we're<00:00:01.709> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.860> take<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:03.110> transformer<00:00:04.110> a

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
we're going to take a transformer a

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.380 
we're going to take a transformer a
mystery<00:00:04.500> transformer<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.370> see<00:00:05.430> if<00:00:06.150> we<00:00:06.240> can

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
mystery transformer and see if we can

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.259 
mystery transformer and see if we can
figure<00:00:06.629> out<00:00:06.779> what<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.890> goes<00:00:08.220> with<00:00:08.610> or<00:00:09.030> what

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
figure out what this goes with or what

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.839 
figure out what this goes with or what
we<00:00:09.389> can<00:00:09.570> use<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.990> for<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:11.040> looks<00:00:11.250> like<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.460> pretty

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
we can use it for it looks like a pretty

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.299 
we can use it for it looks like a pretty
hefty<00:00:12.120> transformer<00:00:12.929> probably<00:00:13.500> around<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.920> 50

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
hefty transformer probably around a 50

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.240 
hefty transformer probably around a 50
watt<00:00:15.080> transformer<00:00:16.080> probably<00:00:16.529> for<00:00:16.710> using<00:00:17.039> to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
watt transformer probably for using to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.849 
watt transformer probably for using to
output<00:00:17.730> tubes<00:00:18.230> looks<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:19.380> an<00:00:19.500> output

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
output tubes looks like an output

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.609 
output tubes looks like an output
transformer<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.180> got<00:00:21.410> three<00:00:22.410> wires

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
transformer because it's got three wires

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.800 
transformer because it's got three wires
coming<00:00:22.920> out<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.279> side<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:24.119> four<00:00:24.570> wires

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
coming out of this side of four wires

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.810

coming<00:00:25.080> out<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.470> side<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.369> three<00:00:26.640> wires

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
coming out of this side is probably the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.310 
coming out of this side is probably the
primary<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.300> probably<00:00:30.689> center<00:00:31.080> tab

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
primary and it's probably center tab

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.139 
primary and it's probably center tab
because<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.740> see<00:00:31.920> there's<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> red<00:00:32.460> wire<00:00:32.700> here

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
because we see there's a red wire here

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.330 
because we see there's a red wire here
and<00:00:33.300> usually<00:00:35.000> red<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.780> center<00:00:37.079> tab<00:00:37.350> Brown

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and usually red is the center tab Brown

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.670 
and usually red is the center tab Brown
is<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.940> end<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> blue<00:00:39.989> as<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.170> other<00:00:40.469> but

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
is one end and blue as the other but

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.860 
is one end and blue as the other but
let's<00:00:40.860> check<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:41.879> if<00:00:42.090> that's<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
let's check this to see if that's the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.540 
let's check this to see if that's the
case<00:00:43.730> I'm<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> connect<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.539> red<00:00:46.550> meter

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
case I'm going to connect the red meter

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.200 
case I'm going to connect the red meter
lead<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.690> blue<00:00:49.280> lead<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.489> transformer

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
lead to the blue lead of the transformer

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.200 
lead to the blue lead of the transformer
because<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.480> think<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.840> might<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.050> an<00:00:52.260> end<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
because I think that might be an end and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.779 
because I think that might be an end and
the<00:00:54.210> black<00:00:54.510> leader<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.110> meter<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the black leader the meter is going to

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.889 
the black leader the meter is going to
the<00:00:57.050> brown<00:00:58.050> lead<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.940> look<00:01:00.420> at<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the brown lead and we look at that and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.570 
the brown lead and we look at that and
see<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.289> that's<00:01:01.500> about<00:01:01.890> 80<00:01:02.449> ohms<00:01:03.949> now<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
see that that's about 80 ohms now if the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.240 
see that that's about 80 ohms now if the
red<00:01:05.880> lead<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> center<00:01:06.869> tap<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.439> should<00:01:08.130> be

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
red lead is the center tap I should be

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.359 
red lead is the center tap I should be
able<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.640> connect<00:01:09.890> disconnect<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.010> from<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
able to connect disconnect this from the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.950 
able to connect disconnect this from the
end<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.909> put<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.360> center<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> should

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
end and put it to the center it should

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.640 
end and put it to the center it should
read<00:01:13.110> about<00:01:13.290> half<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:15.200> which<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.409> does

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
read about half of that which it does

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.160 
read about half of that which it does
we're<00:01:17.070> getting<00:01:17.400> about<00:01:17.729> 40<00:01:18.710> ohms<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:21.600> would

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
we're getting about 40 ohms so I would

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.730 
we're getting about 40 ohms so I would
say<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.799> red<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.610> center<00:01:24.090> tap<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
say that the red is the center tap and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.140 
say that the red is the center tap and
the<00:01:25.740> blue<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.360> brown<00:01:27.780> would<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> ends

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
the blue and the brown would be the ends

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.640 
the blue and the brown would be the ends
this<00:01:30.150> has<00:01:30.329> got<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.930> primary<00:01:31.200> because

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
this has got to be the primary because

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.740 
this has got to be the primary because
the<00:01:31.920> secondary<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.670> an<00:01:32.790> output<00:01:33.090> transformer

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the secondary of an output transformer

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.399 
the secondary of an output transformer
is<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.200> ultra<00:01:34.710> low<00:01:35.180> DC<00:01:36.180> resistance

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
is going to have ultra low DC resistance

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.980 
is going to have ultra low DC resistance
probably<00:01:37.409> less<00:01:37.619> than<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.979> gnome<00:01:38.329> so<00:01:39.329> let's

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
probably less than a gnome so let's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.840 
probably less than a gnome so let's
assume<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> primary<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
assume that this is the primary and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.510 
assume that this is the primary and
let's<00:01:42.600> take<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.110> other<00:01:43.320> leads<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.399> we

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
let's take the other leads and see if we

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.450 
let's take the other leads and see if we
can<00:01:44.700> figure<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.329> these<00:01:45.540> are<00:01:45.780> for

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
can figure out what these are for

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.399 
can figure out what these are for
there's<00:01:47.460> four<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.869> don't<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.229> they

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
there's four and we don't know what they

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.929 
there's four and we don't know what they
are<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.799> we'll<00:01:49.979> start<00:01:50.220> off<00:01:50.340> by<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.549> putting

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
are but we'll start off by just putting

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.990 
are but we'll start off by just putting
one<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> meter<00:01:52.200> leads<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
one of the meter leads on one of the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.420 
one of the meter leads on one of the
wires<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.899> we're<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.350> check<00:01:55.740> DCR

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
wires and we're going to just check DCR

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.359 
wires and we're going to just check DCR
DC<00:01:56.939> resistance<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.600> go<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.159> other

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
DC resistance and go to all the other

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.550 
DC resistance and go to all the other
leads<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.680> get<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> reading<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:03.420> ones<00:02:03.689> that

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
leads and get a reading the ones that

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.340 
leads and get a reading the ones that
have<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.860> largest<00:02:05.759> reading<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.840> four<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
have the largest reading of the four and

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
green point 33 so the largest DC

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.740 
green point 33 so the largest DC

it<00:03:02.340> again<00:03:03.860> okay<00:03:04.860> point<00:03:05.810> 90<00:03:08.060> now<00:03:09.060> we<00:03:09.120> know<00:03:09.540> that

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
it again okay point 90 now we know that

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.040 
it again okay point 90 now we know that
these<00:03:09.959> are<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.290> ends<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.519> secondary<00:03:12.150> the

these are the ends of the secondary the
orange<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.590> black<00:03:13.860> now<00:03:14.519> how<00:03:14.670> do<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:14.940> know<00:03:15.120> which

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
orange to black now how do we know which

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.930 
orange to black now how do we know which
one<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.630> these<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.170> going<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.069> be<00:03:17.190> ground<00:03:17.579> and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
one of these is going to be ground and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.220 
one of these is going to be ground and
which<00:03:18.120> one's<00:03:18.360> going<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.630> be<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.989> higher

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
which one's going to be the higher

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.319 
which one's going to be the higher
impedance<00:03:19.769> setting<00:03:20.459> by<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.880> way<00:03:21.000> this<00:03:21.120> one's

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
impedance setting by the way this one's

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.890 
impedance setting by the way this one's
probably<00:03:21.480> going<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.840> be<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.959> 16-8<00:03:22.829> om<00:03:23.130> four<00:03:23.579> ohm

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
probably going to be a 16-8 om four ohm

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.880 
probably going to be a 16-8 om four ohm
transformer<00:03:24.900> because<00:03:25.140> since<00:03:25.350> it's<00:03:25.530> got<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
transformer because since it's got the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.090 
transformer because since it's got the
four<00:03:26.130> leads<00:03:27.049> one's<00:03:28.049> going<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.290> be<00:03:28.440> ground<00:03:28.799> and

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
four leads one's going to be ground and

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.289 
four leads one's going to be ground and
then<00:03:29.190> you'll<00:03:29.340> have<00:03:29.489> three<00:03:29.760> others<00:03:30.060> it's

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
then you'll have three others it's

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.870 
then you'll have three others it's
probably<00:03:30.660> 16<00:03:31.320> 8<00:03:32.130> 4<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:33.090> could<00:03:33.269> possibly<00:03:33.450> be<00:03:34.880> 842

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
probably 16 8 4 it could possibly be 842

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.880 
probably 16 8 4 it could possibly be 842
but<00:03:36.660> we<00:03:36.810> know<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.170> these<00:03:37.350> two<00:03:37.380> right<00:03:37.860> here

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
but we know that these two right here

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.840 
but we know that these two right here
are<00:03:38.400> going<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.790> be<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:40.019> largest<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:41.100> whatever

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
are going to be the largest of whatever

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.000 
are going to be the largest of whatever
it<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.859> now<00:03:44.480> on<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.570> transformer<00:03:46.380> when<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.769> go

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
it is now on a transformer when you go

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.690 
it is now on a transformer when you go
from<00:03:47.370> 16<00:03:48.329> ohms<00:03:48.570> 28<00:03:49.019> or<00:03:49.350> from<00:03:49.650> eight<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:50.130> four<00:03:50.160> or

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
from 16 ohms 28 or from eight to four or

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.569 
from 16 ohms 28 or from eight to four or
from<00:03:51.030> four<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.720> two<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:52.799> change<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.310> number

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
from four to two you change the number

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.900 
from four to two you change the number
of<00:03:53.609> turns<00:03:54.000> by<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.900> square<00:03:55.200> root<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.590> two<00:03:55.910> so

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
of turns by the square root of two so

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.729 
of turns by the square root of two so
this<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.299> also<00:03:57.480> going<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.840> change<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.380> DC

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
this is also going to change the DC

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.009 
this is also going to change the DC
resistance<00:03:58.920> by<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.609> square<00:03:59.910> root<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.209> two<00:04:00.420> so

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
resistance by the square root of two so

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.680 
resistance by the square root of two so
let's<00:04:01.049> take<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.709> point<00:04:02.010> nine<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.760> divide<00:04:03.660> it

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
let's take the point nine and divide it

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.560 
let's take the point nine and divide it
by<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.440> square<00:04:04.769> root<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:05.130> two<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:06.180> see<00:04:06.420> what

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
by the square root of two to see what

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.120 
by the square root of two to see what
the<00:04:06.720> next<00:04:06.900> impedance<00:04:07.500> setting<00:04:07.890> would<00:04:08.010> be

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
the next impedance setting would be

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.460 
the next impedance setting would be
point<00:04:11.130> nine<00:04:12.320> divided<00:04:13.320> by<00:04:13.590> 1<00:04:14.130> point<00:04:15.030> 4<00:04:15.630> 14

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
point nine divided by 1 point 4 14

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:25.149 
point nine divided by 1 point 4 14
equals<00:04:17.400> 0<00:04:18.049> point<00:04:19.049> 6<00:04:20.329> 36<00:04:21.329> ohms<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.940> let's<00:04:24.330> see<00:04:24.720> if

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
equals 0 point 6 36 ohms so let's see if

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.880 
equals 0 point 6 36 ohms so let's see if
we<00:04:26.159> can<00:04:26.340> find<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.849> point

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
we can find a point

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.610 
we can find a point
636<00:04:29.090> by<00:04:30.090> moving<00:04:30.390> one<00:04:30.750> of<00:04:31.200> these<00:04:31.350> will<00:04:31.590> just

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
636 by moving one of these will just

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.990 
636 by moving one of these will just
going<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:31.980> go<00:04:32.100> ahead<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.340> leave<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.790> black

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
going to go ahead and leave the black

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.340 
going to go ahead and leave the black
one<00:04:33.210> attached<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:33.810> assume<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.200> that's

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
one attached and assume that that's

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.940 
one attached and assume that that's
ground<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.160> let's<00:04:35.700> see<00:04:35.880> if<00:04:35.910> either<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.510> these

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.660 
ground and let's see if either of these
give<00:04:37.950> us<00:04:38.160> our<00:04:38.400> point<00:04:38.820> 63<00:04:40.100> we<00:04:41.100> see<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.370> the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
give us our point 63 we see that the

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.570 
give us our point 63 we see that the
green<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:43.130> point<00:04:44.130> for<00:04:45.890> next<00:04:46.890> I'll<00:04:47.010> check<00:04:47.340> the

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
green is point for next I'll check the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.320 
green is point for next I'll check the
yellow<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:51.350> we<00:04:52.350> see<00:04:52.590> we<00:04:52.770> have<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:52.980> point<00:04:53.400> 57<00:04:54.150> so

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
yellow and we see we have a point 57 so

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.850 
yellow and we see we have a point 57 so
neither<00:04:54.480> one<00:04:54.600> of<00:04:54.750> those<00:04:54.990> were<00:04:55.260> close<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.740> the

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
neither one of those were close to the

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.140 
neither one of those were close to the
point<00:04:56.100> 64<00:04:56.700> let's<00:04:57.570> go<00:04:57.780> back<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.850> assume<00:04:59.850> that

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
point 64 let's go back and assume that

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.530 
point 64 let's go back and assume that
the<00:05:00.330> orange<00:05:01.020> is<00:05:01.260> ground<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.190> we'll<00:05:03.090> move<00:05:03.270> the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
the orange is ground and we'll move the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:13.360 
the orange is ground and we'll move the
black<00:05:04.700> to<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.820> green<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:09.890> we<00:05:10.890> get<00:05:11.070> a<00:05:11.100> point<00:05:11.840> 68

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
black to the green and we get a point 68

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.690 
black to the green and we get a point 68
that's<00:05:14.370> probably<00:05:14.910> it<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:16.160> then<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.490> the

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
that's probably it and then to the

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:25.300 
that's probably it and then to the
yellow<00:05:20.450> we've<00:05:21.450> got<00:05:21.570> 2.5<00:05:22.070> to<00:05:23.180> so<00:05:24.180> now<00:05:24.420> we<00:05:24.480> know

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
yellow we've got 2.5 to so now we know

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.510 
yellow we've got 2.5 to so now we know
that<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.490> oranges<00:05:27.060> Brown<00:05:27.420> is<00:05:27.750> ground<00:05:28.520> the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
that the oranges Brown is ground the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.820 
that the oranges Brown is ground the
black<00:05:29.850> is<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.300> highest<00:05:30.750> impedance<00:05:31.410> setting

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
black is the highest impedance setting

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.210 
black is the highest impedance setting
the<00:05:32.760> green<00:05:33.060> is<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.330> next<00:05:33.840> one<00:05:34.020> and<00:05:34.220> probably

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
the green is the next one and probably

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.650 
the green is the next one and probably
the<00:05:35.460> yellow<00:05:35.670> is<00:05:35.850> the<00:05:35.910> next<00:05:36.240> one<00:05:36.360> after<00:05:36.510> that

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
the yellow is the next one after that

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.530 
the yellow is the next one after that
and<00:05:36.810> if<00:05:36.990> we<00:05:37.080> take<00:05:37.260> the<00:05:37.440> point<00:05:37.710> 6<00:05:38.040> 3<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.670> divide

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
and if we take the point 6 3 and divide

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.210 
and if we take the point 6 3 and divide
that<00:05:39.780> by<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:40.770> square<00:05:40.920> root<00:05:41.220> of<00:05:41.490> two<00:05:42.980> we<00:05:43.980> see

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
that by the square root of two we see

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.160 
that by the square root of two we see
that<00:05:44.430> the<00:05:44.580> next<00:05:44.880> one<00:05:45.060> down<00:05:45.270> should<00:05:45.660> be<00:05:45.810> about

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
that the next one down should be about

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.940 
that the next one down should be about
point<00:05:46.740> four<00:05:46.860> five<00:05:47.430> in<00:05:47.820> DC<00:05:48.450> resistance<00:05:48.950> so

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
point four five in DC resistance so

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:57.070 
point four five in DC resistance so
let's<00:05:50.160> see

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.529 

well<00:05:57.590> it's<00:05:57.710> a<00:05:57.770> point<00:05:58.039> 51<00:05:58.639> that's<00:05:58.909> that's<00:05:59.270> close

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
well it's a point 51 that's that's close

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.929 
well it's a point 51 that's that's close
enough<00:05:59.569> that's<00:06:00.050> probably<00:06:00.590> it<00:06:00.919> you're<00:06:01.729> going

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:01.939 
enough that's probably it you're going

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:08.800 
enough that's probably it you're going
to<00:06:02.000> have<00:06:04.840> orange<00:06:05.840> as<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:06.500> ground<00:06:07.539> the<00:06:08.539> black

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
to have orange as the ground the black

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.270 
to have orange as the ground the black
is<00:06:08.840> going<00:06:09.110> to<00:06:09.199> be<00:06:09.289> the<00:06:09.439> highest<00:06:09.770> impedance

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
is going to be the highest impedance

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.969 
is going to be the highest impedance
setting<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:11.810> green<00:06:12.080> is<00:06:12.229> going<00:06:12.349> to<00:06:12.409> be<00:06:12.530> half<00:06:12.800> of

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
setting the green is going to be half of

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.399 
setting the green is going to be half of
that<00:06:13.129> and<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:14.479> yellow<00:06:14.689> is<00:06:14.810> going<00:06:14.990> to<00:06:15.050> be<00:06:15.169> half

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409 
that and the yellow is going to be half

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.369 
that and the yellow is going to be half
of<00:06:15.560> that<00:06:15.710> if<00:06:15.949> this<00:06:16.370> is<00:06:16.580> a<00:06:16.610> 16<00:06:17.210> ohm<00:06:17.419> transformer

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:18.379 
of that if this is a 16 ohm transformer

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:22.510 
of that if this is a 16 ohm transformer
this<00:06:19.129> would<00:06:19.280> be<00:06:19.310> 16<00:06:20.199> this<00:06:21.199> would<00:06:21.349> be<00:06:21.379> 8<00:06:21.710> this

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
this would be 16 this would be 8 this

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.820 
this would be 16 this would be 8 this
would<00:06:22.669> be<00:06:22.699> for<00:06:23.169> now<00:06:24.169> in<00:06:24.319> order<00:06:24.469> to<00:06:24.590> double

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
would be for now in order to double

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.610 
would be for now in order to double
check<00:06:25.009> it<00:06:25.400> let's<00:06:26.120> check<00:06:26.419> it<00:06:26.599> with<00:06:27.020> our<00:06:27.229> very

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
check it let's check it with our very

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.439 
check it let's check it with our very
act<00:06:27.889> and<00:06:28.189> we'll<00:06:28.280> put<00:06:28.430> some<00:06:28.610> voltage<00:06:28.969> on<00:06:29.180> it<00:06:29.300> and

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
act and we'll put some voltage on it and

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:35.590 
act and we'll put some voltage on it and
see<00:06:29.659> what<00:06:29.870> we<00:06:30.770> get<00:06:31.509> we'll<00:06:32.509> hook<00:06:32.629> the<00:06:32.810> variac<00:06:33.289> up
