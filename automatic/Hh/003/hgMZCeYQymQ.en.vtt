videos on on this type of chassis I

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.910 
videos on on this type of chassis I
talked<00:00:16.430> about<00:00:16.670> I<00:00:16.850> originally<00:00:17.630> made<00:00:17.750> one<00:00:17.990> with

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
talked about I originally made one with

talked about I originally made one with
it<00:00:19.070> in<00:00:19.220> truck<00:00:19.640> form<00:00:19.939> and<00:00:20.240> then<00:00:20.720> I'm<00:00:20.810> converting

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
it in truck form and then I'm converting

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.740

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
this effort P chassis alone which was

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.420 
this effort P chassis alone which was
worth<00:01:00.230> more<00:01:00.500> than<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.800> rest<00:01:00.980> of<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.130> stuff

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
worth more than the rest of the stuff

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.090 
worth more than the rest of the stuff
for<00:01:02.120> around<00:01:02.390> 125<00:01:03.200> dollars<00:01:03.590> a<00:01:03.620> really<00:01:03.950> good

deal so I figured I'd pick it up and
sort<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:07.640> refurbish<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.180> chassis<00:01:08.390> he's<00:01:08.540> put

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
sort of refurbish the chassis he's put

gonna paint the body metallic red and

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.910 
gonna paint the body metallic red and
you<00:01:35.930> know<00:01:36.020> do<00:01:36.170> all<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.350> detailing<00:01:36.740> and

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
you know do all the detailing and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
you know do all the detailing and
everything<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:39.400> that's<00:01:40.400> this<00:01:40.700> right<00:01:40.880> here

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
everything and that's this right here

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.680 
everything and that's this right here
this<00:01:41.300> is<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.510> 200<00:01:42.020> millimeter<00:01:42.350> body<00:01:42.620> and<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:44.120> t

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
this is a 200 millimeter body and the t

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.050 
this is a 200 millimeter body and the t
AO<00:01:44.840> -<00:01:45.729> typically<00:01:46.729> accepts<00:01:47.150> 190<00:01:48.050> millimeter

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
AO - typically accepts 190 millimeter

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.399 
AO - typically accepts 190 millimeter
bodies<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.659> way<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:50.870> can<00:01:51.080> get<00:01:51.200> around

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
bodies so the way you can get around

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.320 
bodies so the way you can get around
that<00:01:51.620> is<00:01:51.800> by<00:01:52.280> getting<00:01:52.340> rims<00:01:52.790> with<00:01:53.030> an<00:01:53.120> offset

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
that is by getting rims with an offset

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.730 
that is by getting rims with an offset
so<00:01:53.840> these<00:01:54.020> are<00:01:54.260> HPI<00:01:55.690> rims<00:01:56.690> with<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.049> +<00:01:57.409> 6

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
so these are HPI rims with a + 6

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.250 
so these are HPI rims with a + 6
millimeter<00:01:58.190> offset<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.909> they<00:01:59.690> make<00:01:59.870> this

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
millimeter offset and they make this

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.730 
millimeter offset and they make this
particular<00:02:00.799> pattern<00:02:01.070> in<00:02:02.110> bronze<00:02:03.110> which<00:02:03.440> you

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
particular pattern in bronze which you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.850 
particular pattern in bronze which you
see<00:02:03.920> here<00:02:04.190> they<00:02:04.340> also<00:02:04.490> do<00:02:04.760> black<00:02:05.120> and<00:02:05.560> chrome<00:02:06.560> I

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
see here they also do black and chrome I

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.930 
see here they also do black and chrome I
believe<00:02:07.209> so<00:02:08.209> I<00:02:08.240> just<00:02:08.450> got<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.690> bronze<00:02:08.929> ones

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
believe so I just got the bronze ones

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.680

like<00:02:16.160> what<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.730> might<00:02:16.880> see<00:02:17.060> in<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.150> DVL<00:02:17.540> one

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
like what you might see in the DVL one

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.420 
like what you might see in the DVL one
it<00:02:18.770> has<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.459> rear<00:02:20.420> anti-roll<00:02:20.780> bar<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.560> carry<00:02:22.280> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.510 
over the HPI carbon-fiber shock towers
that<00:02:25.850> used<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.150> be<00:02:26.270> on<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.540> other<00:02:26.690> ta<00:02:26.959> o2<00:02:27.230> as<00:02:27.650> a

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
that used to be on the other ta o2 as a

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.060 
that used to be on the other ta o2 as a
throme<00:02:28.790> in<00:02:28.910> here<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.390> have<00:02:30.290> some<00:02:30.320> yeah<00:02:30.650> racing

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
throme in here I have some yeah racing

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.300 
throme in here I have some yeah racing
shocks<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:33.200> when<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:33.500> get<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.830> shocks<00:02:34.130> that

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
shocks that when you get the shocks that

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.050 
shocks that when you get the shocks that
comes<00:02:34.550> with<00:02:35.590> silver<00:02:36.590> springs<00:02:36.920> blue<00:02:37.730> springs

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
comes with silver springs blue springs

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.370 
comes with silver springs blue springs
and<00:02:38.270> gold<00:02:38.450> springs<00:02:38.780> depending<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.260> the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
and gold springs depending on the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.820 
and gold springs depending on the
tension<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.800> want<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.459> silvers<00:02:40.910> are<00:02:41.150> the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
tension you want the silvers are the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.810 
tension you want the silvers are the
softest<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.489> blue<00:02:43.819> springs<00:02:44.150> are<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.569> next

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
softest the blue springs are the next

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.310 
softest the blue springs are the next
salt<00:02:46.820> with<00:02:46.940> stiffest<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.780> gold<00:02:48.080> springs

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
salt with stiffest and the gold springs

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.260 
salt with stiffest and the gold springs
are<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.500> stiffest<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.700> got<00:02:49.820> silver<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.180> the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
are the stiffest so I got silver on the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.699 
are the stiffest so I got silver on the
front<00:02:51.100> blue<00:02:52.100> in<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.280> back<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.880> 40<00:02:53.480> weight

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709

Trinity<00:02:54.709> shock<00:02:54.950> oil<00:02:55.280> front<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:55.730> rear<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:58.220> two

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
Trinity shock oil front and rear the two

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.400 
Trinity shock oil front and rear the two
chassis<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:59.030> got<00:02:59.269> one<00:03:00.110> of<00:03:00.200> them<00:03:00.260> was<00:03:00.380> a

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
chassis that I got one of them was a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
chassis that I got one of them was a
normal<00:03:00.800> tio<00:03:00.950> 2<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.519> other<00:03:01.700> one<00:03:01.940> was<00:03:02.720> there<00:03:03.430> it

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
normal tio 2 the other one was there it

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.570 
normal tio 2 the other one was there it
was<00:03:04.820> like<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:04.970> special<00:03:05.450> edition<00:03:05.870> ta<00:03:06.830> o2<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.459> to

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
was like a special edition ta o2 that to

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.810 
was like a special edition ta o2 that to
me<00:03:07.640> used<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.030> make<00:03:08.180> that<00:03:08.390> had<00:03:08.570> lighter<00:03:09.470> weight

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
me used to make that had lighter weight

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
me used to make that had lighter weight
suspension<00:03:10.820> arms<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.300> they<00:03:11.420> had<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.630> know

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
suspension arms so they had you know

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.199 
suspension arms so they had you know
cutouts<00:03:12.739> in<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:12.950> suspension<00:03:13.370> arms<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.060> the

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
cutouts in the suspension arms and the

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.960 
cutouts in the suspension arms and the
hinge<00:03:14.420> pins<00:03:14.690> used<00:03:14.930> Eclipse<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:16.190> mount<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.580> C

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
hinge pins used Eclipse to mount the C

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.240 
hinge pins used Eclipse to mount the C
hubs<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.330> front<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.739> rear<00:03:18.769> hub

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
hubs in the front and the rear hub

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.509 
hubs in the front and the rear hub
carriers<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.570> this<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.290> really<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:21.799> a<00:03:21.829> hybrid

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
carriers so this is really like a hybrid

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.550 
carriers so this is really like a hybrid
chassis<00:03:23.090> here<00:03:23.440> combination<00:03:24.440> between

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
chassis here combination between

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.680 
chassis here combination between
whatever<00:03:25.459> parts<00:03:25.820> that<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.000> could<00:03:26.209> use<00:03:26.390> from

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
whatever parts that I could use from

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.400 
whatever parts that I could use from
that<00:03:26.930> racing<00:03:27.680> special<00:03:28.040> chassis<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.640> the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
that racing special chassis and the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.830 
that racing special chassis and the
conventional<00:03:30.410> ta<00:03:30.620> o2<00:03:31.360> also<00:03:32.360> got<00:03:32.540> some

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
conventional ta o2 also got some

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.140 
conventional ta o2 also got some
Universal<00:03:33.620> drive<00:03:33.799> shafts<00:03:34.070> in<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.519> front<00:03:34.880> I

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
Universal drive shafts in the front I

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.080 
Universal drive shafts in the front I
think<00:03:35.630> these<00:03:35.720> are<00:03:35.780> GPM<00:03:36.380> drive<00:03:36.590> shafts<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:37.130> I

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
think these are GPM drive shafts and I

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.110 
think these are GPM drive shafts and I
have<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.480> get<00:03:38.690> some<00:03:39.519> universals<00:03:40.519> for<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.880> rear

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
have to get some universals for the rear

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.090 
have to get some universals for the rear
those<00:03:42.110> are<00:03:42.260> actually<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.500> little<00:03:42.620> harder<00:03:43.010> to

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
those are actually a little harder to

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.240 
those are actually a little harder to
find<00:03:43.340> than<00:03:43.579> the<00:03:43.640> front<00:03:43.880> for<00:03:44.120> some<00:03:44.299> reason<00:03:45.250> what

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
find than the front for some reason what

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.640 
find than the front for some reason what
else<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:46.610> do<00:03:46.670> here<00:03:47.470> got<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:50.200> these<00:03:51.200> I

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
else that I do here got the these I

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.009 
else that I do here got the these I
forget<00:03:51.980> who<00:03:52.100> made<00:03:52.250> these<00:03:52.430> maybe<00:03:52.670> GPM<00:03:53.239> front

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
forget who made these maybe GPM front

the other videos I have I talked about I

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.740 
the other videos I have I talked about I
had<00:04:03.079> a<00:04:03.280> set<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:04.400> purple<00:04:04.760> aluminum<00:04:05.239> see<00:04:05.480> hubs

I tried putting them on this thinking
they<00:04:15.980> would<00:04:16.070> work<00:04:16.280> well<00:04:16.489> just<00:04:16.970> as<00:04:17.060> a<00:04:17.090> normal

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
they would work well just as a normal

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.870 
they would work well just as a normal
for<00:04:18.079> a<00:04:18.109> normal<00:04:18.320> sedan<00:04:18.560> application<00:04:19.250> the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
for a normal sedan application the

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.430 
for a normal sedan application the
problem<00:04:20.840> was<00:04:21.049> that<00:04:22.330> if<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:23.419> look<00:04:23.630> here<00:04:24.849> this

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
problem was that if you look here this

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.910 
problem was that if you look here this
front<00:04:26.830> camber<00:04:27.130> link<00:04:28.440> wouldn't<00:04:29.440> fit<00:04:29.710> quite

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
front camber link wouldn't fit quite

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.540 
front camber link wouldn't fit quite
right<00:04:30.120> with<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.420> C<00:04:31.840> hub<00:04:32.020> carry<00:04:32.290> because<00:04:32.650> the

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
right with the C hub carry because the

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.340 
right with the C hub carry because the
hole<00:04:33.820> that<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.240> would<00:04:34.390> have<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.750> mount<00:04:34.960> the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
hole that you would have to mount the

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.540 
hole that you would have to mount the
ball<00:04:36.130> stud<00:04:36.400> on<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.700> then<00:04:36.790> see<00:04:36.970> hub<00:04:37.150> carrier

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
ball stud on and then see hub carrier

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.770 
ball stud on and then see hub carrier
didn't<00:04:39.550> leave<00:04:39.700> enough<00:04:39.940> space<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.300> actually

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
didn't leave enough space to actually

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.070 
didn't leave enough space to actually
screw<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:42.130> ball<00:04:42.700> stud<00:04:42.970> in<00:04:43.330> so<00:04:44.050> I

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
screw the the the ball stud in so I

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.630 
screw the the the ball stud in so I
would<00:04:44.590> actually<00:04:44.770> have<00:04:45.010> had<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.310> mount<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
would actually have had to mount the

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.000 
would actually have had to mount the
ball<00:04:45.820> set<00:04:46.030> on<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.270> other<00:04:46.390> side<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.500> if<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:47.740> did

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
ball set on the other side and if I did

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.780 
ball set on the other side and if I did
that<00:04:48.040> I'd<00:04:48.910> have<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.210> either<00:04:49.480> push<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:50.790> camber

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
that I'd have to either push this camber

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.390 
that I'd have to either push this camber
link<00:04:51.940> way<00:04:52.270> out<00:04:52.510> this<00:04:52.690> way<00:04:52.930> or<00:04:53.260> if<00:04:53.950> I<00:04:54.040> flipped<00:04:54.310> it

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
link way out this way or if I flipped it

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.040 
link way out this way or if I flipped it
around<00:04:54.460> and<00:04:54.820> have<00:04:54.910> to<00:04:55.030> pull<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.330> way<00:04:55.600> back<00:04:55.810> this

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
around and have to pull it way back this

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.900 
around and have to pull it way back this
way<00:04:56.260> and<00:04:56.410> either<00:04:56.560> way<00:04:56.800> you<00:04:57.550> would<00:04:57.670> get<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:57.790> lot

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
way and either way you would get a lot

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.730 
way and either way you would get a lot
of<00:04:58.060> bind<00:04:58.360> in<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.660> suspension<00:04:59.170> travel<00:04:59.380> so<00:04:59.710> I

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
of bind in the suspension travel so I

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.500 
of bind in the suspension travel so I
figured<00:05:00.130> you<00:05:00.280> know<00:05:00.370> screw<00:05:00.670> it<00:05:00.730> just<00:05:01.030> put<00:05:01.390> those

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
figured you know screw it just put those

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.950 
figured you know screw it just put those
things<00:05:01.570> away<00:05:01.870> use<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:03.010> stock<00:05:03.280> C<00:05:04.210> hubs<00:05:04.420> and<00:05:04.720> and

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
things away use the stock C hubs and and

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.180 
things away use the stock C hubs and and
it'll<00:05:05.290> work<00:05:05.490> just<00:05:06.490> fine<00:05:06.640> no<00:05:07.030> problem<00:05:08.190> let's

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
it'll work just fine no problem let's

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.220 
it'll work just fine no problem let's

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
ball bearings in there yes I put some

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
little smoother the only thing is this

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.840 
little smoother the only thing is this

post<00:05:37.150> on<00:05:37.360> this<00:05:37.540> side<00:05:37.810> so<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:38.620> may<00:05:39.070> have<00:05:39.100> to<00:05:39.190> do

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
post on this side so I may have to do

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.270 
post on this side so I may have to do
some<00:05:39.790> funky<00:05:40.240> business<00:05:40.540> here<00:05:40.960> to<00:05:41.169> close<00:05:42.070> this

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
some funky business here to close this

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.390 
some funky business here to close this
off<00:05:42.520> and<00:05:43.000> hold<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.270> battery<00:05:43.450> pack<00:05:43.780> in<00:05:44.400> stuff

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
off and hold the battery pack in stuff

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.340 
off and hold the battery pack in stuff
to<00:05:45.550> mount<00:05:45.730> them<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:46.240> electronics<00:05:47.200> and

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
to mount them the electronics and

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.030 
to mount them the electronics and
everything<00:05:48.060> but<00:05:49.060> I<00:05:49.120> think<00:05:49.180> that's<00:05:50.040> pretty

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
everything but I think that's pretty

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.950 
everything but I think that's pretty
much<00:05:51.160> it<00:05:51.340> I<00:05:51.610> had<00:05:51.940> to<00:05:52.030> do<00:05:52.180> some<00:05:52.419> Frankenstein

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
much it I had to do some Frankenstein

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.620 
much it I had to do some Frankenstein
stuff<00:05:53.320> to<00:05:53.560> mount<00:05:54.400> the<00:05:54.520> shocks<00:05:56.160> because<00:05:57.160> the

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
stuff to mount the shocks because the

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.150 
stuff to mount the shocks because the
yeah<00:05:58.630> racing<00:05:58.990> shocks<00:05:59.230> are<00:05:59.500> actually<00:05:59.919> pretty

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
yeah racing shocks are actually pretty

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.090 
yeah racing shocks are actually pretty
nice<00:06:00.310> and<00:06:00.730> they<00:06:01.180> come<00:06:01.360> with<00:06:01.510> different<00:06:02.100> shock

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
nice and they come with different shock

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.920 
nice and they come with different shock
mount<00:06:03.480> pieces<00:06:04.480> but<00:06:04.890> I<00:06:05.890> had<00:06:06.820> to<00:06:06.970> use<00:06:07.090> screws<00:06:07.780> of

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
mount pieces but I had to use screws of

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.180 
mount pieces but I had to use screws of
a<00:06:07.990> different<00:06:08.290> length<00:06:08.470> to<00:06:08.680> get<00:06:08.800> everything<00:06:08.980> to

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
a different length to get everything to

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.450 
a different length to get everything to
fit

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
fit

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.230 
fit
I<00:06:10.150> got<00:06:10.810> Phillips<00:06:11.710> screws<00:06:12.040> and<00:06:12.370> and<00:06:12.700> hex<00:06:13.060> head

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
I got Phillips screws and and hex head

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.150 
I got Phillips screws and and hex head
screws<00:06:13.600> all<00:06:13.870> over<00:06:14.110> this<00:06:14.260> thing<00:06:14.500> so<00:06:14.740> it's<00:06:14.890> by<00:06:15.130> no

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
screws all over this thing so it's by no

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.360 
screws all over this thing so it's by no
means<00:06:15.340> a<00:06:15.820> uniform<00:06:16.480> build<00:06:16.919> but<00:06:17.919> I<00:06:17.950> just<00:06:18.190> wanted

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
means a uniform build but I just wanted

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.580 
means a uniform build but I just wanted
to<00:06:18.460> make<00:06:18.580> something<00:06:18.820> that<00:06:19.090> I<00:06:19.120> felt<00:06:19.390> was<00:06:19.690> more

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
to make something that I felt was more

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.270 
to make something that I felt was more

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
the d bo one is actually a little bit

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.670 
the d bo one is actually a little bit
fragile<00:06:26.200> in<00:06:26.560> some<00:06:27.120> places<00:06:28.120> and<00:06:28.570> the<00:06:28.810> TA<00:06:28.990> o2<00:06:29.200> I

and I'm very familiar working on this

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.450 
and I'm very familiar working on this
thing<00:06:38.050> it's<00:06:38.200> actually<00:06:38.350> very<00:06:38.650> easy<00:06:38.860> to<00:06:39.010> work<00:06:39.130> on

so very nice jassie to get as a first

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.120 
so very nice jassie to get as a first
chassis<00:06:44.890> for<00:06:45.930> somebody<00:06:46.930> who<00:06:47.170> is<00:06:47.440> new<00:06:47.860> to<00:06:48.100> our

chassis for somebody who is new to our

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.210 
chassis for somebody who is new to our
see<00:06:48.690> it<00:06:49.690> still<00:06:49.960> has<00:06:50.140> some<00:06:50.170> some<00:06:50.890> good<00:06:51.040> tune

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
see it still has some some good tune

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.430 
see it still has some some good tune
ability<00:06:51.640> to<00:06:51.790> it<00:06:51.940> you<00:06:52.090> can<00:06:52.210> change<00:06:52.420> shock<00:06:53.200> tower

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
ability to it you can change shock tower

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.910 
ability to it you can change shock tower
positions<00:06:53.620> you<00:06:54.580> can<00:06:54.730> change<00:06:55.120> camber<00:06:55.990> you<00:06:56.800> can

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
positions you can change camber you can

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.150 
positions you can change camber you can
change<00:06:57.130> tone<00:06:57.370> of<00:06:57.580> course<00:06:57.790> in<00:06:58.390> the<00:06:58.480> front<00:06:59.160> so

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160

the the baldest that came with it at the
time<00:07:14.230> are<00:07:14.950> actually<00:07:15.340> kind<00:07:15.520> of<00:07:15.550> tight<00:07:15.880> they

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
time are actually kind of tight they

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.870 
time are actually kind of tight they
don't<00:07:16.270> have<00:07:16.600> the<00:07:17.410> nice<00:07:17.650> smooth<00:07:18.190> feel<00:07:18.580> that<00:07:18.790> you

don't have the nice smooth feel that you
would<00:07:19.000> expect<00:07:19.420> to<00:07:19.540> get<00:07:19.780> in<00:07:19.960> a<00:07:20.200> modern<00:07:20.590> like<00:07:21.210> say

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210 
would expect to get in a modern like say

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.180 
would expect to get in a modern like say
an<00:07:22.510> associated<00:07:23.080> RC<00:07:23.320> 10<00:07:23.530> for<00:07:23.710> example<00:07:24.070> those

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
an associated RC 10 for example those

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.160 
an associated RC 10 for example those
are<00:07:24.220> nice<00:07:24.430> smooth<00:07:24.790> ball<00:07:24.970> diffs<00:07:25.240> these<00:07:25.810> are<00:07:25.990> not

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.170 
are nice smooth ball diffs these are not

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:31.680 
are nice smooth ball diffs these are not
that<00:07:26.470> smooth<00:07:28.590> so<00:07:30.030> whatever<00:07:31.030> good<00:07:31.390> beginner

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:31.690

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.620 
chassis figured I'd at least show you
the<00:07:34.330> status<00:07:34.990> of<00:07:35.230> it<00:07:35.350> as<00:07:35.500> it<00:07:35.830> presently<00:07:36.630> exists

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:37.630 
the status of it as it presently exists

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.270 
the status of it as it presently exists
when<00:07:37.780> I<00:07:37.810> complete<00:07:38.350> it<00:07:38.380> and<00:07:38.680> certainly<00:07:39.040> want<00:07:39.220> to
