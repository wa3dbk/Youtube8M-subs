hey<00:00:01.230> everybody<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:01.979> my<00:00:02.340> padded<00:00:03.330> tilt

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hey everybody this is my padded tilt

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.920 
hey everybody this is my padded tilt
camera<00:00:04.520> contraption<00:00:05.520> that<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.670> built<00:00:05.970> so<00:00:06.779> that

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
camera contraption that I built so that

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.870 
camera contraption that I built so that
I<00:00:07.020> could<00:00:07.170> film<00:00:07.379> events<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:08.130> out<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.400> necessity

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
I could film events is out of necessity

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.150 
I could film events is out of necessity
and<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.809> spent<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> little<00:00:10.650> time<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.010> make<00:00:11.130> it

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
and so I spent a little time to make it

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.919 
and so I spent a little time to make it
right<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.849> won't<00:00:12.240> look<00:00:12.330> like<00:00:12.480> an<00:00:12.570> idiot<00:00:12.690> out

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
right and I won't look like an idiot out

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.259 
right and I won't look like an idiot out
there<00:00:12.990> when<00:00:13.429> you<00:00:14.429> know<00:00:14.549> having<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.059> breakdown

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
there when you know having a breakdown

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.640 
there when you know having a breakdown
so<00:00:15.630> what<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.890> take<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.100> standard<00:00:17.609> GoPro

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
so what I do is take a standard GoPro

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.140 
so what I do is take a standard GoPro
casing<00:00:19.650> I'll<00:00:20.340> use<00:00:20.580> an<00:00:20.850> existing<00:00:21.180> offset<00:00:22.080> clip

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
casing I'll use an existing offset clip

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.060 
casing I'll use an existing offset clip
see<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.300> goes<00:00:24.420> back<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.109> that's<00:00:25.830> so

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
see how it goes back like this that's so

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.339 
see how it goes back like this that's so
I<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.250> all<00:00:26.640> get<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> good<00:00:27.300> connection<00:00:27.570> from<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
I can all get a good connection from the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.400 
I can all get a good connection from the
servo<00:00:28.769> with<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> linkage<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.519> allow<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.050> this

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
servo with a linkage to allow and I this

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.819 
servo with a linkage to allow and I this
extension<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.399> put<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:32.969> here<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> flexible

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
extension I put on here as a flexible

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.190 
extension I put on here as a flexible
plastic<00:00:34.829> extension<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.719> linkage

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
plastic extension and it's this linkage

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.380 
plastic extension and it's this linkage
and<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.530> angle<00:00:38.010> allows<00:00:38.370> greater<00:00:38.790> movement<00:00:39.239> up

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and the angle allows greater movement up

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.060 
and the angle allows greater movement up
and<00:00:39.510> down<00:00:39.690> by<00:00:40.020> using<00:00:40.350> only<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.620> quarter-inch

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and down by using only a quarter-inch

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.500 
and down by using only a quarter-inch
servo<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:43.469> ice<00:00:43.980> drill<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.640> threaded<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
servo and ice drill it and threaded it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.950 
servo and ice drill it and threaded it
into<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> bottom<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:48.680> GoPro<00:00:49.789> clip<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.239> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
into the bottom of this GoPro clip and I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.639 
into the bottom of this GoPro clip and I
mounted<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.680> clip<00:00:53.010> onto<00:00:53.309> another<00:00:53.850> servo

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
mounted this clip onto another servo

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.020 
mounted this clip onto another servo
that<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> mounted<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.489> piece<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that I mounted into a piece of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.020 
that I mounted into a piece of
inch-and-a-half<00:00:57.390> PVC<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.440> allows<00:00:59.399> me<00:00:59.670> to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
inch-and-a-half PVC that allows me to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.819 
inch-and-a-half PVC that allows me to
slip<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.750> right<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.199> another<00:01:01.350> inch<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
slip it right on to another inch and a

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.939 
slip it right on to another inch and a
half<00:01:01.859> pipe<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:03.359> make<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> long<00:01:03.780> pole<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.439> take

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
half pipe to make a long pole and take

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
half pipe to make a long pole and take
some<00:01:05.129> good<00:01:05.280> aerial<00:01:05.670> views<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.210> took<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.600> casing

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
some good aerial views I took the casing

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.429 
some good aerial views I took the casing
that<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.860> got<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> video<00:01:08.850> monitor<00:01:09.409> that<00:01:10.409> I

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that I got with the video monitor that I

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.010 
that I got with the video monitor that I
wasn't<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> use<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.430> scuba

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
wasn't going to use it's a scuba

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.539 
wasn't going to use it's a scuba
underwater<00:01:13.020> casing<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.100> didn't<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.430> any

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
underwater casing so it didn't have any

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.080 
underwater casing so it didn't have any
sound<00:01:15.740> didn't<00:01:16.740> allow<00:01:16.890> any<00:01:17.100> sound<00:01:17.340> through<00:01:17.909> it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
sound didn't allow any sound through it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.179 
sound didn't allow any sound through it
it<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.270> solid<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.810> drilled<00:01:19.110> holes<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.740> or

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
it was solid I drilled holes in it or

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.469 
it was solid I drilled holes in it or
the<00:01:20.880> mic<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> camera<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.970> let's<00:01:24.299> see

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the mic was for the camera and let's see

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.679 
the mic was for the camera and let's see
what<00:01:24.689> else<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.020> think<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.670> oh<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:27.240> used<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
what else I can think of oh we used the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.499 
what else I can think of oh we used the
standard<00:01:28.259> linkage<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.210> loosen<00:01:30.210> up<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
standard linkage you have to loosen up a

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.819 
standard linkage you have to loosen up a
bit<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.990> acts<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.380> hinge

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
bit so it acts like a hinge

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.830 
bit so it acts like a hinge
I<00:01:31.979> also<00:01:32.250> greased<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.119> connection<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.780> is

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
I also greased this connection this is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.710 
I also greased this connection this is
linkage<00:01:34.409> from<00:01:34.740> an<00:01:34.890> airplane<00:01:35.270> RC<00:01:36.270> airplane

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
linkage from an airplane RC airplane

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.530 
linkage from an airplane RC airplane
that<00:01:37.140> also<00:01:37.350> swivels<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.909> allows<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.509> to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that also swivels so this allows it to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.210 
that also swivels so this allows it to
go<00:01:39.720> way<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.350> way<00:01:40.530> down<00:01:40.770> without<00:01:40.890> any

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
go way up and way down without any

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.520 
go way up and way down without any
linkage<00:01:41.579> binding<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.720> demonstrate<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.409> for

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
linkage binding that demonstrate it for

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.639 
linkage binding that demonstrate it for
you<00:01:45.200> there<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.229> go

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you there you go

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.069 
you there you go
left<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.070> right<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.899> I'll<00:01:49.049> show

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
left and right up and down and I'll show

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.200 
left and right up and down and I'll show
you<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.500> side<00:01:49.710> linkage<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.460> action<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.149> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
you this side linkage in action so you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.840 
you this side linkage in action so you
can<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.479> what<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> mean<00:01:51.840> by<00:01:52.020> binding<00:01:52.640> see<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
can see what I mean by binding see that

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.520 
can see what I mean by binding see that
and<00:01:54.119> twist<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.990> turns<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.470> does<00:01:55.619> everything

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
and twist it turns it does everything

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.560 
and twist it turns it does everything
that's<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.829> regular<00:01:59.399> hard<00:01:59.850> linkage<00:02:00.180> wouldn't

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that's a regular hard linkage wouldn't

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.630 
that's a regular hard linkage wouldn't
do<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:01.409> wouldn't<00:02:01.590> allow<00:02:01.890> us<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.159> do<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.430> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
do it wouldn't allow us to do this and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.410 
do it wouldn't allow us to do this and
would<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.850> stuck<00:02:03.920> this<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> hole<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.640> cut

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
would get stuck this is the hole I cut

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.320 
would get stuck this is the hole I cut
into<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> back<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.700> monitor<00:02:08.700> casing

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
into the back of the monitor casing

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.540 
into the back of the monitor casing
extension<00:02:09.899> was<00:02:10.530> very<00:02:10.739> tight<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.280> slipped

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
extension was very tight so it slipped

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.660 
extension was very tight so it slipped
in<00:02:11.700> there<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> used<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.450> piece

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
in there and I used a piece

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.100 
in there and I used a piece
rubber<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.240> make<00:02:13.390> up<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.630> difference<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:14.080> the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
rubber to make up the difference on the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.230 
rubber to make up the difference on the
back<00:02:14.440> foam<00:02:14.800> rubber<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.310> push<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.060> camera

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
back foam rubber to push the camera

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.540 
back foam rubber to push the camera
against<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.900> front<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.260> casing<00:02:17.680> keep<00:02:18.459> it

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
against the front of the casing keep it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.080 
against the front of the casing keep it
a<00:02:18.640> nice<00:02:18.790> tight<00:02:19.030> fit<00:02:19.300> there<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:21.310> go<00:02:21.459> this<00:02:22.030> is

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
a nice tight fit there you go this is

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.280 
a nice tight fit there you go this is
also<00:02:22.420> mounted<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.410> plant<00:02:24.340> box<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.970> plant

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.020

pot if you will and it's it's a very
flimsy<00:02:31.900> thing<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.709> is<00:02:32.920> just<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.310> could

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
flimsy thing so this is just so I could

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.300 
flimsy thing so this is just so I could
work<00:02:34.810> on<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.080> pick<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.560> up<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.770> down<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:35.950> made

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
work on it pick it up and down I made

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.770 
work on it pick it up and down I made
Pakistan<00:02:36.940> here<00:02:37.209> for<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.600> servo<00:02:37.840> or<00:02:38.200> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
Pakistan here for the servo or the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.990 
Pakistan here for the servo or the
receiver<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.260> battery<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:42.640> way<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.819> can

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
receiver and the battery that way I can

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.750 
receiver and the battery that way I can
work<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.330> very<00:02:43.569> good<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:45.220> we'll<00:02:45.580> do<00:02:45.730> a

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
work on it very good and we'll do a

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.949 
work on it very good and we'll do a
little<00:02:45.970> bit<00:02:46.090> more<00:02:46.300> stuff<00:02:46.900> for<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.290> here<00:02:48.930> do<00:02:49.930> a

little bit more stuff for you here do a

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.380 
little bit more stuff for you here do a
lot<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.230> stuff<00:02:50.440> I'm<00:02:50.560> using<00:02:50.620> an<00:02:50.950> RC<00:02:51.340> remote<00:02:51.640> and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
lot of stuff I'm using an RC remote and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.509 
lot of stuff I'm using an RC remote and
I'm<00:02:52.569> using<00:02:52.750> two<00:02:53.140> channels<00:02:53.170> on<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.709> right<00:02:53.890> that

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
I'm using two channels on the right that

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.160 
I'm using two channels on the right that
way<00:02:54.640> I<00:02:54.670> could<00:02:54.940> use<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.360> other<00:02:55.660> two<00:02:55.900> channels

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
way I could use the other two channels

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.559 
way I could use the other two channels
for<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.769> blimp<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.250> I'm<00:02:57.700> gonna<00:02:58.180> mount<00:02:58.390> this

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
for the blimp that I'm gonna mount this

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.229 
for the blimp that I'm gonna mount this
upside<00:02:58.989> down<00:02:59.019> on<00:02:59.380> you

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
upside down on you

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.630 
upside down on you
eventually<00:03:01.239> I'll<00:03:01.510> put<00:03:01.690> it<00:03:01.780> on<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.900> helicopter

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
eventually I'll put it on a helicopter

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.180 
eventually I'll put it on a helicopter
so<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:03.670> gotta<00:03:03.970> find<00:03:04.209> one<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.709> think<00:03:05.709> carry<00:03:06.069> this

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
so I gotta find one I think carry this

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.660 
so I gotta find one I think carry this
1008<00:03:06.959> there<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.080> know<00:03:08.200> back<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.560> forth<00:03:08.670> if

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
1008 there you know back and forth if

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.930 
1008 there you know back and forth if
you<00:03:09.880> wanted<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.180> use<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.480> monitor<00:03:10.870> you<00:03:11.019> could

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
you wanted to use the monitor you could

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.729 
you wanted to use the monitor you could
just<00:03:12.940> take<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.330> servo<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:15.489> mount<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.180> upside

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
just take this servo and mount it upside

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.849 
just take this servo and mount it upside
sideways<00:03:17.739> another<00:03:19.019> quarter<00:03:20.019> turn<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.470> put<00:03:20.769> it

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
sideways another quarter turn and put it

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.340 
sideways another quarter turn and put it
flat<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.280> in<00:03:21.400> this<00:03:21.549> way<00:03:21.730> this<00:03:22.450> arm<00:03:23.019> could

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
flat and in this way this arm could

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.930 
flat and in this way this arm could
stick<00:03:23.590> out<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:24.100> only<00:03:24.280> problem<00:03:24.609> with<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.730> is

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
stick out the only problem with that is

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.789 
stick out the only problem with that is
you<00:03:25.030> don't<00:03:25.150> get<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.480> full<00:03:25.900> movement<00:03:26.290> you're<00:03:26.680> not

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
you don't get a full movement you're not

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.300 
you don't get a full movement you're not
a<00:03:26.829> lot<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.160> can't<00:03:27.430> get<00:03:27.579> this<00:03:28.560> extra<00:03:29.560> movement

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
a lot you can't get this extra movement

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.709 
a lot you can't get this extra movement
from<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:32.200> that's<00:03:32.350> about<00:03:32.470> it
