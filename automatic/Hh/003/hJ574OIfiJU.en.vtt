00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.600
 hello I'm playing the marathon the tester 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:17.360
 from the track magazine today we have a man 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.360
 gx 480 horsepower to test 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.079
 for this test we have chosen a 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.149
 intermediate cabin xl x 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.149
 It is ideal also balanced for 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.670
 trucks that are looking to go down 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.039
 maximum consumption maybe to make 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.079
 international transportation with two 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.239
 drivers be a little scant of 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.850
 space but be clear what 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.409
 we want for that the manufacturer offers 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.850
 another type of cabin is much older 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:01:01.409
 size and as you can see with two bunk beds there 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.409
 enough space for two people 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.200
 with the engine of this truck is the 26 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.750
 76 is a six cylinder in line and of 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.330
 four valves per cylinder has the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.200
 common-rail injection 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.800
 etc 7 is to say that it is the seventh version 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.680
 with electronic motor regulation 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.100
 gets to adjust the injection as much as possible 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.910
 and then this truck has a series of 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.200
 characteristics of the line of 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.170
 vision line initially 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.329
 there will be more series equipment 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.630
 related to fuel savings 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.299
 as a better aerodynamic wheels 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.509
 lower consumption then they have also 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.789
 mounted a compressor that is aimed 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.580
 electronically so that when not 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.140
 it is necessary that work is not going to 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.760
 create resistance 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.760
 in the kinematic chain 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.860
 they have also improved the inter- 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.860
 third version 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.780
 well we are ready we have done 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.280
 all measurements photographs and 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.090
 controls that we usually do before 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.090
 start the tour 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.060
 and we are not going to go the road let's see 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.890
 how this x axis behaves 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.890
 Fission series line 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.140
 cheating is able to circulate up to 85 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.270
 kilometers per hour because of the limitation to 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.860
 that only the manufacturer to avoid 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.200
 basic 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.910
 85 kilometers per hour usually the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.910
 is doing now at 1300 doors 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.590
 this change behaves very well in the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.750
 new version of the internet and improved 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.940
 much with respect to the previous ones and it 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:47.150
 note much more effectiveness offers us 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.150
 up to 285 kilowatts of power 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.250
 well we usually the magazine 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.720
 track we usually take the opinion of 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.000
 an expert today we have the 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.770
 collaboration of antonio 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.170
 an expert driver who works in the 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.420
 contras antonio company that has 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.780
 appeared estates the truth is that the 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.570
 Very comfortable change of cabin and above 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.910
 the whole stem the subject of the silences 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.190
 here in the cabin every time you go up 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.960
 the windows the outside noise is 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.960
 practically zero and the truth 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.610
 and 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.550
 things that we want to highlight is that it has 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.580
 a limited speed 85 kilometers per 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.979
 hour 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.770
 is one of the characteristics of this 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:03.090
 type of vehicles that aims to lower 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:06.780
 consumption to the limit and only once is possible 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.229
 disable this function in one in a 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.229
 authorized workshop 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.789
 but your mined by today a test 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.330
 of almost five hours on the road plus 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:39.599
 hours that we have done in the polygons 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.370
 all this man and if you want to see the 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:44.069
 Full story you can do in 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.650
 change the current point is or also 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:49.860
 in professional transport point 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.330
 giving this video as others and news 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.630
 related to transport and 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.630
 truck
