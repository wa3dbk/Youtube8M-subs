these<00:00:48.180> gadgets<00:00:48.420> right<00:00:48.750> here<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.170> way<00:00:49.350> more<00:00:49.649> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
these gadgets right here do way more so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.330 
these gadgets right here do way more so
the<00:00:50.489> only<00:00:50.700> reason<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.270> would<00:00:51.329> play<00:00:51.629> them<00:00:51.870> over

the<00:00:55.680> deck<00:00:56.239> weighs<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.539> as<00:00:57.660> well<00:00:57.870> since<00:00:58.379> like

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the deck weighs more as well since like

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.110 
the deck weighs more as well since like
these<00:00:59.910> when<00:01:00.559> supers<00:01:01.559> way<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:03.000> do

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
these when supers way more and so do

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.950 
these when supers way more and so do
secrets<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.260> forth<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.360> key<00:01:06.360> example<00:01:06.450> is

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
secrets and so forth so a key example is

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.370 
secrets and so forth so a key example is
like<00:01:07.229> when<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.710> opponent<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:09.380> power
