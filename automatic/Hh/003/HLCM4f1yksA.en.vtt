00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.660
 I believe that football has been a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.320
 tool like to open fields for 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.130
 one feel satisfied what 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.900
 He could achieve his dreams have played 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.599
 a decade in europe play with teams 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.150
 great all weekends the most 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.790
 complicated is the way of life and the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.070
 way to play the way to play is very 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.460
 difficult different from ours a football 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.280
 very very competitive every day and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.670
 get up with a weather the low grade 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.059
 zero 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.010
 you have to overcome that and that includes 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.449
 also the language and the coexistence with 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.449
 the companions and the adaptation 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.100
 for me it was something new I discovered something 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.460
 something something own where I made my own 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.549
 way then when he arrived was a 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.220
 little bit more more accessible because I already 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.039
 I could convey that it was difficult for 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.380
 the weather the classmates shouted a lot 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.840
 they were and he had to have learned the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.900
 language and feel to feel more 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.120
 comfortable 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.220
 the life stage of the selection I think 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.430
 which is very great because ecuador 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.760
 I had 50 years of frustration is without 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.440
 football identity without achievements to 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:38.640
 national level a country in multiple 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.860
 political social cultural conflicts 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.390
 then we go to 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.030
 carry a flag to carry a flag 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.730
 to take this country forward and those achievements 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.880
 from ecuador was getting that up 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.440
 Today, they see or already an Ecuadorian 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.680
 he puts on a shirt from ecuador 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.170
 any day and you can already 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.090
 you can appreciate that I think it 's one of 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.280
 the best achievements that one has obtained 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.280
 in life and in sports life 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.959
 what I now long for is to finish well 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.300
 my soccer career and 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.480
 then go to what I always dreamed 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.300
 what I always wanted to good, I always 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.360
 I have dreamed about struggling to have build 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.379
 a town I also like a lot is the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.739
 topic the business topic also I 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.269
 The family theme and the 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.040
 there all the components that are 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.170
 can add as an achievement in life I think 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.319
 that are of great satisfaction until a 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.239
 moment he tried to get everything 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.000
 goes the best way then let's wait 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.010
 conclude everything has its beginning and its 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.840
 final in what it is about is that 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.269
 when the end comes one to go with the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.489
 satisfaction of having achieved and 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.379
 that these achievements allow you to open other 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.379
 achievements other achievements in life
