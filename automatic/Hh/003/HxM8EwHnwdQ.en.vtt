00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.510
 The description has links to games from this. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.199
 review so I'm waiting for your thumbs up 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.760
 about this 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.529
 our first program is called from where 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.330
 children are taken and she will tell the child 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.399
 where did he come from to his parents 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.100
 you don't have to lie now 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.420
 show baby this app in 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.760
 program riding on such provocative 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.559
 pictures and for these pictures and the type of me 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.850
 maybe a-ta-ta so i will them 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.739
 cover it up it will look 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.280
 funny a lot however we have 7 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.289
 in general, yes, everything was told by this principle 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.949
 the program will let the child know where he comes from 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.079
 took on the free in the appstore 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.360
 The next game is called finger with a type 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.309
 fingers in general yes game 10 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.469
 called its meaning justifies the name 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.059
 we run our finger across the screen and should not 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.729
 come across this obstacle 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.740
 stumbled to lose such a game logic 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.380
 this game on captures say it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.659
 grab the fact that brother is free 2 y 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.060
 its such a cool gameplay and 3 all share 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.189
 still colorful in principle is easy that is 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.759
 play can play interesting game 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.869
 called 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:28.049
 fingers muffin grs further with s4 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.810
 go to the game this is a shooter on the form 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.189
 on top if nothing messed up maybe 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.259
 this is untrue said but nonetheless you 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.689
 see the picture and I meant what 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.520
 meant we see our hero spheres 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.960
 we have two joysticks one run 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.850
 we shoot to others we must wet 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.500
 zombies we have to perform at the level 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.210
 various tasks take place here begin 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.979
 until the end buy their weapons 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.240
 perfect our weapons ie here 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.680
 such an ordinary shooter 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.170
 but no matter how it is possible 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.170
 it will be interesting to call this sidious s4 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.240
 the success of the flappy bird still haunts 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.880
 many developers and even rovio not 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.830
 resisted released her efforts game under 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.450
 called red wine the meaning is very simple we 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.799
 not there yes the planes have to go from 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.350
 beginning in the fleece to the end of level do not 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.540
 hitting the ground not hitting the 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.720
 the clouds should fly like this 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.489
 the end point in general is shit like a game 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.200
 called rave allstars we are in it 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.959
 basketball players in the truest sense of the word 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.209
 words by me and strategies and coaches from 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.880
 one players who run on this 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.769
 the field that we ourselves should do here we 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.390
 must choose a card depending on 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.310
 the fact that we do attack or 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.290
 defend ie attack we choose 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.690
 striker with the best steve that i am now 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.850
 and do if we defend it you choose 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.830
 the defender is the best skill that is and 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.600
 they so u face a rival and in 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.970
 as a result , we are earning points 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.780
 also we will have the opportunity to go here 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.360
 it's in the field 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.280
 horseradish as he is called and throws 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.510
 ball and take away those balls and ours 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.430
 rivals ie basically in principle 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.319
 it is interesting to play of course in the game 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.079
 and on purchase because the game is free 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.640
 food play for free 500 you can play 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.720
 basically interestingly called it 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.720
 sat fought stars 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.560
 the next one is called nhl dumber game 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.709
 many have been waiting for this hockey and 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.850
 and and makes her and you know I want to believe 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.370
 not about hockey 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.670
 About this game will be specifically a separate 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.750
 minutes but because I want to ask 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.810
 developers while it is clear not to do 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.870
 horseradish look but still and that's what 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.690
 hell in the world most fans it 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.970
 football and many love football and mess 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.250
 ask what the hell 15 so crap well 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.859
 why hockey and basketball are all very 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.950
 cool cool graphics cool gameplay 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.989
 management where necessary but fifa 15 well 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.299
 govnische but shit he 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.420
 it's impossible to play on this one 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.519
 and on and the other 115 done here it is 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.989
 fucking hockey worth again 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.180
 I apologize to hockey fans but 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.640
 this hockey is worth 8 dollars why not 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.620
 make fu 15 will continue days without and not 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.319
 others with all the teams and so you can 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.120
 It was quietly adequately playing where this 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.380
 damn innovation who's here in hockey 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.830
 which is all very cool 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.630
 like in basketball where is this effect in 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.370
 general boiling over from the whole I showed you 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.810
 gameplay told his if the game 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.280

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.650
