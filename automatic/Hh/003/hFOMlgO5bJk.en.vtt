00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
on the map freefall I believe it's on a

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.420 
on the map freefall I believe it's on a
person<00:00:18.510> solo<00:00:18.750> I'm<00:00:18.869> not<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.230> don't<00:00:19.949> don't<00:00:20.310> quote

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.210 
person solo I'm not I don't don't quote
me<00:00:20.580> on<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.699> I'm<00:00:20.939> almost<00:00:21.720> positive<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.859> he's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
me on that I'm almost positive that he's

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.310 
me on that I'm almost positive that he's
not<00:00:23.340> playing<00:00:23.519> with<00:00:23.640> anybody<00:00:24.000> else<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:25.140> I

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
not playing with anybody else but I

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.900 
not playing with anybody else but I
think<00:00:25.800> you're<00:00:26.010> later<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.789> that

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
think you're later on here to see that

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.310 
think you're later on here to see that
people<00:00:27.060> are<00:00:27.180> throwing<00:00:27.480> down<00:00:27.630> ballistic<00:00:28.109> vest

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
people are throwing down ballistic vest

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.810 
people are throwing down ballistic vest
I<00:00:28.529> think<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> randoms<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.730> are

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
I think that just the randoms that are

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.450 
I think that just the randoms that are
using<00:00:30.090> support<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:31.289> his<00:00:31.529> game<00:00:31.769> but<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.980> can

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
using support in his game but I can

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.069 
using support in his game but I can
pretty<00:00:32.880> much<00:00:33.030> assure<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.570> guys<00:00:33.719> there's

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
pretty much assure you guys there's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.110 
pretty much assure you guys there's
nobody<00:00:34.410> else<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.860> he<00:00:35.489> knows<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:35.940> game

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
nobody else that he knows in this game

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.810 
nobody else that he knows in this game
i'm<00:00:36.239> pretty<00:00:36.420> sure<00:00:36.600> they're<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:37.760> randoms<00:00:38.760> i

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
i'm pretty sure they're all randoms i

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.040 
i'm pretty sure they're all randoms i
don't<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.120> he<00:00:39.210> has<00:00:39.329> he's<00:00:39.600> playing<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:39.899> any

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
don't think he has he's playing with any

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
don't think he has he's playing with any
friends<00:00:40.410> or<00:00:40.440> anything<00:00:40.649> like<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:41.820> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
friends or anything like that so if you

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.790 
friends or anything like that so if you
do<00:00:42.300> see<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.600> ballistic<00:00:43.020> vest<00:00:43.230> they're<00:00:43.770> just

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
do see this ballistic vest they're just

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.380 
do see this ballistic vest they're just
most<00:00:44.489> likely<00:00:44.940> from<00:00:47.000> randoms<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.210> using

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
most likely from randoms that are using

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.520 
most likely from randoms that are using
support<00:00:48.750> which<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.320> there's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
support which is you know there's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.569 
support which is you know there's
nothing<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.829> can<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.010> about<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
nothing you can do about that and of

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.979 
nothing you can do about that and of
course<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.969> works<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.360> advantage<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.840> it's

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
course that works your advantage so it's

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.720 
course that works your advantage so it's
always<00:00:52.199> good<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:53.070> teammates<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.610> run

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
always good to have teammates that run

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.360 
always good to have teammates that run
support<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.559> without<00:00:55.559> them<00:00:55.829> without<00:00:56.160> you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
support for you without them without you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.580 
support for you without them without you

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the gameplay better as you guys know but

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.820 
the gameplay better as you guys know but
it's<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.750> map<00:01:09.869> free<00:01:10.200> fall<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.439> that's<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
it's on the map free fall and that's the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.140 
it's on the map free fall and that's the
reason<00:01:11.130> why<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.490> thought<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.030> guys

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
reason why we thought that you guys

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
reason why we thought that you guys
would<00:01:12.330> enjoy<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.409> little<00:01:13.619> bit<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
would enjoy it it's a little bit of a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.140 
would enjoy it it's a little bit of a
different<00:01:14.189> map<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.610> pretty<00:01:14.820> high

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
different map and it's pretty high

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.410 
different map and it's pretty high
action<00:01:15.659> pace<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.850> intense<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.060> pretty<00:01:18.299> good

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
action pace and intense it's pretty good

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.590 
action pace and intense it's pretty good
gameplay<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.430> it's<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.729> yet<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.450> an

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
gameplay and it's it's yet it's an

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.539 
gameplay and it's it's yet it's an
average<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> same<00:01:23.040> time<00:01:23.189> pretty

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
average but at the same time pretty

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.940 
average but at the same time pretty
decent<00:01:24.000> gameplay<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.500> know<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.710> guys

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
decent gameplay and you know as you guys

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.200 
decent gameplay and you know as you guys
know<00:01:25.979> there's<00:01:26.310> not<00:01:26.430> too<00:01:26.610> many<00:01:26.670> triples<00:01:26.970> out

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
know there's not too many triples out

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.749 
know there's not too many triples out
there<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.600> doubles<00:01:28.409> at<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.770> moment<00:01:29.130> are<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
there so doubles at the moment are the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.149 
there so doubles at the moment are the
current<00:01:30.479> standard<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.560> they<00:01:31.650> play<00:01:31.950> behind

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
current standard so they play behind

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.580 
current standard so they play behind
this<00:01:32.340> gameplay<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:33.030> carnage<00:01:33.780> mush<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.470> he's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this gameplay is carnage mush and he's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.380 
this gameplay is carnage mush and he's
an<00:01:34.740> absolute<00:01:34.860> monster<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.939> guys<00:01:36.090> haven't

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390

an absolute monster you guys haven't
seen<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> gameplay<00:01:36.960> from<00:01:37.020> him<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.439> long<00:01:37.590> time

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
