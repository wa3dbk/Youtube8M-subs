we're<00:00:26.829> going<00:00:26.919> to<00:00:27.040> start<00:00:27.070> off<00:00:27.489> as<00:00:27.700> you<00:00:27.820> can<00:00:27.970> see

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:28.149 
we're going to start off as you can see

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.760 
we're going to start off as you can see
here<00:00:28.360> we<00:00:28.480> just<00:00:28.689> set<00:00:28.810> it<00:00:28.840> up<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.200> a<00:00:29.230> preset

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
here we just set it up to a preset

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.830 
here we just set it up to a preset
called<00:00:30.040> acoustic<00:00:30.640> it's<00:00:30.849> a<00:00:30.910> classic<00:00:31.329> acoustic

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
called acoustic it's a classic acoustic

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.900 
called acoustic it's a classic acoustic
sound<00:00:32.110> and<00:00:32.380> I've<00:00:32.950> got<00:00:33.130> my<00:00:33.250> brother<00:00:33.460> here<00:00:33.700> again

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
sound and I've got my brother here again

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.850 
sound and I've got my brother here again
to<00:00:34.059> help<00:00:34.239> and<00:00:34.480> we're<00:00:35.170> going<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.410> kind<00:00:35.590> of<00:00:35.710> go

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
to help and we're going to kind of go

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.740 
to help and we're going to kind of go
through<00:00:36.100> some<00:00:36.280> of<00:00:36.399> these<00:00:36.489> sounds<00:00:36.969> and<00:00:37.120> I<00:00:37.450> just

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
through some of these sounds and I just

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.680 
through some of these sounds and I just
have<00:00:37.899> this<00:00:38.110> hooked<00:00:38.410> up<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:39.010> a<00:00:39.580> receiver<00:00:40.240> so<00:00:40.600> if

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
have this hooked up to a receiver so if

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.940 
have this hooked up to a receiver so if
you<00:00:40.810> notice<00:00:40.930> a<00:00:41.170> little<00:00:41.290> delay<00:00:41.650> that's

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
you notice a little delay that's

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.680 
you notice a little delay that's
probably<00:00:42.400> why<00:00:42.640> we<00:00:42.910> just<00:00:43.030> have<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:43.330> hooked<00:00:43.450> into

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
probably why we just have it hooked into

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.360 
probably why we just have it hooked into
a<00:00:43.810> surround<00:00:44.200> sound<00:00:44.290> system<00:00:44.920> because<00:00:45.160> that's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
a surround sound system because that's

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.940 
a surround sound system because that's
what<00:00:45.610> I've<00:00:45.730> got<00:00:45.970> to<00:00:46.000> work<00:00:46.300> with<00:00:46.480> here<00:00:46.780> so<00:00:47.560> we're

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
before for this when we did it we used a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.020 
before for this when we did it we used a
surround<00:03:21.060> sound<00:03:21.180> system<00:03:21.900> just<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.320> standard

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
surround sound system just a standard

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.729 
surround sound system just a standard
5.1<00:03:24.030> surround<00:03:24.209> sound<00:03:24.480> system<00:03:25.080> I'm<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.470> sounded

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
5.1 surround sound system I'm it sounded

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.290 
5.1 surround sound system I'm it sounded
pretty<00:03:25.830> decent<00:03:26.310> obviously<00:03:26.820> when<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.030> have<00:03:27.180> it

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
pretty decent obviously when you have it

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.270 
pretty decent obviously when you have it
up<00:03:27.390> hooked<00:03:27.870> up<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.170> like<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.350> dedicated<00:03:28.769> speaker

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
up hooked up to like a dedicated speaker

up hooked up to like a dedicated speaker
using<00:03:29.790> headphones<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.600> might<00:03:30.720> sound<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.959> little

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
using headphones it might sound a little

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.680 
using headphones it might sound a little
bit<00:03:31.290> better<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:32.610> might<00:03:32.760> not<00:03:32.910> have<00:03:33.120> as<00:03:33.480> much<00:03:33.630> of

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
bit better you might not have as much of

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.420 
bit better you might not have as much of
a<00:03:33.900> delay<00:03:34.080> as<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.620> might<00:03:34.769> have<00:03:35.010> with<00:03:35.370> a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
a delay as you might have with a

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.710 
a delay as you might have with a

I<00:04:27.510> like<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.050> layout<00:04:28.230> of<00:04:28.380> this<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.740> lot<00:04:29.100> better

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
I like the layout of this a lot better

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.790 
I like the layout of this a lot better
than<00:04:29.550> amplitube<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.330> think<00:04:30.600> we<00:04:31.410> didn't<00:04:31.680> have

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
than amplitube I think we didn't have

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.740 
than amplitube I think we didn't have
any<00:04:31.950> distortion<00:04:32.550> issues<00:04:32.880> or<00:04:33.030> whatnot<00:04:33.270> with

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
any distortion issues or whatnot with

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.159 
any distortion issues or whatnot with
the<00:04:34.290> amplitube<00:04:35.190> iRig<00:04:35.700> we<00:04:36.390> did<00:04:36.570> with<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.930> link

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
the amplitube iRig we did with the link

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.480 
the amplitube iRig we did with the link
and<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.470> don't<00:04:37.650> know<00:04:37.770> if<00:04:37.860> maybe<00:04:38.040> that's<00:04:38.310> just

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
and I don't know if maybe that's just

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.100 
and I don't know if maybe that's just
because<00:04:38.669> of<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:38.970> surround<00:04:39.330> sound<00:04:39.450> system<00:04:39.990> we

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
because of the surround sound system we

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.930 
because of the surround sound system we
were<00:04:40.230> using<00:04:40.440> but<00:04:40.680> we<00:04:40.770> also<00:04:40.950> had<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.460> we<00:04:41.910> only

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
were using but we also had it we only

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.760 
were using but we also had it we only
really<00:04:42.240> had<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.600> on<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.810> distortion<00:04:43.290> pedal<00:04:43.590> so

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
really had it on the distortion pedal so

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.260 
really had it on the distortion pedal so
we<00:04:44.010> very<00:04:44.250> well<00:04:44.370> could<00:04:44.550> have<00:04:44.760> been<00:04:44.880> doing

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
we very well could have been doing

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.550 
we very well could have been doing
something<00:04:45.630> wrong<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.140> if<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.350> guys<00:04:46.530> think

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
something wrong so if you guys think

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.530 
something wrong so if you guys think
that<00:04:46.890> maybe<00:04:47.160> you<00:04:47.460> had<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.640> solution<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.330> or

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
that maybe you had a solution to that or

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.820 
that maybe you had a solution to that or
maybe<00:04:48.660> we<00:04:48.870> were<00:04:49.020> doing<00:04:49.290> something<00:04:49.620> wrong<00:04:49.770> and

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
maybe we were doing something wrong and

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.370 
maybe we were doing something wrong and
that<00:04:50.730> sounds<00:04:51.000> familiar<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:51.510> let<00:04:52.110> us<00:04:52.200> know

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
that sounds familiar to you let us know

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.900 
that sounds familiar to you let us know
in<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.530> comments<00:04:53.040> other<00:04:53.280> than<00:04:53.460> that<00:04:53.550> I'm

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
in the comments other than that I'm

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.090
