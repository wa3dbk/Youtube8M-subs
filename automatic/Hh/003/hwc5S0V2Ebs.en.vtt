00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.549
 flexible but that does not renounce to 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.339
 fundamental qualities of the good chandler 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.830

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.330
 Ott ample at a strong base damage and it is 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.000
 fitted with one of the best stone of the 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.800
 jungle game to reclaim on 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.470
 stand also not needing 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.470
 car is a great gunter before 6 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.550
 for one you can use red atac speed 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.840
 or magic penetration yellow armor or hp 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.770

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.170
 items that make it ton thing but that 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.090
 same time give them their first equation 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.450
 magic to exploit his other damages 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.040
 basic as django light not having 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.050
 need your ranger stand 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.620
 I prefer to sky but what makes it 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.020
 the island 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.020
 no one more fearsome is strong in 1 v1 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.310
 for your first to start at 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.070
 nearest field given bot 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.020
 from there go to the nearest bar e 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.380
 end with the last field of that 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.440
 area 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.840
 at this point if you are on the red side that 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.760
 run if you have a blue car to decide if 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.180
 try making a big one with the collar 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.640
 immediately skilled for her begins 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.860
 putting a dot on the w using from three 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.200
 seconds before on pony campus while you are 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.270
 in human form then turning into a 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.820
 spider vat base attack on our e 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.930
 immediately after use the w as a reset for you 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.420
 they immediately have another as a second 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.920
 skill take the q using the first in 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.000
 human form for damage based on 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.520
 how much life to the enemy 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.750
 then the damage based on the spider 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:00.580
 he concludes with the life missing of the enemy 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.130
 taking it, that is, cohesion spiders 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.440
 in two ways if you want more damage to create 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.040
 of the field quickly tired and not of 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.229
 to die 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.119
 if you do not want to ancare instead, take a step 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.400
 back in such a way as to make him take it 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.400
 shots from monsters before they attack you 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.130
 if you want to invade at level 2 I start 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.980
 of q followed by is this scrutinize the 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.580
 damage is the closer of the acu and the stunt e 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.910
 the applause of yours is yours 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.070
 first climax areas first the cour then the w 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.580
 finally the former putting the points on the r 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.580
 when it is possible 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.100
 while moving around the map try to 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.200
 stay in the form of a spider to exploit 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.090
 the good speed written by itself for the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.980
 evidence of a fight or because step 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.110
 reagan care or why are you jong singers 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.640
 lando returns in human form because from 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.560
 that form that can start all 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.020
 your fights because of the stand 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.800
 on the is of the ac which does more damage more 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.800
 vital enemy 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.140
 kimi always keep in mind that using the in 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.749
 spider shape to go through i 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:12.150
 walls allowing you to make place and gang 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:14.099
 that with other champions you ca n't 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.629
 you always start a whites in 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.969
 human form to be able to study 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:22.879
 the opponent with the stone pulls the w q 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:26.519
 transformed into a spider and continue with q 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:30.109
 attack w saves the is for when the 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.109
 enemy tries to escape if you want 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.400
 or even better to lose the agro of the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.400
 tower after cultivated charity 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.550
 if you are that I looked you will need it 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.440
 spider mobility to hook into 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.870
 spider form uses it a friend 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.730
 transformed the sea launch 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.330
 nothing to flush it out 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.130
 from there then follow your usual combo 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.780
 remember if the end of the combo if in 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.730
 spider shape of your friend stands 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.500
 running away with little life then again 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.940
 turn into human form for 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.069
 become range and have a curent elise 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.800
 not needing one and one of the 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.019
 a hundred more strong in the again this le 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.720
 allows to be strong in 1 v1 and 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:21.639
 sing jungle king if you want against jungle 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.370
 re enters the enemy jungle in shape 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.740
 human account pull is just and vision 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.139
 of the enemy he followed them with the usual 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.060
 combo using it in the form of a spider 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.690
 to chase the enemy in the event of a 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.280
 flash 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.650
 or if you are losing the fight 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.250
 to jump on a jungle field in 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.250
 way to escape 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.090
 when you do the dragon or the bar on 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.770
 begins the salty combo e 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.180
 remains in the form of a spider until it does 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.120
 the speed bust ends 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.150
 Attack of your w then return to formula 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.490
 na and the combo starts again to kill him 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.069
 save given as in spider form and use 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.110
 it consumes it if you can where it should 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:05.009
 hit the smile a moment later so 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.009
 to do more damage 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.610
 you want to try to hit one of the 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.290
 enemy mines pour or even a 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.680
 killer trying to go on yours 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.680
 curry 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.580
 or even better in case I find it in 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.860
 a single and isolated if he can hit it 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.340
 with the and you have just given birth to a 5 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.340
 of 4 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.750
 based on the situation I preferred 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.970
 stick with early tricks to defend them 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.290
 or there is too much at the opening jump up 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.480
 chieri opponents returned combo 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.480
 leaving you with little life or killing them 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.110
 ideally network type enemies maybe not 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.650
 making to waste their damage on 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.510
 you 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:11.390
 later use the spider form 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:12.830
 to no longer be struck by this 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.560
 damian concludes led eg 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.440
 if you are interested in guide national agency 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.000
 generally subscribe to the channel for now 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.000
