harder<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.680> have<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:14.890> smaller<00:03:15.459> time<00:03:15.790> frame<00:03:15.820> to

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
harder you have a smaller time frame to

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.229 
harder you have a smaller time frame to
do<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:17.170> just<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.440> little<00:03:17.590> bit<00:03:17.769> harder

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
do it in it's just a little bit harder

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.000 
do it in it's just a little bit harder
changing<00:03:19.239> difficulty<00:03:19.750> pretty<00:03:19.959> much<00:03:20.170> so<00:03:20.530> to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010
