00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.190
 nvidia the brand of graphics cards 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.849
 believes that consoles will never be able 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.200
 surpass pc in graphic technology 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.329
 consider that the time in which they were 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.339
 more powerful has come to an end 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.770
 cutting edge words from nvidia manufacturer 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.990
 of gpu believes that consoles never 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.910
 will be ahead of the pc something that yes 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.070
 has happened in the past because of how 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.980
 Advanced the graphic chip industry 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.990
 in this way the executive of nvidia 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.760
 toni is more and believes that it is no longer 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.309
 possible that a console has better 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.289
 graphics or that is more capable than a pc 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.319
 is more and admits that this has happened 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:41.170
 in the past of course but now 

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:43.629
 He is no longer so attentive to his words says 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.969
 of course with the first playstation and 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.829
 playstation 2 was a time when 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.409
 there were not really good graphics 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.749
 I started during the playstation 2 era 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.909
 is when the 3d really started 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.699
 arise in the pc but before that 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.519
 moment the 3d image was the domain of 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.269
 silicon graphics and other stations 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.670
 work 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.800
 sonic sega or nintendo could invest in 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.940
 3d graphics for a platform 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.670
 consumption 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.730
 is that playstation 2 was faster than 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.690
 a pp for when they arrived xbox 360 and 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.910
 Playstation 3 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.980
 the consoles were already on par with the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.160
 fish if you look at your hardware have 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.230
 nvidia or aemead graphics technology 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.660
 because at that time all the innovation 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.020
 of graphics was being done in the 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.360
 graphics companies for pc envy it 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.970
 spend $ 1.5 billion a year 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.280
 in research and development all 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.980
 years and during the commercial cycle 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.250
 of a console we spent more than 10 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.620
 billion dollars in research 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.810
 for tam well sony microsoft simply 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.210
 they can not assume that volume of expenses 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.550
 they do not have the investment capacity to 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.860
 equal to pp people us 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.140
 we can do it by the size of this 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.630
 economy because we sell millions of 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.060
 chips year after year also according to us 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.250
 account now the gpu take advantage of all the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.710
 technology and possible power something that 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.810
 it was not years ago something that 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.450
 definitely places the vanguard 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.489
 graphic the graphics industry for pc 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.240
 it did not work to the limit of physics and 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.880
 the potter 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.890
 if you look back in time a card 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.930
 high-end graphic of then not 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.670
 reached such high yields of 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.100
 power we did not make chips that 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.380
 will use the most advanced processes of 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.360
 semiconductors and we had thousands of 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.610
 millions of transistors now we create 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.010
 gpu to the limit of what the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.410
 manufacturing processes no one can 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.840
 make anything bigger or more powerful than 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.820
 what is in a pp is not possible but 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.890
 this did not happen yet in the previous 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.260
 generation of consoles brought to their 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.690
 theoretical limits the best that any 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.750
 console could do is be equal to 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.760
 best pc at the time of its release 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.280
 but then one year later it will be more 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.590
 slow although in any case this could not 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.180
 be done by the energy limitations 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.040
 The truth is that this news a lot 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.290
 people will not be surprised it's obvious that 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.990
 fish are superior to consoles 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.240
 the most cutting edge pc on the market 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.670
 will always be superior to the console 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.890
 of last generation but lately 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.370
 there is a lot of news about this 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.010
 it would be because the nexgen consoles are not 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.050
 so nexgen as you think there will be fear of 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.610
 that in a couple of years 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.440
 the consoles are totally 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.440
 obsolete that you think about it
