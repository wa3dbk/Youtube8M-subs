 with that push in June so I had 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.980
 very few books in total I 'm going to 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.510

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.759
 And now let 's start from the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.570
 Collaboration of spring in random house 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:12.689
 of the month of June that are that collaborated 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.460
 with three books that are the following 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.720
 the first is a murderer's apprentice 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.920

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.560
 rijo rijo that belongs to the trilogy 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.780
 of the murderer this is the book one that I 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.000
 there was not but it should be very very 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.900
 interesting so I have many many 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.880
 desire to make and good rich 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.520
 the second book is called the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.320

 the queen of the cemetery that is going to be a 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.330
 adaptation to a television series like this 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.400
 what 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.070
 and keep an eye on that because it's going to be very 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.460
 interesting and in my current reading I 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.900
 I'm watching with my book 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.590
 reading and it 's like ghosts and 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.530
 certain sense and from it detective well 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.390
 that is very very very good and the third 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.280
 book of danger real danger of a house 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.750

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.750
 by nicolÃ¡s is part of this book 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.530
 it's wonderful and I'll leave it received 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.930
 over here so they can see her 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.160
 and they really are very good books and 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.819
 I love 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.200
 then I bought a book because I had 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.600
 read the first book of this saga 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.430
 then the courts and I said I need 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.950
 the second as well now and it's month 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.920
 test runner is that the world 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.320
 James Buster gone super weird because 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.480
 I did not start reading and as the marker of 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.810
 little cat 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.130
 on page 18 and then continue 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.620
 advancing because 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.040
 I was very info for the second one 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.040
 human 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.260
 like the books and read and guide me 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.879
 name throughout the book and in front 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.220
 secret and everything I'm here still 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.599
 because I can not move forward is not something 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.120
 it happens with this book that I can not 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:12.250
 move forward but that later in editions bm 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.430
 collaborated with a book for the month of 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.379
 june and slum and nantes the enigma of nolan 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.180
 written by Ivan Roca 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.549
 I'll think about this book a little bit like that 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.200
 like yesterday and I'm going to page 23 just 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.209
 but it's very very good because it's like 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.580
 something that calls the origin and like that 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.050
 controls people but the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.370
 people like you say yes and 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.860
 medical checks like who does not want 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.629
 make own decisions and the title 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.730
 nygma with this flower that is here so 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.330
 It is very interesting 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.769
 and reading too and I have clothes and 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.049
 then for the month of July 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.720
 coming back with collaborations I have 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.390

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.799

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.400

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.739
 said in the turn the mark had to carry 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.120

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.970

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.750

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.330
 press seen I loved how you know and 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.510
 I do not have a crisis because this money 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.120
 it is more serious 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.220
 Then I bought another book because 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.410

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.110
 star this book I already read it I liked it 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:01.470
 a lot if and if you want to see my opinion 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:04.460
 I'll leave the review because it is also 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.460
 a very good book 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.590
 it's a good book on a mat 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.199
 interesting but under the same star 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:18.270
 He left the rod very high and soft paper 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:20.910
