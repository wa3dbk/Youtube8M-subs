00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
been doing and how we've worked really

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.439 
been doing and how we've worked really
hard<00:00:48.159> these<00:00:48.519> past<00:00:48.579> couple<00:00:48.940> weeks<00:00:49.089> it<00:00:49.329> seems

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
hard these past couple weeks it seems

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.549 
hard these past couple weeks it seems
like<00:00:49.629> it's<00:00:49.749> been<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:49.929> while<00:00:50.139> since<00:00:50.350> we've

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
like it's been a while since we've

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.889 
like it's been a while since we've
played<00:00:50.739> a<00:00:50.769> game<00:00:50.979> so<00:00:51.339> I<00:00:51.760> think<00:00:52.389> that's<00:00:52.539> kept<00:00:52.780> us

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
played a game so I think that's kept us

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.840 
played a game so I think that's kept us
motivated<00:00:53.289> and<00:00:53.649> hungry<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:54.489> we're<00:00:54.639> and<00:00:54.729> we're

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
motivated and hungry and we're and we're

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.189 
motivated and hungry and we're and we're
really<00:00:55.030> looking<00:00:55.149> forward<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.539> tomorrow<00:00:55.809> I

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
really looking forward to tomorrow I

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.229 
really looking forward to tomorrow I
think<00:00:56.920> we're<00:00:57.100> going<00:00:57.309> through<00:00:57.699> the<00:00:57.760> scouting

lot I think it would say it's a lot

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.900 
lot I think it would say it's a lot
easier<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.470> know<00:01:20.500> traveling<00:01:21.160> is<00:01:21.370> a<00:01:21.400> factor

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
easier you know traveling is a factor

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.960 
easier you know traveling is a factor
that<00:01:22.270> affects<00:01:22.900> most<00:01:23.590> teams<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:24.130> know<00:01:24.160> and<00:01:24.640> so

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.800 
it's like even though we've gotten the
number<00:01:50.860> one<00:01:51.010> seed<00:01:51.250> we're<00:01:51.610> acting<00:01:52.300> like<00:01:52.480> we're

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
number one seed we're acting like we're

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.600 
number one seed we're acting like we're
the<00:01:52.840> lower<00:01:53.230> seed<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:53.830> our<00:01:53.950> bracket<00:01:54.190> you<00:01:54.490> know

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
the lower seed in our bracket you know

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.460 
the lower seed in our bracket you know
we<00:01:54.820> just<00:01:55.030> coming<00:01:55.330> out<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.720> playing<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.290> hard

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
we just coming out and playing the hard

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.870 
we just coming out and playing the hard
as<00:01:56.560> we<00:01:56.680> can<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.070> taking<00:01:57.370> nothing<00:01:57.520> for<00:01:57.820> granted

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
as we can and taking nothing for granted

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.330 
as we can and taking nothing for granted
we<00:01:58.390> know<00:01:58.600> that<00:01:58.630> every<00:01:59.530> team<00:01:59.710> we're<00:01:59.890> playing<00:01:59.920> is

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
we know that every team we're playing is

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.830 
we know that every team we're playing is
extremely<00:02:00.850> good<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.240> could<00:02:01.330> have<00:02:01.480> the<00:02:01.630> chance

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
extremely good and could have the chance

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.330 
extremely good and could have the chance
to<00:02:01.960> come<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.260> and<00:02:02.350> upset<00:02:02.680> us<00:02:02.800> so<00:02:03.010> we're<00:02:03.190> not

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
to come in and upset us so we're not

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.590 
to come in and upset us so we're not
going<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.610> let<00:02:03.700> that<00:02:03.760> happen<00:02:03.910> we're<00:02:04.330> coming

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
going to let that happen we're coming

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.360 
going to let that happen we're coming
out<00:02:04.660> focused<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:05.380> serious<00:02:05.590> every<00:02:06.190> single

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
out focused and serious every single

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.820 
out focused and serious every single
game<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:06.850> I<00:02:07.270> think<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.810> we<00:02:08.380> can<00:02:08.500> do<00:02:08.649> that

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
game and I think that we can do that

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.040 
game and I think that we can do that
then<00:02:09.040> we<00:02:09.550> have<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.700> great<00:02:09.880> chance<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.330> making<00:02:10.930> as

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
then we have a great chance of making as

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.740 
then we have a great chance of making as
far<00:02:11.260> as<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.410> want<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.650> go
