00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.379
 hello friends in this presentation is more we believe the parts psp or 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:13.409
 this fact the processor the interpreter the instructions contained in the 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.589
 programs and process the data 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:21.939
 now we will see what is the hard drive which is a storage device 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.160
 these regularly use a superb recording system ana logical 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:34.059
 these images as strips that visualize now are called pos 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:34.820
 data 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.820
 which allow the conduction of the data 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.260
 the motherboard is a printed circuit board to which you connect 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.140
 the other parts of a computer 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.140
 has installed a series of integrated circuits 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.720
 among which are the chef c 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.870
 which serves as a protection center 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.490
 between the processor 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.679
 ram memory 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.179
 the expansion buses 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.050
 and other devices 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.270
 is installed inside the box that is usually made 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.280
 tab to 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.140
 and has a panel to connect tester 2 devices 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.400
 and many internal connectors 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.860
 made cars to install components inside the box 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.740
 we will see now what is a microprocessor 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.659
 in this 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.770
 most important chip of a computer 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.990
 belongs to the central processing unit of the machine 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.430
 and between its main sections 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.020
 they find the unit 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.050
 logical arithmetic 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.300
 is that they are responsible for running the programs stored in a ram 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.230
 this is a compact disc player is a device dependent on the computer 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.350
 and controlled by that 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.380
 this part is similar to a citi reader 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.150
 but it's a burner d split 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.530
 he can read and burn xerez idibi 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.630
 the main memory or ramires where the computer keep the data that is 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.849
 using in the present moment 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.879
 storage is considered temporary because they and so many programs 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.519
 remain in the day while the computer is on or has not been 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.809
 restarted 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.060
 the floppy disk drive 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.659
 physical unit that is responsible for reading 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:30.550
 to write 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.739
 supposedly tennis 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.639
 collet and mentions are 5 a quarter 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.129
 and behind a medium 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.890
 which are usually represented with the units 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.730
 these are the cables and it is the means by 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.730
 which pass the signals of a device 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:54.459
 we are now seeing what is the processor fan 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.059
 yesterday to the processor to be at a normal temperature 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.129
 and my side 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.129
 and do not have problems of overheating 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.890
 this is a cache 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.639
 which is a small amount of high-speed memory 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.299
 increases computer performance by storing data 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.439
 temporarily 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.849
 now the president the most important parts of the square more 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.859
 this time he emphasizes that the defendant 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.309
 It is an electromechanical system band support electronic connection installed 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.569
 on the motherboard that is used to 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.569
 and connected 3 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:50.570
 was doing now what the slots for ram memories set 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.510
 these many readers in Spain connect memory modules 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.489
 main computer 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.089
 these connectors are also called memory banks 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.689
 this one that we are seeing now in six days is a more effective system of 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.650
 input and output that normally goes unnoticed to the end user of 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.430
 computer stein charge against this radio equipment and it will do this way 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.409
 now he was found in one of the stands supporting the state of shock and was 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:26.320
 restored where are concentrated those that generally among which we can 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.810
 transform actress deputy head of the musel 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.600
 licua tuareg on the court and lain ohl in the air then read now we will see the 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.009
 who agreed to receive this mother 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.189
 on my right 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:40.199
 we are seeing two doors 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.469
 ps2 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:47.199
 the weight of the markets the tandem has connected the mouse psc 2 blue the 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.129
 plan of the connected the keyboard 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:53.489
 The ports are also there, so we can connect them in memory of their 

00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:57.569
 Esteve as well as any device that has this type of behavior 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.389
 the vigués the serial port in cereals east 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.990
 connects all older devices 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.639
 childbirth to read 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.319
 the commonly longest set that last year by the way was connected 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.529
 interest 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.159
 the beige this collaboration 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.770
 in this frame the monitor has been 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.710
 we also find the puertollano that are from the connects the network 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:28.840
 we also find the audio ports the blue is the one used for 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:30.229
 enter amaury 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.110
 the green this is that is not used 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.600
 nobody audio 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.910
 larraz advanced yourself stop and the connection of the micro 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:47.129
 now again the most important parts of a process 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:52.469
 in these 50 the noise generator the unit there bothers me logic 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:58.119
 in the statistics of administrations load instructions and control unit 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:06.189
 the abuse allow the wireless connection entel different subsystems 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:08.439
 of a digital system 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:11.909
 sending data between devices from different areas 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:18.550
 most blues are based on metallic conductors by which 

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:23.789
 They transmit signals in ethics that are sent and received with the help of 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.139
 members who produce in the parrandas informality of the directors 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.929
 to those who send the signal of the set of computers as lanzaroteños and gave 

00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:37.939
 the high end its capacity according to this compact card reader the 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.689
 carnal wit between the information contained on the compact disc 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.289
 is conscious 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:48.189
 thanks for your attention
