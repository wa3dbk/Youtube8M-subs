00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.720
 I have just come from Martin and we 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.220
 just talked about what 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.930
 It's best to shoot for the first time 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.490
 model and I have me too 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.860
 said I still prefer 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 my finishing brother with it though 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.650
 I think you are the right one 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.470
 address and can the audience was 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.270
 helpful tips give then handed over 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:37.920
 me and wish you all soccer 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:39.510
 Thank you very much then for his love 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.309
 welcome to today's topic 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.900
 Primer and we just want to 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.820
 take a look at the most important things 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.470
 you need a perfect one 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.710
 to do priming and catch it 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.090
 We always best concealer with at 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.270
 Concealer is mostly a small one 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.550
 sweet packaging and just 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.800
 then it uses only small and 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.420
 sweet if you look here on my 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.120
 redness on the hand you can see that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.470
 wonderful it may ensure there to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.479
 just such redness on the face 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.119
 cover or of course, too 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.649
 gray eyes under the eyes 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.850
 nose we have more often times 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.550
 redness and shadow 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.960
 we see how cover is to the concealer 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.420
 but we also see if you can 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.100
 is already everywhere he goes already 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.210
 quite a lot in the skin a little so 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.530
 with something always a bit 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.299
 he will be a little bit more careful 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.770
 Less prefers to finish 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.450
 perhaps make a second time over it 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.159
 but delete before something like that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.320
 Of course, very in the little ones was with 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.060
 we see high quality here 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.070
 product and yet the stronger the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.619
 pigmentation more strongly can the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.150
 just settle in the moth so 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.330
 first step, so to speak 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.430
 we all have lightened all the shadows 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.590
 redness covered and now it's about 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.060
 that we just get even 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.009
 if we have a skin we do not 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.540
 must cover particularly strong 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.130
 apart from the small shadow or 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.520
 maybe one or the other 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.409
 pimple 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.570
 it is usually easy enough only 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:03.060
 Dacian mostly simple 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.650
 liquid contains as color pigments we 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.360
 have one here that means build yours 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.860
 you can just be good fans then too 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.179
 smear on arms and legs if that 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.829
 Model then maybe not 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.390
 so very tanned but only so part 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.370
 browned we all know that 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.329
 we see it here again on my hand 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.459
 Press the entire hand will be nice yellow 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.150
 in comparison to otherwise but the rescue 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.220
 you look after 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.540
 It's not a miracle , too 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.720
 germania the concealer again 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.480
 just wiped away so that was it 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.840
 the comparison that you see a liquid 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.549
 make up that is little pigmented and 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.170
 here simply to contrast we take 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.359
 quiet also just something darker 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.459
 Sound so you see how that on the 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:46.560
 Skin behaves if we just now 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.829
 someone completely on wear we see 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.620
 that it is not quite as fluid as 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.389
 Creamy also covers very different 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.859
 and the redness is almost not 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.000
 to see so if you discover such 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.340
 The make-up takes then you need 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.500
 actually almost only completely 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.599
 a bit concealer or just about even 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.829
 not so busy 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.480
 but you see exactly that now 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.670
 difference between a very 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.739
 covering makeup and the only just 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.079
 quite easily covered for as well as 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.379
 said really great skin that not so 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.060
 So much product needs first step 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.310
 concealer second step make liquid 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.959
 we would have had that up and what as 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.750
 Next comes the powder 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.730
 you already know from the janina you have 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.879
 just seen that always takes this 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.139
 with to quasi the whole thing 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.419
 Take away this is one 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.760
 transparent brother just one thing no 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:38.310
 own color has yes that 's really only 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.370
 to compensate or to compensate 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.190
 actually a bit 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.379
 afterwards powdering off so if you have it 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.280
 Wearing on very much will likely 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.019
 a little bit lighter 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.430
 but as I said, mainly 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.629
 really only mark this when we are 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.069
 We also want to say one more thing 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.229
 we have to clean up a bit 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.840
 rather a powder take something stronger 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:00.599
 pigmented is with after color here 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.090
 something yellow steady of it always 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.319
 apply very little you want too 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.150
 After all, just a little bit the 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.829
 Change color because if you are natural 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.120
 in such a powder neat neat 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.250
 purely because it is not so 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.810
 like the transparent powder where you are 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.459
 simply said, now we can quickly 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.380
 clean away but you have neat 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.389
 color on your face that you should bypass 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.340
 so first step concealer second 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.049
 Step Makeup Third Step Powder 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.400
 So we have a perfect primer 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.310
 and now we only need one and 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.020
 two feet the rouge is not 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.460
 Stale as you sometimes could think 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.580
 because it's just like that when we have one 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.289
 have made perfect primer 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.830
 we have the face completely the red 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.030
 withdrawn and therefore one has so far 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.919
 So we just a little bit more 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.349
 conjure up fresh back with it 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.389
 our model is not completely pale and 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.219
 looks sick but just easy 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.719
 you get fresh again here 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.370
 two very soft tones 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:50.900
 if we choose the one or the other 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.550
 Actually, no matter the main thing you do 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.590
 makes the model a bit fresher 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.009
 as it just as completely covered 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.509
 is 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.509
 that was already mine 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.280
 page of so small tips for today 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.190
 You are probably still priming it 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.569
 to tell one or the other 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.550
 but we do it all the best 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.319
 Next time say the other two 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.039
 I greet you very much and see you 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.039
 next time
