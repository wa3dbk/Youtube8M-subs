00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.240
So the Mona Lisa might be the first 3D Image!

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.860
German researchers Claus-Christian Carbon
and Vera Hesslinger studied the famous Leonardo

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.230
da Vinci portrait alongside a very similar
copy known as the “Prado Mona Lisa” in

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.560
Spain.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.830
They conclude that the pair might be the world’s
first stereoscopic image.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.449
But wait! What is a stereoscopic image? How
can two images be 3D image?

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.640
Stereoscopy is a technique where you create
the illusion of depth by using two similar,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.070
but slightly shifted images. Basically, it
mimics what our eyes see.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.290
Your left eye and right eye can look at the
same object, the vision is slightly different

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.460
because of the distance between your pupils.
Your body sends these two flat images to the

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.590
brain, and your brain smooshes the two images
together, and voila, you have depth perception!

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.900
Amazing!

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.850
However, since you’re looking at a flat
image, rather than a 3 dimensional object,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.350
tricking your eye into thinking it’s 3 dimensional
is a little trickier. You might see something

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.189
if you full screen this video, cross your
eyes, and adjust your head closer or farther

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.469
from the screen. But that might be a bit uncomfortable,
and still not produce the desired result.

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:22.749
So thats why we have a stereoscope to comfortably
view the images. The first one was invented

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:28.590
by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1838, but if
da Vinci were to have made one to accompany

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.200
these two paintings, he would have predated
this by more than 300 years.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.729
The Prado version was introduced to the public
in 2012 as a possible work of deVinci or one

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.850
of his students. It’s thoerized that the
paintings were painted side by side, which

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.899
would explain the slight difference in perspective.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.209
Intrigued, Carbon and Hesslinger decided to
calculate the positions between the painters

00:01:53.209 --> 00:02:00.209
(or painter) and they concluded that the horizontal
shift between the two paintings were 2.7 inches,

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.869
which happens to be very close to the average
distance between a person's eyes.

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.459
Turns out, among all his other studies, DaVinci
also researched monocular and binocular vision,

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:19.459
aspects of optics, eye anatomy, and light
reflections. So it could’ve been that he

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.459
intentionally tried to create a stereoscopic
art.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.400
It's impossible to know whether Carbon and
Hesslinger's observations are just a coincidence,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.540
or if if was intentionally made to be stereoscopic.
What do you guys think? Do you buy it? Or

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.290
do you just think it’s a result of how the
two were produced side by side.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.750
