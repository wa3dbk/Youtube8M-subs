00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 Take her three in three to go 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.350

 follow up on any news that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.730
 example I get on twitter if not 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.890
 I'm taking a television first 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.330
 What I do is go to the page of 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.060
 internet to be able to see it live by 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.910

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.320
 the coverage that has true tv forum 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.790
 which is a channel that also has gives me 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.619
 a lot of confidence whenever in any 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.600
 note and in addition to culture in many things 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.640
 fractal sense, the truth is that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.770
 Strong is a channel that covers all 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.030
 news is a channel that informs us and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.770
 especially at all times it does not have 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.330
 multiple schedules and all the people 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.310
 can go in it was tendered to all the people to 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.720
 all the production of the channel because 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.220
 They have done a good job reporting 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.909
 all the people I love but 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.119

 for this year more than meet and thank you 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.649
 for informing us every day is a 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.750
 excellent option when suddenly we 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.200
 We learned from some news of the last 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.140
 hour or suddenly a weekend or 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.259
 soon does not coincide with other news 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.910
 really that for me is the option without 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.910
 doubt and it is also a very good option
