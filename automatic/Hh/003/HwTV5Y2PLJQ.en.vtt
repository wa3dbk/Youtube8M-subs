get<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.570> some<00:00:45.690> headphones<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> but<00:00:46.649> you

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
get with some headphones with it but you

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.930 
get with some headphones with it but you
can<00:00:46.860> use<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.100> own<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.520> I'll<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.760> rid<00:00:47.850> of

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
can use your own so I'll get rid of

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:58.310 
can use your own so I'll get rid of
those<00:00:48.200> fat<00:00:49.200> free<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.739> useful

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.319 

okay<00:00:59.320> well<00:00:59.559> that's<00:00:59.710> booting<00:01:00.160> up<00:01:00.309> you<00:01:00.760> also<00:01:00.940> get

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
okay well that's booting up you also get

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.740 
okay well that's booting up you also get
your<00:01:01.750> manuals<00:01:02.289> and<00:01:04.590> power<00:01:05.590> supply<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.400> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
your manuals and power supply and a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.240 
your manuals and power supply and a
video<00:01:07.750> cable<00:01:08.440> here<00:01:08.680> that<00:01:09.430> presumably<00:01:11.250> plugs

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
video cable here that presumably plugs

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.810 
video cable here that presumably plugs
into<00:01:12.520> this<00:01:13.360> output<00:01:13.930> here<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.430> can<00:01:15.610> plug

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
into this output here so you can plug

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.450 
into this output here so you can plug
that<00:01:15.880> into<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.659> TV<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:20.649> course<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:21.009> USB

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
that into the TV and of course a USB

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:30.450 
that into the TV and of course a USB
cable<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.920> there<00:01:27.190> it<00:01:27.310> is<00:01:27.660> the<00:01:28.660> nokia<00:01:29.050> n95<00:01:29.860> as

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
cable so there it is the nokia n95 as

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.910 
cable so there it is the nokia n95 as
you<00:01:30.940> can<00:01:31.030> see<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.420> screen<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:32.020> nice<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.500> clear

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
you can see the screen is nice and clear

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.889 
you can see the screen is nice and clear
although<00:01:33.490> it's<00:01:33.670> not<00:01:33.880> actually<00:01:34.300> as<00:01:34.420> high<00:01:34.630> res

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
although it's not actually as high res

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.200 
although it's not actually as high res
as<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.500> nokia<00:01:36.220> n80<00:01:36.670> screen<00:01:37.240> was<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.970> does

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
as the nokia n80 screen was it does

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.730 
as the nokia n80 screen was it does
pretty<00:01:40.390> much<00:01:40.479> everything<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:41.050> nokia<00:01:41.380> n80

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
pretty much everything the nokia n80

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.609 
pretty much everything the nokia n80
does<00:01:42.069> it's<00:01:42.310> got<00:01:42.460> Wi-Fi<00:01:42.700> built-in<00:01:43.390> 3g<00:01:44.110> of

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
does it's got Wi-Fi built-in 3g of

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.760 
does it's got Wi-Fi built-in 3g of
course<00:01:44.920> it's<00:01:45.880> got<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.179> 5<00:01:46.630> megapixel<00:01:47.350> camera

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
course it's got this 5 megapixel camera

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.590 
course it's got this 5 megapixel camera
here<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:49.509> it's<00:01:49.659> also<00:01:51.300> got<00:01:52.300> maps

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.890 

also<00:01:56.600> when<00:01:56.720> you're<00:01:57.190> just<00:01:58.190> jealous

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
also when you're just jealous

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.440 
also when you're just jealous
now<00:02:00.470> at<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.800> moment<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.190> can<00:02:01.340> see<00:02:01.580> we're<00:02:02.300> not

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
now at the moment you can see we're not

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.240 
now at the moment you can see we're not
getting<00:02:02.690> any<00:02:02.840> satellite<00:02:03.320> signal<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:04.160> i'm

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
getting any satellite signal so i'm

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.710 
getting any satellite signal so i'm
going<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.430> head<00:02:04.580> outside<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.090> try<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.630> out

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
going to head outside and try it out

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.400 
going to head outside and try it out
there<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:07.340> here<00:02:07.550> we<00:02:07.580> are<00:02:07.820> outside<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.410> the

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
there so here we are outside and the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.060 
there so here we are outside and the
satellite<00:02:10.130> navigation<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:11.390> actually<00:02:11.780> working

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
satellite navigation is actually working

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.990 
satellite navigation is actually working
surprisingly<00:02:13.070> unlike<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.670> pre-production

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
surprisingly unlike the pre-production

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.630 
surprisingly unlike the pre-production
model<00:02:14.510> i<00:02:14.600> had<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:15.680> picked<00:02:15.950> up<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.220> satellites

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
model i had is picked up the satellites

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.760 
model i had is picked up the satellites
very<00:02:16.850> quickly<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.510> it's<00:02:17.930> got<00:02:18.140> exactly<00:02:18.650> the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
very quickly and it's got exactly the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.520 
very quickly and it's got exactly the
right<00:02:18.950> spot<00:02:19.370> on<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.850> map<00:02:20.090> now<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:21.140> does<00:02:21.320> take<00:02:21.500> a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
right spot on the map now it does take a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.560 
right spot on the map now it does take a
little<00:02:21.740> while<00:02:22.100> for<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.610> maps<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:23.000> download

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
little while for the maps to download

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.870 
little while for the maps to download
you're<00:02:24.560> probably<00:02:24.710> better<00:02:24.920> best<00:02:25.370> off<00:02:25.520> doing<00:02:25.790> it

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
you're probably better best off doing it

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.790 
you're probably better best off doing it
in<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> Wi-Fi<00:02:26.420> hotspot<00:02:26.450> rather<00:02:27.320> than<00:02:27.530> using

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
in a Wi-Fi hotspot rather than using

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.530 
in a Wi-Fi hotspot rather than using
your<00:02:28.070> data<00:02:28.280> connection<00:02:28.430> otherwise<00:02:29.240> it<00:02:29.480> will

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
your data connection otherwise it will

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.450 
your data connection otherwise it will
cost<00:02:29.750> quite<00:02:29.960> a<00:02:30.020> lot<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.260> money<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:31.310> other

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
cost quite a lot of money the other

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.850 
cost quite a lot of money the other
thing<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.760> although<00:02:32.120> these<00:02:32.450> maps<00:02:32.810> are<00:02:33.110> free

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
thing is although these maps are free

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.010 
thing is although these maps are free
apart<00:02:34.340> from<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.580> data<00:02:34.790> charges<00:02:35.240> if<00:02:35.540> you

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
apart from the data charges if you

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.980 
apart from the data charges if you
actually<00:02:36.260> want<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.709> navigate<00:02:37.630> you'll<00:02:38.630> need<00:02:38.840> to

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
actually want to navigate you'll need to
