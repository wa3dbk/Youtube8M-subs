stuff<00:01:33.710> that<00:01:33.740> I<00:01:33.890> drew<00:01:34.100> that<00:01:34.250> had<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.370> good<00:01:34.520> idea

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
stuff that I drew that had a good idea

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.180 
stuff that I drew that had a good idea

but they were poorly executed and I'd
redraw<00:01:37.610> them<00:01:53.470> thinking<00:01:54.470> making<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:54.890> story<00:01:55.160> of<00:01:55.310> a

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
redraw them thinking making a story of a

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.710
