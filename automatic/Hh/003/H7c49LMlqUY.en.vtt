00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.049 
electronics engineer is going to be
testing<00:00:13.019> some<00:00:13.049> speakers<00:00:13.799> he<00:00:13.980> found<00:00:14.280> that

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
testing some speakers he found that

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.910 
testing some speakers he found that
means<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.480> not<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.109> any<00:00:16.379> test<00:00:16.650> just

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
means it's not going to any test just

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.150 
means it's not going to any test just
one<00:00:16.980> speaker<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:18.390> three<00:00:18.930> speakers<00:00:19.439> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
recorder is usually recording my me

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.110 
recorder is usually recording my me
talking<00:01:01.859> when<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.160> these<00:01:02.430> videos<00:01:02.640> but

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
talking when I do these videos but

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.729 
talking when I do these videos but
obviously<00:01:03.690> I'm<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.930> gonna<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.229> able<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> use

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
obviously I'm not gonna be able to use

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.100 
obviously I'm not gonna be able to use
that<00:01:05.070> purpose<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.570> video<00:01:06.930> it's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
that purpose because in this video it's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.700 
that purpose because in this video it's
going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.470> playing<00:01:07.740> some<00:01:08.159> music<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:09.710> these

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
going to be playing some music and these

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.800 
going to be playing some music and these
are<00:01:10.920> three<00:01:11.280> sets<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.820> speakers<00:01:11.939> I'm<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.689> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
are three sets of speakers I'm going to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.230 
are three sets of speakers I'm going to
test<00:01:12.990> there's<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:14.130> speaker<00:01:14.760> from<00:01:14.939> each

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
test there's just one speaker from each

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.740 
test there's just one speaker from each
set<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:17.220> better<00:01:17.400> slot<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.060> going

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
set and the better slot which is going

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.999 
set and the better slot which is going
to<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> amplifying

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
to do the amplifying

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.399 
to do the amplifying
so<00:01:20.280> anyway<00:01:20.700> first<00:01:21.180> speaker<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.720> test<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.229> one

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
so anyway first speaker to test is one

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.350 
so anyway first speaker to test is one
of<00:01:22.500> these<00:01:22.619> weird<00:01:22.890> ones<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> two<00:01:23.970> voice

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of these weird ones with the two voice

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.960 
of these weird ones with the two voice
coils<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> two<00:01:25.110> magnets<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.759> see

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
coils and the two magnets as you can see

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.600 
coils and the two magnets as you can see
and<00:01:27.930> hopefully<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> camera<00:01:29.040> closer<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and hopefully with the camera closer to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.630 
and hopefully with the camera closer to
them<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.939> should<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.360> able<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> hear<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.400> if<00:01:32.400> not

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
them it should be able to hear it if not

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.980 
them it should be able to hear it if not
I'm<00:01:32.880> gonna<00:01:33.090> connect<00:01:33.540> these<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
I'm gonna connect these up to a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.569 
I'm gonna connect these up to a
different<00:01:34.290> amplifier<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.979> run<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> test

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
different amplifier and run the test

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.030 
different amplifier and run the test
again<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:35.970> anyway<00:01:36.409> let's<00:01:37.409> hear<00:01:37.650> how<00:01:37.829> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
again but anyway let's hear how this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:52.649 
again but anyway let's hear how this
speaker<00:01:38.460> sounds<00:01:38.909> first<00:01:39.900> from<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> front

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.749 

now<00:01:53.659> we'll<00:01:53.930> hear<00:01:54.259> how<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:54.979> sounds<00:01:55.399> from<00:01:55.549> the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
now we'll hear how it sounds from the

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:10.180 
now we'll hear how it sounds from the
back

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.750 

all<00:02:11.190> right<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.610> that's<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.000> Sony<00:02:12.890> dual<00:02:13.890> magnet

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
all right so that's the Sony dual magnet

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.440 
all right so that's the Sony dual magnet
and<00:02:14.910> voice<00:02:15.209> call<00:02:15.480> speaker<00:02:16.819> which<00:02:17.819> is<00:02:17.850> about<00:02:18.120> 8

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
and voice call speaker which is about 8

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.310 
and voice call speaker which is about 8
ohms

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.990 

now<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.380> next<00:02:22.740> speaker<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.280> test<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.760> this

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
now the next speaker in the test is this

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.449 
now the next speaker in the test is this
one<00:02:24.270> which<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.690> sharp<00:02:25.110> well<00:02:26.100> it's<00:02:26.190> got<00:02:26.310> some

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
one which is a sharp well it's got some

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.530 
one which is a sharp well it's got some
numbers<00:02:26.640> there<00:02:26.820> I'm<00:02:27.030> not<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.330> read<00:02:27.450> them

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
numbers there I'm not going to read them

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.370 
numbers there I'm not going to read them
all<00:02:27.690> out<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:28.920> one<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.550> 7<00:02:30.150> own<00:02:30.390> 12<00:02:31.050> watt

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
all out but this one is a 7 own 12 watt

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.500 
all out but this one is a 7 own 12 watt
speaker<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.100> I've<00:02:32.190> never<00:02:32.430> actually<00:02:32.670> seen<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:33.060> 7

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
speaker and I've never actually seen a 7

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.220 
speaker and I've never actually seen a 7
ohm<00:02:33.660> speaker<00:02:34.050> before<00:02:34.850> I've<00:02:35.850> seen<00:02:35.880> 8<00:02:36.209> ohms<00:02:36.480> 6

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
ohm speaker before I've seen 8 ohms 6

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.040 
ohm speaker before I've seen 8 ohms 6
ohms<00:02:37.530> for<00:02:37.770> OHS<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.280> even<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.910> 3<00:02:39.270> ohm<00:02:39.480> speaker

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
ohms for OHS and even a 3 ohm speaker

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.670 
ohms for OHS and even a 3 ohm speaker
but<00:02:40.200> never<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.500> 7<00:02:41.070> own<00:02:41.280> before<00:02:42.680> anything

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
but never a 7 own before anything

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.990 
but never a 7 own before anything
remember<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.370> one<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.640> ones<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:44.970> I

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
remember this is one of the ones that I

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.790 
remember this is one of the ones that I
caught<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> Jonas<00:02:45.900> Brother<00:02:46.140> speaker<00:02:46.620> because

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
caught a Jonas Brother speaker because

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.000 
caught a Jonas Brother speaker because
it<00:02:47.070> will<00:02:47.160> probably<00:02:47.459> sound<00:02:47.640> terrible<00:02:49.010> so

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
it will probably sound terrible so

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.850 
it will probably sound terrible so
anyway<00:02:50.489> just<00:02:52.610> connect<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.730> up<00:02:54.470> let's<00:02:55.470> see<00:02:55.650> how

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
anyway just connect it up let's see how

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:04.580 
anyway just connect it up let's see how
this<00:02:56.070> one<00:02:56.310> sounds<00:03:02.989> well<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.080> seems<00:03:04.260> there<00:03:04.440> will

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
this one sounds well it seems there will

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:17.729 
this one sounds well it seems there will
be<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.830> little<00:03:05.160> bit

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:28.209 

and<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.069> how<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.340> sounds<00:03:19.610> what<00:03:19.939> about<00:03:27.219> now

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:28.219 
and this is how it sounds what about now

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:29.709 
and this is how it sounds what about now
in<00:03:28.370> case<00:03:28.519> you're<00:03:28.670> wondering<00:03:28.849> why<00:03:29.329> I'm<00:03:29.510> using

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:29.719 
in case you're wondering why I'm using

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.929 
in case you're wondering why I'm using
such<00:03:30.109> weird<00:03:30.530> music<00:03:30.859> to<00:03:31.129> test<00:03:31.340> these<00:03:31.519> speakers

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
such weird music to test these speakers

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.119 
such weird music to test these speakers
with<00:03:32.150> it's<00:03:32.420> because<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:32.930> particular<00:03:33.439> song

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
with it's because that particular song

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.460 
with it's because that particular song
has<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.430> lot<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.670> bass<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.299> it<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:35.629> it's<00:03:36.260> from

has a lot of bass in it and it's from
one<00:03:36.650> of<00:03:36.680> my<00:03:36.859> games<00:03:37.099> so<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:38.060> know<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:38.239> shouldn't

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
one of my games so you know I shouldn't

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.140 
one of my games so you know I shouldn't
get<00:03:38.720> nads<00:03:39.079> by<00:03:39.349> wmg<00:03:40.250> or<00:03:40.400> anything<00:03:40.730> stupid<00:03:40.970> like

get nads by wmg or anything stupid like

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:50.740 
get nads by wmg or anything stupid like
that<00:03:47.349> in<00:03:48.349> any<00:03:48.470> way<00:03:48.680> now<00:03:49.239> let's<00:03:50.239> test<00:03:50.480> one<00:03:50.720> of

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
that in any way now let's test one of

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.720 
that in any way now let's test one of
these<00:03:50.959> weird<00:03:51.349> things<00:03:51.739> out<00:03:52.450> okay<00:03:53.450> there<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.019> is

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
these weird things out okay there it is

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.830 
these weird things out okay there it is
connected<00:03:55.730> up<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:56.000> what<00:03:56.150> would<00:03:56.299> be<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.480> best

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
connected up and what would be the best

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.589 
connected up and what would be the best
way<00:03:57.079> to<00:03:57.109> show<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:57.739> one<00:03:57.980> like<00:03:58.370> that<00:03:58.579> or<00:03:59.540> like

way to show this one like that or like
this<00:04:01.780> now<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:02.959> one<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.500> a<00:04:03.530> horn<00:04:03.889> loaded

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
this now this one is a horn loaded

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.099 
this now this one is a horn loaded
speaker<00:04:04.879> as<00:04:05.299> you<00:04:05.419> can<00:04:05.569> see<00:04:05.750> there's<00:04:05.989> the

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
speaker as you can see there's the

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.170 
speaker as you can see there's the
speaker<00:04:06.379> driver<00:04:06.709> right<00:04:06.980> at<00:04:07.159> the<00:04:07.220> back<00:04:10.180> so

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
speaker driver right at the back so

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:40.410 
speaker driver right at the back so
let's<00:04:11.389> see<00:04:11.569> how<00:04:11.840> this<00:04:12.049> one<00:04:12.290> sounds

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:52.860 

and<00:04:41.420> here<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.720> is<00:04:41.900> how<00:04:42.470> it<00:04:42.530> sounds<00:04:42.770> from<00:04:43.010> there

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.900 

well<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.140> certainly<00:04:54.500> is<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:54.890> loudest<00:04:55.730> of

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
well that certainly is the loudest of

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.030 
well that certainly is the loudest of
the<00:04:56.030> three<00:04:56.270> speakers<00:04:56.570> so<00:04:57.470> what<00:04:57.590> I'm<00:04:57.680> gonna<00:04:57.830> do

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
the three speakers so what I'm gonna do

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.040 
the three speakers so what I'm gonna do
now<00:04:58.220> is<00:04:58.250> just<00:04:58.850> shut<00:04:59.180> up<00:04:59.360> and<00:04:59.540> let<00:04:59.690> you<00:04:59.840> hear<00:05:00.020> the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
now is just shut up and let you hear the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.930 
now is just shut up and let you hear the
three<00:05:00.380> speakers<00:05:00.710> one<00:05:01.400> after<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:01.910> other

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
three speakers one after the other

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.020 
three speakers one after the other
without<00:05:02.420> a<00:05:02.660> pause
