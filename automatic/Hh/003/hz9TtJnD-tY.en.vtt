00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.420
 that there are cules speak to them lion hunter now I decided to do a second part of 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.580
 a video I'm telling 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.520
 about the worst megaman game jajajajajajajaj obvious you already know that is the 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.949
 x7 well then put on your comforts go down to the music 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.500
 very well let's start in the mega man x7 there are several things that the game has and 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.539
 that I did not say in my previous video so now I'm going to tell you but before 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.820
 to start if someone likes the x7 better close the video since almost everything 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.109
 is to break the mother to this game 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.450
 for example I do not know if they have been fixed but the click but zero 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.490
 it looks like a giant banana I do not know if it's like that because of that fucked up 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.980
 they also lacked a classic thing in mega mans I'm talking about those 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.390
 little things what else before reaching a boss in the x7 also appears the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.809
 motorcycle but the excuse is that you can not accelerate because on the fucking level 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.770
 you just have to be picking up some bombs on the floor and rescuing 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.490
 the damn little monkeys fuck what they thought the capcom 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.960
 it is assumed that from the x2 when you took the motorcycle you could accelerate up 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.280
 the infinite prick and apart what you had to do was to dodge 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.160
 obstacles 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.450
 in x 4 and x5 those motorcycle levels were also very good 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.530
 also another thing that makes me very shit about this game was that he just 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.310
 you can get a fucking armor for x 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.520
 what mother are those 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.960
 if in the previous you could get up to 3 armors 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.610
 also counting the black hill 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.260
 there's an ending aside when you finish it with zero 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.580
 saleh that x betrayed 0 and kills him 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.820
 but I do not know maybe that's the only interesting part of the game 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.580
 since the endings with x and axel are shit 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.540
 also that is that bullshit that do not leave the last avoid mori the black 0 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.980
 if putting those armors was already a tradition if even in the damn x8 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.960
 come out those armors do not improve also it is assumed that the mega man will be 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.590
 remembered for having the best music and in the x7 almost all are 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.450
 good caracas 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.940
 Well I only like two of when you choose level and when you fight 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.350
 against the first sign sea 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.350
 I also think that they removed some agility from the characters because if 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.280
 you climb a wall and use the button to sweep tetu you'll think that obvious is going to 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.569
 climb faster but they never arrive what happens is that the character gets stuck and 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.069
 rise more slowly hahahahahahahaha 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.480
 they also forgot a little detail what a mess of dynamo 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.480
 that fucking steal that you jod and the mother in x5 and x6 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.829
 no handling that gave him pinchetti rubbing or why fucked no longer comes out 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.669
 also the screen to choose levels has done to the urbÃ³n because 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.239
 it's just a tea circle and you have to wait for the whole whore to turn to 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.260
 to be able to choose the boss that you want to split the mother 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.090
 although the simple principle is going to leave you because when you start 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.970
 the characters are very weak and you drop them a shit and they lower you a 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.769
 rebound there are also some bosses that desperate you as the fire does not 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.200
 agreement what it's called but it was like a hyena 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.190
 that damned one is one of the most bastards to kill him since he's like up a 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.730
 horse dt and has some clones that in the spare time he uses them to 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.439
 fuck 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.200
 the only thing that I liked is the part where you play with zero and that these in the 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.529
 highway where you get the bumblebees 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.290
 I think that's the only good thing about the fucking fucking game also the 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.719
 graphics are very screwed to be pla and 2 are very square and 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.020
 aside the characters have no face and are very young 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.650
 another character who did not know what happened to him was one out in the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.389
 previous mega man games 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.449
 called dukla be still appealed green in my opinion this game 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.409
 would have been better if they had done it in 2d like the previous ones 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.209
 I think that for the moment that's all I'll say about this fucking game like that 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.639
 is that until the next culeros and put in 5 estrellitas kg sagessa 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.159
 waterfalls
