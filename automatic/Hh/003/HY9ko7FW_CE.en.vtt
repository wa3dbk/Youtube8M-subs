00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.780 
that is a bit difficult to show on
pictures<00:00:30.329> so<00:00:31.320> I've<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.500> made<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> small<00:00:32.309> video

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
pictures so I've just made a small video

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.700 
pictures so I've just made a small video

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.900 
helps and thanks right so here's the
fabric<00:00:50.429> for<00:00:51.120> your<00:00:51.239> harem<00:00:51.690> pants<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.579> it<00:00:53.579> I've

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
fabric for your harem pants and it I've

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.419 
fabric for your harem pants and it I've
just<00:00:54.210> drawn<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.749> the<00:00:55.379> marks<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.859> are<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
just drawn the the marks that are on the

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:02.840 
just drawn the the marks that are on the
pattern<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:56.969> well<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.699> 1<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.089> 2<00:01:00.719> B<00:01:01.850> 1

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
pattern as well so this is a 1 a 2 B 1

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.850 
pattern as well so this is a 1 a 2 B 1
and<00:01:03.179> B<00:01:03.210> 2<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.860> those<00:01:05.040> are<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:07.380> pieces

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and B 2 and those are the the pieces

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.770 
and B 2 and those are the the pieces
that<00:01:08.070> we're<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.490> put<00:01:08.700> together<00:01:08.880> we're

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
that we're going to put together we're

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.390 
that we're going to put together we're
going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.020> pretend<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.010> right

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
going to pretend that this is the right

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.220 
going to pretend that this is the right
the<00:01:12.240> right<00:01:12.420> side<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> fabric<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.200> what<00:01:16.200> I

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
the right side of the fabric so what I

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.140 
the right side of the fabric so what I
want<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.190> do<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.490> take<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.940> 1<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.890> fold<00:01:19.890> it

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
want you to do is take a 1 and fold it

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.460 
want you to do is take a 1 and fold it
so<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.270> fits<00:01:22.220> with<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> 2<00:01:23.630> it's<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
so it fits with a 2 it's kind of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.100 
so it fits with a 2 it's kind of
difficult<00:01:26.010> but<00:01:26.400> you'll<00:01:27.300> probably<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.960> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
difficult but you'll probably get it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.160 
difficult but you'll probably get it
right<00:01:29.780> or<00:01:30.780> whatever<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.690> is<00:01:33.870> how<00:01:34.050> it

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
right or whatever so this is how it

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.310 
right or whatever so this is how it
should<00:01:34.380> look<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.980> see<00:01:35.130> all<00:01:35.310> this

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
should look and if you see all this

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.800 
should look and if you see all this
wrinkly<00:01:37.320> stuff<00:01:37.710> don't<00:01:38.040> mind<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.690> it'll<00:01:39.690> be

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
wrinkly stuff don't mind that it'll be

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.470 
wrinkly stuff don't mind that it'll be
better<00:01:39.840> when<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.440> all<00:01:40.650> pinned<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.100> sew<00:01:41.480> so

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
better when it's all pinned and sew so

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.410 
better when it's all pinned and sew so
here<00:01:43.290> we're<00:01:43.410> going<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> pin<00:01:43.800> this<00:01:47.270> ok<00:01:48.270> I'm<00:01:48.360> just

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
here we're going to pin this ok I'm just

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.980 
here we're going to pin this ok I'm just
going<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:48.780> pretend<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.230> I'm<00:01:49.470> sewing<00:01:50.060> sew<00:01:51.060> sew

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
going to pretend that I'm sewing sew sew

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.960 
going to pretend that I'm sewing sew sew

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.510 

and<00:02:01.970> this<00:02:02.390> is<00:02:02.510> where<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.870> also<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.560> then<00:02:04.370> we

and this is where you also and then we

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.290 
and this is where you also and then we
have<00:02:05.920> b1<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.250> b2

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
could make the marks on the wrong side

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.460 
could make the marks on the wrong side
of<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.840> fabric<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:21.050> where<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.320> put
