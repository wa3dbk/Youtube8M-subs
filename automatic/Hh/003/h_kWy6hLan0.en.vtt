00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
could be screwed up to the boat as we're

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.280 
could be screwed up to the boat as we're
doing<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:04.830> now<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> fiberglass<00:01:07.049> boat

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
doing here now or on a fiberglass boat

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.770 
doing here now or on a fiberglass boat
is<00:01:07.439> recommended<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.220> put<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.820> sandwich<00:01:09.390> of

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
is recommended that we put a sandwich of

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.250 
is recommended that we put a sandwich of
wood<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.470> behind<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.010> bit<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> marine<00:01:11.490> ply<00:01:12.260> these

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
wood in behind a bit of marine ply these

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.320 
wood in behind a bit of marine ply these
need<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.619> nice<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.979> tight<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:15.150> it

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
need to be nice and tight so that it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.070 
need to be nice and tight so that it
doesn't<00:01:15.479> Rock<00:01:16.070> when<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.340> use<00:01:17.780> as<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.930> can

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
doesn't Rock when it's in use as you can

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.950 
doesn't Rock when it's in use as you can
see<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.619> very<00:01:20.280> firm<00:01:20.700> we've<00:01:21.450> got<00:01:21.600> spring

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
see this is very firm we've got spring

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.160 
see this is very firm we've got spring
bolts<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:23.250> hold<00:01:23.280> everything<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.939> place<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.479> we

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
bolts to hold everything in place so we

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.399 
bolts to hold everything in place so we
open<00:01:25.380> those<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.689> is

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.780 

books<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.400> set<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.619> onto<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.340> brackets

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
books and set this one onto the brackets

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:44.570 
books and set this one onto the brackets
that<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:37.130> goes<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.369> there<00:01:38.549> so

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.940 

and<00:01:45.580> they<00:01:45.700> just<00:01:45.880> spring<00:01:46.240> into<00:01:46.420> place<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:46.990> then

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
and they just spring into place and then

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.460 
and they just spring into place and then
the<00:01:48.159> two<00:01:48.720> extra<00:01:49.720> brackets<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:51.490> spring<00:01:51.940> box

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the two extra brackets one spring box

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.370 
the two extra brackets one spring box
they<00:01:53.470> hold<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.890> in<00:01:53.979> place<00:01:54.869> when<00:01:55.869> this<00:01:56.050> is<00:01:56.200> not

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
they hold it in place when this is not

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.680 
they hold it in place when this is not
actually<00:01:56.770> in<00:01:56.800> use<00:01:57.159> all<00:01:58.030> which<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.479> was

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
actually in use all which it was

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.730 
actually in use all which it was
released<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.260> to<00:01:59.470> front<00:01:59.830> catches<00:02:00.310> like<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
released of to front catches like so and

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.980 
released of to front catches like so and
then<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.070> all<00:02:03.250> tilts<00:02:03.670> down<00:02:03.759> into<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.270> boat<00:02:04.450> so

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
then it all tilts down into the boat so

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.719 
then it all tilts down into the boat so
it's<00:02:05.560> inside<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.100> gun<00:02:06.250> well<00:02:06.400> that<00:02:06.490> can't

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
it's inside the gun well that can't

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.389 
it's inside the gun well that can't
catch<00:02:06.970> on<00:02:07.150> anything<00:02:07.180> had<00:02:07.509> you<00:02:07.630> come<00:02:07.810> into<00:02:07.960> port

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
catch on anything had you come into port

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.310 
catch on anything had you come into port
so<00:02:09.399> it's<00:02:09.520> as<00:02:09.610> simple<00:02:09.640> as<00:02:10.060> literally<00:02:10.929> lifting

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
so it's as simple as literally lifting

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.240 
so it's as simple as literally lifting
this<00:02:11.470> up<00:02:11.820> bring<00:02:12.820> that<00:02:12.940> one<00:02:13.060> into<00:02:13.270> place<00:02:14.250> bring

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
this up bring that one into place bring

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.360 
this up bring that one into place bring
that<00:02:15.370> into<00:02:15.730> place<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.900> then<00:02:17.050> that's<00:02:17.230> nice<00:02:18.190> and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.150 
bracket three two one the next stage is
to<00:02:25.590> put<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:27.090> overhead<00:02:28.090> gantry<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:28.890> which<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:30.130> a

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
to put the overhead gantry in which is a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.630 
to put the overhead gantry in which is a
foot<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.540> stabilize<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.440> deck<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
foot to stabilize it on the deck and the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.509 
foot to stabilize it on the deck and the
bottom<00:02:34.269> pole<00:02:34.570> which<00:02:35.380> goes<00:02:35.590> through<00:02:35.620> an

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
bottom pole which goes through an

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.670 
bottom pole which goes through an
adjustable<00:02:37.000> brackets<00:02:37.450> which<00:02:38.170> can<00:02:38.350> be<00:02:38.440> set<00:02:38.650> up

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
adjustable brackets which can be set up

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.500 
adjustable brackets which can be set up
either<00:02:39.010> side<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.640> stripper<00:02:39.910> either<00:02:40.209> to

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
either side of the stripper either to

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.630 
either side of the stripper either to
the<00:02:40.600> right<00:02:40.630> or<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.140> left<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:42.190> what<00:02:42.340> we<00:02:42.489> do

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
the right or to the left so what we do

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.890 
the right or to the left so what we do
is<00:02:42.850> we<00:02:42.970> set<00:02:43.209> this<00:02:43.360> one<00:02:43.800> pinch<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:46.480> then<00:02:46.660> drop

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
is we set this one pinch and then drop

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.880 
is we set this one pinch and then drop
the<00:02:47.019> leg<00:02:47.200> through<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.930> floor<00:02:50.170> this<00:02:50.709> one

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
the leg through to the floor this one

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.420 
the leg through to the floor this one
then<00:02:51.070> goes<00:02:51.250> on<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.670> bottom<00:02:53.220> all<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.340> way

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
then goes on to the bottom all the way

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.810 
then goes on to the bottom all the way
down<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.750> floor<00:02:55.870> like<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:56.739> what<00:02:57.670> we<00:02:57.790> then

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
down to the floor like so what we then

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.750 
down to the floor like so what we then
do<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.360> just<00:02:58.450> take<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.140> screen<00:02:59.459> like<00:03:00.459> so

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
do is you just take the screen like so

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.930 
do is you just take the screen like so
and<00:03:01.060> then<00:03:01.810> tighten<00:03:02.230> that<00:03:02.350> one<00:03:02.410> up<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.760> that

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
and then tighten that one up and that

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.630 
and then tighten that one up and that
will<00:03:04.030> then<00:03:04.180> keep<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.600> stable<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:06.310> overhead

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
will then keep it stable the overhead

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.509 
will then keep it stable the overhead
gantry<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:08.560> is<00:03:08.709> this<00:03:08.860> one<00:03:09.040> with<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.310> two

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
gantry this is this one with the two

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.229 
gantry this is this one with the two
pulleys<00:03:09.959> this<00:03:10.959> swivels<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.000> line

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
pulleys this swivels so that the line

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.210 
pulleys this swivels so that the line
coming<00:03:14.019> up<00:03:14.140> from<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.440> girl<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.769> were<00:03:14.920> when<00:03:15.070> we

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
coming up from the girl you were when we

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.280 
coming up from the girl you were when we
pit<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.579> will<00:03:16.180> always<00:03:16.360> align<00:03:16.810> with<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.110> two

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
pit it will always align with the two

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.050 
pit it will always align with the two
pulleys<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:18.670> this<00:03:18.850> one<00:03:19.060> slots<00:03:19.450> over<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.380> top

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.740 

and<00:03:24.060> pinched<00:03:24.659> up<00:03:26.269> there<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:28.680> one<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.750> fully

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
and pinched up there this one is fully

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.920 
and pinched up there this one is fully
adjustable<00:03:31.430> what<00:03:32.430> we<00:03:32.579> then<00:03:32.760> do<00:03:33.000> we<00:03:33.360> attach<00:03:33.659> the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
adjustable what we then do we attach the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:46.699 
adjustable what we then do we attach the
girlie<00:03:34.140> wheel<00:03:34.439> on<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.610> side

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.900 

again<00:03:47.340> true<00:03:48.299> that

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.850 

and<00:03:51.270> then<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:51.540> could<00:03:51.750> be<00:03:51.810> adjusted<00:03:52.110> in<00:03:52.680> an

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
and then this could be adjusted in an

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.400 
and then this could be adjusted in an
act<00:03:53.240> so<00:03:54.240> that<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.450> lying<00:03:54.720> coming<00:03:55.020> over<00:03:55.320> the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
act so that the lying coming over the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.520 
act so that the lying coming over the
top<00:03:55.620> comes<00:03:55.980> down<00:03:56.190> through<00:03:56.960> we<00:03:57.960> now<00:03:58.230> have<00:03:58.500> a

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
top comes down through we now have a

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.260 
top comes down through we now have a
Gideon<00:03:58.890> bar<00:03:59.160> which<00:03:59.460> is<00:03:59.610> adjustable<00:04:00.030> as<00:04:00.240> well

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
Gideon bar which is adjustable as well

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.080 
Gideon bar which is adjustable as well
so<00:04:00.660> we<00:04:00.810> can<00:04:00.840> follow<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.410> line<00:04:01.850> that<00:04:02.850> one<00:04:02.940> can

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
so we can follow the line that one can

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.210 
so we can follow the line that one can
be<00:04:03.150> locked<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.540> place<00:04:03.780> if<00:04:03.930> necessary<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:05.070> then

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
be locked in place if necessary and then

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.490 
be locked in place if necessary and then
this<00:04:05.340> one<00:04:05.550> blocks<00:04:05.850> up<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.900> make<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.080> all<00:04:07.320> nice

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
this one blocks up to make it all nice

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.450 
this one blocks up to make it all nice
and<00:04:07.530> firm<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:09.510> that's<00:04:10.010> that's<00:04:11.010> where<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
and firm and that's that's where the

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.880 
and firm and that's that's where the
overhead<00:04:11.670> gantry<00:04:12.180> then<00:04:12.360> lines<00:04:13.230> up<00:04:13.470> with<00:04:13.650> there

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
overhead gantry then lines up with there

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.370 
overhead gantry then lines up with there
so<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.000> lines<00:04:15.330> coming<00:04:15.660> straight<00:04:15.900> down<00:04:15.960> into

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
so the lines coming straight down into

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.270 
so the lines coming straight down into
the<00:04:16.560> wheel<00:04:17.540> what<00:04:18.560> now<00:04:19.560> we<00:04:19.620> have<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:19.980> Gertie

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
the wheel what now we have the Gertie

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.380 
the wheel what now we have the Gertie
wheel<00:04:20.430> in<00:04:20.610> place<00:04:20.670> and<00:04:21.800> the<00:04:22.800> line<00:04:23.120> over<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.240> two

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
wheel in place and the line over the two

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.030 
wheel in place and the line over the two
pulleys<00:04:24.690> coming<00:04:25.260> back<00:04:25.440> down<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.890> this

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
pulleys coming back down to this

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.740 
pulleys coming back down to this
stripper<00:04:26.960> we<00:04:27.960> can<00:04:28.110> now<00:04:28.260> align<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.770> Gideon<00:04:29.070> bar

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
stripper we can now align the Gideon bar

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.870 
stripper we can now align the Gideon bar
so<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.130> so<00:04:32.130> it's<00:04:32.280> running<00:04:32.460> straight

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
so that the so it's running straight

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.580 
so that the so it's running straight
through<00:04:32.940> as<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:33.840> see<00:04:34.050> there<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:36.060> then<00:04:36.590> to

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
through as you see there and then to

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.540 
through as you see there and then to
accommodate<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:39.450> more<00:04:39.930> hooks<00:04:40.230> what<00:04:41.160> we<00:04:41.280> do<00:04:41.430> is

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
accommodate the more hooks what we do is

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.860 
accommodate the more hooks what we do is
we<00:04:41.670> raise<00:04:41.910> this<00:04:42.330> mast<00:04:42.680> up<00:04:44.270> lift<00:04:45.270> me<00:04:45.360> what<00:04:45.630> to

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
we raise this mast up lift me what to

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.850 
we raise this mast up lift me what to
take<00:04:46.790> up<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:48.030> 20<00:04:48.450> hooks<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:49.350> then<00:04:49.620> that's

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
take up to 20 hooks and then that's

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.910 
take up to 20 hooks and then that's
locked<00:04:50.130> off<00:04:50.390> like<00:04:51.390> so

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.310 

this<00:04:55.520> system<00:04:55.970> can<00:04:56.150> be<00:04:56.300> mounted<00:04:56.450> either<00:04:56.780> say<00:04:57.050> on

this system can be mounted either say on
either<00:04:57.890> side<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:58.280> have<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.700> wheel<00:04:58.910> on<00:04:59.240> this

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
either side you have the wheel on this

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.440 
either side you have the wheel on this
side<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.950> gantry<00:05:01.340> on<00:05:01.610> this<00:05:01.850> side<00:05:02.120> and

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
side and the gantry on this side and

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.960 
side and the gantry on this side and
that<00:05:03.260> will<00:05:03.530> then<00:05:03.770> swivel<00:05:04.100> around<00:05:04.310> to

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
that will then swivel around to

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.050 
that will then swivel around to
accommodate<00:05:07.720> once<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.870> weight<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.290> on<00:05:09.440> the

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
accommodate once the weight is on the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.390 
accommodate once the weight is on the
liners<00:05:11.230> then<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:14.720> importance<00:05:15.220> of<00:05:16.220> this

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
liners then the importance of this

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.110 
liners then the importance of this
system<00:05:16.910> is<00:05:17.300> that<00:05:17.540> it<00:05:18.470> stops<00:05:18.800> going<00:05:19.190> across<00:05:19.880> the

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
system is that it stops going across the

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.230 
system is that it stops going across the
boat<00:05:20.300> to<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.020> conventional<00:05:21.940> outrigger<00:05:22.940> and

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
boat to the conventional outrigger and

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.510 
boat to the conventional outrigger and
it<00:05:24.050> means<00:05:24.230> that<00:05:24.380> you're<00:05:24.560> free<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:25.160> actually

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
it means that you're free to actually

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.080 
it means that you're free to actually
walk<00:05:25.730> around<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.720> system<00:05:27.140> and<00:05:27.800> if<00:05:28.490> necessary

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
walk around the system and if necessary

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.660 
walk around the system and if necessary
you<00:05:29.450> could<00:05:29.720> mount<00:05:29.980> exactly<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.070> same<00:05:31.280> system

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
you could mount exactly the same system

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.490 
you could mount exactly the same system
on<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:31.910> other<00:05:31.970> side<00:05:32.270> of<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.510> boat<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:32.990> have

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
on the other side of the boat and have

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.410 
on the other side of the boat and have
two<00:05:33.770> operators<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:36.530> safety<00:05:36.980> aspect<00:05:37.420> we

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
two operators and the safety aspect we

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.710 
two operators and the safety aspect we
feel<00:05:38.660> is<00:05:38.840> very<00:05:39.170> important
