00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello everyone with you vladimir in actors and 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.780
 This video on Russian drafts 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:17.100
 100 juicy etudes and this is youtube number 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:21.029
 one came up with this German m 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:25.830
 position we came up with this stash st this 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.560
 master see white dunkin ac3 f8 and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.429
 white checker on 5 and also two black 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.829
 shashkin 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.829
 already the 3rd already 2 white tasks to win 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.540
 scientists how is achieved with it 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.950
 thought that the flowers and I alone 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.690
 to win the cup you're wrong 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 since as many as two knives one white beat and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.239
 black lady becomes central 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.090
 the line where you canâ€™t catch it 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.090
 correct journey 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.979
 manages to make a draw 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.040
 how to fight against these two cups 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.240
 such a position can be often 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.540
 been with someone or similar 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.840
 need to play f8 on d6 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.970
 thus h2 move alone becomes 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:31.340
 We died because after the white 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.340
 sit checker we observe that 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:40.280
 the center line is white and they have three 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.860
 Danky more precisely two tanks and saber but its 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.170
 easy to hold at the dam without losing 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.940
 center line 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.150
 that is, the triangle of Petrov will be 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:56.650
 done or you catch 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:02:03.619
 in other ways so once again set 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:05.869
 here we attacked 8 to 6 we reviewed sh2 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:13.540
 greedy is a bad option 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:13.540
 is also on March 2 when the white go at least 8 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.080
 Now we see that black 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.540
 there are few options such as 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:31.970
 option as in two knives one here leads 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.640
 straight to picking yes but first it 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.549
 can be called tetanus 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.600
 because after giving it will 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:45.140
 locking that is to walk in this 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:49.580
 situations black goes nowhere in even 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.519
 one bad move let's consider h21 in 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.080
 such a position 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:58.459
 then whites play 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:03.290
 that move which we reviewed earlier c31 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.970
 but with this course you can go black 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.570
 h2 only 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:13.340
 and having eaten a piece, Black cannot occupy 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:18.459
 center line because checkers dame 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:22.790
 would 8 interfere takes this line double 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.930
 so you have to retreat and you can 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.450
 calmly occupy 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:32.090
 center line and lead sasha in 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.290
 ladies and there will already be a triangle 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:39.180
 Petrova 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.519
 It turns out in such a position in black 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.769
 Well, one entrance 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:47.340
 it go from 2 to 1 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:52.340
 but he, too, remember on since white 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:55.650
 would play 87 and after the exchange 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:01.230
 scientists there is only one move as many as two 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.950
 knife day but they are immediately caught like this 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.379
 this etude is solved 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.519
 here thanks for your attention with you 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.519
