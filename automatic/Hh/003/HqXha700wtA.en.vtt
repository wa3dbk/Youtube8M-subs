says<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> big<00:00:37.290> reason<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.070> is

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
says that the big reason for this is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.100 
says that the big reason for this is
that<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.700> want<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.120> make<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.480> game<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.079> best

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that they want to make the game the best

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.010 
that they want to make the game the best
they<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.489> not<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> lot<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.090> bugs<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.899> know

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
they can so not a lot of bugs you know

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.990 
they can so not a lot of bugs you know
that's<00:00:43.320> why<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:43.680> delayed<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.309> from<00:00:44.579> spring

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
that's why they delayed it from spring

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.660 
that's why they delayed it from spring
to<00:00:45.239> sep<00:00:45.930> tember<00:00:46.110> 27<00:00:46.649> theme<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.370> they<00:00:47.489> also

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to sep tember 27 theme but they also

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.389 
to sep tember 27 theme but they also
said<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.480> delay<00:00:48.870> has<00:00:49.350> nothing<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.160> do

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
said that the delay has nothing to do

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.959 
said that the delay has nothing to do
with<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> release<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.770> next-gen<00:00:52.770> console<00:00:53.640> so

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
with a release on a next-gen console so

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.900 
with a release on a next-gen console so
does<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.510> mean<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:55.050> GTA<00:00:55.680> 5<00:00:55.949> will<00:00:56.370> not<00:00:56.670> be

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
does this mean that GTA 5 will not be

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.330 
does this mean that GTA 5 will not be
released<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.780> PlayStation<00:00:58.469> 4<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.190> new

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.080 
xbox and why is GTA 5 not being released
on<00:01:03.359> pc<00:01:04.040> Rockstar<00:01:05.040> Games<00:01:05.159> makes<00:01:05.580> their<00:01:05.790> games

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
on pc Rockstar Games makes their games

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.350 
on pc Rockstar Games makes their games
on<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.960> PlayStation<00:01:07.140> 3<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.340> xbox<00:01:08.760> 360

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
on the PlayStation 3 and the xbox 360

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.200 
on the PlayStation 3 and the xbox 360
and<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:10.020> always<00:01:10.229> release<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.220> pc<00:01:11.640> version<00:01:11.670> a

and they always release the pc version a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.810 
and they always release the pc version a
few<00:01:12.600> months<00:01:12.750> later<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.830> GTA<00:01:14.280> 5<00:01:14.549> will

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
few months later so GTA 5 will

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.120

definitely be release on a pc sometime

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.710 
definitely be release on a pc sometime
but<00:01:17.939> not<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.110> September<00:01:19.710> 217<00:01:20.720> we

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
but not just on the September 217 we

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.510 
but not just on the September 217 we
think<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.200> grand<00:01:22.560> theft<00:01:22.650> auto<00:01:22.830> 5<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:23.369> get
