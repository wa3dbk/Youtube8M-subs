 watch tv surf the internet the worst with a 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.660
 friend on the phone 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.850
 for us are everyday activities and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.860
 all have one point in common are 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.940
 possible thanks to the power of technology 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.630
 from the satellite 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.480
 iss operates one of the largest fleets of 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.430
 the world satellites and employs more than a thousand 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.440
 professionals scattered around the globe 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.880
 today satellite communication is a 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.619
 central element in the sector of 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.020
 rapidly expanding communications 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.110
 by europe north america america 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.120
 Latin Africa and Asia for example 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.970
 growing demand for high-end TVs 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.220
 definition and pay tv in asia multiplied 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.950
 the need for satellite coverage 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.860
 however few people fully recognize 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.019
 the complexity of the satellite and the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 committed to building and launching 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.860
 put into operation 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.020
 When building a satellite, ss collaborates 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.720
 intimately with their partners I cried 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.180
 selected as Austria 1 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.549
 French all stages of construction 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.979
 require an incredibly high level of 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.200
 attention and precision because after launch 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.830
 a satellite in space there is no way to 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.810
 to repair it a crucial phase of construction 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.090
 is the coupling of the 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.330
 communication and service because it is 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.979
 that the satellite begins to take shape 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.929
 when this communication module 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.460
 high above the service module to be 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.920
 mounted in the middle we will check 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.050
 visually there is no shock or problem 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.940
 to make sure everything is 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.979
 in order because then he needs 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.080
 for 15 years and we can not 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.670
 to go into orbit to fix a car 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.130
 nothing understands 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.319
 we have to be very careful on land and 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.929
 we tested everything to make sure that 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.780
 everything is in order all the components 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.780
 necessary for the operation of the satellite are 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.479
 double if a system fails in space or 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.550
 reserve will be triggered this is the only 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.149
 way to ensure that the satellite that 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.880
 15 years on end in the last phase of the 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.369
 building a lot bells before the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.770
 vital antennas before launching the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.680
 and check if 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.020
 carefully each of your details 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.480
 for six months only this way you can 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.760
 that the satellite will comply with the 15 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.010
 following years the functions for which it was 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.920
 created thanks to a technology of last 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.069
 the high performance satellite of the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.050
 ss broadcast hundreds of tv channels 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.270
 for an entire continent and the scope 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.670
 of this satellite is contributing to 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.250
 connect people to we have more points 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.750
 and to achieve communications 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.760
 reliable global 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.470
 from the satellite to the location of the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.580
 launch requires enormous effort 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.260
 logistic once there begins the most 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.280
 of the process, the launching of the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.410
 rocket the person responsible for placing 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.250
 the satellite in the space with 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.170
 martin hhaway the technology director of 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.420
 ss and his team we have is to 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.220
 thermal state of the satellite check 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.110
 temperatures are correct 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.700
 batteries in all tanks. 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.830
 technical components of the interior of the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.900
 also check that the batteries 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.489
 are loaded and ready 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.530
 for launch to achieve a 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.080
 flawless launch you need to perform 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.209
 perfectly all the technical steps to 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.190
 journey to the launch pad is 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.440
 a stupid show and an operation 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.510
 It takes one hour to win two 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.519
 miles with the rocket and its 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.620
 vacancy on the platform may be 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.200
 finally begin preparations for 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.069
 the countdown is missing 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.630
 eight hours before launch 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.610
 my colleagues are in another building 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.720
 working to set up the satellite and 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.700
 monitor and test everything to have the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.550
 sure that everything is ready 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.130
 the voltage will slow when the satellite 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.739
 separate from the rocket launcher and when 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.350
 we see that the work is correct and 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.329
 will disappear every now and then 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.459
 satellite signal what should happen 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.370
 15 minutes after separation 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.650
 launch is a quasi-momentum. 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.519
 inconceivable 30 million horses of 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.739
 force equal to 40 airbus engines 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:16.400
 a380 and takes the rocket to the centuries 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.680
 through the planet to ss administrate 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.650
 four operations centers from which 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.630
 satellites are controlled and operated on 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.550
 main function is to monitor with 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.860
 accurate all transmitted data 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.860
 for the satellite and for the satellite 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.750
 remain in geostationary orbit 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.580
 geostationary orbit is one in which the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.890
 satellite travels at the same speed 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.289
 The result is that the 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.150
 appears to be in a fixed position 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.440
 the screen mounted on the wall of your 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.690
 home so to speak 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.529
 it is thanks to this that you receive your 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.929
 Software 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.569
 here our task is to ensure that the 

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:52.999
 position in this position if the 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:55.369
 satellite moves one tenth of a degree 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:57.709
 which is maybe the customers miss a 

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:59.749
 signal to ensure that the satellite is 

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:02.239
 in the correct location the drivers 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:04.909
 monitor more than 15,000 values ​​per 

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:06.709
 minute of each satellite every day of 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.079
 January to December the engineers 

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:11.899
 need to act immediately whenever 

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:14.659
 these values ​​go beyond the acceptable range 

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:16.639
 Today it transmits more than 5 thousand 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:17.209
 tv shows for world markets 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.969
 all 

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:21.859
 more than any other teacher 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:24.889
 network operation center team 

00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:26.689
 ss digital in luxembourg responds 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.379
 for monitoring the quality of 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:29.419
 Software 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.939
 they check all tv signals 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.189
 transmitted to the satellite and from there 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:36.679
 transmitted to land and ensure that 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:41.029
 signal reliability never falls 

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:43.699
 below 99.99 97% 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:45.949
 modern satellite technology is the 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.709
 more reliable and cost effective 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:51.889

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:58.489
 effectively activating connections 

00:05:56.179 --> 00:06:00.949
 anywhere from any point to any 

00:05:58.489 --> 00:06:03.529
 moment the satellites are perfect channel 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.249
 to transmit huge volumes of data
