relatively slow the 1401 is was the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.279 
relatively slow the 1401 is was the

IBM was the course the leader in that

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.639 
IBM was the course the leader in that
area<00:01:56.330> I'm<00:01:56.869> not<00:01:56.899> kidding<00:01:57.320> you<00:01:57.380> there<00:01:57.530> was<00:01:57.619> a

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
area I'm not kidding you there was a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.620 
area I'm not kidding you there was a
tremendous<00:01:58.340> excitement<00:01:58.729> going<00:01:59.119> on<00:01:59.420> I<00:01:59.600> mean

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
tremendous excitement going on I mean

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.480 
tremendous excitement going on I mean
there<00:02:00.140> were<00:02:00.229> people<00:02:00.440> that<00:02:00.770> almost<00:02:01.070> got<00:02:01.220> into

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
there were people that almost got into

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.880 
there were people that almost got into
fistfights<00:02:01.850> not<00:02:02.330> because<00:02:02.810> they<00:02:03.320> each<00:02:03.500> wanted

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
fistfights not because they each wanted

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.249 
fistfights not because they each wanted
to<00:02:04.009> do<00:02:04.159> their<00:02:04.369> own<00:02:04.400> thing<00:02:04.659> but<00:02:05.659> because<00:02:05.840> they

compute their bills and the printer was

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.830 
compute their bills and the printer was
the<00:02:52.100> means<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.970> getting<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.420> out<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.750> the

the means of getting it out to the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.440 
the means of getting it out to the
customer<00:02:54.019> we<00:02:54.530> pretty<00:02:54.829> much<00:02:55.010> understood<00:02:55.609> that

not<00:02:56.989> only<00:02:57.230> was<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:58.010> electronics<00:02:58.730> but<00:02:59.000> some

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
not only was it the electronics but some

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.270 
not only was it the electronics but some
of<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.630> other<00:02:59.810> things<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.680> 1401

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
of the other things that the 1401

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.000 
of the other things that the 1401
presented<00:03:02.030> like<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.870> being<00:03:03.320> able<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.650> store
