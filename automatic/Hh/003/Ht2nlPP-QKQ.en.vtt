until I saw those numbers the record
breaking<00:00:33.530> yeah<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> few

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
breaking yeah so you know I have a few

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.979 
breaking yeah so you know I have a few
thoughts<00:00:35.940> about<00:00:36.390> that

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
thoughts about that

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.530 
thoughts about that
the<00:00:37.829> first<00:00:38.129> one<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.520> people<00:00:39.030> know<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.390> this

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the first one is people know that this

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.930 
the first one is people know that this
is<00:00:39.690> currently<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.170> fairly<00:00:40.590> hot<00:00:40.800> market<00:00:41.430> and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
is currently a fairly hot market and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.360 
is currently a fairly hot market and
that<00:00:42.149> means<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> seller<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.800> expect<00:00:44.219> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that means that the seller can expect to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.910 
that means that the seller can expect to
get<00:00:44.520> multiple<00:00:45.090> offers<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> home<00:00:46.050> which

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
get multiple offers on a home which

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.889 
get multiple offers on a home which
means<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.000> bidders<00:00:48.300> are<00:00:48.539> probably

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
means that the bidders are probably

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.389 
means that the bidders are probably
going<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> get<00:00:49.320> into<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> bidding<00:00:49.829> war<00:00:49.980> they'll

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
going to get into a bidding war they'll

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.410 
going to get into a bidding war they'll
put<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.670> their<00:00:50.789> initial<00:00:51.000> bids<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:53.420> whistling

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
put in their initial bids the whistling

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.910 
put in their initial bids the whistling
agen<00:00:54.690> will<00:00:54.780> come<00:00:54.989> back<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.410> them<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.590> they'll

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
agen will come back to them and they'll

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
agen will come back to them and they'll
put<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.309> second<00:00:56.789> round<00:00:56.940> bits<00:00:57.270> pretty<00:00:57.629> commonly

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
put in second round bits pretty commonly

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.590 
put in second round bits pretty commonly
in<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.890> case<00:00:59.250> what<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.789> really<00:00:59.940> want<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
in that case what you really want is to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.410 
in that case what you really want is to
get<00:01:00.719> lots<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.260> lots<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.739> bidders<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
get lots and lots of bidders and so the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.830 
get lots and lots of bidders and so the
listing<00:01:04.199> price<00:01:04.760> indicates<00:01:05.760> something<00:01:06.090> but

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
listing price indicates something but

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.000 
listing price indicates something but
it's<00:01:06.960> probably<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
it's probably not going to be the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.640 
it's probably not going to be the
ultimate<00:01:08.130> sales<00:01:08.700> price<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.990> may<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.409> wise

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
ultimate sales price so it may be a wise

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.399 
ultimate sales price so it may be a wise
strategy<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.970> list<00:01:12.210> considerably<00:01:13.140> below

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
strategy to list considerably below

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.140 
strategy to list considerably below
where<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.010> think<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> property's<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
where you think the property's going to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.899 
where you think the property's going to
sell<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.560> slow<00:01:16.920> market<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> typically

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
sell in a slow market you typically

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.700 
sell in a slow market you typically
don't<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> type<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.869> behavior<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
don't see that type of behavior the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.010 
don't see that type of behavior the
listing<00:01:20.100> price<00:01:20.430> more<00:01:21.060> reflects<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
listing price more reflects what the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
listing price more reflects what the
seller<00:01:22.409> hopes<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.979> receive<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.909> doesn't

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
seller hopes to receive but that doesn't

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.539 
seller hopes to receive but that doesn't
have<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> case<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.080> hot<00:01:25.259> market<00:01:25.549> no

have to be the case in a hot market no
and<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:26.939> some<00:01:27.420> agents<00:01:27.930> are<00:01:28.110> notorious<00:01:28.680> for

and I know some agents are notorious for

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.890 
and I know some agents are notorious for

finding it hard to believe that a house
on<00:01:37.350> 26th<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.220> mean<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.390> west<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.840> Maine<00:01:40.110> but

on 26th I mean it is west of Maine but

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.440 
on 26th I mean it is west of Maine but
on<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> east<00:01:40.740> side<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.579> selling<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.180> 2

million<00:01:42.750> dollars<00:01:43.079> yeah<00:01:43.890> well<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:45.320> imagine<00:01:46.320> it's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
million dollars yeah well I imagine it's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.859 
million dollars yeah well I imagine it's
a<00:01:46.619> very<00:01:46.829> nice<00:01:47.070> home<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.390> location

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
a very nice home in that location

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260 
a very nice home in that location
because<00:01:49.140> 2<00:01:49.470> million<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.250> high<00:01:50.460> or<00:01:51.240> that

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.719

Vancouver have seen tremendous price

world<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.030> that's<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.450> surprising<00:01:57.950> now<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
world so that's not surprising now the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.340 
world so that's not surprising now the
other<00:01:59.340> issue<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.390> east<00:02:00.810> side<00:02:01.079> is

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
other issue is the east side is

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.319 
other issue is the east side is
gentrifying<00:02:02.040> as<00:02:02.719> very<00:02:03.719> wealthy<00:02:04.290> buyers<00:02:04.560> are

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
gentrifying as very wealthy buyers are

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
gentrifying as very wealthy buyers are
becoming<00:02:06.329> more<00:02:06.630> predominant<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> west

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
becoming more predominant on the west

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.699 
becoming more predominant on the west
side<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.789> pushes<00:02:09.360> nearly<00:02:09.840> affluent<00:02:10.470> buyers

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
side that pushes nearly affluent buyers

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.940 
side that pushes nearly affluent buyers
to<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.069> east<00:02:11.400> side<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
to the east side and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.050 
to the east side and
the<00:02:13.099> eastside<00:02:14.260> doesn't<00:02:15.260> quite<00:02:15.440> have<00:02:15.770> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
the eastside doesn't quite have the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.190 
the eastside doesn't quite have the
environmental<00:02:17.060> amenity<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.810> west<00:02:18.020> side

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
environmental amenity of the west side

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.470 
environmental amenity of the west side
with<00:02:18.470> convenience<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.160> beaches<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:20.300> there's

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
with convenience to beaches but there's

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.360 
with convenience to beaches but there's
a<00:02:20.569> lot<00:02:20.750> there<00:02:20.959> that's<00:02:21.170> terrific<00:02:21.500> culturally

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
a lot there that's terrific culturally

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.830 
a lot there that's terrific culturally
and<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.420> we<00:02:23.720> can<00:02:23.930> expect<00:02:25.060> over<00:02:26.060> time<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.720> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
and so we can expect over time that the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.330 
and so we can expect over time that the
east<00:02:27.020> side<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.530> going<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.770> face<00:02:27.980> price

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
east side is going to face price

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.460 
east side is going to face price
pressure<00:02:28.730> not<00:02:29.330> just<00:02:29.600> because<00:02:29.870> bain<00:02:30.050> Cooper's

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
pressure not just because bain Cooper's

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.580 
pressure not just because bain Cooper's
appreciating<00:02:31.250> but<00:02:31.580> also<00:02:31.760> because<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.590> nature

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
appreciating but also because the nature

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.030 
appreciating but also because the nature

can't afford it or where I just have the
perception<00:02:55.580> they<00:02:55.850> can't<00:02:56.030> afford<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.390> yeah<00:02:57.200> so

perception they can't afford it yeah so

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.320 
perception they can't afford it yeah so
let's<00:02:57.680> be<00:02:57.860> clear<00:02:58.190> about<00:02:58.370> what<00:02:58.700> affordability

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
let's be clear about what affordability

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.780 
let's be clear about what affordability
means<00:02:59.810> if<00:03:00.049> you<00:03:00.170> can<00:03:00.380> make<00:03:00.560> rental<00:03:01.100> payments<00:03:01.640> on

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
means if you can make rental payments on

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.850 
means if you can make rental payments on
a<00:03:01.819> unit<00:03:02.299> I<00:03:02.480> don't<00:03:02.870> think<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.200> get<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.500> say<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
a unit I don't think you get to say the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.100 
a unit I don't think you get to say the
city<00:03:04.069> is<00:03:04.220> unaffordable<00:03:04.730> now<00:03:05.180> rents<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.660> believe

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
city is unaffordable now rents I believe

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.590 
city is unaffordable now rents I believe
are<00:03:06.380> rising<00:03:06.620> if<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.010> look<00:03:07.250> at<00:03:07.600> statistics

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
are rising if you look at statistics

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.570 
are rising if you look at statistics
it's<00:03:08.780> hard<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.110> tease<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.470> out<00:03:09.680> but<00:03:10.489> it

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
it's hard to tease that out but it

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.130 
it's hard to tease that out but it
appears<00:03:10.940> rents<00:03:11.239> are<00:03:11.360> starting<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.930> rise

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
appears rents are starting to rise

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.690 
appears rents are starting to rise
around<00:03:12.410> Vancouver<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.310> that's<00:03:13.489> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
around Vancouver and that's the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.910 
around Vancouver and that's the
affordability<00:03:14.269> question<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.470> worry<00:03:15.709> about

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
affordability question you worry about

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.039 
affordability question you worry about
now<00:03:16.730> whether<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.180> should<00:03:17.239> buy<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.630> home

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
now whether you should buy a home

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.710 
now whether you should buy a home
whether<00:03:18.650> owning<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.549> home<00:03:19.730> in<00:03:19.940> Vancouver<00:03:20.120> is

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
whether owning a home in Vancouver is

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.810 
whether owning a home in Vancouver is
the<00:03:20.930> right<00:03:21.109> asset<00:03:21.680> for<00:03:21.859> your<00:03:21.980> portfolio<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.760> a

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
the right asset for your portfolio is a

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.300 
the right asset for your portfolio is a
complicated<00:03:23.570> question<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.290> think<00:03:24.799> people<00:03:25.160> have

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
complicated question I think people have

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.759 
complicated question I think people have
the<00:03:25.489> belief<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:26.060> over<00:03:26.420> time<00:03:26.660> 20<00:03:27.200> 30<00:03:27.470> years

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
the belief that over time 20 30 years

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.810 
the belief that over time 20 30 years
from<00:03:27.829> now<00:03:28.010> being<00:03:28.310> Coover<00:03:28.640> may<00:03:28.760> be

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
from now being Coover may be

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.539 
from now being Coover may be
considerably<00:03:29.450> more<00:03:29.600> expensive

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
considerably more expensive

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.009 
considerably more expensive
inflation-adjusted<00:03:31.549> than<00:03:32.180> it<00:03:32.299> is<00:03:32.420> today<00:03:32.630> and

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
inflation-adjusted than it is today and

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.830 
inflation-adjusted than it is today and
that<00:03:33.500> might<00:03:33.799> rationalize<00:03:34.609> these<00:03:34.940> prices<00:03:35.510> but

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
that might rationalize these prices but

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.449 
that might rationalize these prices but
if<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:35.989> don't<00:03:36.200> think<00:03:36.470> prices<00:03:36.769> are<00:03:37.040> gonna<00:03:37.160> rise

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
if you don't think prices are gonna rise

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.380 
if you don't think prices are gonna rise
sharply

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
sharply

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.020 
sharply
the<00:03:38.720> rent<00:03:38.989> is<00:03:39.530> going<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.190> be<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.340> lot<00:03:40.609> lower<00:03:40.850> than

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
the rent is going to be a lot lower than

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.660 
the rent is going to be a lot lower than
your<00:03:41.510> mortgage<00:03:42.049> payment<00:03:42.500> even<00:03:42.859> if<00:03:43.130> mortgage

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
your mortgage payment even if mortgage

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.660 
your mortgage payment even if mortgage
rates<00:03:43.970> remain<00:03:44.750> as<00:03:45.079> low<00:03:45.350> as<00:03:45.530> they<00:03:45.739> are<00:03:45.769> so<00:03:46.609> you

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
rates remain as low as they are so you

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.289 
rates remain as low as they are so you
have<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.180> believe<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:49.310> Vancouver<00:03:49.880> prices

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
have to believe a that Vancouver prices

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.060 
have to believe a that Vancouver prices
are<00:03:50.390> gonna<00:03:50.480> rise<00:03:50.720> over<00:03:51.140> time<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.859> probably

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
are gonna rise over time and it probably

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.069 
are gonna rise over time and it probably
only<00:03:52.370> makes<00:03:52.579> sense<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:53.030> buy<00:03:53.180> in<00:03:53.390> Vancouver<00:03:53.989> if

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
only makes sense to buy in Vancouver if

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.360 
only makes sense to buy in Vancouver if
you're<00:03:54.230> really<00:03:54.560> pretty<00:03:54.709> committed<00:03:55.220> to

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
you're really pretty committed to

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.920 
you're really pretty committed to
staying<00:03:55.640> here<00:03:56.060> if<00:03:56.329> you<00:03:56.510> think<00:03:56.540> you're<00:03:56.810> gonna

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
staying here if you think you're gonna

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.360 
staying here if you think you're gonna
want<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.230> pull<00:03:57.410> your<00:03:57.530> cash<00:03:57.799> out<00:03:58.069> of<00:03:58.100> Vancouver

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
want to pull your cash out of Vancouver

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.550 
want to pull your cash out of Vancouver
into<00:03:58.970> another<00:03:59.239> market<00:03:59.480> sometime<00:04:00.170> in<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.470> near

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
into another market sometime in the near

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.220 
into another market sometime in the near
future<00:04:01.090> which<00:04:02.090> probably<00:04:02.420> makes<00:04:02.720> sense<00:04:02.870> for

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
future which probably makes sense for

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.309 
future which probably makes sense for
people<00:04:03.500> who<00:04:03.590> aren't<00:04:03.769> quite<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.400> HAP<00:04:04.640> fluent<00:04:05.319> to

at least be flexible and consider that

at least be flexible and consider that
then<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:09.709> not<00:04:09.859> clear<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:10.190> ownership<00:04:10.549> makes

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
then it's not clear that ownership makes

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.920 
then it's not clear that ownership makes
a<00:04:10.970> lot<00:04:11.120> of<00:04:11.150> sense

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
a lot of sense

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.440 
a lot of sense
are<00:04:13.859> we<00:04:14.040> thinking<00:04:14.430> about<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.819> question<00:04:15.209> wrong

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
you know I think there is a lot of

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.370 
you know I think there is a lot of
commitment<00:04:29.759> to<00:04:29.880> homeownership<00:04:30.479> it's<00:04:30.900> nice<00:04:31.139> to

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
commitment to homeownership it's nice to

there's<00:04:33.479> some<00:04:33.840> evidence<00:04:34.050> although<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:34.979> hard

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
there's some evidence although it's hard

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.830 
there's some evidence although it's hard
to<00:04:35.310> really<00:04:35.639> know<00:04:35.820> what<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.509> underlying

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
to really know what the underlying

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.230 
to really know what the underlying
causes<00:04:37.470> but<00:04:38.039> there's<00:04:38.220> some<00:04:38.460> belief<00:04:38.820> that

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
causes but there's some belief that

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.939 
causes but there's some belief that
people<00:04:39.509> who<00:04:39.750> own<00:04:39.960> homes<00:04:40.169> become<00:04:40.770> better

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
people who own homes become better

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
to have control over what the paint job

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.140 
to have control over what the paint job
is<00:04:48.990> when<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.830> plumbing<00:04:50.220> goes<00:04:50.430> bad<00:04:50.669> they<00:04:50.910> want

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
is when the plumbing goes bad they want

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.610 
is when the plumbing goes bad they want
to<00:04:51.240> be<00:04:51.330> responsible<00:04:51.900> instead<00:04:52.199> of<00:04:52.289> having<00:04:52.440> to

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
to be responsible instead of having to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.770 
to be responsible instead of having to
interact<00:04:53.070> with<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.310> landlord<00:04:54.180> or<00:04:54.539> some

interact with a landlord or some

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.839 
interact with a landlord or some

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
live there are some serious concerns

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.200 
live there are some serious concerns
about<00:05:33.900> affordability<00:05:34.889> absolutely<00:05:35.820> what<00:05:35.970> reps

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
about affordability absolutely what reps

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.969 
about affordability absolutely what reps
are<00:05:36.389> I<00:05:36.419> think<00:05:36.659> there's<00:05:37.139> pressure<00:05:37.440> on<00:05:37.590> rent<00:05:37.830> we

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
are I think there's pressure on rent we

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.129 
are I think there's pressure on rent we
have<00:05:38.070> very<00:05:38.340> low<00:05:38.610> vacancy<00:05:39.150> rates<00:05:39.570> just

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
have very low vacancy rates just

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.430 
have very low vacancy rates just
observational<00:05:41.099> EIC<00:05:41.400> rents<00:05:42.030> rising<00:05:42.630> and<00:05:42.930> when

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
observational EIC rents rising and when

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.469 
observational EIC rents rising and when
you<00:05:43.530> have<00:05:43.710> such<00:05:44.009> low<00:05:44.280> vacancy<00:05:44.909> rates<00:05:45.150> as<00:05:45.330> we

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
you have such low vacancy rates as we

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.749 
you have such low vacancy rates as we
have<00:05:45.720> in<00:05:45.930> rental<00:05:46.919> housing<00:05:47.250> in<00:05:47.280> Vancouver<00:05:47.729> that

have in rental housing in Vancouver that

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.670 
have in rental housing in Vancouver that
makes<00:05:48.090> you<00:05:48.270> think<00:05:48.509> if<00:05:48.990> you've<00:05:49.169> got<00:05:49.349> a<00:05:49.380> line<00:05:49.650> of

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
makes you think if you've got a line of

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.379 
makes you think if you've got a line of
people<00:05:49.860> willing<00:05:50.400> to<00:05:50.520> pay<00:05:50.639> the<00:05:50.820> current<00:05:51.180> rent

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
people willing to pay the current rent

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:52.850 
people willing to pay the current rent
that<00:05:51.780> eventually<00:05:52.080> landlords<00:05:52.680> are<00:05:52.770> gonna

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
that eventually landlords are gonna

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.360 
that eventually landlords are gonna
start<00:05:53.099> increasing<00:05:54.060> rents<00:05:54.360> more<00:05:54.659> and<00:05:54.930> again<00:05:55.830> if

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
start increasing rents more and again if

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.670 
start increasing rents more and again if
we<00:05:56.430> believe<00:05:57.090> that<00:05:57.300> these<00:05:57.509> prices<00:05:57.810> make<00:05:58.259> sense

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
we believe that these prices make sense

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.610 
we believe that these prices make sense
they<00:05:59.220> only<00:05:59.430> make<00:05:59.789> sense<00:06:00.120> because<00:06:00.570> rents<00:06:01.320> and

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
they only make sense because rents and

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.560 
they only make sense because rents and
prices<00:06:02.099> are<00:06:02.220> gonna<00:06:02.340> rise<00:06:02.580> down<00:06:02.909> the<00:06:03.120> road<00:06:03.330> so

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
prices are gonna rise down the road so

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.480 
prices are gonna rise down the road so
absolutely<00:06:04.409> I<00:06:04.440> would<00:06:04.560> say<00:06:04.830> affordability

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490

down<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.539> road<00:06:06.750> is<00:06:07.020> a<00:06:07.050> major<00:06:07.560> concern<00:06:08.190> and

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
down the road is a major concern and

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.210 
down the road is a major concern and
homeownership<00:06:09.650> affordability<00:06:10.650> if<00:06:11.039> it's

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
homeownership affordability if it's

that would have an adverse effect on

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.470 
that would have an adverse effect on
prices<00:06:43.190> because<00:06:43.460> of<00:06:43.490> the<00:06:43.610> affordability<00:06:44.210> of

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
mortgage payments the other issue is we

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
just don't know what's going to happen

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.370 
just don't know what's going to happen
to<00:06:49.130> the<00:06:49.220> demand<00:06:49.420> from<00:06:50.420> people<00:06:50.720> who<00:06:50.810> don't<00:06:51.020> live

from outside wishing to live here you

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.660 
from outside wishing to live here you
know<00:06:57.500> there's<00:06:57.830> certainly<00:06:58.070> reason<00:06:58.430> to<00:06:58.520> believe

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:58.670 
know there's certainly reason to believe

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.180 
know there's certainly reason to believe
there'll<00:06:59.030> be<00:06:59.060> more<00:06:59.390> but<00:06:59.690> it's<00:07:00.230> hard<00:07:00.500> to<00:07:00.710> really

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
there'll be more but it's hard to really

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.370 
there'll be more but it's hard to really
put<00:07:02.090> a<00:07:02.120> number<00:07:02.360> on<00:07:02.540> how<00:07:02.690> that's<00:07:03.080> going<00:07:03.320> to

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
put a number on how that's going to

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.040 
put a number on how that's going to
change<00:07:03.650> over<00:07:04.010> time<00:07:04.660> so<00:07:05.660> at<00:07:05.750> the<00:07:05.840> end<00:07:05.900> of<00:07:05.990> the

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
change over time so at the end of the

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.170 
change over time so at the end of the
day<00:07:06.170> we<00:07:06.320> just<00:07:06.350> put<00:07:06.620> our<00:07:06.710> hands<00:07:06.890> up<00:07:07.100> and<00:07:07.280> deal
