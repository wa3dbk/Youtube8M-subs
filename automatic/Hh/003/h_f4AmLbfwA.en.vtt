like it's about Ragnarok which in each

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.320

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
so he was just pretty much thought

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.309 
so he was just pretty much thought
through<00:02:11.940> answer<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.569> why<00:02:12.720> he's<00:02:12.870> been<00:02:13.050> looking

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
because when he explains it to mark role

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.460 
because when he explains it to mark role
he<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.190> going<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.760> make<00:02:18.030> another<00:02:18.690> dragon

stops<00:08:04.009> us<00:08:04.099> from<00:08:04.159> being<00:08:04.430> a<00:08:04.550> really<00:08:04.909> good

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:04.940 
stops us from being a really good

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.909

chapter<00:08:05.300> like<00:08:05.539> nine<00:08:05.779> and<00:08:06.110> stuff<00:08:06.289> up<00:08:06.469> I<00:08:06.650> still

00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:06.919 
chapter like nine and stuff up I still

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:08.170 
chapter like nine and stuff up I still
think<00:08:06.949> it's<00:08:07.219> a<00:08:07.279> very<00:08:07.400> good<00:08:07.520> chapter<00:08:07.909> though

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:08.180 
think it's a very good chapter though

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.480 
think it's a very good chapter though
but<00:08:08.870> it<00:08:08.990> does<00:08:09.139> have<00:08:09.319> some<00:08:09.469> issues<00:08:09.620> but<00:08:09.979> that's

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:10.490 
but it does have some issues but that's

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.709 
but it does have some issues but that's
all<00:08:10.699> for<00:08:10.880> me<00:08:10.969> something<00:08:11.270> that<00:08:11.389> much<00:08:11.509> which<00:08:11.690> is

00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:11.719 
all for me something that much which is

00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:16.630 
all for me something that much which is
always<00:08:12.169> and<00:08:12.529> I'll<00:08:12.770> see<00:08:13.039> you<00:08:13.190> guys<00:08:13.219> next<00:08:13.759> time
