00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:11.250
 Hello and welcome to the otv 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.010
 he is probably the easiest at the moment 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.590
 Gas cooker on the market only 48 grams 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.970
 but because of the month and we have 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.289
 We can ask such a tiny thing 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.420
 really boil water 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.080
 That's what we want in the movie 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.080
 check 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.410
 Let's take a look first 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.730
 scope of delivery at the mercy will be in one 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.940
 fixed screw housing made of plastic 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.490
 Delivered in it is natural 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.600
 the cooker himself further finds 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:48.739
 one in an English-speaking one 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:50.720
 we are looking for instructions for the construction 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.570
 First, a solid foundation for the 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.670
 cartouche the burr is a cooker for 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.640
 screw cartridge and therefore becomes easy 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.989
 screwed on the gas cartridge too 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.790
 Last but not least , there are three more upstairs 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.790
 stand feet unfolded for the pot 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.770
 so now we look at the mercy though 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.940
 once in action 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.370
 First of all is on the page 1 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.590
 usually when the barrel is rotated because of 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.210
 cooker does not have his own ignition he must 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.140
 with a lighter or similar 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.810
 be ignited 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.690
 then a pot is turned upside down 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.820
 and filled with water last but not least 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.940
 the lid is still on the pot with it 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.170
 no unnecessary heat is lost 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.930
 the state has a relatively broad one 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.580
 Flame picture goes on smaller pots 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.619
 Part of energy on the side 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.550
 lost 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.700
 Overall, the stove offers a 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:48.660
 heating capacity of 3260 has 11,000 btu 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.119
 He heats half a liter with it 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.280
 water in about three minutes and one 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.610
 liters of water in about one and a half minutes 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.720
 the consumption of the cooker is 150 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.720
 grams per hour 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.679
 Let's throw one more at the end 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.540
 look at the technical data of the 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.480
 the frame of the cook is for the most part 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.790
 made of titanium that ensures that 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.739
 the state only 48 grams weight on the 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.290
 Libra brings he is 65 cm high and 55 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.700
 centimeters wide 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.800
 Positive is the rule valve 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.069
 which is a very accurate control of the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.900
 power allows the feet of the 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.110
 Cookers are sturdy and allow too 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.120
 use larger pots so heated 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.680
 the grace without hesitation one with two 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.680
 liter of water filled pot 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.190
 we come to the conclusion no question of 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.140
 Grace is currently the easiest 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.480
 gas cooker in the market thanks 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.240
 titanium case but also thanks to missing 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.980
 The piezo ignition of the cooker offers a 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.750
 very decent performance itself 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.250
 In addition, they also control very well 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.690
 leaves 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.430
 there are deductions in the b-note for that 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.410
 wide flame picture because just those 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.510
 the target group of the State of the ultralight 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.580
 Hikers are more likely to use narrow pots or 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.080
 mugs 1 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.510
 for the cooker is priced right 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.050
 fair and sorted in midfield 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.140
 the month is starting from 60 euro in the trade 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.140
 available
