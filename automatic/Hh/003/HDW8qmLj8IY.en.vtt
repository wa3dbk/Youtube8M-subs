00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
showing you how to get the expose for

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.049 
showing you how to get the expose for
free<00:00:06.330> for<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.750> iphone<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.290> ipod<00:00:07.529> touch<00:00:08.059> now

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
free for the iphone and ipod touch now

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.820 
free for the iphone and ipod touch now
for<00:00:09.570> those<00:00:09.630> who<00:00:09.960> don't<00:00:10.170> know<00:00:10.290> what<00:00:10.500> expose

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
for those who don't know what expose

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.799 
for those who don't know what expose
years<00:00:11.130> but<00:00:11.429> it's<00:00:11.610> basically<00:00:12.049> this<00:00:13.309> BAM<00:00:14.809> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
years but it's basically this BAM the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.060 
years but it's basically this BAM the
program<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.199> called<00:00:16.260> orbit<00:00:16.800> but<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:18.180> know

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
program is called orbit but you know

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
program is called orbit but you know
expose<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.550> much<00:00:20.670> better<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
expose is so much better so this is the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.290 
expose is so much better so this is the
Archon<00:00:22.140> right<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:22.470> orbit<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.220> when<00:00:24.150> i<00:00:24.180> click

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
Archon right here orbit and when i click

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.710 
Archon right here orbit and when i click
on<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.720> icon<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.350> get<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.890> expose<00:00:26.460> now<00:00:27.240> they

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
on this icon I get the expose now they

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.830 
on this icon I get the expose now they
trying<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:27.990> mimic<00:00:28.230> mac<00:00:28.769> OS<00:00:29.130> x<00:00:29.160> 0<00:00:29.689> because<00:00:30.689> they

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
trying to mimic mac OS x 0 because they

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.389 
trying to mimic mac OS x 0 because they
have<00:00:30.990> expose<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:33.300> get<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:34.280> go<00:00:35.280> on

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
have expose so to get this just go on

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.920 
have expose so to get this just go on
into<00:00:35.670> cydia<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.180> need<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> jailbroken<00:00:36.540> iphone

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
into cydia you need a jailbroken iphone

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.920 
into cydia you need a jailbroken iphone
ipod<00:00:37.410> touch<00:00:37.440> go<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.100> into<00:00:38.280> cydia<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.660> you're

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
ipod touch go on into cydia and you're

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.770 
ipod touch go on into cydia and you're
going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.110> want<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> add<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:41.420> source<00:00:42.420> which

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
going to want to add a source which

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.260 
going to want to add a source which
somebody<00:00:43.140> tell<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.770> right<00:00:43.890> now<00:00:44.000> this<00:00:45.000> might

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
somebody tell you right now this might

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.420 
somebody tell you right now this might
take<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> while<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.050> cydia<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:47.309> some

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
take a while because cydia for some

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.420 
take a while because cydia for some
reason<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.789> very<00:00:47.850> slow<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.770> let<00:00:49.950> load<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
reason is very slow so just let load and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.049 
reason is very slow so just let load and
head<00:00:50.579> over<00:00:50.640> i'll<00:00:50.910> manage<00:00:51.149> click<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.140> sources

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
head over i'll manage click on sources

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.470 
head over i'll manage click on sources
edit<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:55.289> add<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.280> read<00:00:59.850> just

already have it but just click on add a
source<00:01:31.850> BAM<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.210> once<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.229> add<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
source BAM and once you add in this is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.510 
source BAM and once you add in this is
done<00:01:35.210> verifying<00:01:36.259> verifying<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:38.340> how<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
done verifying verifying it just how to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.639 
done verifying verifying it just how to
order<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.790> search<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.479> type<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.259> orbit<00:01:40.680> or<00:01:42.649> fit

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
order a search and type in orbit or fit

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.899 
order a search and type in orbit or fit
so<00:01:44.430> I've<00:01:44.520> been<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.799> orbit<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.189> should

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
so I've been this orbit and you should

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.219 
so I've been this orbit and you should
see<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.590> let's<00:01:49.590> go<00:01:49.710> Oh<00:01:49.890> bit<00:01:50.100> cracked<00:01:50.399> because

see it let's go Oh bit cracked because

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.139 
see it let's go Oh bit cracked because
it's<00:01:52.229> cracked<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.890> pay<00:01:53.040> for<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.399> so

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it's cracked you have to pay for it so

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.389 
it's cracked you have to pay for it so
click<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.930> all<00:01:55.049> bit<00:01:55.200> crack<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
click it all bit crack and just in the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.679 
click it all bit crack and just in the
top<00:01:56.610> right<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.329> say<00:01:57.390> install

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
top right is going to say install

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.999 
top right is going to say install
install<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:59.509> then<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.930> find<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.590> orbit

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
install it and then just find the orbit

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.440 
install it and then just find the orbit
icon<00:02:03.950> as<00:02:04.950> I'm<00:02:05.189> focusing<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> Oregon<00:02:06.329> right

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
icon as I'm focusing the Oregon right

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.729 
icon as I'm focusing the Oregon right
there<00:02:06.689> click<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.450> if<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.629> see<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
there click on it and if you see the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.890 
there click on it and if you see the
expose<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.879> works

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
expose then it works

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.229 
expose then it works
so<00:02:13.409> this<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.769> guy's<00:02:14.069> arm<00:02:14.519> thanks<00:02:15.090> for
