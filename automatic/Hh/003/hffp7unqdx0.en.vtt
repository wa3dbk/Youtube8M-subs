and why there's so much moisture in the
gas<00:00:50.940> which<00:00:51.329> there<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.719> definitely<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.440> this

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
gas which there is definitely in this

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.170 
gas which there is definitely in this
you<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.309> come<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.820> don't<00:00:54.059> know<00:00:54.120> if

you can come in here I don't know if
you're<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.539> able<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.699> kind

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
you're going to be able to see this kind

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.900 
you're going to be able to see this kind
of<00:00:56.789> sloshing<00:00:57.180> around<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:57.680> but<00:00:58.680> uh<00:00:58.910> if

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
of sloshing around right now but uh if

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
of sloshing around right now but uh if
you<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> good<00:01:00.989> shot<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.500> there's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you can get a good shot of it there's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.820 
you can get a good shot of it there's
definitely<00:01:02.520> water<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.719> gas<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:03.989> water

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
definitely water in that gas and water

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.770 
definitely water in that gas and water
and<00:01:05.010> gas<00:01:05.189> don't<00:01:05.430> mix<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.510> easy<00:01:06.689> to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
and gas don't mix it so it's so easy to

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.929 
and gas don't mix it so it's so easy to
tell<00:01:07.020> by<00:01:07.950> angle<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.280> towards<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.549> light<00:01:08.729> maybe

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
tell by angle it towards the light maybe

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.179 
tell by angle it towards the light maybe
you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.180> pick<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.420> some<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.920> it's

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you can pick up some more of it so it's

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.940 
you can pick up some more of it so it's
almost<00:01:11.369> 50/50<00:01:12.180> almost<00:01:12.780> 50%<00:01:13.049> water<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.710> 50%

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
almost 50/50 almost 50% water and 50%

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.969 
almost 50/50 almost 50% water and 50%
gas<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.299> unfortunately<00:01:16.020> water<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.770> not

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
gas and unfortunately water is not

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.190 
gas and unfortunately water is not
flammable

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
flammable

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.080 
flammable
so<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.650> bike<00:01:19.799> won't<00:01:20.040> run<00:01:20.220> right<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.729> that's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so the bike won't run right and that's

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.670 
so the bike won't run right and that's
everything<00:01:21.689> inside<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> flow<00:01:22.290> Bowl<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
everything inside the flow Bowl in the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.800 
everything inside the flow Bowl in the
carburetor<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> gas<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.659> came

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
carburetor and this is the gas that came

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.600 
carburetor and this is the gas that came
out<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.140> tank<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:28.220> I'm<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
sit here to see what settles to the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.640 
sit here to see what settles to the
bottom<00:01:32.479> pretty<00:01:33.479> American<00:01:33.750> pretty<00:01:34.409> gross

we'll see what happens I here in a
little<00:01:36.060> bit<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.579> very<00:01:38.759> good<00:01:38.970> sign

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
little bit so that's a very good sign

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.539 
little bit so that's a very good sign
that<00:01:39.540> something<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.680> right<00:01:40.890> when<00:01:41.400> it

that's a gasoline that came out of the
carburetor<00:02:19.269> that's<00:02:20.269> not<00:02:20.450> good<00:02:20.689> that's<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.989> lot

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170

water<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.549> not<00:02:25.670> flammable<00:02:25.939> so<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.200> will<00:02:27.379> not

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
water is not flammable so it will not

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.470 
water is not flammable so it will not
run<00:02:27.769> properly<00:02:28.040> like<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.579> you<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.239> get<00:02:29.389> that

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
out of the carburetor just by opening up

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.770 
out of the carburetor just by opening up
the<00:02:32.510> folk<00:02:32.750> bulb<00:02:33.079> drain<00:02:33.709> plug<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:35.180> right<00:02:35.540> here<00:02:35.750> I

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
the folk bulb drain plug so right here I

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.690 
the folk bulb drain plug so right here I
just<00:02:35.900> poured<00:02:36.349> a<00:02:36.409> little<00:02:36.500> bit<00:02:36.739> of<00:02:36.829> good<00:02:37.099> gas<00:02:37.370> out

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
just poured a little bit of good gas out

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.759 
just poured a little bit of good gas out
this<00:02:38.569> is<00:02:38.689> just<00:02:38.840> good<00:02:39.459> regular<00:02:40.459> gasoline<00:02:41.769> and

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
this is just good regular gasoline and

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.659 
this is just good regular gasoline and
that's<00:02:42.950> what<00:02:43.099> it's<00:02:43.219> supposed<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.609> look<00:02:43.819> like

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.740 

all<00:02:49.669> right<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.120> bottom<00:02:50.389> line<00:02:50.419> is<00:02:50.569> that

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
all right so the bottom line is that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.929 
all right so the bottom line is that
your<00:02:51.079> gas<00:02:51.290> needs<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.739> be<00:02:51.859> clean<00:02:52.189> and<00:02:52.370> clear<00:02:52.639> if

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
your gas needs to be clean and clear if

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.610 
your gas needs to be clean and clear if
it's<00:02:53.090> cloudy<00:02:53.299> or<00:02:53.599> has<00:02:53.780> water<00:02:54.019> in<00:02:54.169> it<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:54.409> need
