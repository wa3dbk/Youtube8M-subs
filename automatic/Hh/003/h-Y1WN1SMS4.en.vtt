00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello to all here franÃ§ois for 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.210
 pro video training in this tutorial I 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.450
 will show you how to optimize 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.309
 your green fund ie having 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.790
 a piece of green fabric it's not okay 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.130
 suffice 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.520
 it will have to respect some rules 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.980
 for that to really optimize the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.630
 video quality of the overlay 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.240
 that you are going to have to do good you 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.930
 see I put the big green background or I 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.840
 am on the same level and what is needed to 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.110
 any price have already first it's a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.120
 a more or less direct green canvas 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.670
 with the most flashy color possible 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.980
 the most natural meaning 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.559
 that your software incrustation 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.860
 you 're going to tell him that color 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.989
 the pipette here is this one I want the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.289
 delete except that if it's a color 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.149
 that you find on a good face 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.190
 obviously because we have a little bit of 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.230
 green casually on a face a 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.520
 human face to a small component of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.600
 glass so that's why it takes 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.970
 really choose well his canvas for for 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.650
 that the computer does this work of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.290
 trimming as neatly as possible 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.909
 without that you risk having some of 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.799
 pixels that will disappear on a 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.780
 face or on any other object that you 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.430
 go filming and it's going to give 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.170
 something very very ugly or when 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.720
 you will have to push others 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.060
 settings that risk you that you 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.040
 generate contours would aim and who 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.560
 do not go in the end not be handsome who will 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.810
 break the effect so already bad 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.630
 news already is that a green fund 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.479
 of quality at a certain stroke my one 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.290
 there I bought on the internet on a 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.920
 specialized website 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.229
 and I think it cost in the 200 to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.810
 300 euros 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.860
 the ideal obviously I thought about it but hey 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.240
 for now I could not do it 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.930
 I have not found the right thing is 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.970
 to have a flat wall painted green 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.130
 because the ideal is to have no 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.640
 obviously no fold because the more you 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.280
 will have different shades on your 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.750
 funds the more you need you will have to 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.630
 push settings to take 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.940
 more color palettes in 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.750
 the shades of green 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.500
 obviously that plays on our 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.300
 disadvantage 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.900
 so what I really recommend 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.280
 these two 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.319
 if you have found the right web 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.480
 it is to wait for it and to make sure 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.150
 that there is no no no crease 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.019
 above and there obviously we come a 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.129
 other point which is lighting since 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.409
 obviously already the lighting will do 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.650
 bring out the smallest imperfection 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.349
 and then we'll have to manage 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.900
 already a fund lighting for them 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.040
 be uniform on a canvas of this tea 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.379
 not because there are other systems that 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.720
 does not require any lighting and I will do 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.620
 a tutorial soon on this 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.389
 other clipping technique so here we go 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.879
 with a real canvas already a 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:53.459
 here it is to illuminate it uniformly 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.650
 I use two except box that go two 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.629
 lighting with diffusion sails 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.700
 who are already going to say that's fine 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.139
 lit up my background and I have two 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.650
 more lights that come 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.540
 enlighten me months so what's needed 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.409
 obviously it is to avoid shadows 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.909
 since here's more I'll get closer 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.620
 the more we will see the shadows it will have to 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.690
 place your lighting in such a way 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.930
 that there is not really the minimum 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.730
 shadows on your background otherwise 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.280
 obviously in the same way your 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.660
 software is going to have different nuances there 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.669
 will have to push the settings again 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.919
 for the waves to disappear and that 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.419
 you do not need the ideal at all 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.760
 obviously it is to enlighten the fund 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:39.359
 green do not get the person the 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.780
 presenter let's say from earth in front 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.819
 sorry the lightings of the bottom and after 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.510
 to enlighten this person that's for 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.780
 have to ensure even illumination 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.079
 on the background and after to illuminate 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.079
 so his presenter other small 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.340
 advice to shut up how badly we should 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.319
 light up a green background 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.989
 so that's a question I'm asking myself 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.840
 am obviously asked from the beginning and 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.970
 I obviously when I have 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.970
 obviously answered it is necessary that the 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.970
 the lighting on the bottom is the same the 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.940
 same intensity as on the face it is 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.940
 say that the more information there will be 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.850
 color in your 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.900
 your video file will be easier 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.880
 for the program here's to find 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.810
 this color to find it at the beginning 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.220
 for example when I started the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.560
 inlays I thought it needed 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.120
 put the background to a level here 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.160
 a little brighter for that to happen 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.140
 clear of the skin and I was wrong 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.970
 I was completely wrong it takes 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.450
 contrary that this glass information 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:48.090
 pure silk is full here it is necessary that 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.330
 this level is either a beautiful green 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.890
 full if you have a camera 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.410
 professional or semi-professional 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.450
 you can detect that by doing 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.000
 to appear the wave form it's a name a 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.580
 little barbarian but hey you have a kind 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.760
 de rosas makes different points 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.680
 which correspond to each color of 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.350
 the palette is one of his points 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.840
 is green so when you go 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.800
 finish your your background 100 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.680
 people 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.230
 look closely look closely at what is 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.420
 pass on your kind of oscilloscopes 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.180
 on your box form to be able to 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.570
 get as close as possible 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.310
 your settings as much as possible this 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.070
 color this point that will draw on 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.570
 your on your green diagram the 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.640
 pure green color 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.590
 after you pass your person you 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.980
 illuminate it and then everything should be 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.900
 pass 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.970
 I hope you know 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.190
 will have served you well 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.419
 I remain at your disposal for all 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.220
 the questions you can leave in 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.870
 below this video and I tell you to 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.860
 very quickly for an upcoming tutorial on 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.860
 pro video training
