00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.500 
Canadian here's the basic grip itself I
always<00:00:21.340> wondered<00:00:21.699> why<00:00:21.820> people<00:00:21.849> never<00:00:22.330> show

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
always wondered why people never show

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.089 
always wondered why people never show
their<00:00:22.689> faces<00:00:22.960> on<00:00:23.289> these<00:00:23.410> things<00:00:23.619> I<00:00:23.920> thought

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
their faces on these things I thought

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.519 
their faces on these things I thought
maybe<00:00:24.279> because<00:00:24.550> they're<00:00:24.699> ugly<00:00:24.910> or<00:00:25.900> cuz

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
maybe because they're ugly or cuz

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.980 
maybe because they're ugly or cuz
they're<00:00:26.800> maybe<00:00:27.279> really<00:00:27.580> nerdy<00:00:27.880> but<00:00:28.810> it's

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
they're maybe really nerdy but it's

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.070

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
twisting yep the green light on there

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.160 
twisting yep the green light on there
usually<00:03:47.530> means<00:03:48.160> it's<00:03:48.370> getting<00:03:48.520> power<00:03:49.170> just

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
usually means it's getting power just

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.920 
usually means it's getting power just
tighten<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.650> up<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.940> wheel<00:03:52.180> feels<00:03:52.510> okay<00:03:52.900> a

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
tighten it up this wheel feels okay a

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.360 
tighten it up this wheel feels okay a
little<00:03:53.110> thin<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.740> don't<00:03:54.040> know<00:03:54.130> what<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
little thin I don't know what the

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.510 
little thin I don't know what the
original<00:03:54.430> feels<00:03:55.060> like<00:03:55.240> so<00:03:56.400> initially<00:03:57.400> the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
original feels like so initially the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.740 
original feels like so initially the
plastic<00:03:58.030> seems<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.810> match<00:03:59.050> pretty<00:03:59.500> good

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
plastic seems to match pretty good

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.510 
plastic seems to match pretty good
definitely<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.900> bigger<00:04:02.110> speckle<00:04:02.680> if<00:04:02.890> you<00:04:03.130> are

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
definitely a bigger speckle if you are

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.030 
definitely a bigger speckle if you are
into<00:04:04.530> details<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:06.370> rubber<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:08.410> doesn't<00:04:08.890> feel

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
into details the rubber it doesn't feel

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.610 
into details the rubber it doesn't feel
as<00:04:09.160> nice<00:04:09.340> as<00:04:09.520> the<00:04:09.760> Nikon<00:04:10.480> rubber<00:04:11.320> on<00:04:11.500> the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
as nice as the Nikon rubber on the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.830 
as nice as the Nikon rubber on the
camera<00:04:12.040> but<00:04:12.250> it's<00:04:12.400> definitely<00:04:12.580> okay<00:04:13.120> and

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
camera but it's definitely okay and

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.000 
camera but it's definitely okay and
