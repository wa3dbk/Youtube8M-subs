justify<00:01:17.009> quite<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
justify quite a lot with that but at the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.780 
justify quite a lot with that but at the
same<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.439> understand<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.280> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
same time I can understand it if this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.780 
same time I can understand it if this

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
will treat him as such now let's get

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.929 
will treat him as such now let's get
into<00:03:11.639> the<00:03:11.879> third<00:03:12.620> point<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:14.220> would<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:14.730> to

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
into the third point I would like to

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.360 
into the third point I would like to
stress<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.359> that<00:03:15.389> do<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.739> transgenders

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
stress is that do the transgenders

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.110 
stress is that do the transgenders
really<00:03:17.700> get<00:03:17.849> happier<00:03:18.500> by<00:03:19.519> doing<00:03:20.519> surgeries<00:03:20.940> on

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
really get happier by doing surgeries on

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.750 
really get happier by doing surgeries on
themselves<00:03:21.449> and<00:03:21.659> I<00:03:22.290> suppose<00:03:22.949> like<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.549> ten

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
themselves and I suppose like in ten

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.819 
themselves and I suppose like in ten
years<00:03:23.909> time<00:03:24.150> we<00:03:24.419> will<00:03:24.569> probably<00:03:24.810> see<00:03:25.169> a<00:03:25.379> lot<00:03:25.530> of

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
years time we will probably see a lot of

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.619 
years time we will probably see a lot of
reports<00:03:26.400> coming<00:03:26.549> in<00:03:26.760> because<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.299> whole

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
reports coming in because this whole

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.479 
reports coming in because this whole
surgery<00:03:28.079> and<00:03:28.349> transgender<00:03:28.919> is<00:03:29.010> quite<00:03:29.250> new

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
surgery and transgender is quite new

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.629 
surgery and transgender is quite new
indeed<00:03:29.879> and<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.780> think<00:03:31.169> we'll<00:03:31.379> see<00:03:31.620> if<00:03:32.220> they<00:03:32.519> are

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
indeed and I think we'll see if they are

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.099 
indeed and I think we'll see if they are
doing<00:03:32.970> stories<00:03:33.269> on<00:03:33.629> that<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.470> doesn't<00:03:35.069> really

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
doing stories on that it doesn't really

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.170 
doing stories on that it doesn't really
increase<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.470> happiness<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:38.159> a<00:03:38.549> person<00:03:39.030> like

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
increase the happiness of a person like

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.750 
increase the happiness of a person like
you<00:03:39.329> will<00:03:39.479> still<00:03:39.870> not<00:03:40.290> be<00:03:40.319> a<00:03:41.069> woman<00:03:41.489> even

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
you will still not be a woman even

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.430 
you will still not be a woman even
though<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.909> think<00:03:42.120> you're<00:03:42.299> a<00:03:42.329> woman<00:03:42.599> so<00:03:42.629> how

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
though you think you're a woman so how

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.520 
though you think you're a woman so how
does<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.400> mean<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.599> don't<00:03:45.750> get<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.349> don't

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
does it I mean you don't get you don't

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.189 
does it I mean you don't get you don't
become<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.829> woman<00:03:47.280> by<00:03:47.430> doing<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.419> few<00:03:48.599> surgeries

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
become a woman by doing a few surgeries

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.449 
become a woman by doing a few surgeries
I<00:03:49.319> mean<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.799> will<00:03:49.919> still<00:03:50.129> have<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.370> same

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
I mean you will still have the same

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.809 
I mean you will still have the same
problems<00:03:51.209> inside<00:03:51.659> of<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:51.989> so<00:03:52.769> perhaps<00:03:53.310> it's

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
problems inside of you so perhaps it's

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.819 
problems inside of you so perhaps it's
the<00:03:53.970> case<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.750> there<00:03:55.349> are<00:03:55.379> some<00:03:55.530> other

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
the case that there are some other

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.490 
the case that there are some other
psychological<00:03:56.699> factors<00:03:57.209> playing<00:03:57.479> in<00:03:57.780> that

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
psychological factors playing in that

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.649 
psychological factors playing in that
needs<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:58.979> be<00:03:59.010> addressed<00:03:59.430> instead<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.419> them

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
needs to be addressed instead of them

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.390 
needs to be addressed instead of them
