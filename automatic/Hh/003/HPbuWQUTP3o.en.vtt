but<00:04:06.040> here<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.190> put<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.460> in<00:04:06.520> six<00:04:06.820> cruising<00:04:07.540> along

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
but here I put it in six cruising along

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.060 
but here I put it in six cruising along
about<00:04:07.900> fifty<00:04:08.200> miles<00:04:08.380> an<00:04:08.560> hour<00:04:08.680> I'm<00:04:08.860> turning

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
about fifty miles an hour I'm turning

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.600 
about fifty miles an hour I'm turning
about<00:04:09.220> 2,000<00:04:09.700> rpms<00:04:10.090> and

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
about 2,000 rpms and

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.040 
about 2,000 rpms and
I<00:04:11.670> mean<00:04:12.240> honestly<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.630> might<00:04:12.780> be<00:04:12.930> more

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
I mean honestly this might be more

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.810 
I mean honestly this might be more
comfortable<00:04:13.290> than<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.680> Mercedes<00:04:14.040> SL<00:04:14.340> at<00:04:14.610> this

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
comfortable than a Mercedes SL at this

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.479 
comfortable than a Mercedes SL at this
point<00:04:15.140> it's<00:04:16.140> just<00:04:16.380> buttery<00:04:16.920> smooth<00:04:17.310> and

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
point it's just buttery smooth and

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.370 
point it's just buttery smooth and
everything<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.910> does<00:04:18.120> but<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.109> know<00:04:19.230> you've

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
everything it does but you know you've

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.620 
everything it does but you know you've
got<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:19.620> immense<00:04:19.890> power<00:04:20.100> behind<00:04:20.340> you

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
got that immense power behind you

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.510 
got that immense power behind you
so<00:04:22.230> obviously<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:22.650> can<00:04:22.680> downshift<00:04:22.980> to<00:04:23.310> get

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
so obviously you can downshift to get

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.980 
so obviously you can downshift to get
the<00:04:23.640> soundtrack<00:04:24.210> back<00:04:24.450> there<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.720> go<00:04:24.810> into

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
the soundtrack back there you go into

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.129 
the soundtrack back there you go into
