00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.509
 and we already have a new boxing 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.260
 this is the one of carrÃ­cola of microsoft 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:37.460
 for xbox 360 controls is this 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.860
 It is basically a battery that 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.460
 has an included charger that 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.449
 connect on the xbox via a usb cable and the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.579
 another extreme we are part of the control and 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.649
 Well, what does this do well 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.140
 basically it's to not have to be 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.780
 interrupting our hours of play and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.879
 always have a source at hand to 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.829
 load like this is not necessary have to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.640
 be loading or good recharging 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.240
 batteries 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.870
 and well here it says that it guarantees up to 35 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.870
 hours of play 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.640
 but 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.179
 here it seems that it is the original of 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.179
 microsoft 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.740
 this was bought 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:33.049
 this opens up is starting here by the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.049
 back side already 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.020
 It is common given 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.030
 because they were open 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.250
 we counted a little and here they can 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.630
 see a small guide the square root of 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.350
 460 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.980
 then I have guys who have funds 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.980
 with other 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.060
 it basically says how to connect it and 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.940
 all this until death 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.220
 understands everything 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.440
 the cable is approximately 1,200 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.860
 meters and can damage the matter of 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.860
 change 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.140
 good 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.069
 I'm here is the cable this with good 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.470
 see and is the tip cable is vtv 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.740
 this goes to any osb to any 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.740
 usb port 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:58.220
 microsoft is the other end to end 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.120
 this is for I suppose that's for the 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.390
 battery to keep it and here it is 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.390
 the port 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.810
 illustrates this other end byron scott 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.790
 you can not start loading anyway 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:21.520
 that can be lit in the green color 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.640
 or red 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.490
 well this is quite all this is with 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.940
 what works this good battery brings 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.210
 batteries inside 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.510
 a guest matter modified by 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.220
 say it and this is the most here in the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.500
 control let's put the hour so that 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.410
 can appreciate this is the traditional 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.220
 that the Parisian track that causes 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.350
 many problems between the two and these 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.890
 can turn another in the 22 overcoming 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.890
 the contact 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.260
 but it connects 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.010
 are anticipating 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.010
 in 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.390
 and well, it only remains to connect 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.760
 he is strong 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.280
 this week les beaux india so 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.299
