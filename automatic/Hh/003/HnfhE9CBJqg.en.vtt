across<00:01:40.770> Europe<00:01:41.220> there<00:01:41.580> will<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.760> a<00:01:41.850> shifting

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
across Europe there will be a shifting

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
campaign which has both a visual and

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.320 
campaign which has both a visual and
practical<00:01:46.530> effects<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.640> areas<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.060> attrition

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
practical effects the areas of attrition

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.850 
practical effects the areas of attrition
will<00:01:48.630> increase<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> winters<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.619> become

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
more bold as the campaign progresses

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.969 
more bold as the campaign progresses
this<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.259> something<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.590> will<00:01:52.830> actually

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
this is something I think will actually

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.260 
this is something I think will actually
make<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> light<00:01:53.460> game<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> little<00:01:53.880> bit<00:01:54.060> more

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
make the light game a little bit more

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.880 
make the light game a little bit more
challenging<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.869> even<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> climate<00:01:55.799> is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
against you the province system is

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.179 
against you the province system is
making<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.140> return<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.799> time<00:01:58.979> has<00:01:59.159> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
slightly different UI scheme and is

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.780 
slightly different UI scheme and is

provinces<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> very<00:02:07.560> interesting<00:02:07.950> new

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
provinces have a very interesting new

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.949 
provinces have a very interesting new
mechanic<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.789> them<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.509> feel<00:02:09.780> you're

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
mechanic to them if you feel you're

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.630 
mechanic to them if you feel you're
going<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.259> lose<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> town<00:02:10.770> or<00:02:10.800> region<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.520> can

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
going to lose a town or region you can

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.380 
going to lose a town or region you can
abandon<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.390> raise<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.630> completely

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
abandon it and raise it completely

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.600 
abandon it and raise it completely
I<00:02:13.450> think<00:02:14.080> it's<00:02:14.200> called<00:02:14.380> devastation<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
I think it's called devastation the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.340 
I think it's called devastation the
entire<00:02:15.880> region<00:02:16.120> burns<00:02:16.510> from<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.780> center<00:02:17.200> add

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
entire region burns from the center add

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.290 
entire region burns from the center add
to<00:02:17.500> its<00:02:17.650> borders<00:02:18.040> destroying<00:02:18.459> all<00:02:18.700> things<00:02:19.000> and

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
to its borders destroying all things and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.970 
to its borders destroying all things and
buildings<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.870> completely<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.530> leaving<00:02:20.860> it

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
buildings in a completely and leaving it

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.550 
buildings in a completely and leaving it
barren<00:02:21.280> owned<00:02:21.760> by<00:02:22.090> nobody<00:02:22.420> not<00:02:22.870> even<00:02:23.050> rebels

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
barren owned by nobody not even rebels

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.059 
barren owned by nobody not even rebels
if<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:25.690> look<00:02:25.840> at<00:02:25.959> blank<00:02:26.170> parts<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.740> map<00:02:26.920> in

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
if you look at blank parts of the map in

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.110 
if you look at blank parts of the map in
the<00:02:27.160> bottom<00:02:27.430> right<00:02:27.580> corner<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.940> this

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
the bottom right corner of this

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.520 
the bottom right corner of this
screenshot<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:28.840> see<00:02:29.110> there<00:02:29.290> are<00:02:29.380> some

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
screenshot you can see there are some

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.380 
screenshot you can see there are some
abandoned<00:02:30.040> regions<00:02:30.400> it's<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.970> new<00:02:31.150> type<00:02:31.360> of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
abandoned regions it's a new type of

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.270 
abandoned regions it's a new type of
scorched<00:02:31.959> earth<00:02:32.110> policy<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:32.920> think<00:02:33.130> that

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
scorched earth policy and I think that

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.100 
scorched earth policy and I think that
will<00:02:33.400> be<00:02:33.430> really<00:02:33.790> interesting<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.959> main

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
will be really interesting the main

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.390 
will be really interesting the main
reason<00:02:35.380> for<00:02:35.410> this<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:35.950> are<00:02:36.040> slowing

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
reason for this is that you are slowing

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.220 
reason for this is that you are slowing
the<00:02:36.580> advance<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:37.030> your<00:02:37.120> enemies<00:02:37.480> if<00:02:37.870> they<00:02:38.050> take

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
the advance of your enemies if they take

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.840 
the advance of your enemies if they take
the<00:02:38.350> town<00:02:38.560> after<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.040> was<00:02:39.130> destroyed

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
the town after it was destroyed

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.400 
the town after it was destroyed
it'll<00:02:40.180> take<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> very<00:02:40.690> very<00:02:40.780> long<00:02:41.020> time<00:02:41.200> to

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
it'll take a very very long time to

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.860 
it'll take a very very long time to
rebuild<00:02:41.680> however<00:02:42.550> if<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.819> town<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.209> seized<00:02:43.480> then

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
rebuild however if a town is seized then

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.270 
rebuild however if a town is seized then
the<00:02:43.989> defenders<00:02:44.440> won't<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:44.709> able<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.920> destroy

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
the defenders won't be able to destroy

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.010 
the defenders won't be able to destroy
it<00:02:45.459> meaning<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.090> will<00:02:46.239> have<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.510> race<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
it meaning you will have to race the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.600 
it meaning you will have to race the
siege<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.440> town<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.800> lock<00:02:48.040> them<00:02:48.250> down<00:02:48.400> before

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
siege of town to lock them down before

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.780 
siege of town to lock them down before
they<00:02:48.760> can<00:02:49.000> burn<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.300> out<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:51.250> hard<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.519> say<00:02:51.670> if

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
they can burn it out it's hard to say if

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.070 
they can burn it out it's hard to say if
this<00:02:51.880> will<00:02:52.030> be<00:02:52.120> exploited<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.750> multiplayer

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
this will be exploited in multiplayer
