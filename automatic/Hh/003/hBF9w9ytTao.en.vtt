00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
nationals it's a really really different

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.430 
nationals it's a really really different
team<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.410> year<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:40.920> last<00:00:41.460> year<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:43.230> lost

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
team this year because last year we lost

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.360 
team this year because last year we lost
four<00:00:44.129> seniors<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.600> gained<00:00:45.950> half<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
four seniors but we gained half of the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.000 
four seniors but we gained half of the
team<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.820> new<00:00:48.000> people<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.590> was<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> really

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
team as new people so it was a really

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.860 
team as new people so it was a really
different<00:00:50.460> mix<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.059> took<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> little<00:00:51.420> meshing

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
different mix it took a little meshing

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.139 
different mix it took a little meshing
together<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.010> beginning<00:00:53.129> but<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.910> think

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
together in the beginning but I think

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.790 
together in the beginning but I think
we're<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> completely<00:00:55.289> different<00:00:55.500> team<00:00:55.620> when

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
we're a completely different team when

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.049 
we're a completely different team when
we<00:00:56.039> were<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> beginning<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> year<00:00:56.820> and

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
we were in the beginning of the year and

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.200 
we were in the beginning of the year and
I<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.680> coming<00:00:58.829> together<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.219> lot<00:00:59.370> but

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
I think it's coming together a lot but

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.090 
I think it's coming together a lot but
the<00:01:00.329> past<00:01:00.570> two<00:01:00.809> years<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> diamond<00:01:01.649> gems<00:01:01.890> have

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the past two years the diamond gems have

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
the past two years the diamond gems have
placed<00:01:02.340> within<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> top<00:01:02.910> ten<00:01:03.239> teams<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.780> both

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
placed within the top ten teams in both
