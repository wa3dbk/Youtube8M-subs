I've<00:01:17.580> been<00:01:17.729> practicing<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.390> writing<00:01:18.780> at<00:01:18.900> night

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
I've been practicing my writing at night

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.570 
I've been practicing my writing at night
when<00:01:19.409> I'm<00:01:19.530> not<00:01:19.680> looking<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.130> playbook

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
when I'm not looking at the playbook

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
when I'm not looking at the playbook
your<00:01:21.360> first<00:01:21.630> NFL<00:01:22.080> pass<00:01:22.350> went<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> touchdown

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
your first NFL pass went for a touchdown

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.280 
your first NFL pass went for a touchdown
now<00:01:23.640> wasn't<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.090> big<00:01:24.360> mistake<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:24.960> far<00:01:24.990> as

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
now wasn't that a big mistake as far as

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.320 
now wasn't that a big mistake as far as
expectations<00:01:26.070> are<00:01:26.250> concerned<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> time<00:01:27.299> I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
expectations are concerned at the time I

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.700 
expectations are concerned at the time I
thought<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.810> was<00:01:27.870> a<00:01:27.960> great<00:01:28.080> thing<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> throw

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
thought it was a great thing to throw

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
thought it was a great thing to throw
that<00:01:28.860> first<00:01:29.070> pass<00:01:29.370> and<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
that first pass and have it go for a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
that first pass and have it go for a
touchdown<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.890> week<00:01:32.189> after

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
touchdown but then you know week after

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.740 
touchdown but then you know week after
week<00:01:32.729> you're<00:01:32.939> getting<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> questions<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.719> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
week you're getting the questions in the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.969 
week you're getting the questions in the
interviews<00:01:34.200> how<00:01:34.350> come<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.619> didn't<00:01:34.799> throw<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
interviews how come you didn't throw a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.319 
interviews how come you didn't throw a
touchdown<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.640> first<00:01:35.850> pass<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.060> this

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
touchdown on your first pass of this

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.370 
touchdown on your first pass of this
game<00:01:36.570> how<00:01:36.750> come<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.020> didn't<00:01:37.200> throw<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
game how come you didn't throw a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.870 
game how come you didn't throw a
touchdown<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.950> first<00:01:38.009> pass<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.640> game

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
touchdown on the first pass of that game

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
touchdown on the first pass of that game
and<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.630> had<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.899> do<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.110> again<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and so if you had to do it again you

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.870 
and so if you had to do it again you
would<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.649> overthrown<00:01:41.039> it<00:01:41.280> yeah<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.610> probably

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
would have overthrown it yeah I probably

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.340 
would have overthrown it yeah I probably
waited<00:01:42.270> until<00:01:42.359> like<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> third<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.079> fourth

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
waited until like the third or fourth

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.200 
waited until like the third or fourth
series<00:01:43.649> something<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.219> that<00:01:44.430> or<00:01:44.850> maybe<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
series something like that or maybe the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.149 
series something like that or maybe the
third<00:01:45.359> or<00:01:45.539> fourth<00:01:45.719> week<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:46.170> couple<00:01:46.649> weeks<00:01:46.920> off

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
third or fourth week a couple weeks off

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.740 
third or fourth week a couple weeks off
from<00:01:47.549> from<00:01:47.909> throwing<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.210> touchdown<00:01:48.390> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
from from throwing a touchdown you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.389 
from from throwing a touchdown you
definitely<00:01:49.170> set<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.530> standard<00:01:49.770> very<00:01:50.189> low

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
definitely set that standard very low

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.910 
definitely set that standard very low
well<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> rookie<00:01:51.479> mistake<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.530> definitely
