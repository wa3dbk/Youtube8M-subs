00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.899
 that is, all these components are cut 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.579
 no machine presses there 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.269

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.300

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.630
 associations with russia harmonica bath 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.730

 recommended retail is 2600 rubles that 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.830
