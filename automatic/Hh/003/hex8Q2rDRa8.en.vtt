00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.740 
look at it and I think about in 20 years
or<00:01:15.799> in<00:01:15.890> 30<00:01:16.100> years<00:01:16.250> going<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.450> flea<00:01:17.720> market

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
or in 30 years going to a flea market

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.470 
or in 30 years going to a flea market
maybe<00:01:18.440> with<00:01:18.800> like<00:01:19.010> my<00:01:19.280> son<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:20.090> know<00:01:20.180> it's<00:01:20.330> a

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
maybe with like my son you know it's a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.790 
maybe with like my son you know it's a
lot<00:01:20.630> of<00:01:20.750> its<00:01:20.900> gonna<00:01:21.020> be<00:01:21.110> sort<00:01:21.500> of<00:01:21.590> much<00:01:21.770> more

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
lot of its gonna be sort of much more

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.330 
lot of its gonna be sort of much more
like<00:01:22.220> commodity<00:01:22.910> like<00:01:23.360> cheap<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.920> know<00:01:25.040> stuff

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
like commodity like cheap you know stuff

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.040 
like commodity like cheap you know stuff
that<00:01:25.370> isn't<00:01:25.700> made<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.000> last<00:01:26.360> for<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.600> long<00:01:26.780> time

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
that isn't made to last for a long time

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.960 
that isn't made to last for a long time
and<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:27.380> I<00:01:27.409> think<00:01:27.710> that<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.070> know<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.580> vintage
