00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.330
 hello to all welcome to this 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.320
 video where I'm just going 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.400
 today you talk about two things 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.640
 two accessories that I have a little more 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.080
 beefy bet with time and between 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.109
 others that I have created means do not wait 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.640
 not be short of time and also what will 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.099
 happen in the coming week because 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.529
 I will be absent then first of all 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.779
 I would like to talk about this accessory 6 I 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.100
 think will be called gopaul I'm not 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.340
 very well, of course, finally, I make them 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.239
 entirely myself by doing a little bit 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.430
 search all over the internet 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.170
 so just the right part that you 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.309
 see it's just a craft 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.539
 paint roller flapping it makes a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.140
 good handle as you can see 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.239
 after that above the black part here 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.120
 this is an accessory to you pros 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.649
 that I only received with the pack 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.300
 so and it's called in fact a fcs 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.780
 club I think and it's an accessory 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.060
 for if you have a spell that already has a 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.220
 hole and savored high school this thing in 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.549
 and it's much more secure than 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.009
 with the sticker is like my surf did 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.909
 not this accessory there I could not do anything 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.350
 to make this fps plogue so I decided 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.600
 to look a little bit at his size how do I 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.400
 could do for him 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.640
 simply and I found a video that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.310
 explains is pretty well how how 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.329
 do this kind of accessory so everything 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.670
 stupidly I have to drill a hole in the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.619
 part of the bottom of this withdrawal a 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.000
 picture in the time that I speak 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.740
 now like that you can see this 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.409
 that I mean but here below it 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.299
 there is a black part after that 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.070
 times two lengths I turn is all 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.860
 just i did i drill a hole 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.920
 wide enough teeth to be able to 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.320
 to pass a life is the same in the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.869
 the Sunday classic of the roll to 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.640
 painting gfr I have to drill a hole and 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.080
 the other side not his life it was too much 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.619
 long but hey it has you in the rich 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.599
 shorter 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.989
 so I had to saw with a saw at 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.250
 metals and after that here you can 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.930
 see I put little pucks of 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.810
 method to compress the length and 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.910
 I ended up putting a screen that is in 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.150
 does the same as that access 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.739
 be your words and to customize 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.180
 I put a small sticker Cottereau 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.920
 because I'm starting to get really 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.110
 a lot 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.319
 so that I also wanted to talk about the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.360
 telescopic pole that I already had 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.450
 shown unhappy with one of my videos 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.910
 previous years and in time she had 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.290
 so I put a little I 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.640
 did not find that it's a plastic that we 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.340
 can squeeze very hard and that's very 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.170
 difficult to endow it so I had that 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.250
 is the same here I did the same thing 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.680
 I put a life that little reed of 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.390
 metal a nut all tightly 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.610
 that it is much more secure 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.940
 that before and again this accessory there 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.290
 comes with the pro vo so and this stick so 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.170
 that's how you did not see my 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.140
 old video that when we call it a 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.170
 stick to wash the liters what can 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.690
 know how to say that my mother 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.670
 did not use anymore so I got them back 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.549
 to Algiers but also one of the great 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.079
 stickers to the pros who are air 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.430
 extremely powerful end not powerful 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.980
 but he really sticks very very well 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.090
 in the water it was not at all so 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.519
 alas I have a lot so that's 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.140
 not bad and finally to secure 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.600
 when we spend at the chairlift rise this 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:38.840
 who cares we put a little 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:42.470
 way that is adjustable at the level of 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.299
 wrist like these include and in 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.319
 done it's just recovered 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.640
 of a wii remote so if 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.889
 you have a wii that you use more 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.510
 high that you do not necessarily need 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:56.030
 of the thong you undo it and 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.010
 so use it dead it's more than a 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.120
 game have to find a system to do 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.700
 the same thing with the I do not know 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.230
 the name of this axis strong but good brief 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.370
 to do with this one like it will be 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.459
 even better since 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.879
 Ehret who holds it if I ever let go 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.810
 lose my cup 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.090
 so that's it, it's an accessory 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.579
 which is sold I think at 25 euros I 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.419
 a little looked at amazon if you 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.070
 buy the pack 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.979
 if you already have I mean the pack 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.540
 surf with the stories except for sticking 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.350
 on your board 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.479
 well you can do it for me to 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.710
 less than 2 euros I think it's really 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.300
 practice of being able to do things 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.560
 like that is even and that I like 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.810
 in your prowess only as it's a 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.860
 camera that is mounted with the iss in fact 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.470
 it's all stupid it's a life it's a 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.539
 nut you can make accessories 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.660
 yourself and customize them as you 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:50.270
 so that was the part 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.860
 props of this video and I have 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.210
 bought a new accessory that I'm going 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:59.120
 keep secret until the next video 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.470
 who is very very very happy 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.690
 but I'll talk about it in more detail after 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.850
 and for now what will happen 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.310
 is that I have not in Scotland during 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.389
 a week and so that inevitably no 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.699
 video during that time but by 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.840
 against I take to go pro with because I 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.539
 will stay in a place that 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.919
 is called the rails greece is not 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.750
 went quickly see on google like that 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.910
 you learned something with 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.460
 this video and so rhein it's a 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.950
 very wild place in Scotland and I 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.780
 will go camping in front of the sea â€‹â€‹so 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.550
 if there are beautiful sunsets or 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.370
 beautiful landscapes I will surely make 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.740
 time lapse that I will put back 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.849
 so here it was a little one just a 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.580
 little by little from what is happening and 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.229
 I hope you will come to this 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.470
 accessory that is really good because 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.120
 that in fact it gives a picture a lot 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.949
 more stable than just holding the gopro 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.150
 in hand so that is to say if you 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.650
 hold in hand I have beautiful film or even 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.940
 you 're going a little shaky like that 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.130
 naturally it's everybody 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.960
 shakes a little bit the image becomes 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.380
 mistress to but this makes the picture a 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.300
 little more net more stable so no 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.430
 essential but nice to have lo 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.949
 I hope you have enjoyed good I have 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.039
 not say much but but that's it 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.039
 him
