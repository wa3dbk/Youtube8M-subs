00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:08.790
 Huh- it 's coming from the forecast center Oh , it 's going to be released on Friday the 30th on Friday . 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.330
 I am 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:18.670
 I will tell you more about this snow view 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:21.120
 Let's check from the current state of clouds first 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.120
 Here 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:30.619
 Japan Archipelago is a situation where clouds that clearly appear white are passing and saying 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:35.120
 Although this cloud itself is I would say a thin cloud 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:40.450
 A situation where clouds of low pressure are approaching from the west 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:45.160
 And I want you to pay attention to this south of Japan 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:51.550
 There is a cloud that looks a bit faint here but here 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:53.140
 Small low pressure is generated supposed to be clouds bring snow in the Kanto area of a ground 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.989
 I will go 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:03.430
 When we will confirm based on the simulation computer of the prediction computer of the future perfume 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:11.380
 This is midnight when the date changes 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:12.400
 In western Japan, a low pressure rain cloud is lightly applied, but it is likely that there will be more places where it will generally rain 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.159
 is 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.260
 This red 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:23.640
 The dotted line 9 is an element of delight about 1500 meters above the sky 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:33.110
 The more you go north, the stronger the chill in the sky 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:33.110
 Where it hits the north side of the most perfume, it is likely to change from midnight to snow near Hiroshima 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.030
 After the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.619
 Here at 30 am and 6 am 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.619
 Around 6 am 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:57.900
 Apart from the Nishino low pressure, another low pressure will also occur in the south of Kanto Tokai 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:02.680
 The perfume on the north side of this cloud falls on the area and the same as explained in Hiroshima earlier 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:06.760
 Is it cold as the air goes as you go ? 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.850
 It will be in the state in which the year is entering 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.060
 Of the distant morning from the low-pressure 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.390
 Kanto area as the timing of launch 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.840
 We expect to Fu that it would become snow 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.840
 After the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:31.610
 As this low pressure approaches, it gradually rises 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:36.090
 The air is getting warm and around noon the Kanto area 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.870
 It seems to have become more a place to come on behalf of the rain 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.819
 Just north of the feeling 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.670
 It is expected that these places will still be snowing around noon 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:54.170
 Cart area 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:03:00.210
 It seems that it will be around 3 am to 6 am as the timing of getting out 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:04.569
 And it is a good likely to continue to be snow in that snow until around noon 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.319
 The amount of snow in the future 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:11.880
 What was predicted is here 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.680
 About Kanto area Oh urban area 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.670
 A bit on the road 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:24.640
 It looks like it's going to be like snowfall 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:30.290
 Firmly to you and the road goes towards the update Elian a little to enter the inland 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:37.939
 There is also is likely to oodles and accumulate such a place on the road in or along the mountain 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:40.470
 And if does not end snow firmly to go to around noon longer full by The snow than expected 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:41.840
 You come to a woman to break a little bit more 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.940
 This is 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:55.160
 Snowfall prediction for the worst case osho 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:56.210
 In the inland area Utsunomiya or Saitama area, there will be places where it will snow well on the road. 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.230
 Seems so 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:05.470
 It seems to be in such a situation that the road is firmly covered with snow even in the center of Tokyo 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.159
 Assuming bad eyes and quite 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:18.489
 Though it seems to affect transportation in the inland area 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:19.730
 In Tokyo metropolitan area because it is a snow cover of about pale et al on the road right now of the place as the center of the forecast 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:27.120
 Is 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:31.780
 It is expected that there will be no major impact on public transportation 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:35.700
 Though it is this snow approximately image 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.090
 Such is the case in central Tokyo 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:44.190
 It feels like it's a little bit on the road 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.900
 In the inland Ilia, it seems like this will build on the main road a little more firmly 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:52.479
 But it seems to come out 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:59.080
 The Fu that, such as the city of Tokyo is about wispy also piled up around faintly like this 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:05:03.820
 As we expect, we see that there is no big influence on public transportation 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.639
 Yeah ball first alignment head Though not look Fu that it would not so much occur 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.180
 Big 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:14.310
 In this snow everyone is driving car carefully so I will be much 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:21.480
 The speed will not increase and traffic congestion etc. will occur easily 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:29.430
 In addition, there may be more people on the train than others . 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:30.330
 I will leave the house early because I think that tomorrow morning work will take longer than usual 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.770
 Please give me 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:41.009
 If you are moving by car 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:46.840
 Don't forget to use this equipment, such as winter tires and chains 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:53.080
 There is also a possibility that snow will mix in Osaka Nagoya Higashi 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.860
 However, it is expected that there will be little snowfall in Osaka, Nagoya, etc. 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.280
 I will 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:04.990
 This is a forecast of snowfall, but the white areas are areas where there is not much snowfall 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:11.889
 Osaka Nagoya has no major impact even if snow is mixed 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:14.440
 Hiroshima area will snow several centimeters so here too winter tires and chains tend to 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:19.410
 I hope the door 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.410
 We told the first snow information from the horizontal center
