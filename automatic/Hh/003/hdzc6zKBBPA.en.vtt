00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:04.220 

alright<00:00:02.429> so<00:00:02.730> see<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.240> actually<00:00:03.510> do<00:00:03.899> have<00:00:04.049> to

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
alright so see you actually do have to

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.950 
alright so see you actually do have to
build<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.529> bridge<00:00:04.770> with<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.069> road<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.960> you

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
build a bridge with the road and you

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.589 
build a bridge with the road and you
don't<00:00:07.170> have<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.830> single<00:00:08.280> point<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:09.179> actually

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
don't have a single point that actually

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.560 
don't have a single point that actually
carries<00:00:10.559> away<00:00:10.710> it's<00:00:11.370> distributed<00:00:12.240> pretty

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
carries away it's distributed pretty

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.709 
carries away it's distributed pretty
much<00:00:12.690> even<00:00:13.019> like<00:00:13.549> so<00:00:14.549> yeah<00:00:14.730> like<00:00:14.759> cards<00:00:15.420> on<00:00:15.599> it

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
much even like so yeah like cards on it

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:24.830 
much even like so yeah like cards on it
or<00:00:15.839> whatever

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.109 

and<00:00:25.840> basically<00:00:26.830> I<00:00:27.070> told<00:00:27.160> you<00:00:27.520> that<00:00:27.610> the<00:00:27.850> arched

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
and basically I told you that the arched

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.560 
and basically I told you that the arched
pattern<00:00:28.600> that's<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.680> best<00:00:29.830> way<00:00:30.040> to<00:00:30.100> go

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
pattern that's the best way to go

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.609 
pattern that's the best way to go
depends<00:00:31.570> on<00:00:31.660> your<00:00:31.750> material<00:00:32.200> if<00:00:32.290> you<00:00:32.410> really

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
depends on your material if you really

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.070 
depends on your material if you really
can't<00:00:32.830> build<00:00:33.040> arch<00:00:33.250> then<00:00:33.700> you<00:00:34.630> know<00:00:34.720> you<00:00:34.840> gave

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
can't build arch then you know you gave

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.930 
can't build arch then you know you gave
some<00:00:35.320> sort<00:00:35.559> of<00:00:35.620> truss<00:00:35.950> bridge<00:00:36.220> based<00:00:36.610> on<00:00:36.820> that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
some sort of truss bridge based on that

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.000 
some sort of truss bridge based on that
arch<00:00:37.180> pattern<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.239> like<00:00:40.420> I<00:00:40.540> said<00:00:40.830> you<00:00:41.830> want

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
arch pattern and like I said you want

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.350 
arch pattern and like I said you want
the<00:00:42.129> attention<00:00:42.220> Mars<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:43.000> be<00:00:43.030> perpendicular

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
the attention Mars to be perpendicular

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.210 
the attention Mars to be perpendicular
to<00:00:43.900> the<00:00:44.650> ground<00:00:47.430> because<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.780> easier<00:00:50.290> on<00:00:50.620> the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
to the ground because it's easier on the

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.939 
to the ground because it's easier on the
drums<00:00:51.430> up<00:00:51.610> here<00:00:53.580> and<00:00:54.930> you're<00:00:55.930> making<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.739> most

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
drums up here and you're making the most

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.430 
drums up here and you're making the most
use<00:00:57.250> of<00:00:57.460> that<00:00:57.610> wire<00:00:59.220> and<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.420> what<00:01:02.199> you<00:01:02.290> can<00:01:02.379> see

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
use of that wire and so what you can see

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.430 
use of that wire and so what you can see
a<00:01:02.920> lot<00:01:03.580> of<00:01:03.610> times<00:01:03.879> is<00:01:04.089> that<00:01:04.120> these<00:01:04.900> roads<00:01:05.170> also

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
a lot of times is that these roads also

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.960 
a lot of times is that these roads also
have<00:01:05.799> sort<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:06.700> cross<00:01:06.940> members<00:01:07.330> at<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.570> bottom

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.640 

the<00:01:12.970> reason<00:01:13.270> being<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:17.610> youth<00:01:18.610> joints<00:01:19.090> I

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the reason being is that youth joints I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.719 
the reason being is that youth joints I
mean<00:01:20.650> this<00:01:20.770> whole<00:01:20.950> number<00:01:21.280> right<00:01:21.400> here<00:01:21.460> it's

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
mean this whole number right here it's

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.190 
mean this whole number right here it's
going<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.940> want<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.180> sort<00:01:22.420> of<00:01:22.510> separate<00:01:22.930> one

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
going to want to sort of separate one

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.310 
going to want to sort of separate one
way<00:01:23.409> to<00:01:23.470> put<00:01:23.740> on<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.690> crossmember

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
way to put on it but the crossmember

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.609 
way to put on it but the crossmember
pushes<00:01:27.250> that<00:01:27.659> number<00:01:28.659> back<00:01:28.840> into<00:01:29.140> place<00:01:29.350> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
pushes that number back into place and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.380 
pushes that number back into place and
really<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.859> basic<00:01:33.189> purpose<00:01:33.369> of<00:01:33.700> all<00:01:33.909> this<00:01:33.939> is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
really the basic purpose of all this is

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.740 
really the basic purpose of all this is
so<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:36.189> weight<00:01:36.340> right<00:01:36.520> here<00:01:37.060> pushing

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
so that the weight right here pushing

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.620 
so that the weight right here pushing
down<00:01:38.049> this<00:01:38.920> brought<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.670> ground<00:01:39.880> on<00:01:40.420> these

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
down this brought to the ground on these

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.730 
down this brought to the ground on these
sides<00:01:40.899> over<00:01:41.289> here<00:01:43.200> alright<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:47.259> one

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
sides over here alright so that's one

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.160 
sides over here alright so that's one
basic<00:01:48.189> design<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.820> know<00:01:49.329> their<00:01:49.539> basic<00:01:49.869> design

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
basic design I know their basic design

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.740 
basic design I know their basic design
you'll<00:01:50.380> see<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.210> little<00:01:52.420> bit<00:01:52.570> more

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
you'll see it's a little bit more

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.880 
you'll see it's a little bit more
complicated<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:55.109> it<00:01:56.109> follows<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.710> same

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
complicated but it follows the same

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.919 
complicated but it follows the same
pattern<00:01:57.399> just<00:01:57.789> sort<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.539> inverse<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.780> see

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
pattern just sort of inverse and you see

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.440 
pattern just sort of inverse and you see
a<00:02:01.960> lot<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:02.259> times<00:02:02.560> if<00:02:03.429> there's<00:02:03.759> water<00:02:04.119> in<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
a lot of times if there's water in the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.580 
a lot of times if there's water in the
equation<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:06.030> yeah<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:07.990> across<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.259> large

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
equation so yeah it's across a large

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.140 
equation so yeah it's across a large
piece<00:02:09.130> of<00:02:09.160> water

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.710 

you<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:13.519> say<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.579> really<00:02:14.970> can't<00:02:15.209> build<00:02:15.450> one

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
you have say you really can't build one

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.140 
you have say you really can't build one
arch<00:02:16.849> what<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.269> is<00:02:19.909> something<00:02:20.909> like

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
arch what you have is something like

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.850 
arch what you have is something like
this<00:02:23.090> where<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.860> these

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
this where you have these

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.759 
this where you have these
downward-facing<00:02:26.430> arches<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:28.049> have<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.349> road

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.649 

and<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:32.189> still<00:02:32.459> not<00:02:32.640> deal<00:02:32.819> with<00:02:32.909> wires<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.510> be

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
and you still not deal with wires to be

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.580 
and you still not deal with wires to be
perpendicular<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.799> ground<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:37.200> just

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
perpendicular with the ground it's just

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.240 
perpendicular with the ground it's just
the<00:02:37.859> best<00:02:38.069> way<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.370> go<00:02:38.579> and<00:02:39.560> on<00:02:40.560> each<00:02:40.709> side<00:02:41.069> of

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the best way to go and on each side of

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.710 
the best way to go and on each side of
this<00:02:41.510> sort<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.680> holds<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.799> up<00:02:44.329> the<00:02:45.329> wires<00:02:45.569> are

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
this sort of holds it up the wires are

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.440 
this sort of holds it up the wires are
going<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:45.959> be<00:02:46.049> on<00:02:46.379> each<00:02:46.739> side

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.110 

just<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:53.220> make<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.400> whole<00:02:53.670> inbox<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:54.480> know<00:02:56.120> so

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
just to make it whole inbox you know so

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.180 
just to make it whole inbox you know so
pretty<00:02:57.870> much<00:02:57.959> how<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.200> build<00:02:58.470> any<00:02:58.680> bridge<00:02:59.010> you

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
pretty much how to build any bridge you

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.150 
pretty much how to build any bridge you
