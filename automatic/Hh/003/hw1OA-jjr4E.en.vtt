00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.660 

these<00:00:03.270> notes<00:00:03.480> are<00:00:03.659> on<00:00:03.689> multiplying<00:00:04.380> decimals

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:04.670 
these notes are on multiplying decimals

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.980 
these notes are on multiplying decimals
what<00:00:05.670> you'll<00:00:05.819> notice<00:00:05.970> that<00:00:06.270> we<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:06.569> here<00:00:06.870> is

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
what you'll notice that we have here is

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.570 
what you'll notice that we have here is
our<00:00:07.109> sleeping<00:00:07.589> dog<00:00:07.799> because<00:00:08.309> when<00:00:08.460> we

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
our sleeping dog because when we

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.700 
our sleeping dog because when we
multiply<00:00:08.760> decimals<00:00:09.260> we're<00:00:10.260> also<00:00:10.410> going<00:00:10.650> to

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
multiply decimals we're also going to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.470 
multiply decimals we're also going to
use<00:00:10.860> our<00:00:11.010> integer<00:00:11.280> rules<00:00:11.610> because<00:00:12.030> as<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.300> can

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
use our integer rules because as you can

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.970 
use our integer rules because as you can
see<00:00:12.690> looking<00:00:13.019> over<00:00:13.320> your<00:00:13.440> notes<00:00:13.710> you're

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
see looking over your notes you're

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.350 
see looking over your notes you're
actually<00:00:14.280> going<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.460> have<00:00:14.670> positive<00:00:14.910> and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
actually going to have positive and

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.140 
actually going to have positive and
negative<00:00:15.500> numbers<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:16.880> when<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.000> multiply

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
negative numbers so when we multiply

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.390 
negative numbers so when we multiply
decimals<00:00:18.510> we're<00:00:19.199> going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.560> multiply<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:20.130> if

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
decimals we're going to multiply as if

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.160 
decimals we're going to multiply as if
there<00:00:20.580> were<00:00:20.820> no<00:00:21.060> decimals<00:00:21.270> because<00:00:21.990> that

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
there were no decimals because that

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.679 
there were no decimals because that
makes<00:00:22.380> things<00:00:22.650> much<00:00:22.830> easier<00:00:23.570> then<00:00:24.570> we're

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
makes things much easier then we're

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.150 
makes things much easier then we're
going<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> place<00:00:25.140> our<00:00:25.320> decimal<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:25.980> our<00:00:26.099> answer

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
going to place our decimal in our answer

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.400 
going to place our decimal in our answer
by<00:00:27.000> counting<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.510> number<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.869> decimal<00:00:28.380> places

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
by counting the number of decimal places

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.880 
by counting the number of decimal places
and<00:00:29.039> your<00:00:29.220> factors<00:00:30.199> then<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.380> need<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.679> count

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
and your factors then you need to count

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.340 
and your factors then you need to count
that<00:00:32.160> many<00:00:32.430> places<00:00:32.700> from<00:00:33.270> right<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.600> left<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
that many places from right to left and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.900 
that many places from right to left and
as<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:34.770> I'd<00:00:34.890> started<00:00:35.280> my<00:00:35.340> little<00:00:35.610> swoops

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
as you see I'd started my little swoops

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.569 
as you see I'd started my little swoops
here<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.960> start<00:00:37.230> from<00:00:37.410> right<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.860> left<00:00:38.010> in

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
here so we start from right to left in

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.420 
here so we start from right to left in
order<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> put<00:00:39.480> our<00:00:39.600> decimal<00:00:39.780> back<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.469> then

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
order to put our decimal back in then

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.010 
order to put our decimal back in then
we're<00:00:41.550> going<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.700> use<00:00:41.790> estimation<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.809> check

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
we're going to use estimation to check

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.959 
we're going to use estimation to check
if<00:00:43.200> our<00:00:43.290> answer<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.800> reasonable<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.760> let's

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
if our answer is reasonable so let's

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.450 
if our answer is reasonable so let's
take<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> look<00:00:45.480> at<00:00:45.600> our<00:00:45.719> examples<00:00:46.399> for<00:00:47.399> example

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
take a look at our examples for example

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.900 
take a look at our examples for example
number<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.840> six<00:00:49.140> times<00:00:49.500> point<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.430> so

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
number one I have six times point one so

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.459 
number one I have six times point one so
I'm<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.480> multiply<00:00:51.899> as<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.140> there<00:00:52.320> were

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
I'm going to multiply as if there were

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.680 
I'm going to multiply as if there were
no<00:00:52.680> decimals<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.250> that's<00:00:53.489> actually<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:54.149> six

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
no decimals so that's actually just six

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.660 
no decimals so that's actually just six
times<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.760> six<00:00:56.760> times<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.570> six<00:00:58.520> if<00:00:59.520> we

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
times one six times one is six if we

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
times one six times one is six if we
take<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> look<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.539> our<00:01:01.489> problem<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.300> one

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
take a look at our problem we have one

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.620 
take a look at our problem we have one
decimal<00:01:04.260> place<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:05.100> our<00:01:05.280> factors<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.540> I'm

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
decimal place in our factors so I'm

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.480 
decimal place in our factors so I'm
going<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.810> start<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.439> right<00:01:07.650> go<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
going to start on the right go to the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789 
going to start on the right go to the
left<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.270> place<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.990> means<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.320> decimal

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
left one place so that means my decimal

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.160 
left one place so that means my decimal
is<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.810> means<00:01:12.990> my

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
is going to be here so that means my

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.480 
is going to be here so that means my
final<00:01:13.590> answer<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.570> six<00:01:15.570> times<00:01:16.490> if

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
final answer is going to be six times if

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.210 
final answer is going to be six times if
I<00:01:17.610> check<00:01:17.909> my<00:01:18.090> answer<00:01:18.509> using<00:01:18.810> estimation<00:01:19.650> I'm

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
I check my answer using estimation I'm

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.130 
I check my answer using estimation I'm
going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> estimate<00:01:20.759> six<00:01:21.210> two<00:01:21.450> six<00:01:21.659> because

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
going to estimate six two six because

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.890 
going to estimate six two six because
it's<00:01:22.320> already<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.270> one<00:01:24.270> tenth<00:01:24.659> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it's already there and one tenth is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.710 
it's already there and one tenth is
closest<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> zero<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.310> six<00:01:26.640> times<00:01:26.939> zero<00:01:27.150> gives

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
closest to zero so six times zero gives

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.679 
closest to zero so six times zero gives
me<00:01:27.930> an<00:01:28.020> answer<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.610> zero<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> think

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
me an answer of zero and if you think

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.179 
me an answer of zero and if you think
about<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> those<00:01:31.320> numbers<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:31.979> actually

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
about it those numbers are actually

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.569 
about it those numbers are actually
pretty<00:01:32.700> close<00:01:33.000> together<00:01:34.070> let's<00:01:35.070> take<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> look

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
pretty close together let's take a look

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.510 
pretty close together let's take a look
at<00:01:35.729> number<00:01:36.030> two<00:01:36.329> number<00:01:36.750> two<00:01:37.229> says<00:01:37.680> negative<00:01:37.979> 3

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
at number two number two says negative 3

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.440 
at number two number two says negative 3
times<00:01:39.150> positive<00:01:39.560> three<00:01:40.560> point<00:01:40.890> oh<00:01:41.100> three<00:01:41.490> I'm

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
times positive three point oh three I'm

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.210 
times positive three point oh three I'm
going<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.780> start<00:01:43.020> off<00:01:43.200> by<00:01:43.229> going<00:01:43.829> ahead<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
going to start off by going ahead and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.620 
going to start off by going ahead and
putting<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.670> sleeping<00:01:45.060> dog<00:01:45.210> because

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
putting my sleeping dog because

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.600 
putting my sleeping dog because
sometimes<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.290> forget<00:01:46.500> once<00:01:46.920> I've<00:01:47.100> done<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.430> my

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
sometimes I forget once I've done all my

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.490 
sometimes I forget once I've done all my
work<00:01:48.119> with<00:01:48.329> my<00:01:48.450> decimals<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.290> actually

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
work with my decimals that I actually

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.830 
work with my decimals that I actually
had<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.280> negative<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> positive<00:01:51.149> there

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
had a not negative and a positive there

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.560 
had a not negative and a positive there
so<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> negative<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.540> positive

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
so if I have a negative and a positive

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.359 
so if I have a negative and a positive
that<00:01:55.229> means<00:01:55.380> my<00:01:55.590> answer<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.219> come

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
that means my answer is going to come

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.240 
that means my answer is going to come
out<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> negative<00:01:57.649> now<00:01:58.649> let's<00:01:58.890> go<00:01:59.009> through

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
out as a negative now let's go through

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.399 
out as a negative now let's go through
and<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.460> our<00:01:59.579> multiplication<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.290> going

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
and do our multiplication and I'm going

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.780 
and do our multiplication and I'm going
to<00:02:01.469> multiply<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.250> were<00:02:02.399> no<00:02:02.610> decimals

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
to multiply as if there were no decimals

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.179 
to multiply as if there were no decimals
so<00:02:03.090> I'm<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.570> three<00:02:03.930> times<00:02:04.469> three

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
so I'm going to do three times three

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.910 
so I'm going to do three times three
hundred<00:02:05.520> three<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:07.140> I'm<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.530> three

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
hundred three so I'm going to do three

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.260 
hundred three so I'm going to do three
hundred<00:02:08.459> three<00:02:08.959> times<00:02:09.959> 3<00:02:10.890> 3<00:02:11.760> times<00:02:11.849> three

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
hundred three times 3 3 times three

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.090 
hundred three times 3 3 times three
gives<00:02:12.300> me<00:02:12.690> nine

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
gives me nine

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.900 
gives me nine
that<00:02:13.820> gives<00:02:14.060> me<00:02:14.150> zero<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:15.230> gives<00:02:15.260> me<00:02:15.680> nine<00:02:15.920> so

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
that gives me zero that gives me nine so

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.660 
that gives me zero that gives me nine so
now<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.120> need<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.540> go<00:02:17.660> through<00:02:18.020> my<00:02:18.340> factors<00:02:19.340> and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
now I need to go through my factors and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.660 
now I need to go through my factors and
I<00:02:19.760> have<00:02:20.000> two<00:02:20.330> decimal<00:02:21.260> places<00:02:21.680> here<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:22.550> I'm

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
I have two decimal places here so I'm

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.640 
I have two decimal places here so I'm
going<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.000> start<00:02:23.270> from<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.540> right<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.500> have

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
going to start from the right and I have

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.340 
going to start from the right and I have
two<00:02:24.860> decimal<00:02:25.100> places<00:02:25.550> here<00:02:26.180> don't<00:02:26.960> forget<00:02:27.140> I

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
two decimal places here don't forget I

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.860 
two decimal places here don't forget I
figured<00:02:27.770> out<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.040> was<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.220> negative<00:02:28.820> so<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.750> is

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
figured out it was a negative so it is

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.010 
figured out it was a negative so it is
going<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.410> negative<00:02:30.770> nine<00:02:31.520> point<00:02:32.210> zero

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
going to be a negative nine point zero

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.790 
going to be a negative nine point zero
nine<00:02:34.060> gonna<00:02:35.060> use<00:02:35.240> estimation<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.200> check<00:02:36.500> I

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
nine gonna use estimation to check I

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.080 
nine gonna use estimation to check I
have<00:02:37.070> negative<00:02:37.400> 3<00:02:38.180> times<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.820> 3.0<00:02:40.820> three

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
have negative 3 times and 3.0 three

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.690 
have negative 3 times and 3.0 three
rounds<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.480> three<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.650> negative<00:02:43.040> 3<00:02:43.340> times

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
rounds to three so negative 3 times

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.870 
rounds to three so negative 3 times
positive<00:02:44.060> 3<00:02:44.660> gives<00:02:44.990> me<00:02:45.170> negative<00:02:45.380> nine<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:46.640> you

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
positive 3 gives me negative nine if you

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.150 
positive 3 gives me negative nine if you
notice<00:02:47.240> my<00:02:47.270> actual<00:02:47.930> answer<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.290> very<00:02:48.770> close<00:02:49.130> to

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
notice my actual answer is very close to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.920 
notice my actual answer is very close to
my<00:02:49.490> estimated<00:02:50.450> answer<00:02:52.000> number<00:02:53.000> three<00:02:53.510> I'm

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
my estimated answer number three I'm

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.590 
my estimated answer number three I'm
going<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.470> multiply<00:02:54.980> negative<00:02:55.760> two<00:02:56.300> point

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
going to multiply negative two point

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.020 
going to multiply negative two point
seven<00:02:57.050> eight<00:02:57.200> times<00:02:57.710> positive<00:02:58.460> so<00:02:58.700> once<00:02:58.880> again

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
seven eight times positive so once again

times positive gives me an answer of a

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.950 
times positive gives me an answer of a
negative<00:03:04.330> take<00:03:05.330> out<00:03:05.510> my<00:03:05.630> decimals<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.850> 278

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
negative take out my decimals so 278

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.660 
negative take out my decimals so 278
times<00:03:08.980> 28<00:03:10.660> 8<00:03:11.660> times<00:03:11.960> 8<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.230> 64<00:03:13.120> 8<00:03:14.120> times<00:03:14.480> 7<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.960> 56

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
times 28 8 times 8 is 64 8 times 7 is 56

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:23.650 
times 28 8 times 8 is 64 8 times 7 is 56
plus<00:03:16.670> 6<00:03:17.030> gives<00:03:17.300> me<00:03:18.190> 62<00:03:19.570> 8<00:03:20.570> times<00:03:20.990> 2<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.350> 16<00:03:22.660> plus

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
plus 6 gives me 62 8 times 2 is 16 plus

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:32.110 
plus 6 gives me 62 8 times 2 is 16 plus
6<00:03:24.130> gives<00:03:25.130> me<00:03:25.400> 22<00:03:27.700> 2<00:03:28.700> times<00:03:29.000> 8<00:03:29.270> again<00:03:29.660> is<00:03:29.810> 16<00:03:31.120> that

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
6 gives me 22 2 times 8 again is 16 that

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.650 
6 gives me 22 2 times 8 again is 16 that
gives<00:03:32.330> me<00:03:32.420> 14<00:03:32.990> plus<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.440> 1<00:03:33.590> is<00:03:33.770> 15<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.660> then

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
gives me 14 plus the 1 is 15 and then

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.560 
gives me 14 plus the 1 is 15 and then
that<00:03:35.900> gives<00:03:36.110> me<00:03:36.380> five<00:03:37.250> so<00:03:37.880> if<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:38.060> add<00:03:38.240> them<00:03:38.420> all

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
that gives me five so if I add them all

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.680 
that gives me five so if I add them all
together<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:38.990> get<00:03:39.290> 4<00:03:39.670> eight<00:03:41.050> seven<00:03:42.050> and<00:03:42.580> seven

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
together I get 4 eight seven and seven

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.360 
together I get 4 eight seven and seven
don't<00:03:44.690> forget<00:03:44.990> to<00:03:45.080> bring<00:03:45.260> down<00:03:45.410> your<00:03:45.770> negative

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
don't forget to bring down your negative

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.390 
don't forget to bring down your negative
sign<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.150> now<00:03:48.020> let's<00:03:48.230> place<00:03:48.500> our<00:03:48.680> decimals<00:03:49.220> so

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
sign and now let's place our decimals so

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.610 
sign and now let's place our decimals so
we<00:03:49.520> have<00:03:49.610> one<00:03:49.910> two<00:03:50.240> three<00:03:51.820> three<00:03:52.820> total<00:03:53.620> places

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
we have one two three three total places

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.440 
we have one two three three total places
decimal<00:03:55.100> places<00:03:55.310> in<00:03:55.580> my<00:03:55.700> factors<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.390> I'm

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
decimal places in my factors so I'm

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.550 
decimal places in my factors so I'm
going<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.690> do<00:03:56.810> one<00:03:57.110> two<00:03:58.360> three<00:03:59.360> in<00:03:59.690> my<00:04:00.080> answer

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
going to do one two three in my answer

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.490 
going to do one two three in my answer
so<00:04:00.800> my<00:04:01.580> final<00:04:01.880> answer<00:04:02.210> is<00:04:02.480> negative<00:04:02.900> seven

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
so my final answer is negative seven

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.110 
so my final answer is negative seven

to check negative two point seven eight

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.650 
to check negative two point seven eight
rounds<00:04:11.600> two<00:04:11.750> negative<00:04:12.170> three<00:04:12.670> times<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.090> 2.8

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
rounds two negative three times and 2.8

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.550 
rounds two negative three times and 2.8
is<00:04:14.840> 3<00:04:15.700> negative<00:04:16.700> 3<00:04:17.180> times<00:04:17.540> positive<00:04:17.810> 3<00:04:18.350> once

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
is 3 negative 3 times positive 3 once

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.190 
is 3 negative 3 times positive 3 once
again<00:04:18.859> gives<00:04:19.130> me<00:04:19.340> negative<00:04:19.520> nine<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.720> all

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
again gives me negative nine and all

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.020 
again gives me negative nine and all
those<00:04:21.410> aren't<00:04:21.710> really<00:04:22.010> close<00:04:22.400> because<00:04:22.700> it's

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
those aren't really close because it's

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.340 
those aren't really close because it's
multiplication<00:04:23.419> they're<00:04:23.990> going<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.169> be<00:04:24.320> a

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
multiplication they're going to be a

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.940 
multiplication they're going to be a
little<00:04:24.560> bit<00:04:24.740> further<00:04:25.010> off<00:04:25.100> than<00:04:25.460> they<00:04:25.580> were

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
little bit further off than they were

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.950 
little bit further off than they were
addition<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.490> subtraction<00:04:27.120> they're<00:04:27.660> still

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
addition and subtraction they're still

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.870 
addition and subtraction they're still
relatively<00:04:28.410> close<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:29.160> more<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.520> get<00:04:29.700> that

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
relatively close it's more to get that

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.490 
relatively close it's more to get that
correct<00:04:30.450> decimal<00:04:31.130> location<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:33.810> number<00:04:34.140> four

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
correct decimal location so number four

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
correct decimal location so number four
I<00:04:34.740> have<00:04:35.070> negative<00:04:35.930> 7/10<00:04:36.930> times<00:04:37.260> negative<00:04:37.560> 8/10

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
I have negative 7/10 times negative 8/10

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.960 
I have negative 7/10 times negative 8/10
so<00:04:38.670> this<00:04:38.820> is<00:04:38.970> going<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.210> be<00:04:39.300> 7<00:04:39.750> times<00:04:40.560> 8<00:04:41.010> which

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
so this is going to be 7 times 8 which

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.320 
so this is going to be 7 times 8 which
gives<00:04:42.000> me<00:04:42.890> 56<00:04:44.390> to<00:04:45.390> place<00:04:45.630> my<00:04:45.870> decimal<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.590> have<00:04:46.890> 1

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
gives me 56 to place my decimal I have 1

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.080 
gives me 56 to place my decimal I have 1
2<00:04:48.350> so<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.380> have<00:04:49.530> 1<00:04:50.040> 2<00:04:51.920> so<00:04:52.920> my<00:04:53.040> answer<00:04:53.460> is<00:04:53.490> zero

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
2 so I have 1 2 so my answer is zero

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.980 
2 so I have 1 2 so my answer is zero
point<00:04:54.510> 5<00:04:54.810> 6<00:04:55.230> or<00:04:55.500> 56<00:04:56.160> hundredths<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:56.910> I<00:04:57.840> almost

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
point 5 6 or 56 hundredths and I almost

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.580 
point 5 6 or 56 hundredths and I almost
forgot<00:04:58.380> about<00:04:58.440> my<00:04:58.800> sleeping<00:04:59.280> dog<00:04:59.490> a<00:05:00.590> negative

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
forgot about my sleeping dog a negative

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.890 
forgot about my sleeping dog a negative
and<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:02.010> negative<00:05:02.040> gives<00:05:02.610> me<00:05:02.850> a<00:05:02.880> positive<00:05:03.240> so<00:05:03.780> it

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
and a negative gives me a positive so it

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.740 
and a negative gives me a positive so it
is<00:05:03.990> a<00:05:04.020> positive<00:05:04.410> 56<00:05:05.310> hundredths<00:05:05.850> to<00:05:06.630> use

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
is a positive 56 hundredths to use

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.510 
is a positive 56 hundredths to use
estimation<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.620> check<00:05:07.860> if<00:05:08.040> I<00:05:08.160> round<00:05:08.430> that

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
estimation to check if I round that

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.330 
estimation to check if I round that
that's<00:05:08.940> gonna<00:05:09.120> give<00:05:09.360> me<00:05:09.390> negative<00:05:09.930> 1<00:05:10.340> by

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
that's gonna give me negative 1 by

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.950 
that's gonna give me negative 1 by
around<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:11.820> that's<00:05:12.060> also<00:05:12.480> gonna<00:05:12.630> give<00:05:12.870> me

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
around that that's also gonna give me

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.260

negative 1 negative 1 times negative 1

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.180 
negative 1 negative 1 times negative 1
gives<00:05:15.420> me<00:05:15.930> positive<00:05:16.530> 1<00:05:17.040> so<00:05:18.740> take<00:05:19.740> a<00:05:19.770> look<00:05:19.980> over

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
gives me positive 1 so take a look over
