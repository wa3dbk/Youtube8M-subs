00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.760
 Let's start with the ingredients people two cups of milk 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.710
 half a cup of oil three cups of sweet sprinkles 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 50 grams of grated parmesan cheese a teaspoon of salt 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:50.859
 and two eggs. Let's take it to the fire, milk and oil 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:59.050
 Let's get the boil boiling a lot, that's the way it is. 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.019
 so that the dough is scalded I put the sprinkle 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.159
 now I will put the milk and the oil very hot 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:36.079
 mix well until we blend to be able to use our hands 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:51.040
 now I'm going to use my hands, let's knead 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:02:08.119
 now I will put the other ingredients mixing always 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:55.440
 Now let's knead until the dough is soft 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:11.740
 The secret is to make the pasta well. The pasta is already perfect. 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.730

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:33.890
 Now let's model our cheese rolls 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:41.170
 the best way of dividing the mass 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.610
 It's like this, I give birth to half, then half 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:04:04.400
 half and do the same with each serving 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:22.630
