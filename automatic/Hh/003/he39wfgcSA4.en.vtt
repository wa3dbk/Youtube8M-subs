so first let's say file new this Navy CL

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.759 
so first let's say file new this Navy CL
C++<00:00:08.920> builder<00:00:09.309> application<00:00:10.590> will<00:00:11.590> put<00:00:11.740> a

application or compile it and run the
C++<00:01:22.250> application<00:01:22.910> I'll<00:01:23.270> have<00:01:23.690> a<00:01:23.890> simple

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
C++ application I'll have a simple

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.250 
C++ application I'll have a simple
metropolis<00:01:25.520> looking<00:01:26.650> C++<00:01:27.650> example<00:01:28.990> with<00:01:29.990> all

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
metropolis looking C++ example with all

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.780 
metropolis looking C++ example with all
the<00:01:30.470> right<00:01:30.620> styles<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.250> colors<00:01:31.580> available

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
the right styles and colors available

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.380 
the right styles and colors available
course<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.360> first<00:01:32.540> time<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:34.060> then<00:01:35.060> I<00:01:35.090> build

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
course the first time that then I build

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.180 
course the first time that then I build
it<00:01:35.570> it's<00:01:35.720> gonna<00:01:35.870> build<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.200> pre<00:01:36.350> compiler<00:01:36.860> file

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
it it's gonna build a pre compiler file

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.240 
it it's gonna build a pre compiler file
and<00:01:37.520> it's<00:01:38.390> going<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.930> compile<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:40.070> project

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
and it's going to compile the project

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.100 
and it's going to compile the project
and<00:01:40.700> then<00:01:40.850> subsequent<00:01:41.480> bills<00:01:41.659> will<00:01:41.810> be<00:01:41.840> better

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
and then subsequent bills will be better

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.690 
and then subsequent bills will be better
so<00:01:42.320> here's<00:01:42.560> now<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.770> green<00:01:43.040> style<00:01:43.370> and<00:01:43.640> I've

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
so here's now the green style and I've

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.600 
so here's now the green style and I've
got<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.880> button<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:44.510> can<00:01:45.050> click<00:01:45.260> on<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.680> I<00:01:46.400> can

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
got a button I can click on and I can

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.760 
got a button I can click on and I can
hit<00:01:46.820> alt<00:01:47.360> f4<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:48.229> quit

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
hit alt f4 to quit

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.219 
hit alt f4 to quit
so<00:01:49.280> again<00:01:49.610> Windows<00:01:50.030> 8<00:01:50.300> style<00:01:50.690> or<00:01:50.930> metropolis

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
so again Windows 8 style or metropolis

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.460 
so again Windows 8 style or metropolis
UI<00:01:51.710> style<00:01:52.070> are<00:01:52.400> full<00:01:52.729> screen<00:01:53.470> applications

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
UI style are full screen applications

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.770 
UI style are full screen applications
and<00:01:54.950> we<00:01:55.070> could<00:01:55.220> add<00:01:55.370> a<00:01:55.400> toolbar<00:01:56.240> if<00:01:56.360> we<00:01:56.510> want

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
and we could add a toolbar if we want

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.010 
and we could add a toolbar if we want
and<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:58.430> other<00:01:58.700> things<00:01:59.000> but<00:01:59.240> it'll<00:01:59.540> convert

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
and and other things but it'll convert

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.130 
and and other things but it'll convert
all<00:02:00.260> of<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.560> application<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.400> have<00:02:01.610> that<00:02:01.790> look

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
all of the application to have that look

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.260 
all of the application to have that look
now<00:02:03.140> same<00:02:03.590> thing<00:02:03.620> goes<00:02:04.100> for<00:02:04.400> fire<00:02:05.060> monkey

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
now same thing goes for fire monkey

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.139 
now same thing goes for fire monkey
application<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.799> if<00:02:06.950> I<00:02:07.040> say<00:02:07.220> filed<00:02:07.520> new<00:02:07.820> fire

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
application so if I say filed new fire

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.399 
application so if I say filed new fire

project that you convert from and then

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.260 
project that you convert from and then
you<00:05:37.340> can<00:05:37.670> in<00:05:37.790> do<00:05:37.940> a<00:05:37.970> build<00:05:38.300> of<00:05:38.600> a<00:05:38.750> of<00:05:39.320> a

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
you can in do a build of a of a

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
apply button would would be a better

apply button would would be a better
