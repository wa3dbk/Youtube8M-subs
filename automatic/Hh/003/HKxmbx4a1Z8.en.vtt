think<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> two<00:00:31.620> biggest<00:00:31.860> challenges<00:00:32.279> that

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
think the two biggest challenges that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.639 
think the two biggest challenges that
face<00:00:32.640> me<00:00:32.850> today<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.450> working<00:00:34.050> continuously

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
face me today is working continuously

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.740 
face me today is working continuously
about<00:00:34.980> building<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.430> brand<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
about building my brand and I think the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.329 
about building my brand and I think the
importance<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.289> that<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.620> how<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:38.039> I<00:00:38.129> offer

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
importance in that is how can I offer

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.970 
importance in that is how can I offer
and<00:00:38.640> explain<00:00:39.089> a<00:00:39.379> differentiated<00:00:40.379> service<00:00:40.800> in

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and explain a differentiated service in

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.040 
and explain a differentiated service in
a<00:00:41.039> very<00:00:41.219> competitive<00:00:41.550> marketplace<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.539> think

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
a very competitive marketplace I think

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.599 
a very competitive marketplace I think
the<00:00:43.109> other<00:00:43.260> challenge<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
the other challenge is really the

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.549 
the other challenge is really the
digital<00:00:44.940> workflow<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.570> how<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:46.019> can<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.409> an

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
digital workflow and how I can have an

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.410 
digital workflow and how I can have an
integrated<00:00:46.859> workflow<00:00:47.579> that's<00:00:47.760> efficient<00:00:48.269> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
integrated workflow that's efficient and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.270 
integrated workflow that's efficient and
effective<00:00:48.659> and<00:00:49.019> enables<00:00:49.710> me<00:00:49.859> to<00:00:49.890> always

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
various options that I want so that I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.550 
various options that I want so that I
have<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> platform<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.810> support<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.260> image

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
have a platform to support my image

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.499

making<00:01:07.800> I<00:01:08.159> always<00:01:08.580> find<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.090> little<00:01:09.299> bit

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
making I always find it a little bit

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:10.969 
making I always find it a little bit
difficult<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.960> describe<00:01:10.290> my<00:01:10.530> style<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.950> think

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
difficult to describe my style I think

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.530 
difficult to describe my style I think
that's<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.640> really<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.060> blend<00:01:12.329> of

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that's because it's really a blend of

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.510 
that's because it's really a blend of
three<00:01:12.719> key<00:01:13.049> things<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.950> first<00:01:14.219> thing<00:01:14.399> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
three key things the first thing is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.969 
three key things the first thing is
really<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.880> documentary<00:01:15.689> element<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.710> being

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
really a documentary element it's being

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.550 
really a documentary element it's being
able<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.310> witness<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.939> observe<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.570> person<00:01:19.380> or

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
able to witness and observe a person or

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.440 
able to witness and observe a person or
an<00:01:19.740> event<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.579> second<00:01:21.000> part<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.420> really

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
an event the second part is really

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.660 
an event the second part is really
creating<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.409> great<00:01:22.680> very<00:01:23.369> strong

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
creating just great very strong

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.209 
creating just great very strong
portraits<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.360> people<00:01:24.770> portraits<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> tell
