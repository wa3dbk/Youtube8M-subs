00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
they're just trying to stray away from

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.319 
they're just trying to stray away from
the<00:00:58.140> SMGs<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.800> little<00:00:59.219> bit<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.030> said

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the SMGs a little bit with that said

the SMGs a little bit with that said
however<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.170> next<00:01:01.500> map<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.920> my<00:01:02.160> opinion<00:01:02.460> is

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
however the next map in my opinion is

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.570 
however the next map in my opinion is
going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> be<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> most<00:01:03.510> SMG<00:01:04.170> friendly<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:05.280> of

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
going to be the most SMG friendly out of

the four and this is grind it takes

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.100 
the four and this is grind it takes

that you have the map is half pipes and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.600 
that you have the map is half pipes and
skateboard<00:01:12.420> ramps<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.799> can't<00:01:14.490> really

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
skateboard ramps that you can't really

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
be none of that you know a lot of the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.960 
be none of that you know a lot of the
fighting<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.490> out<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> open

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
fighting is going to be out in the open

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.850 
fighting is going to be out in the open
this<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.329> where<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.960> SMGs<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
this is where I think the SMGs and the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.770 
this is where I think the SMGs and the
shotguns<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> shine<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> do

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
shotguns are going to shine but I do

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.010 
shotguns are going to shine but I do
think<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.159> only<00:01:35.340> map<00:01:35.670> where

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
think that this is the only map where

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.899 
think that this is the only map where
it's<00:01:37.020> really<00:01:37.320> gonna<00:01:37.500> showcase<00:01:37.909> close-quarter

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
it's really gonna showcase close-quarter

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.760 
it's really gonna showcase close-quarter
battles<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.720> there<00:01:39.960> won't<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.290> close<00:01:40.500> quarter

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
battles not there won't be close quarter

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.200 
battles not there won't be close quarter
encounters<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> other<00:01:41.369> maps<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:42.000> think

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
encounters the other maps I just think

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.819 
encounters the other maps I just think
that<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> only<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that this is the only one out of the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.530 
that this is the only one out of the
four<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.460> encourages<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
four that really encourages it so the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.889 
four that really encourages it so the
next<00:01:45.780> map<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.320> downhill<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> only<00:01:48.180> snow

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
next map is downhill it is the only snow

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.109 
next map is downhill it is the only snow
map<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.350> black<00:01:49.530> ops<00:01:49.770> 2<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> you

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
map in black ops 2 so this is the you

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.139 
map in black ops 2 so this is the you
know<00:01:51.210> first<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:52.350> black<00:01:52.920> ops<00:01:52.950> 2<00:01:53.399> they<00:01:53.700> didn't

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
know first for black ops 2 they didn't

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.969 
know first for black ops 2 they didn't
implement<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.810> snow<00:01:55.110> map<00:01:55.320> before<00:01:55.530> which<00:01:55.829> I'm

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
implement a snow map before which I'm

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.319 
implement a snow map before which I'm
pretty<00:01:56.100> sure<00:01:56.219> they<00:01:56.430> did<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.759> every<00:01:56.939> other<00:01:57.060> game

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
pretty sure they did in every other game

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.510 
pretty sure they did in every other game
upon<00:01:58.020> release<00:01:58.170> every<00:01:58.619> other<00:01:58.740> call<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.130> duty<00:01:59.340> so

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
upon release every other call of duty so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.459 
upon release every other call of duty so
it's<00:01:59.670> kind<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.909> interesting<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.630> map<00:02:01.439> is

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
it's kind of interesting and this map is

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.050 
it's kind of interesting and this map is
gonna<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> lot<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.189> long<00:02:02.460> lines<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.820> sites

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
gonna have a lot of long lines of sites

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.700 
gonna have a lot of long lines of sites
a<00:02:03.180> lot<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.540> vantage<00:02:03.840> points<00:02:04.200> once<00:02:04.409> again<00:02:04.680> I

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
a lot of vantage points once again I

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.410 
a lot of vantage points once again I
feel<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.340> assault<00:02:05.640> rifles<00:02:06.000> are<00:02:06.119> going<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.299> be

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
feel like assault rifles are going to be

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.389 
feel like assault rifles are going to be
really<00:02:07.259> really<00:02:07.380> strong<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.979> map<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.310> can

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
really really strong this map you can

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.979 
really really strong this map you can
just<00:02:08.580> take<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.759> look<00:02:08.970> at<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.149> pictures<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.750> see

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
just take a look at the pictures and see

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.110 
just take a look at the pictures and see
how<00:02:10.200> open<00:02:10.770> everything<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:12.090> know

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
how open everything is and you know

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.610 
how open everything is and you know
these<00:02:12.510> long<00:02:12.690> lines<00:02:12.840> size<00:02:13.170> definitely

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
these long lines size definitely

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.589 
these long lines size definitely
leave<00:02:13.769> me<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.950> believe<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:15.000> there's<00:02:15.480> going

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
leave me to believe that there's going

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.210 
leave me to believe that there's going
to<00:02:15.690> be<00:02:15.750> control<00:02:16.319> points<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.920> are<00:02:17.040> going<00:02:17.159> to

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
to be control points that are going to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.380 
to be control points that are going to
be<00:02:17.340> really<00:02:17.670> really<00:02:17.700> strong<00:02:18.150> really

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
be really really strong really

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.899 
be really really strong really
beneficial<00:02:18.930> if<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.650> hold<00:02:19.799> down<00:02:19.920> hold

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
beneficial if you can hold down hold

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.220 
beneficial if you can hold down hold
them<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.390> your<00:02:21.510> team<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.720> obviously

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
them down for your team and obviously

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.780 
them down for your team and obviously
this<00:02:22.379> is<00:02:22.530> where<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.799> long<00:02:23.010> line<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.250> sites<00:02:23.580> and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
this is where the long line of sites and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.140 
this is where the long line of sites and
the<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.840> know<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.379> soul<00:02:25.560> rifles<00:02:25.950> come<00:02:26.129> in<00:02:26.280> and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the you know the soul rifles come in and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.430 
the you know the soul rifles come in and
on<00:02:27.450> top<00:02:27.629> of<00:02:27.659> that<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.900> going<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.230> some

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
on top of that is going to be some

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.170 
on top of that is going to be some
gondolas<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.129> could<00:02:29.220> actually<00:02:29.370> move<00:02:29.700> you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
gondolas that could actually move you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.729 
gondolas that could actually move you
use<00:02:30.420> them<00:02:30.569> as<00:02:30.720> cover<00:02:30.959> if<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.230> want<00:02:31.440> I'll<00:02:31.620> be

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
use them as cover if you want I'll be

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.100 
use them as cover if you want I'll be
kind<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.980> weird<00:02:32.129> moving<00:02:32.940> cover<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.390> mean<00:02:33.810> that's

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
kind of weird moving cover I mean that's

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.229 
kind of weird moving cover I mean that's
kind<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.440> cool<00:02:34.560> actually<00:02:34.799> it's<00:02:35.370> possible<00:02:35.940> as<00:02:36.180> a

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
kind of cool actually it's possible as a

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.550 
kind of cool actually it's possible as a
cool<00:02:36.510> thing<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.750> implement<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.290> into<00:02:37.409> your

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
cool thing to implement it into your

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.559 
cool thing to implement it into your
play<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.769> guess<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.310> they<00:02:38.940> can't<00:02:39.150> kill<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.510> if

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
play I guess and they can't kill you if

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.970 
play I guess and they can't kill you if
they<00:02:39.629> splatter<00:02:39.959> used<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.560> careful

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
they splatter used to just be careful

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.309 
they splatter used to just be careful
and<00:02:41.190> once<00:02:41.430> again<00:02:41.549> this<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:42.200> reflects<00:02:43.200> that

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
and once again this this reflects that

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.830 
and once again this this reflects that
they<00:02:43.500> want<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.950> add<00:02:44.310> some<00:02:45.000> more<00:02:45.120> interactive

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
they want to add some more interactive

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.240 
they want to add some more interactive
elements<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.470> map<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.769> feel<00:02:46.950> like<00:02:47.040> that's

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
elements to the map I feel like that's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.410 
elements to the map I feel like that's
one<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.609> things<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:48.030> they're<00:02:48.239> really

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
one of the things that they're really

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.940 
one of the things that they're really
trying<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.840> do<00:02:49.019> through<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:49.379> map<00:02:49.590> pack<00:02:49.799> you

be<00:03:15.750> they<00:03:16.290> really<00:03:16.560> wanted<00:03:16.859> to<00:03:16.920> make<00:03:17.159> this<00:03:17.310> a

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
be they really wanted to make this a

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.699 
be they really wanted to make this a
diverse<00:03:18.209> map<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.720> could<00:03:18.840> use<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.620> know

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
diverse map you could use you know

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.620 
diverse map you could use you know
different<00:03:19.919> kinds<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:20.579> setups<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.090> they

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
different kinds of setups and they

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.000 
different kinds of setups and they
really<00:03:22.169> feel<00:03:22.290> like<00:03:22.349> this<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.650> going<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.889> be<00:03:22.980> a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
really feel like this is going to be a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.890 
really feel like this is going to be a
probably<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.880> most<00:03:24.060> balanced<00:03:24.510> out<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.810> the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
probably the most balanced out of the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.170 
probably the most balanced out of the
mall<00:03:25.109> where<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.709> could<00:03:25.859> use<00:03:26.040> anything<00:03:26.579> that

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
mall where you could use anything that

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.629 
mall where you could use anything that
you<00:03:27.329> enjoy<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.930> do<00:03:28.530> well<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:29.040> an<00:03:29.129> extent<00:03:29.459> you

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
you enjoy and do well to an extent you

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:30.920 
you enjoy and do well to an extent you
know<00:03:29.730> obviously<00:03:29.879> I'm<00:03:30.329> sure<00:03:30.510> there's<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:30.780> to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
know obviously I'm sure there's going to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.599 
know obviously I'm sure there's going to
be<00:03:30.959> certain<00:03:31.260> classes<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:32.069> certain<00:03:32.280> setups

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
be certain classes and certain setups

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.159 
be certain classes and certain setups
that<00:03:32.669> come<00:03:32.879> up<00:03:33.000> for<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.599> map<00:03:33.810> just<00:03:33.959> like

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
that come up for this map just like

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.890 
that come up for this map just like
every<00:03:34.410> map<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.889> tend<00:03:35.669> to<00:03:35.879> be<00:03:36.299> stronger<00:03:36.780> than

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
every map that tend to be stronger than

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.039 
every map that tend to be stronger than
the<00:03:37.049> rest<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.859> feel<00:03:38.819> like<00:03:38.970> they<00:03:39.180> did<00:03:39.239> try<00:03:39.750> to

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
the rest so I feel like they did try to

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.409 
the rest so I feel like they did try to
make<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.530> as<00:03:40.799> balanced<00:03:41.669> as<00:03:41.760> possible<00:03:42.209> but<00:03:42.359> we

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
make it as balanced as possible but we

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.180 
make it as balanced as possible but we
will<00:03:42.569> see<00:03:42.720> what<00:03:42.810> happens<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.260> know<00:03:43.379> dlc<00:03:44.069> is

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
right around the corner we should be

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.970 
right around the corner we should be
seeing<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.049> by<00:03:46.169> the<00:03:46.230> end<00:03:46.349> of<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.620> month<00:03:46.739> so
