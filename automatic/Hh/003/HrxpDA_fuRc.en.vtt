with<00:00:50.100> slight<00:00:50.550> experiments<00:00:51.180> level<00:00:51.510> not

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
with slight experiments level not

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.630 
with slight experiments level not
creative<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.500> ready<00:00:53.510> yeah<00:00:55.070> yeah<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.579> just

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
creative you ready yeah yeah that just

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.869 
creative you ready yeah yeah that just
happened<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.530> mines<00:00:58.739> everything<00:00:59.460> like

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
happened so it's mines everything like

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.709 
happened so it's mines everything like
as<00:01:00.420> fast<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.079> gots<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.879> obsidian<00:01:02.879> mouse

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
as fast so you gots and obsidian mouse

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.830 
as fast so you gots and obsidian mouse
assuming<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.920> mine<00:01:05.430> bedrock<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.390> it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
assuming I can mine bedrock you can it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
assuming I can mine bedrock you can it
carries<00:01:07.200> they<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:08.010> damage<00:01:08.400> but<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.760> only
