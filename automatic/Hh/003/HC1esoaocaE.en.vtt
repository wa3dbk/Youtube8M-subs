in<00:00:33.989> my<00:00:34.920> opinion<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.329> highest<00:00:36.870> chance<00:00:37.170> of

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
in my opinion the highest chance of

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.959 
in my opinion the highest chance of
getting<00:00:37.620> Leon<00:00:37.890> sank<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.309> suppose<00:00:38.550> obviously

the one with the most money and that is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
the one with the most money and that is
a<00:00:40.170> legendary<00:00:40.530> pack<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.820> think<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.270> gonna

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
a legendary pack and I think I'm gonna

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I think I'm gonna go ahead and do that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.540 
I think I'm gonna go ahead and do that
the<00:00:48.870> second<00:00:49.350> thing<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.590> he's<00:00:50.129> gonna<00:00:50.250> come

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the second thing that he's gonna come

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.939 
the second thing that he's gonna come
out<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:51.140> which<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.289> don't<00:00:52.500> think<00:00:52.739> there's<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
out of which I don't think there's a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.420 
out of which I don't think there's a
high<00:00:53.129> chance<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> offseason<00:00:54.030> bundle

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
high chance of is the offseason bundle

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.170 
high chance of is the offseason bundle
basically<00:00:56.430> you're<00:00:56.550> either<00:00:56.670> gonna<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:56.969> from

basically you're either gonna get from

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.029 
basically you're either gonna get from
the<00:00:57.270> legends<00:00:57.690> or<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> offseasons

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the legends or the offseasons

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.319 
the legends or the offseasons
there's<00:00:59.370> no<00:00:59.579> way<00:00:59.699> they're<00:00:59.820> gonna<00:00:59.879> get<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.210> out

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
there's no way they're gonna get it out

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.150 
there's no way they're gonna get it out
