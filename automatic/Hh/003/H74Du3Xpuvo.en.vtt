00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
the hunt just a tremendous morning so

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.140 
the hunt just a tremendous morning so
we're<00:06:12.250> guessing<00:06:12.460> these<00:06:12.610> three<00:06:12.849> and<00:06:12.940> a<00:06:12.970> half

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
we're guessing these three and a half

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.480 
we're guessing these three and a half
we're<00:06:13.419> know<00:06:13.570> pretty<00:06:13.780> soon<00:06:14.490> basal

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
we're know pretty soon basal

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.920 
we're know pretty soon basal
circumference<00:06:16.030> there's<00:06:16.300> a<00:06:16.360> good<00:06:16.510> indicator

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
circumference there's a good indicator

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.330 
circumference there's a good indicator
of<00:06:17.020> age<00:06:17.199> and<00:06:17.560> if<00:06:17.620> it's<00:06:17.770> bigger<00:06:18.010> in<00:06:18.130> the<00:06:18.190> eyes

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
of age and if it's bigger in the eyes

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.040 
of age and if it's bigger in the eyes
you<00:06:18.669> can<00:06:18.699> see<00:06:19.000> it<00:06:19.120> is<00:06:19.270> it's<00:06:19.510> usually<00:06:19.659> three<00:06:19.930> and

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
you can see it is it's usually three and

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.649 
you can see it is it's usually three and
a<00:06:20.080> half<00:06:20.880> it's<00:06:21.880> got<00:06:22.060> a<00:06:22.210> little<00:06:22.419> bit<00:06:22.510> of<00:06:22.599> a

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
a half it's got a little bit of a

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:24.029 
a half it's got a little bit of a
Buffalo<00:06:23.020> shape<00:06:23.289> going<00:06:23.530> on<00:06:23.650> and<00:06:23.979> that

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
Buffalo shape going on and that

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.550 
Buffalo shape going on and that
busted-up<00:06:24.550> leg<00:06:24.639> sealed<00:06:25.300> the<00:06:25.419> deal<00:06:25.599> so<00:06:26.349> at<00:06:26.440> the

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
busted-up leg sealed the deal so at the

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.200 
busted-up leg sealed the deal so at the
end<00:06:26.620> of<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.770> hunt<00:06:26.949> we've<00:06:27.310> got<00:06:27.490> a<00:06:27.520> great<00:06:27.880> three

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
end of the hunt we've got a great three
