00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
the place where the leopard was trying

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.450 
the place where the leopard was trying
to<00:05:39.699> rub<00:05:39.879> off<00:05:40.029> his<00:05:40.240> hair<00:05:40.419> spots<00:05:41.129> but<00:05:42.129> there's<00:05:42.339> no

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
to rub off his hair spots but there's no

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.149 
to rub off his hair spots but there's no
leopard<00:05:42.879> there's<00:05:43.719> a<00:05:43.810> just<00:05:44.439> a<00:05:44.560> lot<00:05:44.740> of<00:05:44.860> spots

I guess that leopard just rubbed and
rubbed<00:05:49.419> until<00:05:49.930> he<00:05:50.050> rubbed<00:05:50.289> himself<00:05:50.469> away<00:05:50.979> in

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
rubbed until he rubbed himself away in

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.719 
rubbed until he rubbed himself away in
there<00:05:51.399> did<00:05:51.699> you<00:05:51.729> just<00:05:52.120> left<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.449> spot
