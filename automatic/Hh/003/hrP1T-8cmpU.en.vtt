00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.930
 Hello to all, and welcome, we are in Poland, Katowice 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.200
 Behind me is a huge beautiful stadium where IEM - Intel Extreme Masters takes place. 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.940
 Now World of Tanks is playing and the best teams from all over Europe are fighting for a lot of money. 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.900
 Here's the cold winter! 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.490
 But inside it is hot! So let's go inside to see how it goes. 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.720
 We are inside, -10 degrees outside, and +50 inside. 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:01.380
 The crowds are coming, there will be over 22,000 people sitting here and cheering for the players, a very busy weekend awaits us. 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.460
 Intel Extreme Masters with Wargaming and World of Tanks, here in Katowice. 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.680
 Welcome to the second day, the final day! 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.920
 The day is almost over, and as you can see, it was an exhausting day. 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.220
 So many crazy things have happened, but now the grand finale is finally knocking at the door. 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.520
 We have two amazing teams here - Evil Panda Squad - EPS, and Odem Mortis, who are going to fight a lot, a lot of money now. 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.620
 Oliver "Laughter": If you want to do this, you have to be in a position where you can light it up. 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.380
 Steven "Dreams": He was lit, they knew he was there. 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.120
 Oliver "Laughter": Tomasz was now mercilessly focused. 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.410
 Steven "Dreams": He got a big blow, 700 damage and then ... No, he got him AMX 13 90 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.160
 Oliver "Laughter": He didn't hit, but Dr_Tuer is lit and grabbed one shot, the other, and down. 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.920
 And god_runze goes around the corner and the Potomac. 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.610
 don't give it, 199 points down ... 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.610
 Steven "Dreams": Maybe too aggressive, 24 HP left ... 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.610
 Oliver "Laughter": NewMultiShow tries to save the day and ... 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.040
 Steven "Dreams": ... and saved him!
