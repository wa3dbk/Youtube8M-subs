just emphasizes how much you know in
British<00:01:14.470> players<00:01:14.830> sometimes<00:01:15.160> we<00:01:15.550> slow<00:01:15.820> down

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
British players sometimes we slow down

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.499 
British players sometimes we slow down
at<00:01:16.960> at<00:01:17.830> contacts<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:18.550> bit<00:01:18.700> or<00:01:18.820> we<00:01:18.940> go<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.149> ground

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
at at contacts a bit or we go to ground

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.830 
at at contacts a bit or we go to ground
around<00:01:20.350> contact<00:01:20.920> where<00:01:21.160> if<00:01:21.640> we<00:01:21.820> can<00:01:22.000> look<00:01:22.240> the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
around contact where if we can look the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.270 
around contact where if we can look the
southern<00:01:23.110> hemisphere<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.619> lot<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.979> sunlit

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
southern hemisphere a lot the sunlit

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.160 
southern hemisphere a lot the sunlit
hemisphere<00:01:24.310> players<00:01:24.939> are<00:01:25.060> very<00:01:25.329> good<00:01:25.659> at

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
hemisphere players are very good at

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.200 
hemisphere players are very good at
stepping<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:26.799> then<00:01:26.979> accelerating<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:28.000> just

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
stepping and then accelerating and just

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.510 
stepping and then accelerating and just
carrying<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:28.869> with<00:01:29.049> them<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.470> just<00:01:30.100> keeping

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
carrying you with them and just keeping

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.880 
carrying you with them and just keeping
that<00:01:30.700> intensity<00:01:31.210> through<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.170> contact<00:01:32.650> area

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
that intensity through the contact area

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.830 
that intensity through the contact area
I<00:01:33.310> said<00:01:33.700> this<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:33.970> what<00:01:34.119> this<00:01:34.390> is<00:01:34.540> what<00:01:34.689> we're

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
I said this is what this is what we're

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.649 
I said this is what this is what we're
not<00:01:34.960> good<00:01:35.229> at<00:01:35.259> it<00:01:35.649> will<00:01:36.310> run<00:01:36.850> 100<00:01:37.240> miles<00:01:37.390> an

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
not good at it will run 100 miles an

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.749 
not good at it will run 100 miles an
hour<00:01:37.750> here<00:01:38.170> then<00:01:38.829> when<00:01:38.920> we<00:01:39.009> start<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:39.399> get<00:01:39.520> here

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
hour here then when we start to get here

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.910 
hour here then when we start to get here
sometimes<00:01:40.240> we'll<00:01:40.479> slow<00:01:40.750> off<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:40.930> bit<00:01:41.259> whereas

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
sometimes we'll slow off a bit whereas

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.859 
sometimes we'll slow off a bit whereas
if<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.189> look<00:01:42.399> at<00:01:42.549> New<00:01:42.700> Zealanders<00:01:43.240> or<00:01:43.570> South

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
if you look at New Zealanders or South

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.139 
if you look at New Zealanders or South
Africans<00:01:44.380> being<00:01:44.920> Australians<00:01:45.670> they'll

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
Africans being Australians they'll

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.700 
Africans being Australians they'll
they'll<00:01:46.570> get<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.960> here<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:47.979> suddenly

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
they'll get to here and suddenly

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.249 
they'll get to here and suddenly
accelerated<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:50.979> know<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:51.369> they'll<00:01:52.170> even<00:01:53.170> if

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
accelerated you know so they'll even if

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.630 
accelerated you know so they'll even if
even<00:01:53.500> if<00:01:53.680> they're<00:01:53.860> running<00:01:53.979> hard

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
even if they're running hard

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.900 
even if they're running hard
they'll<00:01:55.090> keep<00:01:55.390> running<00:01:55.780> hard<00:01:55.990> at<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:57.040> space

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.760 

there's<00:02:01.910> three<00:02:02.180> players<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.110> other<00:02:03.260> one<00:02:03.500> is

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
there's three players the other one is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.530 
there's three players the other one is
trailing<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:04.760> whoever<00:02:04.940> goes<00:02:05.120> through<00:02:05.420> the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
trailing so whoever goes through the

trailing so whoever goes through the
shields<00:02:06.400> trailing<00:02:07.400> man<00:02:07.550> goes<00:02:07.790> through<00:02:07.820> with

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
shields trailing man goes through with

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.940 
shields trailing man goes through with
him<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.570> then<00:02:08.990> you've<00:02:09.110> got<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.380> next<00:02:09.649> two<00:02:09.770> so

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
him and then you've got the next two so

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.560 
him and then you've got the next two so
if<00:02:10.009> he<00:02:10.130> come<00:02:10.369> if<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.880> ball<00:02:11.030> carrier<00:02:11.390> then

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
if he come if the ball carrier then

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.600 
if he come if the ball carrier then
comes<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:11.960> way<00:02:12.290> he's<00:02:12.830> sending<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.370> through

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
man through the next pair follow through

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.550 
man through the next pair follow through
follow<00:02:25.520> through<00:02:25.760> good<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.959> there<00:02:27.170> well

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
follow through good on you there well

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:41.180 
follow through good on you there well
done

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.170 

from<00:02:42.190> there<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.360> there<00:02:43.599> you're<00:02:44.290> accelerating

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
from there so there you're accelerating

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.120 
from there so there you're accelerating
okay<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.239> you're<00:02:46.510> making<00:02:46.989> this<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:47.980> where

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
okay so you're making this this is where

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.220 
okay so you're making this this is where
the<00:02:48.280> real<00:02:48.430> energy<00:02:48.910> is<00:02:49.030> just<00:02:49.599> in<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:49.930> space

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
the real energy is just in this space

00:02:50.230 --> 00:03:10.800 
the real energy is just in this space
here

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.870 

you
