00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.340
 technology sloth all knows mine 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.160
 Technology can do everything around smartphones 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.509
 What electricity needs is lit and up 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.219
 I think I can do something 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.010
 then flew out called 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.520
 no matter what will ireland vt farmer my 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.490
 new north channel so the whole necessary 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.410
 do not show something in the other channel 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.750
 Do not be afraid in another channel 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.359
 Everything stays the same 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.800
 as before, but it always pile up 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.860
 again and is now the heap 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.500
 got really big 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.329

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.860
 other cologne does not fit in so well 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.260
 do not worry it will still be the one 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.850
 Dust and fill unboxing give 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.690

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.850

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.000
 does not fit in there, no fear 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.000

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.449
 such as comic books here 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.689
