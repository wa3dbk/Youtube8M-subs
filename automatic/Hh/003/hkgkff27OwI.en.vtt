00:00:09.888 --> 00:00:16.888
My usual zeroing spot under the tree in case of rain...

00:00:55.406 --> 00:01:01.406
Blaser QD mounts

00:01:04.977 --> 00:01:11.977
Removing barrel takes only couple of seconds

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:32.329
Very simple

00:02:34.647 --> 00:02:42.650
Will it hold zero?
