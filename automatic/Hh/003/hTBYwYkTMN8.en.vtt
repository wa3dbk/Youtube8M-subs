00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
position in the pack I firmly believe

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.739 
position in the pack I firmly believe
that<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.949> training<00:00:59.339> of<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.760> dog<00:00:59.999> should<00:01:00.569> be

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
that the training of a dog should be

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:03.619 
that the training of a dog should be
based<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.289> his<00:01:01.679> position<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.429> the<00:01:02.550> pack<00:01:02.760> dogs

based on his position in the pack dogs

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.970 
based on his position in the pack dogs
are<00:01:03.809> different<00:01:04.050> they<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.710> different

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
are different they have different

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.610 
are different they have different
functions<00:01:05.820> among<00:01:06.000> each<00:01:06.390> other<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.470> have

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
functions among each other and they have

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.100 
functions among each other and they have
different<00:01:08.040> ways<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.520> learn<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> based<00:01:09.840> on

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
different ways to learn and based on

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.910 
different ways to learn and based on
that<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:11.040> should<00:01:11.100> adapt<00:01:11.880> their<00:01:12.510> training<00:01:13.110> so

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that we should adapt their training so

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.250 
that we should adapt their training so

is<00:02:28.569> always<00:02:28.959> one<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.230> them<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:30.069> always<00:02:30.519> tries

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
is always one of them that always tries

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.750 
is always one of them that always tries
to<00:02:31.030> bridge<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.230> gap<00:02:32.470> between<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:33.549> two

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
to bridge the gap between the two

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.930 
to bridge the gap between the two
species<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:34.870> would<00:02:35.170> be<00:02:35.349> her<00:02:36.040> role<00:02:36.340> very

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
species so that would be her role very

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.229 
species so that would be her role very
specific<00:02:37.709> remember<00:02:38.709> when<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.610> have<00:02:39.790> several

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
specific remember when you have several

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.460 
specific remember when you have several
dogs<00:02:40.510> they<00:02:40.780> all<00:02:41.080> need<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.400> different<00:02:43.060> task<00:02:43.470> you

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
dogs they all need a different task you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.860 
dogs they all need a different task you
never<00:02:44.920> want<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.370> treat<00:02:45.640> two<00:02:45.910> dogs<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.480> exact

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
never want to treat two dogs the exact

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.170 
never want to treat two dogs the exact
same<00:02:47.230> way<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.430> understand<00:02:49.090> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
same way you have to understand the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.140 
same way you have to understand the
structure<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.840> based<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.769> that<00:02:50.829> you<00:02:51.340> have<00:02:51.730> to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
structure and based on that you have to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.660 
structure and based on that you have to
address<00:02:52.420> them<00:02:52.780> it's<00:02:53.049> very<00:02:53.410> very<00:02:54.010> important<00:02:54.549> if

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
address them it's very very important if

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.670 
address them it's very very important if
you<00:02:54.730> don't<00:02:55.150> do<00:02:55.359> this<00:02:55.569> if<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:56.290> give<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.650> same

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
you don't do this if you give the same

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.030 
you don't do this if you give the same
function<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.549> two<00:02:58.090> members<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.900> pack<00:02:59.140> they

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
function to two members of the pack they

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.729 
function to two members of the pack they
will<00:03:00.670> get<00:03:00.940> unbalanced<00:03:01.690> let's<00:03:02.470> move<00:03:02.650> on<00:03:04.739> now

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
will get unbalanced let's move on now

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.680 
will get unbalanced let's move on now
let's<00:03:05.920> talk<00:03:06.220> about<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:07.000> can't<00:03:07.329> for<00:03:07.660> a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
let's talk about you you can't for a

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.009 
let's talk about you you can't for a
second<00:03:08.170> remember<00:03:09.150> my<00:03:10.150> belief<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.750> this

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
second remember my belief is that this

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.569 
second remember my belief is that this
is<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.280> multi-species

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
is a multi-species

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.750 
is a multi-species
social<00:03:13.239> structure<00:03:13.750> among<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.920> canines<00:03:15.430> is

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
social structure among the canines is

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.690 
social structure among the canines is
always<00:03:16.180> second<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:17.769> makes<00:03:18.040> him<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.400> leader

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
always second that makes him the leader

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.140 
always second that makes him the leader
of<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.359> canines<00:03:19.840> he's<00:03:20.829> always<00:03:21.100> watching<00:03:21.910> what

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
Daisy and how we were going to approach

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.730 
Daisy and how we were going to approach
her<00:04:31.820> training<00:04:32.270> as<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:32.810> might<00:04:33.139> have<00:04:33.320> noticed

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
her training as you might have noticed

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.180 
her training as you might have noticed
she's<00:04:34.070> always<00:04:34.360> third<00:04:35.360> right<00:04:36.200> behind<00:04:36.620> UConn

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
she's always third right behind UConn

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.810 
she's always third right behind UConn
that<00:04:37.790> makes<00:04:38.090> her<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.450> dog<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.810> observes

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
that makes her the dog that observes

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.460 
that makes her the dog that observes
watches<00:04:40.820> what<00:04:41.090> is<00:04:41.210> supposed<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:41.780> happen<00:04:41.870> and

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
watches what is supposed to happen and

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.629 
watches what is supposed to happen and
then<00:04:43.100> does<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.120> she<00:04:44.750> also<00:04:44.900> makes<00:04:45.440> sure<00:04:45.650> that

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
then does it she also makes sure that
