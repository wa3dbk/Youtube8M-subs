00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.030
 hello friends in the corner of the defender 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.559
 in today's video I 'm going to show you 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.540
 how to join two flat braids with one 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.599
 edge seam in this case with a 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.640
 edge seam from 1 to 5 this is a 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.650
 order that the friend cahuÃ© has made me 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.430
 fonseca so here I am complying with 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.390
 your order and little by little I'm going too 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.529
 fulfilling all the orders that I 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.880
 they have done so I have been made a 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.070
 requested and the video has not yet been released 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.110
 I tell him to know how to wait because 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.680
 I have many good orders we are going to 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.510
 start doing sewing 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:46.780
 to know the press what I do is 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:50.320
 one faced the two braids by the side 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.690
 of the fat and I start using each 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.420
 Last time it was above 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.010
 as they were place in this case you 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.250
 I'm going to do the border seam from 1 to 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.829
 5 the start was not explained because in 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.309
 the description I leave you the video of how 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.890
 it does 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.689
 but I'm going to show you the first round 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.610
 so they have an idea of how to do it 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.330
 so 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.130
 we raised the first pass and we passed 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.409
 with the line 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.570
 towards the other side like 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.930
 We were baking a leather 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.930
 clip 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.450
 and we count 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:40.030
 five passes above 1 2 3 4 5 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.600
 we entered the fifth as it was the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.600
 fifth jal 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.609
 and from here 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.609
 we went back 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.200
 to the second and so on until 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.819
 we started the sewing 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.129
 do not adjust it too much because when 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:25.470
 well after having known both 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.129
 presses we can open them so that they remain 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.129
 in this way 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.860
 and they have the two units 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.970
 I already made several passes to sewing 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.500
 and so it is staying 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.870
 good assuming we had already 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.090
 finished sewing what I do is 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.090
 April the seam in the middle 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.090
 and it will be like that 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.090
 after the what 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:24.340
 that April grabbed with a clamp 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.340
 and I go back to shape 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.569
 to the braids 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.430
 so that it remains intact 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.830
 and I also give the sewing clip 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.790
 so that it is more armed 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.750
 well and this would be this braid this 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.460
 flat braid sewn with a seam of 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.800
 1 to 5 can be the edge seam that 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.300
 you want good with these braids 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.040
 I'm going to make a bracelet if they want 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.290
 see the finished bracelet 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.330
