00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.190 
computers from time to time and my best
experience<00:00:47.370> was<00:00:48.180> with<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.809> these<00:00:48.899> sort<00:00:49.170> of

experience was with one of these sort of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.560 
experience was with one of these sort of
mini<00:00:49.440> PCs<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:50.489> really<00:00:50.789> designed<00:00:50.969> for

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
mini PCs that was really designed for

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.810 
mini PCs that was really designed for
using<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.559> home<00:00:53.190> entertainment

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
using in a home entertainment

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.119 
using in a home entertainment
environment<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.780> was<00:00:55.680> running<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
environment and that was running the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.729 
environment and that was running the
very<00:00:56.280> latest<00:00:56.489> version<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:56.969> Windows<00:00:57.270> 88.1<00:00:58.140> or

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
very latest version of Windows 88.1 or

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.490 
very latest version of Windows 88.1 or
ever<00:00:58.980> revision<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.079> Windows<00:01:01.079> 10<00:01:01.469> has

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
ever revision it's on and Windows 10 has

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.429 
ever revision it's on and Windows 10 has
definitely<00:01:02.600> captured<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:03.750> attention<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.409> think

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
definitely captured my attention I think

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.820 
definitely captured my attention I think
that<00:01:05.010> Microsoft<00:01:06.000> does<00:01:06.240> has<00:01:06.510> really<00:01:07.140> paid<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that Microsoft does has really paid a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.010 
that Microsoft does has really paid a
lot<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.700> attention<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.420> users<00:01:09.900> were

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
lot of attention to what users were

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.830 
lot of attention to what users were
saying<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.680> seems<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.580> they<00:01:11.729> backtracked<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
saying it seems like they backtracked a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.270 
saying it seems like they backtracked a
little<00:01:13.080> bit<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> right<00:01:13.950> way<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
little bit but in the right way and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.890 
little bit but in the right way and
they've<00:01:15.030> certainly<00:01:15.270> made<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.600> lot<00:01:15.869> of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
they've certainly made a lot of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.039 
they've certainly made a lot of
refinements<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.740> interest<00:01:17.460> me<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.420> that's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
refinements that interest me so that's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.230 
refinements that interest me so that's
my<00:01:19.290> sort<00:01:19.590> convoluted<00:01:20.340> way<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.640> saying<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
my sort convoluted way of saying that

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.840 
my sort convoluted way of saying that
yes<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.840> will<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.650> trying<00:01:22.920> Windows<00:01:23.340> 10<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:23.759> it

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
yes I will be trying Windows 10 when it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.999 
yes I will be trying Windows 10 when it
comes<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.509> haven't<00:01:25.049> tried<00:01:25.290> anything<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.860> in

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
comes out I haven't tried anything it in

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.910 
comes out I haven't tried anything it in
its<00:01:26.159> currents<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.759> beta<00:01:27.000> form<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.630> always<00:01:28.080> like

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
its currents or beta form I always like

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.020 
its currents or beta form I always like
to<00:01:28.950> wait<00:01:29.310> until<00:01:29.960> operating<00:01:30.960> systems<00:01:31.470> are

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
to wait until operating systems are

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.670 
to wait until operating systems are
consumer<00:01:33.030> ready<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.659> their<00:01:33.930> final<00:01:34.380> release

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
consumer ready and their final release

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.859 
consumer ready and their final release
and<00:01:35.100> i<00:01:35.460> will<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:35.820> product<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.659> i<00:01:36.780> can

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and i will get product in so that i can

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.260 
and i will get product in so that i can
experience<00:01:37.350> windows<00:01:37.950> 10<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.549> myself<00:01:38.939> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
experience windows 10 for myself and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.210 
experience windows 10 for myself and
then<00:01:39.509> obviously<00:01:39.659> i'll<00:01:40.170> share<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.159> a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
then obviously i'll share with you in a

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.520 
then obviously i'll share with you in a
