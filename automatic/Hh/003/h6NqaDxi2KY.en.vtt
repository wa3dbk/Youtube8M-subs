00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
this end we have a concave mirror now

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.200 
this end we have a concave mirror now
let<00:00:42.690> me<00:00:42.750> continue<00:00:43.050> turning<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.590> around<00:00:43.800> here

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
let me continue turning it around here

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.670 
let me continue turning it around here
take<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> look<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> other<00:00:45.809> side<00:00:46.050> pretty

see there's no bulb in the socket but

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.670 
see there's no bulb in the socket but
yet<00:01:30.360> pushing<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> button<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> bulb

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
yet pushing on the button and the bulb

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.069 
yet pushing on the button and the bulb
appears<00:01:32.119> let's<00:01:33.119> put<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> bulb<00:01:33.570> back<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.869> again

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
appears let's put the bulb back in again

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.420 
appears let's put the bulb back in again
push<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.890> down<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:37.159> take<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.189> back

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
there so the whole question is where is

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.280 
there so the whole question is where is
this<00:01:44.189> coming<00:01:44.460> from<00:01:47.750> well<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.780> first<00:01:49.049> part<00:01:49.200> of

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
this coming from well the first part of

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.780 
this coming from well the first part of
the<00:01:49.380> answer<00:01:49.619> has<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.280> mirror<00:01:50.670> at

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the answer has to do with that mirror at

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.819 
the answer has to do with that mirror at
the<00:01:50.850> end<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.240> device<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.380> concave

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the end of the device it's a concave

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.950 
the end of the device it's a concave
mirror<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.090> concave<00:01:54.540> mirrors

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
mirror and we know that concave mirrors

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.719 
mirror and we know that concave mirrors
will<00:01:55.140> reflect<00:01:55.290> an<00:01:55.710> image<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.130> invert<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
will reflect an image and invert it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.010 
will reflect an image and invert it
which<00:01:56.969> means<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.360> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> flip<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.930> upside

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
which means it's going to flip it upside

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.870 
which means it's going to flip it upside
down

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
down

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
the rest of the explanation has to do

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.380 
the rest of the explanation has to do
with<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.590> box<00:02:02.979> at<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.490> light<00:02:03.759> in<00:02:03.970> sauk<00:02:04.210> is

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
with that box at that light in sauk is

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.240 
with that box at that light in sauk is
sitting<00:02:04.750> on<00:02:04.869> now<00:02:05.590> if<00:02:05.740> we<00:02:05.860> were<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.040> take<00:02:06.189> a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
sitting on now if we were to take a

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.850 
sitting on now if we were to take a

closer look inside the box we would find

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.589 
closer look inside the box we would find
a<00:02:08.979> second<00:02:09.550> bulb<00:02:09.759> in<00:02:10.000> socket

we<00:02:18.069> see<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.310> two<00:02:18.489> bulbs<00:02:18.940> they're<00:02:19.209> not<00:02:19.360> lit<00:02:19.599> I

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
we see the two bulbs they're not lit I

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.449 
we see the two bulbs they're not lit I
push<00:02:20.260> down<00:02:20.440> on<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.680> button<00:02:20.800> they<00:02:21.040> both<00:02:21.220> come

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
push down on the button they both come

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.420 
push down on the button they both come
on<00:02:21.640> but<00:02:22.120> we<00:02:22.209> don't<00:02:22.390> see<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.720> second<00:02:23.140> bulb<00:02:23.430> now

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
on but we don't see that second bulb now

down<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.130> button<00:02:27.250> again<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:28.420> lower<00:02:28.660> bulb

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
down on the button again that lower bulb

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.110 
down on the button again that lower bulb
which<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.319> upside<00:02:29.830> down<00:02:29.860> will<00:02:30.400> light<00:02:30.670> up<00:02:30.849> and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
which is upside down will light up and

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.449 
which is upside down will light up and
its<00:02:31.239> image<00:02:31.630> will<00:02:31.810> be<00:02:31.930> reflected<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.769> inverted

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
its image will be reflected and inverted

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.550 
its image will be reflected and inverted
or<00:02:33.610> in<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:33.880> case<00:02:34.090> turned<00:02:34.630> right<00:02:34.870> side<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:35.350> so

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
or in this case turned right side up so

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.860 
or in this case turned right side up so
that<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.220> appears<00:02:36.670> where<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.299> upper<00:02:37.450> bulb<00:02:37.720> is

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
that it appears where that upper bulb is

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.430 
that it appears where that upper bulb is
supposed<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.200> be<00:02:38.350> sitting<00:02:40.019> now<00:02:41.019> let's<00:02:41.230> take<00:02:41.410> a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
supposed to be sitting now let's take a

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.860 
supposed to be sitting now let's take a
closer<00:02:41.769> look<00:02:41.950> at<00:02:42.100> this<00:02:42.250> piece<00:02:42.630> here<00:02:43.630> we<00:02:43.750> can

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
closer look at this piece here we can

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.660 
closer look at this piece here we can
see<00:02:44.019> both<00:02:44.200> bulbs<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.799> if<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.040> push<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.400> button

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
see both bulbs and if I push the button

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.330 
see both bulbs and if I push the button
down<00:02:46.170> they'll<00:02:47.170> both<00:02:47.349> light<00:02:47.590> up<00:02:47.769> there<00:02:48.010> we<00:02:48.130> go

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
down they'll both light up there we go

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.500 
down they'll both light up there we go
and<00:02:48.780> if<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.870> remove<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.349> upper<00:02:50.680> bulb<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.510> push

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
and if I remove that upper bulb and push

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.390 
and if I remove that upper bulb and push
down<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.930> button<00:02:53.080> just<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.920> lower<00:02:54.069> bulb

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
down on the button just the lower bulb

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.430 
down on the button just the lower bulb
lights<00:02:55.000> up<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.330> that's<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.630> image<00:02:55.989> that<00:02:56.290> is

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
lights up and that's the image that is

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.740 
lights up and that's the image that is
reflected<00:02:57.069> and<00:02:57.190> inverted<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.630> is

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
reflected and inverted so that it is

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.170 
reflected and inverted so that it is
going<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.349> appear<00:02:59.620> in<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.739> empty<00:03:00.670> socket<00:03:01.090> at

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
going to appear in that empty socket at

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.420 
going to appear in that empty socket at
the<00:03:01.269> top<00:03:01.799> looking<00:03:02.799> at<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.040> bulb<00:03:03.220> from<00:03:03.280> a

the top looking at the bulb from a

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.990 
the top looking at the bulb from a
different<00:03:03.609> angle

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
different angle

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.759 
different angle
it<00:03:04.120> doesn't<00:03:04.450> work<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.840> have<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.109> look<00:03:05.350> straight

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
it doesn't work I have to look straight

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.009 
it doesn't work I have to look straight
on<00:03:05.799> for<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:06.609> bulb<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.060> appear<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.540> the

on for that bulb to appear and the

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.509 
on for that bulb to appear and the
eyepiece<00:03:08.320> puts<00:03:08.620> us<00:03:08.739> in<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:08.920> right<00:03:09.040> position

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
eyepiece puts us in the right position

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.470 
eyepiece puts us in the right position
for<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.239> work<00:03:11.940> well<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:12.970> hope<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.209> enjoyed
