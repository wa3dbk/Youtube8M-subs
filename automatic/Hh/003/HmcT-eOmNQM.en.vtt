00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.670
 more current are it's not 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.990
 a reason for pronouncing a burst of 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.820
 dyed more work I will you 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.070
 show a way to use the funds 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.169
 in dermablend experts of yours france 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.880
 with the help of our elites will eat or 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.470
 on the face and who will I use to 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.689
 model you want to start by applying 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.650
 the sting dermablend on the 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.419
 most pigmented intersections like 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.260
 it is very spanning and that 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.050
 facts is not fixed 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.710
 I first apply a thin layer and then 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.490
 I adjust to be more precise and in 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.660
 the implication you can tap the 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.940
 matter and then faded it by stretching on 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.350
 outline then before moving on to 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.360
 foundation we will fix what we have 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.870
 already done with the fixing powder 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.870
 of weapons is full 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.170
 for the makeup of time I'm going 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.600
 start by applying a hue of the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.210
 Christmas carnation on the zones 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:17.030
 protruding therefore the front the top of the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.030
 cheekbones the center of the face 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.479
 we can then apply the founder in 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.380
 tapping on the part one comes from 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.270
 hide many as do so much 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.680
 that we use the very covering ones if we 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.009
 uses the same hue all over the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.229
 face 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.030
 we risk having something very 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.610
 uniform a little we called we're going 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.860
 try to recoil T1 by applying a 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.119
 darker shade like for example here 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.100
 under the cheekbone 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.229
 we will follow the features of Christmas finally 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.210
 the diagonal scripting one can also 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.679
 applying on the temple enforces 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.190
 a darker shade and a hue 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.369
 clearer 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.750
 it will bring brilliance and the contract 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.970
 so here you see we managed to do 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.170
 take out the cheekbones of noelie assault 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.319
 cons are we brought in the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.060
 play with these few gestures 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.619
 simple that you will be able to cover 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.700
 imperfections strong while keeping a 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.700
 well drawn face
