part one at least at least in part one

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.680 
part one at least at least in part one
cuz<00:02:42.920> she<00:02:43.340> didn't<00:02:43.520> really<00:02:43.670> do<00:02:43.820> much<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.300> mean<00:02:44.480> and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
 because obviously if you missed any

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.580 
 because obviously if you missed any
fur<00:02:59.060> of<00:02:59.300> scenes<00:02:59.630> in<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.870> movie<00:02:59.900> or<00:03:00.350> really

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
what matter you didn't do much I think

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.420 
what matter you didn't do much I think
that<00:03:03.440> could<00:03:03.620> have<00:03:03.740> done<00:03:03.920> her<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.070> little<00:03:04.280> bit

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
that could have done her a little bit

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.450 
that could have done her a little bit
better<00:03:04.670> in<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.960> part<00:03:06.380> 1<00:03:06.590> hopefully<00:03:07.250> maybe

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
better in this part 1 hopefully maybe

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.220 
better in this part 1 hopefully maybe
we'll<00:03:07.730> see<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.210> she<00:03:08.330> does<00:03:08.450> better<00:03:08.630> in<00:03:08.750> part<00:03:09.020> 2

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
we'll see that she does better in part 2

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.910 
we'll see that she does better in part 2
hopefully<00:03:10.040> but<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.490> mean<00:03:11.030> we<00:03:11.120> just<00:03:11.210> have<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.510> see
