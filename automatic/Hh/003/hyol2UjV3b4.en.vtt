00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.700
 a car with the twin kites in it 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.800
 logo on the road to discover 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.890
 some place as rare as the sighting 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.689
 a ferrari in rural areas 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.070
 is the Korean car manufacturer long ago 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.689
 no secret tip anymore 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.230
 the story of ssangyong reaches into 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.090
 South Korea back to 1954 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.029
 Some try to walk in Germany 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.430
 the four-wheel specialists 2011 are the summit 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.680
 Currently this is seriously started 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.600
 vehicle offer still quite manageable 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.570
 who only once what we see here 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.970
 change a big suv up to 300 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.470
 can pull tons and that is a whole 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.530
 strong argument today can only 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.239
 still few vehicles in the market and that 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.350
 we offer for a very reasonable price 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.110
 like all our products 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.369
 when we see over there the korando 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.040
 a suv of the e-class segment suv 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:00.869
 the an italian design and designs 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.460
 by giorgio giugiaro the 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.809
 Engine development took place in Austria 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.060
 instead of a car with many 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.970
 he must be from the european components 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.860
 design looks very European where it is 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 fits perfectly in the sales market 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.060
 because we specifically have this segment in the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.120
 the korando moves in germany 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.440
 large growth rates has sets the 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.890
 model we have over here then 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.380
 The action sports a pickup 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.780
 smaller heel winter segment 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.370
 in the german market but the action 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.680
 sports is characterized by the 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.170
 loading area and this is a car what more 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.730
 used by commercial customers 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.970
 the really really something to load 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.220
 the car for your job but also for 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.010
 The leisure can be used by the Korando 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.780
 as compact and the lizard as large 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.729
 Suv are also for recreational athletes 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.130
 those with a horse or boat trailer 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.840
 a powerful towing vehicle need a 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.000
 real alternative to the known ones 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.060
 offered Asian and European 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.860
 manufacturer still an insider tip 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.600
 but with strong arguments when 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.940
 Price and the quality 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.049
 the vehicles also show that to us 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.789
 a five year old customer 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.569
 Mobility Guarantee that's us 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.679
 to lie down 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.170
 should we use the hotels 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.780
 after use, the customer buys the goods 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.640
 Let's face it, a worry-free package 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.530
 strategy of ssangyong deviates from the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.689
 Most manufacturers and importers 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.879
 strong off the koreans put on 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.980
 steadily growing network of smaller retailers 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.870
 those in rural areas are new customers 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.719
 win and that works only if 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.129
 even the distributors of their products 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.780
 One hundred percent are convinced next 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.030
 reasonable prices and pleasing 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.010
 sturdy cars are five years warranty 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.010
 a really good selling point
