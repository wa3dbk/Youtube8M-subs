00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
basically what I just did first simple

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.859 
basically what I just did first simple
marinade<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.329> put<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.770> Earth<00:01:46.979> Fair

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
same as the last time sprinkled a bunch

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.990

of<00:02:31.140> Old<00:02:31.380> Bay<00:02:31.560> seasoning<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:32.580> used<00:02:32.849> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
of Old Bay seasoning and then used a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.199 
of Old Bay seasoning and then used a
little<00:02:33.269> bit<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:34.700> creamy<00:02:35.700> vinaigrette

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
little bit of this creamy vinaigrette

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.970 
little bit of this creamy vinaigrette
dressing<00:02:36.239> just<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.140> keep<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.560> little<00:02:37.739> moist

dressing just to keep it a little moist

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.850

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
much to eat because when I said we were

realize<00:04:34.770> we<00:04:34.950> had<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.160> veggies<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.580> then<00:04:35.940> by

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
realize we had the veggies and then by

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.240 
realize we had the veggies and then by
then<00:04:36.450> I'd<00:04:36.600> already<00:04:36.870> started<00:04:37.140> making<00:04:37.230> a<00:04:37.620> salad

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
then I'd already started making a salad

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.280 
then I'd already started making a salad
so<00:04:38.820> anyway<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.420> was<00:04:39.450> way<00:04:39.690> too<00:04:39.750> much<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.170> eat

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
so anyway that was way too much to eat

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.710 
so anyway that was way too much to eat
and<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:41.250> wish<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.730> would<00:04:41.760> have<00:04:41.880> saved<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.300> salad

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.120 
and I wish I would have saved the salad
because<00:04:42.840> then<00:04:43.200> we<00:04:43.350> could<00:04:43.620> have<00:04:43.650> had<00:04:43.890> that

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130
