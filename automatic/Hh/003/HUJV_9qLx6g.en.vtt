00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
bridge and you don't really have to kill

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.720 
bridge and you don't really have to kill
the<00:00:45.989> elites<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> way<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:46.920> they're

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the elites on the way because they're

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.430 
the elites on the way because they're
not<00:00:47.850> part<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> farming<00:00:48.719> route<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.289> only

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
not part of the farming route you only

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
not part of the farming route you only
have<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.680> do<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.920> once<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.520> once<00:00:51.300> you're

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
have to do it once and once you're

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.330 
have to do it once and once you're
inside<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.960> cave<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.829> resume<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
inside the cave we can just resume the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.369 
inside the cave we can just resume the
game<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:54.030> spawn<00:00:54.329> inside<00:00:54.719> again<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.320> you

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
game and will spawn inside again so you

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
game and will spawn inside again so you
can<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.620> form<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> cave<00:00:58.039> so<00:00:59.039> about<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
can just form the cave so about the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.450 
can just form the cave so about the
magic<00:01:00.149> finds<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.840> suggest<00:01:01.350> about<00:01:01.590> 200<00:01:02.190> magic

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
magic finds I suggest about 200 magic

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.420 
magic finds I suggest about 200 magic
finds<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.000> about<00:01:03.239> 30<00:01:03.629> k<00:01:03.870> dps<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:05.250> also

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
finds and about 30 k dps and it's also

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.190 
finds and about 30 k dps and it's also
best<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> demon<00:01:06.659> hunter<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
best to do it on the demon hunter or a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.710 
best to do it on the demon hunter or a
wizard<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.640> barbarian<00:01:09.240> works<00:01:09.479> also

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
wizard but a barbarian works also

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.780 
wizard but a barbarian works also
because<00:01:10.229> he<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.500> activate<00:01:10.830> super<00:01:11.040> saiyan<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
because he can activate super saiyan and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.410 
because he can activate super saiyan and
he's<00:01:12.000> also<00:01:12.180> pretty<00:01:12.450> fast<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.270> we're

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
he's also pretty fast so now we're

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.320 
he's also pretty fast so now we're
inside<00:01:15.890> all<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.520> enter<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
inside all you do is just enter here and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.789 
inside all you do is just enter here and
now<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> checkpoint<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
now we have the checkpoint so if you

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
now we have the checkpoint so if you
resume<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> game<00:01:20.340> later<00:01:20.670> will<00:01:21.000> spawn<00:01:21.659> inside

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
resume the game later will spawn inside

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.460 
resume the game later will spawn inside
every<00:01:22.380> single<00:01:22.710> time<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.720> it's<00:01:24.720> always<00:01:24.990> an

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
every single time and it's always an

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.730 
every single time and it's always an
elite<00:01:25.710> back<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.689> know<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:28.080> don't<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.470> five

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
elite back here I know we don't get five

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.370 
elite back here I know we don't get five
stacks<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.270> fast<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:31.110> it

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
stacks but it's just so fast that it

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.440 
stacks but it's just so fast that it
doesn't<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:31.829> matter<00:01:32.299> see<00:01:33.299> it's

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
doesn't really matter see it's

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
doesn't really matter see it's
invulnerable<00:01:34.020> minions<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:34.979> why<00:01:35.250> i<00:01:35.280> use

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
invulnerable minions that's why i use

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.090 
invulnerable minions that's why i use
the<00:01:35.790> piercing<00:01:36.210> shots<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.750> these<00:01:37.439> electrical

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the piercing shots like these electrical

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.700 
the piercing shots like these electrical
balls<00:01:38.369> they<00:01:38.549> pierce<00:01:38.820> through<00:01:39.030> enemies<00:01:39.710> that's

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
balls they pierce through enemies that's

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.789 
balls they pierce through enemies that's
actually<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.159> main<00:01:41.310> reason<00:01:41.369> i<00:01:41.700> use<00:01:41.850> those<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
actually the main reason i use those and

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.590 
actually the main reason i use those and
it's<00:01:43.799> kill<00:01:44.070> already<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.670> no<00:01:44.909> rare<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.329> time

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it's kill already it's no rare this time

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.749 
it's kill already it's no rare this time
but<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.049> average<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.729> two

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
but on average is it's like one to two

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.420 
but on average is it's like one to two
rares<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.720> kill<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.100> teleport

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430

there's like no real hard requirement on
it<00:02:17.130> but<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:18.690> requirement<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.320> more<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.650> a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
it but the requirement is more of a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.980 
it but the requirement is more of a
speed<00:02:19.800> issue<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:20.940> your<00:02:21.180> dps<00:02:21.540> isn't<00:02:21.840> high

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
speed issue like if your dps isn't high

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.480 
speed issue like if your dps isn't high
enough<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.440> might<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:22.740> better<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.340> do

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
enough it might be better to just do

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.020 
enough it might be better to just do
