00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.009
 dealing with next and we are here 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.519
 doing the missions of the effigies 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.519
 let's do this which is number 14 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.809
 to the rescue in fact as we crash them 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.670
 we accept it from vision because it does not 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.029
 you can see this mission is here in the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.359
 side that is almost entering the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.359
 tunnels 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.520
 look 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.010
 conquest if they are not located assimilate of 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.850
 this side 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.160
 and here we come to the steppe then 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.280
 we walk all this here to here 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.750
 there for here and here is the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.290
 estigia ok and the bad one is here where 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.860
 we found the chocÃ³ bot 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.860
 okay 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.220
 we're all going out here 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.010
 is here 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.620
 comes to ride the boy and this mission 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.820
 friends is the one who needs the last 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.070
 mission that we need to be able to mount 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.890
 I collided with you 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:18.890
 what they give you as a reward 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.760
 in the studio that is called reins and 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.920
 save them 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.030
 and those are what we need to 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.299
 to be able to mention the fact as 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.270
 now in this mission we can not do 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.640
 surprise attacks and dress spying not 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.420
 we can use surprise attacks so 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.759
 this I recommend them if they are not 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.340
 filled in your glass and you are and are 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.570
 doing to be able to ride chocobos 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:52.780
 put on a steam tour and start 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.780
 break ships and with this you do not touch me anymore 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.560
 why 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.250
 200 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 d 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.120
 at night 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.600
 i 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.070
 the small inconvenience but now 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.070
 is solved 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.760
 now before entering to take to see a 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.689
 animation then before that there's 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.689
 to use the steam 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.430
 ah 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.300
 takes visibility 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.129
 same and if it does not come out this does not matter 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.260
 then they return us afterwards with the 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.530
 Glass and winter and you will see a 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.579
 mini joke when you know we put on 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.579
 the watford 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.980
 bravura so these contribute and cause 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.760
 also does not turn on the two pallets and 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.980
 we enter 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.980
 we will open little bit and there goes the animation 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.689
 In its whole 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.370
 basically now 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.040
 santander 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.210
 already being in a hurry we reduce 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:04:01.269
 I'm using avalanche to make it 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:04.150
 guess if they are eliminated and mathematics to 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.420
 this line a five star steam and 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.010
 then hit the mission then mans 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.870
 mission number 14 the rescue of the 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.650
 chocobos where mission accomplished and there 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.239
 They are on Fridays if something like that comes up 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.109
 jackson is that we need to be able 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.109
 show a lot co2 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:43.290
 at high speed 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.300
 and says that if they touch an enemy they 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.669
 write to a feather and you can touch 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.919
 three maximums before the choco the 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.440
 mandibular played in a blanket and man to 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.610
 the first mana light a lot to fuck and 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.910
 here you can find what this is 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.910
 buried treasures 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.039
 reiterated 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.400
 when I see in that the exclamation mark 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:13.960
 is that they are close to a treasure now it is 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:17.120
 the treasures for regular are 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.790
 in the area that does not have grass 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.979
 and you can see how they bounce 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.410
 to china 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.639
 the faster the rebound means that 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.500
 closer are in the duty angela we 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:33.229
 bounces faster, faster, faster, faster 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.130
 no longer to own that end deserves 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.130
 look for them 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.850
 and that's it 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.600
 we'll see 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.600
 but how slow 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.630
 the treasure 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.630
 how could it be 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:59.200
 when they are close to explore how to be 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:03.400
 a the interim illuminates a boy on the floor 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.150
 red or nani action who challenged them to 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.150
 says examine 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.730
 There are three slogans to fly around here 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.110
 if they put by artist but good 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.810
 there they are had in forest in their treasure 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:29.470
 there are many all over the steppe can 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:34.750
 find golden form there are nuggets of 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:37.030
 gold of minerals that brings crown I think 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.920
 that is in the forum you know that 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.080
 something like this but good this mission number 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.420
 14 to the rescue of the Czechs for 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.490
 get them choco we do it from something 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.490
 proxy and sports
