I guess because it's been in beta for

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.910 
I guess because it's been in beta for
over<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> year<00:01:56.870> but<00:01:57.870> rather<00:01:58.200> than<00:01:58.440> fix<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.860> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
over a year but rather than fix it I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.960
