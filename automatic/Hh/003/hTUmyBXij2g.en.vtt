drooping<00:03:06.480> down<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.690> little<00:03:06.870> bit<00:03:07.050> ineffective

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
drooping down a little bit ineffective

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.840 
drooping down a little bit ineffective
the<00:03:07.680> way<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.070> was<00:03:08.160> carried<00:03:08.490> so<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
the way that it was carried so the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.000 
the way that it was carried so the
winner<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.840> particular<00:03:10.140> portion<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.920> the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
winner of that particular portion of the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.470 
winner of that particular portion of the
Throwdown<00:03:11.370> was<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.820> LA<00:03:12.000> police<00:03:12.300> gear

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
Throwdown was the LA police gear

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.010 
Throwdown was the LA police gear
operator<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> score<00:03:13.860> now<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.280> one<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.760> one

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
operator so the score now is one to one

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.900 
operator so the score now is one to one
in<00:03:16.020> part<00:03:16.470> three<00:03:16.680> we<00:03:16.860> conducted<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.340> water<00:03:17.580> test

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
in part three we conducted a water test

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.210 
in part three we conducted a water test
to<00:03:18.330> see<00:03:18.480> how<00:03:18.660> well<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.080> backpacks<00:03:19.560> repelled

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
to see how well the backpacks repelled

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.520 
to see how well the backpacks repelled
rain<00:03:20.520> let's<00:03:21.120> look<00:03:21.270> now<00:03:21.480> back<00:03:22.020> at<00:03:22.050> some<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.500> that

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
rain let's look now back at some of that

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:41.520 
rain let's look now back at some of that
footage<00:03:22.770> from<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.310> water<00:03:23.520> test

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.500 

as<00:03:42.040> well<00:03:42.280> as<00:03:42.400> dry<00:03:42.580> so<00:03:42.790> all<00:03:42.940> in<00:03:43.060> all<00:03:43.180> they<00:03:43.300> both

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
as well as dry so all in all they both

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.480 
as well as dry so all in all they both
did<00:03:43.690> pretty<00:03:43.720> well<00:03:44.020> I<00:03:44.050> thought<00:03:44.380> of<00:03:44.920> course<00:03:45.340> the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
did pretty well I thought of course the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.490 
did pretty well I thought of course the
powder<00:03:45.910> compartments<00:03:46.600> are<00:03:46.750> there<00:03:46.930> about<00:03:47.350> that

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
powder compartments are there about that

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.960 
powder compartments are there about that
water-resistant<00:03:48.190> but<00:03:48.220> I<00:03:48.310> think<00:03:48.670> if<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:48.850> want

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
water-resistant but I think if you want

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.090 
water-resistant but I think if you want
to<00:03:49.030> have<00:03:49.120> anything<00:03:49.300> protected<00:03:49.840> you're<00:03:50.709> going

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
to have anything protected you're going

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.870 
to have anything protected you're going
to<00:03:51.160> want<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.340> store<00:03:51.520> it<00:03:51.580> in<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.730> main

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
to want to store it in the main

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.520 
to want to store it in the main
compartment<00:03:52.180> area<00:03:52.600> which<00:03:53.080> is<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.230> little<00:03:53.440> bit

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
compartment area which is a little bit

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.170 
compartment area which is a little bit
more<00:03:53.650> water-resistant<00:03:54.370> even<00:03:54.610> under<00:03:55.030> that

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
more water-resistant even under that

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.510 
more water-resistant even under that
onslaught<00:03:56.050> of<00:03:56.110> water<00:03:56.350> that<00:03:56.530> we<00:03:56.620> just<00:03:56.770> did<00:03:56.950> so

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
onslaught of water that we just did so

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.979 
onslaught of water that we just did so
for<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.730> water<00:03:57.910> test<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.450> like<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.780> call<00:03:58.959> that

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
for the water test I like to call that

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.870 
for the water test I like to call that
one<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.319> tie<00:03:59.410> both<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.400> them<00:04:00.520> were<00:04:00.640> able<00:04:00.850> to

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
one a tie both of them were able to

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.490 
one a tie both of them were able to
repel<00:04:01.209> water<00:04:01.239> from<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.900> main<00:04:02.110> compartment

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
repel water from the main compartment

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.740 
repel water from the main compartment
area<00:04:02.890> but<00:04:03.520> both<00:04:03.670> of<00:04:03.700> them<00:04:03.910> also<00:04:04.180> weren't<00:04:04.540> able

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
area but both of them also weren't able

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.270 
area but both of them also weren't able
to<00:04:04.870> repel<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.380> water<00:04:05.410> on<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:06.100> outer

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
to repel the water on the outer

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.160 
to repel the water on the outer
compartments<00:04:06.970> so<00:04:07.330> if<00:04:07.480> you<00:04:07.569> look<00:04:07.720> on<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.959> front

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
compartments so if you look on the front

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.660 
compartments so if you look on the front
compartment<00:04:08.290> here<00:04:08.860> on<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.100> bottom<00:04:09.340> one<00:04:09.459> here

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
compartment here on the bottom one here

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.120 
compartment here on the bottom one here
same<00:04:10.000> with<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.239> opmod<00:04:10.420> tactic<00:04:11.080> both<00:04:11.800> of<00:04:11.980> the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
same with the opmod tactic both of the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.979 
same with the opmod tactic both of the
the<00:04:12.670> contents<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.209> those<00:04:13.420> particular

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
the contents of those particular

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.110 
the contents of those particular
compartments<00:04:14.950> were<00:04:15.040> wet<00:04:15.250> as<00:04:15.459> well<00:04:15.640> as<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.910> the

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
compartments were wet as well as the the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.940 
compartments were wet as well as the the
small<00:04:16.359> side<00:04:16.600> ones<00:04:16.840> as<00:04:16.959> well<00:04:17.109> so<00:04:17.620> let's<00:04:17.799> call

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
small side ones as well so let's call

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.440 
small side ones as well so let's call
that<00:04:18.070> one<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.250> tie<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.640> a<00:04:18.700> word<00:04:18.850> each<00:04:19.090> of<00:04:19.239> them<00:04:19.359> a

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
that one a tie and a word each of them a

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.860 
that one a tie and a word each of them a
point<00:04:19.720> so<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.109> score<00:04:20.350> now<00:04:20.380> is<00:04:20.769> 2<00:04:21.190> 2<00:04:21.310> 2<00:04:21.870> you're

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
point so the score now is 2 2 2 you're

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.240 
point so the score now is 2 2 2 you're
probably<00:04:23.080> wondering<00:04:23.500> why<00:04:23.590> these<00:04:23.770> backpacks

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
probably wondering why these backpacks

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.070 
probably wondering why these backpacks
are<00:04:24.400> so<00:04:24.580> beat-up-looking<00:04:24.940> well<00:04:25.750> that's<00:04:25.960> the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
are so beat-up-looking well that's the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.720 
are so beat-up-looking well that's the
result<00:04:26.440> of<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.800> drag<00:04:27.070> test<00:04:27.400> which<00:04:27.610> was

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
result of the drag test which was

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.520 
result of the drag test which was
conducted<00:04:28.240> in<00:04:28.360> part<00:04:28.690> 4<00:04:28.870> of<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.110> throwdown

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
conducted in part 4 of the throwdown

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.620 
conducted in part 4 of the throwdown
let's<00:04:30.070> look<00:04:30.220> now<00:04:30.400> back<00:04:30.669> at<00:04:30.940> some<00:04:31.240> of<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.419> drag

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
let's look now back at some of the drag

00:04:31.630 --> 00:05:05.390 
let's look now back at some of the drag
test<00:04:31.900> footage

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.650 

after<00:05:06.400> conducting<00:05:06.640> the<00:05:06.880> drag<00:05:07.090> test<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.510> almost

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
after conducting the drag test I almost

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.150 
after conducting the drag test I almost
considered<00:05:08.080> it<00:05:08.200> a<00:05:08.260> tie<00:05:08.470> between<00:05:08.680> both<00:05:08.950> of<00:05:08.980> the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
considered it a tie between both of the

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.130 
considered it a tie between both of the
backpacks<00:05:09.610> they<00:05:10.090> had<00:05:10.210> similar<00:05:10.450> damage<00:05:10.900> on<00:05:11.080> the

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
backpacks they had similar damage on the

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.720 
backpacks they had similar damage on the
pals<00:05:11.350> webbing<00:05:11.590> on<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:11.980> front<00:05:12.250> as<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:12.550> see

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
pals webbing on the front as you see

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.430 
pals webbing on the front as you see
there<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.210> then<00:05:13.600> on<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:13.840> shoulder<00:05:14.140> straps

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
there and then on the shoulder straps

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.530 
there and then on the shoulder straps
both<00:05:15.220> of<00:05:15.340> those<00:05:15.460> had<00:05:15.640> similar<00:05:15.970> damage<00:05:16.120> as<00:05:16.390> well

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
both of those had similar damage as well

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.540 
both of those had similar damage as well
let's<00:05:16.810> look<00:05:16.960> back<00:05:17.170> here<00:05:17.350> over<00:05:17.470> at<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.770> LA

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
let's look back here over at the LA

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.070 
let's look back here over at the LA
police<00:05:18.790> gear<00:05:19.030> and<00:05:19.330> then<00:05:19.540> on<00:05:19.630> the<00:05:19.720> operator

notice<00:05:22.960> that<00:05:23.080> there<00:05:23.260> was<00:05:23.440> some<00:05:23.800> webbing<00:05:24.790> that

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
notice that there was some webbing that

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.330 
notice that there was some webbing that
did<00:05:25.150> come<00:05:25.300> off<00:05:25.510> on<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:26.050> opmod<00:05:26.200> pac<00:05:26.650> pac<00:05:26.920> during

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
did come off on the opmod pac pac during

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.740 
did come off on the opmod pac pac during
the<00:05:27.430> test<00:05:27.670> I<00:05:27.880> didn't<00:05:28.210> really<00:05:28.360> consider<00:05:28.690> that

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
the test I didn't really consider that

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.630 
the test I didn't really consider that
you<00:05:29.260> know<00:05:29.350> a<00:05:29.380> complete<00:05:29.710> fail<00:05:29.890> on<00:05:30.190> its<00:05:30.220> par<00:05:30.520> just

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
you know a complete fail on its par just

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.950 
you know a complete fail on its par just
because<00:05:30.910> it<00:05:31.030> might<00:05:31.150> have<00:05:31.210> been<00:05:31.360> heavily

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
because it might have been heavily

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.870 
because it might have been heavily
weighted<00:05:32.290> towards<00:05:32.680> that<00:05:32.830> side<00:05:33.040> although<00:05:33.700> one

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
weighted towards that side although one

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.280 
weighted towards that side although one
thing<00:05:34.060> that<00:05:34.180> we<00:05:34.270> did<00:05:34.390> notice<00:05:34.600> as<00:05:34.810> well<00:05:34.990> is<00:05:35.260> that

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
thing that we did notice as well is that

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.260 
thing that we did notice as well is that
on<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.680> back<00:05:35.860> panel<00:05:36.160> here<00:05:36.610> we<00:05:36.910> were<00:05:37.060> getting

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
on the back panel here we were getting

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.330 
on the back panel here we were getting
that<00:05:37.300> puncture<00:05:37.840> that<00:05:38.530> happened<00:05:38.920> right<00:05:39.040> here

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
that puncture that happened right here

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.950 
that puncture that happened right here
let's<00:05:40.150> see<00:05:40.210> if<00:05:40.270> we<00:05:40.330> can<00:05:40.450> look<00:05:40.540> in<00:05:40.630> there<00:05:40.750> and

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
let's see if we can look in there and

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.990 
let's see if we can look in there and
this<00:05:41.440> is<00:05:41.560> a<00:05:41.590> soft<00:05:41.920> back<00:05:42.220> on<00:05:42.430> it<00:05:42.550> so<00:05:42.700> if<00:05:42.790> you<00:05:42.880> were

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
this is a soft back on it so if you were

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.940 
this is a soft back on it so if you were
to<00:05:43.090> have<00:05:43.300> a<00:05:43.330> water<00:05:43.600> bladder<00:05:43.930> that<00:05:44.800> would

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
to have a water bladder that would

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.200 
to have a water bladder that would
probably<00:05:45.130> puncture<00:05:45.580> right<00:05:45.790> through<00:05:46.030> there

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
probably puncture right through there

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.600 
probably puncture right through there
