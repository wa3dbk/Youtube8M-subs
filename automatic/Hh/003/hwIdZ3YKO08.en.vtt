one of it got comes with three three

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.160 
one of it got comes with three three

flashlights in each flashlight takes

00:00:39.170 --> 00:01:00.619 
flashlights in each flashlight takes
three<00:00:40.170> triple<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> batteries

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:28.279 

battery<00:01:01.629> pack<00:01:23.100> these<00:01:24.100> flashlights<00:01:24.700> there's<00:01:24.940> a

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:36.440 

158<00:01:29.289> be<00:01:29.500> made<00:01:29.710> 150<00:01:30.250> lumens<00:01:30.369> at<00:01:31.210> this<00:01:31.450> Heisler<00:01:32.080> I

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.910 

setting<00:01:42.659> shot<00:01:43.659> it<00:01:43.780> for<00:01:43.929> a<00:01:43.960> hundred<00:01:44.050> hundred

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
setting shot it for a hundred hundred

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.590 
setting shot it for a hundred hundred
meters<00:01:45.399> I<00:01:45.840> don't<00:01:46.840> know<00:01:46.929> what<00:01:47.140> Baba<00:01:48.130> jst<00:01:48.850> CD<00:01:49.360> yet

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
meters I don't know what Baba jst CD yet

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.229 
meters I don't know what Baba jst CD yet
on<00:01:49.750> what<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:50.080> is<00:01:51.569> bounced<00:01:53.190> one<00:01:54.190> meter<00:01:54.429> all

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:55.239 
on what that is bounced one meter all

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:57.900 
on what that is bounced one meter all
three<00:01:55.539> on<00:01:55.720> I<00:01:55.750> guess<00:01:56.069> it's<00:01:57.069> weather<00:01:57.310> resistant

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
three on I guess it's weather resistant

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:06.559 
three on I guess it's weather resistant
I'm<00:01:58.060> guessing<00:01:58.950> and<00:02:01.319> at<00:02:02.319> the<00:02:03.899> high-speed

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
I'm guessing and at the high-speed

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.380 
I'm guessing and at the high-speed
battery<00:02:07.569> life<00:02:07.750> lasts<00:02:08.140> about<00:02:08.349> an<00:02:08.770> hour<00:02:09.390> Lois

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
battery life lasts about an hour Lois

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:19.290 
battery life lasts about an hour Lois
beam<00:02:12.239> lasts<00:02:13.239> about<00:02:13.360> four<00:02:13.690> hours<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.120> has

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
beam lasts about four hours so it has

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.640 
beam lasts about four hours so it has
three<00:02:19.690> settings

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.589 

on<00:02:26.250> your<00:02:26.430> pick<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.909> ones<00:02:27.150> that's<00:02:27.360> pretty

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
on your pick the ones that's pretty

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.550 
on your pick the ones that's pretty
bright<00:02:28.939> that's<00:02:29.939> the<00:02:30.090> bright<00:02:30.329> setting<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.049> goes

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
bright that's the bright setting it goes

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.929 
bright that's the bright setting it goes
at<00:02:31.769> low<00:02:31.950> setting<00:02:32.280> first<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.640> then<00:02:32.730> goes<00:02:32.909> to

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
at low setting first and then goes to

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:38.089 
at low setting first and then goes to
bright<00:02:33.379> then<00:02:34.379> it<00:02:34.470> goes<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.650> stroke<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:37.099> it's

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
bright then it goes to stroke and it's

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.100 
bright then it goes to stroke and it's
pretty<00:02:38.370> cool<00:02:38.579> flashlight<00:02:39.150> considering<00:02:39.959> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
pretty cool flashlight considering the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.509 
pretty cool flashlight considering the
price<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.650> was<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.359> three<00:02:42.359> for<00:02:42.659> twenty<00:02:43.409> bucks

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
price of it was a three for twenty bucks

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.020 
price of it was a three for twenty bucks
1998<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.959> you<00:02:45.959> can't<00:02:46.200> beat<00:02:46.349> this<00:02:46.590> as<00:02:46.829> a<00:02:47.030> lumen

of<00:03:44.459> batteries<00:03:44.819> it's<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:46.730> more<00:03:47.730> expensive

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
of batteries it's the more expensive

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.349 
of batteries it's the more expensive
batteries<00:03:48.409> I<00:03:49.489> think<00:03:50.489> one<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.790> those<00:03:50.879> batteries

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
batteries I think one of those batteries

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.599 
batteries I think one of those batteries
cost<00:03:51.569> a<00:03:51.840> lot<00:03:52.049> on<00:03:52.199> oh<00:03:52.319> there's<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.709> little<00:03:53.459> more

cost a lot on oh there's a little more
expensive<00:03:53.849> in<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.359> triple-a<00:03:54.989> batteries<00:03:55.319> like

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
expensive in the triple-a batteries like

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.420 
expensive in the triple-a batteries like
I<00:03:56.069> tell<00:03:56.489> you<00:03:56.639> I<00:03:57.389> got<00:03:58.229> them<00:03:58.440> chargeable<00:03:59.129> about
