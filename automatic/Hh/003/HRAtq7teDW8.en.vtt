it's a major focus at this time so the

it's a major focus at this time so the

our science director Jason box has

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.690 
our science director Jason box has
documented<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.710> Greenland<00:02:08.280> ice<00:02:08.429> sheet

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
documented that the Greenland ice sheet

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.110 
documented that the Greenland ice sheet
is<00:02:08.849> darkening<00:02:09.950> therefore<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> absorbing

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
is darkening therefore it is absorbing

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.470 
is darkening therefore it is absorbing

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
video the streams get larger and larger

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.870 
video the streams get larger and larger
and<00:02:57.790> we<00:02:58.269> had<00:02:58.530> not<00:02:59.530> far<00:02:59.860> away<00:03:00.010> from<00:03:00.160> our<00:03:00.430> camp<00:03:00.670> we

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
and we had not far away from our camp we

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.789 
and we had not far away from our camp we
had<00:03:01.090> what<00:03:01.569> are<00:03:01.660> called<00:03:01.840> mulan's<00:03:02.319> these

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
had what are called mulan's these

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.640 
had what are called mulan's these
waterfalls<00:03:03.549> where<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.480> surface<00:03:05.380> water

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
waterfalls where the surface water

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.400 
waterfalls where the surface water
plunges<00:03:06.220> into<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.540> heart<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.959> ice<00:03:08.110> sheet

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
plunges into the heart of the ice sheet

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.729 
plunges into the heart of the ice sheet
and<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.790> thereby<00:03:10.420> sending<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:11.019> whole<00:03:11.230> lot<00:03:11.590> of

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
and and thereby sending a whole lot of

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.470 
and and thereby sending a whole lot of
warmth<00:03:12.190> down<00:03:12.910> into<00:03:14.400> deep<00:03:15.400> deep<00:03:15.849> into<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.360> ice

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
warmth down into deep deep into the ice

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.440 
warmth down into deep deep into the ice
and<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.019> as<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.250> said<00:03:18.489> we<00:03:18.700> know<00:03:18.910> this<00:03:19.120> has<00:03:19.239> always

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
and so as I said we know this has always

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.360 
and so as I said we know this has always
happened<00:03:19.750> around<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.350> edges<00:03:20.709> but<00:03:21.190> those

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
happened around the edges but those

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.580 
happened around the edges but those
edges<00:03:21.819> are<00:03:21.970> getting<00:03:22.299> wider<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.959> wider<00:03:23.200> and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
edges are getting wider and wider and

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.890 
edges are getting wider and wider and
wider<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:24.760> it's<00:03:25.180> critical<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:25.720> we

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
wider and so it's critical that we

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.090 
wider and so it's critical that we
understand<00:03:26.590> why<00:03:27.209> part<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.299> reason<00:03:28.389> may<00:03:28.900> be

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
understand why part of the reason may be

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.900 
understand why part of the reason may be
from<00:03:30.100> wildfires<00:03:30.670> which<00:03:31.060> are<00:03:31.239> increasing<00:03:31.810> in

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
from wildfires which are increasing in

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.289 
from wildfires which are increasing in
northern<00:03:33.910> forests<00:03:34.389> around<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.810> hemisphere

northern forests around the hemisphere

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.940 
northern forests around the hemisphere
part<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.389> it<00:03:37.510> may<00:03:37.660> be<00:03:37.720> from<00:03:38.079> biological

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
part of it may be from biological

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.840 
part of it may be from biological
activity<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.760> algae<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.480> microbes<00:03:41.200> that<00:03:41.950> are

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
activity of algae and microbes that are

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.580 
activity of algae and microbes that are
able<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:44.019> grow<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.739> develop<00:03:44.980> when<00:03:45.819> they<00:03:46.000> have

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
able to grow and develop when they have

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.099 
able to grow and develop when they have

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.809 
liquid water when they're not frozen and
these<00:03:50.109> microbes<00:03:50.739> create<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.190> darkening<00:03:51.730> effect

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
these microbes create a darkening effect

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.870 
these microbes create a darkening effect
on<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:53.319> ice<00:03:53.440> sheet<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:53.859> can<00:03:54.040> see<00:03:54.310> in<00:03:54.639> some

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
studio in Baltimore but we're talking

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.020 
studio in Baltimore but we're talking
about<00:04:07.989> Greenland<00:04:08.530> why<00:04:09.010> should<00:04:09.310> people<00:04:09.459> even

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
about Greenland why should people even

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.710 
about Greenland why should people even
be<00:04:10.180> concerned<00:04:10.690> about<00:04:10.959> what's<00:04:11.560> going<00:04:11.620> on<00:04:11.950> there

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
be concerned about what's going on there

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.770 
be concerned about what's going on there
well<00:04:14.519> I've<00:04:15.519> heard<00:04:15.760> scientists<00:04:16.419> say<00:04:16.510> what

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
well I've heard scientists say what

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.360 
well I've heard scientists say what
happens<00:04:17.169> in<00:04:17.289> the<00:04:17.380> Arctic<00:04:17.410> does<00:04:17.919> not<00:04:18.099> stay<00:04:18.340> in

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
happens in the Arctic does not stay in

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.680 
happens in the Arctic does not stay in
the<00:04:18.609> Arctic<00:04:21.240> we<00:04:22.240> are<00:04:22.360> looking<00:04:22.690> at<00:04:23.970> signs<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.360> of

hurricane<00:04:40.090> sandy<00:04:40.300> was<00:04:40.630> certainly<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.990> wake-up

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
hurricane sandy was certainly a wake-up

for the sea level of maybe 50 or 100
years<00:04:56.290> ago<00:04:56.530> but<00:04:57.280> is<00:04:58.170> rapidly<00:04:59.170> becoming

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
years ago but is rapidly becoming

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.430 
years ago but is rapidly becoming
overwhelmed<00:05:01.240> when<00:05:01.390> we<00:05:01.570> have<00:05:01.810> an<00:05:02.020> extreme

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
overwhelmed when we have an extreme

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.220 
overwhelmed when we have an extreme
event<00:05:02.590> like<00:05:02.980> a<00:05:03.010> hurricane<00:05:03.580> or<00:05:03.880> an<00:05:04.420> extreme

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
event like a hurricane or an extreme

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.140 
event like a hurricane or an extreme
storm<00:05:05.560> so<00:05:06.960> so<00:05:07.960> it<00:05:08.170> Greenland<00:05:09.070> is<00:05:09.460> is<00:05:09.760> going<00:05:10.000> to

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
storm so so it Greenland is is going to

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.270 
storm so so it Greenland is is going to
the<00:05:10.660> melt<00:05:10.900> of<00:05:11.080> Greenland<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.860> other<00:05:12.070> ice

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
the melt of Greenland and the other ice

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.680 
the melt of Greenland and the other ice
sheets<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:12.700> going<00:05:12.880> to<00:05:12.940> come<00:05:13.120> around<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:13.510> bite

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
sheets is going to come around and bite

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.750 
sheets is going to come around and bite
us<00:05:13.720> a<00:05:13.990> lot<00:05:14.200> sooner<00:05:14.500> than<00:05:14.710> some<00:05:15.280> people<00:05:15.430> think

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
us a lot sooner than some people think

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.570 
us a lot sooner than some people think
which<00:05:16.210> populations<00:05:17.080> would<00:05:17.350> then<00:05:17.650> be<00:05:18.340> bitten

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
which populations would then be bitten

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.610 
which populations would then be bitten
harder<00:05:19.060> I<00:05:19.090> guess<00:05:19.450> in<00:05:19.810> terms<00:05:19.990> of<00:05:20.230> which

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
harder I guess in terms of which

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.260 
harder I guess in terms of which
populations<00:05:21.220> would<00:05:21.310> be<00:05:21.430> most<00:05:21.670> affected<00:05:22.240> by

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
populations would be most affected by

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.500 
populations would be most affected by
the<00:05:22.420> sea<00:05:22.750> level<00:05:23.050> rise<00:05:23.260> well<00:05:24.130> of<00:05:24.280> course<00:05:24.510> anyone

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
the sea level rise well of course anyone

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.390 
the sea level rise well of course anyone
you<00:05:25.900> said<00:05:26.140> I<00:05:26.350> believe<00:05:26.680> you're<00:05:26.800> in<00:05:26.890> Baltimore

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
you said I believe you're in Baltimore

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.710 
you said I believe you're in Baltimore
is<00:05:27.550> that<00:05:27.730> correct<00:05:27.940> that's<00:05:28.120> correct

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
is that correct that's correct

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.080 
is that correct that's correct
yeah<00:05:29.140> so<00:05:29.440> I've<00:05:30.250> been<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.700> harbor<00:05:31.000> in

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
yeah so I've been to the harbor in

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.700 
yeah so I've been to the harbor in
Baltimore<00:05:31.570> and<00:05:31.780> I<00:05:31.870> don't<00:05:31.930> think<00:05:32.260> it<00:05:32.380> takes<00:05:32.590> a

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
Baltimore and I don't think it takes a

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.960 
Baltimore and I don't think it takes a
lot<00:05:32.860> of<00:05:32.890> imagination<00:05:33.100> to<00:05:34.030> imagine<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:36.220> picture

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
lot of imagination to imagine a picture

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.900 
lot of imagination to imagine a picture
or<00:05:37.090> a<00:05:37.120> picture<00:05:37.600> a<00:05:37.750> foot<00:05:38.590> or<00:05:38.860> two<00:05:38.890> or<00:05:39.400> three<00:05:39.700> of

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
or a picture a foot or two or three of

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.840 
or a picture a foot or two or three of
sea-level<00:05:40.120> rise<00:05:40.480> which<00:05:41.370> at<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:42.610> current

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
sea-level rise which at the current

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.910 
sea-level rise which at the current
rates<00:05:43.060> at<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:43.480> current<00:05:43.750> rate<00:05:43.930> of<00:05:44.080> increase<00:05:44.500> we

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
rates at the current rate of increase we

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.580 
rates at the current rate of increase we
could<00:05:45.190> very<00:05:45.400> well<00:05:45.460> see<00:05:45.760> in<00:05:45.970> our<00:05:46.090> lifetime<00:05:46.590> and

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
could very well see in our lifetime and

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.460 
could very well see in our lifetime and
and<00:05:48.280> what<00:05:48.640> that<00:05:48.850> might<00:05:49.030> do<00:05:49.270> in<00:05:49.660> the<00:05:49.990> case<00:05:50.230> of<00:05:50.410> a

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
and what that might do in the case of a

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.700 
and what that might do in the case of a
storm<00:05:50.860> for<00:05:51.040> instance<00:05:51.540> okay<00:05:52.570> so<00:05:53.170> Peter<00:05:53.500> I<00:05:53.590> have

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
storm for instance okay so Peter I have

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.050 
storm for instance okay so Peter I have
a<00:05:53.770> challenge<00:05:54.130> for<00:05:54.190> you<00:05:54.340> how<00:05:54.730> would<00:05:54.910> you

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
a challenge for you how would you

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.420 
a challenge for you how would you
respond<00:05:55.540> to<00:05:55.840> those<00:05:56.200> climate<00:05:56.740> change<00:05:56.950> sceptics

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
respond to those climate change sceptics

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.950 
respond to those climate change sceptics
that<00:05:57.520> say<00:05:57.820> the<00:05:57.940> earth<00:05:58.150> has<00:05:58.510> gone<00:05:58.720> through

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
that say the earth has gone through

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.200 
that say the earth has gone through
drastic<00:05:59.590> climate<00:05:59.710> change<00:06:00.130> before<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.850> that

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
drastic climate change before and that

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.150 
drastic climate change before and that
there<00:06:01.420> is<00:06:01.540> no<00:06:01.810> link<00:06:02.110> to<00:06:02.200> human<00:06:02.620> activities

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
there is no link to human activities

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.770 
there is no link to human activities
such<00:06:03.430> as<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.580> burning<00:06:03.820> of<00:06:04.000> fossil<00:06:04.180> fuels<00:06:04.660> and

emissions of green gases how could we
make<00:06:07.330> that<00:06:07.480> direct<00:06:07.870> correlation<00:06:09.540> well<00:06:10.540> the

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
make that direct correlation well the

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.860 
make that direct correlation well the
scientists<00:06:11.590> it's<00:06:12.220> because<00:06:12.790> the<00:06:13.330> scientists

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
scientists it's because the scientists

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.860 
scientists it's because the scientists
understand<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:15.430> changes<00:06:16.000> of<00:06:16.150> the<00:06:16.240> past<00:06:16.480> so

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
understand the changes of the past so

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.170 
understand the changes of the past so
well<00:06:17.200> that<00:06:17.920> they're<00:06:18.190> concerned<00:06:18.640> about<00:06:18.910> the

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
well that they're concerned about the

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.420 
well that they're concerned about the
changes<00:06:19.600> we're<00:06:19.780> making<00:06:20.140> now<00:06:20.310> generally<00:06:21.310> in

the past the planet has changed it's

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.330 
the past the planet has changed it's

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340

changes in the Sun sometimes changes in

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.190 
changes in the Sun sometimes changes in
volcanic<00:06:30.670> activity

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.200 
volcanic activity

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.400

none<00:06:32.830> of<00:06:32.860> those<00:06:33.310> changes<00:06:34.000> adequately<00:06:34.690> explain

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
none of those changes adequately explain

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.520 
none of those changes adequately explain
the<00:06:36.310> the<00:06:36.660> warming<00:06:37.660> process<00:06:38.140> that<00:06:38.380> we're

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
the the warming process that we're

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.770 
the the warming process that we're
seeing<00:06:39.000> that<00:06:40.000> is<00:06:40.120> undeniable

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
seeing that is undeniable

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.190 
seeing that is undeniable
at<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:41.050> present<00:06:41.380> time<00:06:42.360> but<00:06:43.360> there's<00:06:43.960> plenty

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
at the present time but there's plenty

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.070 
at the present time but there's plenty
of<00:06:44.440> evidence<00:06:44.680> of<00:06:45.100> in<00:06:45.400> the<00:06:45.580> past<00:06:45.820> that<00:06:46.420> when<00:06:46.810> we

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
of evidence of in the past that when we

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.590 
of evidence of in the past that when we
have<00:06:47.520> greenhouse<00:06:48.520> gases<00:06:49.210> particularly

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
have greenhouse gases particularly

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.350 
have greenhouse gases particularly
carbon<00:06:49.810> dioxide<00:06:50.620> when<00:06:51.580> they<00:06:51.639> have<00:06:52.030> through

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
carbon dioxide when they have through

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.310 
carbon dioxide when they have through
natural<00:06:52.870> processes<00:06:53.010> gone<00:06:54.010> up<00:06:54.900> then<00:06:55.900> we<00:06:56.110> get<00:06:56.260> a

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:56.320 
natural processes gone up then we get a

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.730 
natural processes gone up then we get a
warmer<00:06:56.650> planet<00:06:56.860> and<00:06:57.220> so<00:06:57.960> what<00:06:58.960> we've<00:06:59.169> done<00:06:59.500> now

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
warmer planet and so what we've done now

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.909 
warmer planet and so what we've done now
and<00:07:00.040> what<00:07:00.220> I've<00:07:00.370> outlined<00:07:00.910> in<00:07:01.630> the<00:07:02.500> interviews

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 
and what I've outlined in the interviews

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.330 
and what I've outlined in the interviews
with<00:07:03.100> scientists<00:07:03.550> and<00:07:03.820> some<00:07:04.000> of<00:07:04.120> my<00:07:04.150> videos<00:07:04.570> is

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
with scientists and some of my videos is

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.090 
with scientists and some of my videos is
that<00:07:06.340> we've<00:07:06.790> we've<00:07:07.530> created<00:07:08.530> an<00:07:08.950> atmosphere

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100 
that we've we've created an atmosphere

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.850 
that we've we've created an atmosphere
now<00:07:09.700> that<00:07:10.030> is<00:07:10.240> like<00:07:10.630> the<00:07:10.870> atmosphere<00:07:11.380> we<00:07:11.650> had

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
now that is like the atmosphere we had

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.770 
now that is like the atmosphere we had
two<00:07:12.310> and<00:07:12.430> a<00:07:12.460> half<00:07:12.610> million<00:07:12.970> years<00:07:13.000> ago<00:07:13.300> and

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.720 

when<00:07:16.780> we<00:07:16.990> look<00:07:17.320> at<00:07:17.350> sea<00:07:17.890> level<00:07:18.070> two-and-a-half

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.730 
when we look at sea level two-and-a-half

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.180 
when we look at sea level two-and-a-half
million<00:07:19.000> years<00:07:19.270> ago<00:07:19.390> we<00:07:19.720> see<00:07:19.960> that<00:07:20.200> it<00:07:20.350> was<00:07:20.560> 50

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
million years ago we see that it was 50

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.870 
million years ago we see that it was 50
60<00:07:21.700> or<00:07:21.910> even<00:07:21.940> 70<00:07:22.660> feet<00:07:22.930> higher<00:07:23.260> than<00:07:24.190> it<00:07:24.820> is

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 
60 or even 70 feet higher than it is

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.370 
60 or even 70 feet higher than it is
today

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380 
today

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.650 
today
that<00:07:26.740> won't<00:07:26.950> happen<00:07:27.190> all<00:07:27.820> at<00:07:27.850> once<00:07:28.030> it<00:07:28.540> won't

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:28.660 
that won't happen all at once it won't

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.520 
that won't happen all at once it won't
happen<00:07:28.900> right<00:07:29.080> away<00:07:29.530> but<00:07:30.630> the<00:07:31.630> the<00:07:31.900> past<00:07:32.169> is

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.530 
happen right away but the the past is

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.969 
happen right away but the the past is
definitely<00:07:33.040> a<00:07:33.310> record<00:07:33.910> that<00:07:34.090> is<00:07:34.270> warning<00:07:34.720> us

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 
definitely a record that is warning us

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:38.550 
definitely a record that is warning us
that<00:07:35.979> if<00:07:36.460> we<00:07:36.790> keep<00:07:37.390> on<00:07:37.630> the<00:07:37.780> same<00:07:37.990> trajectory

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 
that if we keep on the same trajectory

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.710 
that if we keep on the same trajectory
if<00:07:39.100> we<00:07:39.280> keep<00:07:39.460> the<00:07:39.700> same<00:07:39.910> atmosphere<00:07:40.150> that<00:07:40.630> we

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 
if we keep the same atmosphere that we

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.500 
if we keep the same atmosphere that we
have<00:07:40.960> already<00:07:41.200> today<00:07:41.790> that<00:07:42.790> we're<00:07:43.210> heading

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:43.510 
have already today that we're heading

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.900 
have already today that we're heading
for<00:07:43.540> much<00:07:43.900> higher<00:07:44.139> sea<00:07:44.410> level<00:07:44.710> rise<00:07:45.100> than<00:07:45.520> most

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:45.910 
for much higher sea level rise than most

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.820 
for much higher sea level rise than most
