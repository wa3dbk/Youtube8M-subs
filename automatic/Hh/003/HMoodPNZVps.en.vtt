00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:41.300
 and here we see the work of the front action 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:43.550
 the hall when we are old 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:50.010
 there is and this is not traffic to somewhere 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:53.620
 creep all the more there stands 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.570
 nut not touch this on low 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.620
 revs 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.620
 In short, when he gets bored 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.460
 and so do this this we have on three 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.009
 cans on pipe 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.969
 Of course it's boring here on 3 becomes 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.560
 more fun car 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.310
 stopped and now see how it is 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.549
 we have here why the springboard will go and 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:00.030
 jump from ss level let's check it out 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:02.380
 Yetti's flight accelerates and slows down 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.280
 consciousness for that don't like jumping on 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.500
 such springboards 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.849
 it is not for her to bite such a springboard 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.849
 experiencing repair 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.160
 but just drive to take some 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.740
 small springboard 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.190
 see the guy do not like them at all expensive 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.190
 for their 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.599
 let's go flying 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.900
 does not want to be controlled and the center of gravity 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.760
 him 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.760
 his nose pulls down 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.860
 well, you understand 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.199
 and so mean as far as yeti 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.019
 car again for the amateur as well as 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.150
 here is this screw hammers ie rear 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.150
 diff blocked front no line no 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.169
 bashing no super handling but no 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.330
 anywhere from not for track track 2 tracks 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.770
 car therefore . on lover but in 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.630
 difference from hammers hammers and here the bull 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.759
 system support three linden on which 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.100
 He even somehow currency already becomes 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.840
 interesting really there let's see how 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.250
 will show itself in further use 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.780
 but pitching is really an amateur and how 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.780
 only update this did not buy 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.200
