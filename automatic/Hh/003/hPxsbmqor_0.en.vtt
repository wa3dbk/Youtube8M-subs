whole bunch of ammunition this is the
fun<00:00:41.180> part<00:00:44.739> this<00:00:45.739> is<00:00:45.949> a<00:00:45.980> crawl<00:00:46.339> walk<00:00:46.579> run

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.689 
fun part this is a crawl walk run
process<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.839> we<00:00:48.019> start<00:00:48.290> them<00:00:48.409> out<00:00:48.500> slow<00:00:48.920> start

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
process and we start them out slow start

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:50.979 
process and we start them out slow start
them<00:00:49.850> up<00:00:49.909> small<00:00:50.300> there's<00:00:50.540> no<00:00:50.720> pressure

them up small there's no pressure

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.049 
them up small there's no pressure
there's<00:00:51.320> no<00:00:51.470> competition<00:00:51.890> we're<00:00:52.760> just<00:00:52.909> going

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
there's no competition we're just going

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.340 
there's no competition we're just going
to<00:00:53.089> work<00:00:53.269> with<00:00:53.479> them<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:53.720> improve<00:00:53.839> their<00:00:54.229> own

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
to work with them to improve their own

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.469 
to work with them to improve their own
limitation<00:00:54.949> that<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.820> expand<00:00:56.300> their

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
limitation that to expand their

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.619 
limitation that to expand their
limitations<00:00:57.019> and<00:00:57.229> their<00:00:57.379> skill<00:00:58.540> through<00:00:59.540> the

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
limitations and their skill through the

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.060 
limitations and their skill through the
first<00:00:59.839> evolution<00:01:00.350> what<00:01:00.470> we're<00:01:00.589> trying<00:01:00.769> to<00:01:00.949> do

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
first evolution what we're trying to do

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.100 
first evolution what we're trying to do
is<00:01:01.339> understand<00:01:01.909> the<00:01:01.939> exact<00:01:02.299> ballistic<00:01:02.809> curve

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
is understand the exact ballistic curve

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.320 
is understand the exact ballistic curve
of<00:01:03.320> those<00:01:03.799> rifles<00:01:04.100> or<00:01:04.489> cartridges<00:01:04.939> that<00:01:04.970> these

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
of those rifles or cartridges that these

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.320 
of those rifles or cartridges that these
that<00:01:05.869> our<00:01:05.990> hunters<00:01:06.259> show<00:01:06.439> up<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.710> train<00:01:07.220> with

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
that our hunters show up and train with

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.880 
that our hunters show up and train with
because<00:01:08.330> we<00:01:08.479> can<00:01:08.659> run<00:01:08.810> ballistic<00:01:09.229> programs<00:01:09.710> on

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
because we can run ballistic programs on

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.260 
because we can run ballistic programs on
them<00:01:10.009> but<00:01:10.130> until<00:01:10.430> we<00:01:10.520> get<00:01:10.640> them<00:01:10.790> in<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.000> field

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
them but until we get them in the field

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.730 
them but until we get them in the field
and<00:01:11.509> actually<00:01:11.600> prove<00:01:12.080> them<00:01:12.259> we<00:01:12.439> need<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.619> know

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
and actually prove them we need to know

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.380 
and actually prove them we need to know
exactly<00:01:13.009> what<00:01:13.520> they're<00:01:13.640> doing<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.000> we<00:01:14.150> start

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
exactly what they're doing so we start

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.210 
exactly what they're doing so we start
out<00:01:14.570> normally<00:01:15.350> will<00:01:15.530> zero<00:01:15.740> out<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.950> hundred

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
out normally will zero out a hundred

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.490 
out normally will zero out a hundred
because<00:01:16.909> it's<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.150> good<00:01:17.270> start<00:01:17.600> point<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.079> then

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
because it's a good start point and then

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.170 
because it's a good start point and then
we'll<00:01:18.619> start<00:01:18.920> walking<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.430> downrange<00:01:19.880> and

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
we'll start walking it downrange and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.899 
we'll start walking it downrange and
we'll<00:01:20.299> go<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.570> 200<00:01:21.110> 250<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.280> we'll<00:01:22.729> basically

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
we'll go to 200 250 and we'll basically

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.969 
we'll go to 200 250 and we'll basically
walk<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.420> out<00:01:23.509> in<00:01:23.659> 50<00:01:23.960> odd<00:01:24.079> increments<00:01:24.680> out<00:01:24.799> to

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
walk it out in 50 odd increments out to

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.950 
walk it out in 50 odd increments out to
as<00:01:25.130> far<00:01:25.310> as<00:01:25.369> 500<00:01:26.060> or<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:26.270> depends<00:01:26.570> on<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.810> rifle

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
as far as 500 or it depends on the rifle

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.840 
as far as 500 or it depends on the rifle
maybe<00:01:27.290> even<00:01:27.619> further<00:01:27.829> but<00:01:28.369> we<00:01:28.490> want<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.700> get<00:01:28.790> a

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
maybe even further but we want to get a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.100 
maybe even further but we want to get a
good<00:01:29.030> understanding<00:01:29.299> of<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.750> ballistic

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
good understanding of the ballistic

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.690 
good understanding of the ballistic
curve<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.680> then<00:01:31.040> we<00:01:31.100> can<00:01:31.189> come<00:01:31.340> back<00:01:31.520> and

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
curve and then we can come back and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.420 
curve and then we can come back and
build<00:01:31.790> good<00:01:32.060> data<00:01:32.300> cards<00:01:32.630> from<00:01:33.250> one<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.370> the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
build good data cards from one of the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.340 
build good data cards from one of the
things<00:01:34.670> that<00:01:34.850> we<00:01:34.940> do<00:01:35.090> here<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.540> we<00:01:35.570> don't<00:01:36.080> teach

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
things that we do here is we don't teach

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.080 
things that we do here is we don't teach
the<00:01:36.590> students<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.130> way<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.370> do<00:01:37.580> things

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
the students the way to do things

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.180 
the students the way to do things
there's<00:01:38.720> lots<00:01:39.080> of<00:01:39.200> ways<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.409> do<00:01:39.710> things<00:01:39.890> we

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
there's lots of ways to do things we

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.800 
there's lots of ways to do things we
just<00:01:40.370> show<00:01:40.520> them<00:01:40.610> lots<00:01:40.850> of<00:01:41.000> different<00:01:41.330> ways<00:01:41.479> we

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
just show them lots of different ways we

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.570 
just show them lots of different ways we
work<00:01:42.020> with<00:01:42.200> them<00:01:42.320> on<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.530> one<00:01:42.680> face<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.280> suit

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
work with them on the one face that suit

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.700 
work with them on the one face that suit
them<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:43.940> best<00:01:44.120> and<00:01:44.409> practice<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.620> practice

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
them the best and practice and practice

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.680 
them the best and practice and practice
and<00:01:46.159> practice<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.700> most<00:01:47.030> important<00:01:47.450> thing<00:01:47.570> is

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
and practice the most important thing is

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.390 
and practice the most important thing is
we<00:01:47.870> do<00:01:47.990> not<00:01:48.140> teach<00:01:48.409> anything<00:01:48.710> we<00:01:48.979> don't<00:01:49.100> press

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
we do not teach anything we don't press

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
we do not teach anything we don't press
it<00:01:50.409> when<00:01:51.409> I'm<00:01:51.530> with<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.740> rifle<00:01:52.010> I<00:01:52.490> like<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.240> stay

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
it when I'm with a rifle I like to stay

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.969 
it when I'm with a rifle I like to stay
away<00:01:53.450> from<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.900> shooting<00:01:54.229> bench<00:01:54.409> as<00:01:54.620> much<00:01:54.799> as

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
away from the shooting bench as much as

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:55.719 
away from the shooting bench as much as
possible

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
possible

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.789 
possible
I<00:01:55.760> like<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:56.420> get<00:01:56.570> out<00:01:56.690> in<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.869> field<00:01:57.140> shoot

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
I like to get out in the field shoot

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.830 
I like to get out in the field shoot
from<00:01:57.979> hunting<00:01:58.310> positions<00:01:58.820> prone<00:01:59.390> kneeling

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
from hunting positions prone kneeling

I<00:02:02.570> certainly<00:02:02.900> do<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:04.280> nice<00:02:04.460> thing<00:02:04.640> about<00:02:04.700> FCW

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
I certainly do the nice thing about FCW

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.199 
I certainly do the nice thing about FCW
is<00:02:05.720> they<00:02:06.560> understand<00:02:07.159> that<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:07.880> they<00:02:08.030> give

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
is they understand that and they give

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.910 
is they understand that and they give
you<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.509> option<00:02:08.690> of<00:02:09.019> using<00:02:09.080> your<00:02:09.619> field

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
you the option of using your field

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.530 
you the option of using your field
positions<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:10.640> your<00:02:10.819> equipment<00:02:11.060> in

positions and your equipment in

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.479 
positions and your equipment in
situations<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.769> you<00:02:12.980> think<00:02:13.250> you'll

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
situations that you think you'll

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.220 
situations that you think you'll
encounter<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.480> hunting<00:02:14.750> field<00:02:14.780> come

fall

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.650 

I<00:02:20.250> think<00:02:21.250> one<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.520> biggest<00:02:21.820> things<00:02:22.540> that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
I think one of the biggest things that

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.480 
I think one of the biggest things that
people<00:02:22.840> don't<00:02:23.740> understand<00:02:24.100> when<00:02:24.160> they<00:02:24.250> come

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
people don't understand when they come

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.580 
people don't understand when they come
here<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.910> understanding<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.870> they<00:02:26.230> they

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
here is understanding that they they

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.490 
here is understanding that they they
need<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.920> be<00:02:27.040> able<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.570> work<00:02:28.570> their<00:02:28.840> equipment

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
need to be able to work their equipment

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.480 
need to be able to work their equipment
to<00:02:29.680> its<00:02:29.830> fullest

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
to its fullest

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.580 
to its fullest
they<00:02:30.970> understand<00:02:31.420> maybe<00:02:31.600> have<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> zero<00:02:32.140> gun<00:02:32.410> in

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
they understand maybe have a zero gun in

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.530 
they understand maybe have a zero gun in
the<00:02:32.740> other<00:02:32.860> hand<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.580> like<00:02:33.970> my<00:02:34.120> gun<00:02:34.330> at<00:02:34.450> a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the other hand that I like my gun at a

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.150 
the other hand that I like my gun at a

hundred yards two inches high but they

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.320

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
might not understand what that means

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.150 
might not understand what that means
downrange<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.260> we<00:02:38.410> like<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.770> take<00:02:39.010> them

through that scope and that rifle we

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.800 
through that scope and that rifle we
like<00:02:42.070> to<00:02:42.190> maximize<00:02:42.760> their<00:02:43.030> bullet<00:02:43.450> their

potential their rifles potential and
their<00:02:45.730> scope<00:02:45.910> potential<00:02:46.390> there's<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.660> watch

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
their scope potential there's a watch

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.130 
their scope potential there's a watch
there<00:02:47.050> they<00:02:47.230> might<00:02:47.710> not<00:02:47.860> quite<00:02:48.100> understand<00:02:48.520> a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
there they might not quite understand a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.050 
there they might not quite understand a
lot<00:02:50.140> of<00:02:50.170> people<00:02:50.290> have<00:02:50.650> never<00:02:50.860> shot<00:02:51.520> rifles

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
very well most average hunters I'd say

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.500 
very well most average hunters I'd say
in<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.220> couple<00:02:54.670> hundred<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.210> three<00:02:55.420> hundred

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.450 
in that couple hundred to three hundred
yard<00:02:55.900> range<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.410> then<00:02:57.010> they<00:02:57.130> get<00:02:57.250> out<00:02:57.430> here

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460
