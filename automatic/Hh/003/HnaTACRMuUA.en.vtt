00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 honestly nothing in my head 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.819
 changed except I'm now on 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.940
 public as soon as I spoke to dina 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.559
 I learned that I was fighting with Conor for my belt 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.900
 very happy about this is a huge opportunity 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.040
 so it's time to jump into the cage 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.830
 and beat that dude 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.670
 how is your body and how do you feel 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.770
 psychologically now i try 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.300
 lose weight 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:26.160
 it's always a grueling part of it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.880
 sports but it's his part so everything goes 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.039
 according to plan 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.149
 2 weeks before the fight I am where I am 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.570
 should be now we are just adjusting 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.579
 plan for the fight and will only make weight 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.920
 a lot of information coming up to this 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.300
 the battle that collected 8 months and now 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.910
 just two weeks to collect 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.090
 information from you yes it's crazy people 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.980
 swoop down on me from all sides i knew 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.930
 that it will be the craziest 2 weeks 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.879
 in my life I just try to go 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.840
 through this it copes with 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.010
 all media and also 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 perform all the workouts and 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.660
 recovery all i need to do 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.570
 to prepare for this fight this 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.670
 there will be a global victory 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.320
 Conor has already begun to wag language to self 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.920
 myself this is what i expected i think was 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 would be strange if he didn't do it like that 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.830
 what is it like I said what I expected 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.720
 nothing new yesterday you told me that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.729
 you will feel confident no matter 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.259
 will you get a fight in a day in a week 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.700
 full training camp you 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.829
 you feel confident you are still 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.600
 you can beat him yes this is the guy from 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.400
 a fight I would never give up 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.170
 learning about the fight they were not connected 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.790
 full camp so when got 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.590
 this call and said let's sign 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.850
 contract what do you like about it 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.500
 combat this fight suits me very much in style 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.329
 because he is a tall, lanky guy 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.860
 I am a short, stocky, powerful guy to me 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.159
 easier to approach the guys who 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.990
 far above me i have this blast 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.780
 read to shorten the distance and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.299
 go a short distance I think this 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.280
 great match last question what will 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.170
 mean for this hall for you and 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.330
 alpha mail team to have two 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.860
 belt this is important we 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.020
 worked very hard to get hold of 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.060
 that first one just needs to add one more 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.710
 so let's do this translated and 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.270
 voiced wings Mikhail specially for 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.270
