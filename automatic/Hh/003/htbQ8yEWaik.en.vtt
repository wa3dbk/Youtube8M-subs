00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi i'm going to build one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.059
 shoulder strap for work I have to do 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.559
 Tomorrow I will shoulder there, however, no 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:16.590
 I'm one who has different equipment 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.140
 concerning camera accessories and me 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.340
 I was struck consulate doing gods 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.439
 buy from this to this item a 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.650
 mold dart 8 then that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.199
 beautiful object just to see it so 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.780
 gives you the idea of ​​something you can do 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.860
 big things 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.870
 then we have his we said 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.370
 related arms vvt is from a pact 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.940
 of thumb than other size varies 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 adapters adapters and transformers from 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.930
 a piece of life to the other key 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.930
 English 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:05.280
 a little dog on his heels and so on 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.580
 then we have a brand new kit 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.130
 practically with another die and number 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.659
 or cultural this here is a dice with three 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.659
 break against the arms this going 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.290
 with 6 with relative avoid all from the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.600
 same measure 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.030
 then we have the clamps that can 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.119
 always be comfortable 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.540
 the foam rubber a regulator of sight and a 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.670
 another aiming regulator that I think 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.670
 is what I'm going to use 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.150
 ok then let's analyze this 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.330
 our creature looks like a little dog 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:17.400
 nut is where you have to support the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.500
 shoulder and go two must be attached 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.220
 arm sticks call me whatever you want 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.770
 which serve to pry on the shoulder e 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.630
 not by the way already so it would be 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.670
 quite comfortable so it might as well 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.500
 do not serve the rubber 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.530
 after which others must be put at least 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.500
 324 mushroom a kiss as I read it 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.420
 I put three of them in sticks 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.330
 length going to meet another 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.550
 given about this I put the 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.900
 finder the direction cursor that 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.870
 as I had promised myself I put this 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.920
 it's definitely not the shoulder strap 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.530
 definitive because it could also be 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.420
 think of options to make a 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.610
 counterweight with another given here yes 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.810
 might even think of making of 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.050
 support me to lean the weight in 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.810
 abdomen 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.930
 however as the first provisional prototype a 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.120
 me okay from this data you can 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.420
 really get something out of 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.420
 Interesting 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.330
 the variant with the foam that 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.600
 according to me there was no need for it though 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.480
 be sure maybe you can be under 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.920
 effort and then then in the long run can give 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:01.770
 bother instead so more and voila here 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:09.060
 here I am, here I am a little dog 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:11.860
 I squeeze and then all the ease of 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.250
 this point on the room here me 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.720
 I can dribble in short I think 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:23.230
 that I say not a bomb but a half 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.020
 bomb offers the great advantage that i 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.490
 dragons are sub soul media on which there 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.310
 you can then attack anything 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.070
 me on these screws besides the room that 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.430
 is here I can put me need a 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.320
 spotlight cuts off the attack here I need you 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.730
 I can stick a microphone in it 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.770
 attack here as well as clearly 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.419
 on the room brackets could 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.690
 serve it as I realize it 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.580
 maybe a halo of anina because that's enough 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.470
 nothing the before that in the 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.160
 demonstration in short welcome to le 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:58.300
 It puts a little wrong that aspect 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.830
 unfortunately this is not helping me 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.669
 trying to solve the problem of 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:08.950
 symmetry between the tail and the front 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:15.040
 let's say I'm trying to build 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:17.200
 an artificial washer because here 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.180
 now I don't have it and Sunday 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.690
 and tomorrow I have to do the work and then 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.690
 I try to do it myself 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:29.050
 hoping that it is enough then I took a 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.930
 piece of rigid plastic worked with a 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.880
 red-hot screwdriver in a fire 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:40.060
 ford there is a knife what i have 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:42.600
 created this artificial washer of 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.600
 plastic 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.499
 hoping it's enough 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:06:08.149
 it seems so and wants this is mine 

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:08.149
 shoulder strap to the next
