 1 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.040

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.279
 we meet today for the 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.180
 presentation of a 1.16 tools a little bit of 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.470
 kind mohannad so he's very very 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.290
 simple and french you have 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.239
 selected your connection method 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.310
 with your game area you have 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.380
 selected your console login 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.630
 and you're going to wait for a buzzer on 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.120
 your console here you have different 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.090
 modes so you can activate 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.720
 the invincibility the show ends never 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.090
 wanted to run him twice as fast 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.380
 the discreet mode that is to say in fact 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.870
 when you squat and that 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.170
 you're okay you draw a lot more 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.110
 quick 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.100
 no gravity besides that it can be 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.610
 nice i will test 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.750
 here you see so it works my 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.490
 car smokes anything else 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.770
 I would not even like to prove that I am 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.340
 well 1.16 so wait i'll get it to you 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.500
 prove right away so option and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.530
 here you see that I am in one 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.719
 point 16 here so here we are told 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.079
 you know a little bugged my car I 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.240
 the impression I'm happy I 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.429
 not necessarily disable you have a 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.039
 weapons editor on the other hand to find him 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.289
 obsessing them is a bit long so we 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.590
 found as soon as I found the 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.590
 receipts 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.860
 so here are the obsessed weapons have been 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.990
 found so 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.280
 excuse me I 'm just coming back quickly 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.060
 on my chord playing since I had fled 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.640
 for a moment 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.380
 so here's once you're on your 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.120
 game so you select battle by 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.530
 example I'm going to take the gun 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.209
 perforating by cons it's small 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.890
 weird things I forget directly that can 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.120
 simply add the modes 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.459
 for more we'll say is that calm him down 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.870
 so that's good once you're done 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.519
 go go close only affected 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.080
 not against the projectiles otherwise 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.310
 with the mini-sion finished that do you 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.560
 a weird buzz and you'll have everything 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.299
 just more ammunition so by 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.549
 example have enabled the typo 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.930
 you can see that attracts geysers 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.370
 of water while there are two seconds when 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.989
 I kill them and there was absolutely nothing 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.709
 if you want me to find you that 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.049
 I have palmade 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.110
 this is for example I take the pillar a 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:53.120
 promised to associate even I pulled the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.680
 resume here I put the explosion 3 you 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.299
 see that it's big 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.859
 explosions 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.079
 legault of notes on this menu is not 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.209
 a fashion disorder is a real godmode 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.880
 that is, you are sensitive to 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.450
 everything that is 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.680
 bowl so you can for example ball and 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.990
 so for example if I take the rifle 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:17.320
 of assault I will try to find 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:22.780
 quickly who has the assault rifles and 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.680
 that I but I believe that these gases not 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.610
 it's not guard 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:33.640
 it's smoke to make a burial uc 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.510
 which just makes you steal when 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.960
 it's on the ground short I can not find anymore 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.450
 so if I do cooperate for example I 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.760
 put water I go on you see 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.230
 although I'm flying here is that 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.170
 can be nice but it can also be 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.790
 very boring here you go 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.800
 found immediately for the publisher 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.480
 of a bingo ie the vehicles and 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.950
 we find ourselves seven clubs have been 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.950
 as soon as the recipes have been found 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:12.460
 so here we are again safe so 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.910
 the apps were found in a message 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.920
 so here we are 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.239
 you select your vehicle so I 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.680
 do not even know the world this vehicle 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.680
 so the nps 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.510
 I'm not even sure they have the 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.410
 dlc vehicles be 1 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.360
 as you can see so we're going 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.730
 take another car apart from 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.620
 pass on and ravens not serious at 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.480
 we will quickly take another 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.360
 car for example does not have the 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.300
 right I do not like but I'm more 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:48.130
 difficult here is take that's what 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:55.210
 name is looking for the name Havana he has 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:58.090
 done two so we go we choose the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.520
 ffq 2 we go in the modes nearby and 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.910
 here we will activate the invincibility well 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.820
 heard be careful it's not 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.590
 invincible oo 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.690
 launches rockets and all that but 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.230
 invincible to the shock we will be very 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.060
 quick 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.620
 here you see that it accelerates live 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.570
 to put him back heavy and you can 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.420
 in addition raised your car which 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:24.790
 can be really nice to show you 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:27.040
 so here I do not know if they see the 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.260
 see that the car is ten times 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.310
 bigger it can be nice by 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.689
 against I do not know if the others 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:38.099
 players we see it 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:41.489
 simply the vehicles like 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.379
 that's it here in the modes of 

00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:46.699
 vehicles here you have several things 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:48.569
 so that's to change the 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.649
 do not accept excuses but insufficient 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:50.999
 joysticks but since I'm in 

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:53.519
 my salon hit is rather complicated I 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:55.409
 I'll try to move it away so that's 

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.759
 to change or ales custom cars 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.579
 modified for example if you want 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.079
 tuner life q2 with a fender or whatever 

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:02.549
 thing like that do not forget you 

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:04.079
 show what bah I think you 

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:05.879
 already know but others do not 

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:07.409
 do not see these changes we 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.809
 had a first-person mode 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.399
 on the other hand be careful it is very 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:13.889
 often prized like that comes from the 

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:16.259
 do here so we get together as soon as 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.149
 I went back to call me and so 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.439
 so we find ourselves sorry for those who 

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:21.269
 frieze I apologize 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:23.009
 I do not know if they show better 

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:24.779
 so had to cost too close together less 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.089
 in a hurry I hope you hear me 

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:28.229
 better it's really annoying that I 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:31.349
 can you capture in my room 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:35.669
 but hey his c4 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:38.039
 so we were at the dongling editor 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.599
 no vehicle mode of life at the 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.699
 first person is not necessarily 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.169
 a very good idea and I do not know 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.339
 I did not look for the obsessed before 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.539
 six to all that's what had to be done 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:49.139
 had to look for others it's 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:52.099
 first I let you see all that 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:55.319
 so here I am in impossibility 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:56.610
 so here you have a texture mode 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.989
 whose pace even if you want to change 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.309
 the color of the sky 

00:06:57.989 --> 00:07:01.309
 here you see c 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.800
 here you have also colors of 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.660
 windows of vehicles when you pt 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.480
 here I think you know some 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.360
 modes that are already there for some 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.660
 time so here you have a mode for 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.160
 change your money and your lebel me I 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.520
 just will not want to show 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.360
 why because I do not count you 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.210
 to banish me 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.220
 of course no one can be held 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.600
 responsible if you do come 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.370
 it's just that she did not use 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.470
 the whole month the age does not use because 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.570
 I am the v8 and I do not need 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.010
 to be level above that's it 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.750
 I hope in any case that this video 

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:43.760
 you will have pleased I tell you to the next 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.760
 hello everyone and wear well
