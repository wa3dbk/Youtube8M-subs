00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.860
 this stadium here it is more than one 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.130
 football stadium 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.960
 it is a multipurpose arena in addition to it 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.119
 religiously fulfilling his 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.150
 schedule for fifa for the opening 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.239
 Confederations Cup a year from now and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.400
 for the world cup in 2014 will be the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.410
 great legacy that the community that 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.559
 population of the federal district will win 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.710
 the future shows with future this is the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.530
 future football games ie us 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.780
 we will have through the stadium an injection 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.780
 in the federal district economy 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.080
 this is one of the most 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.030
 of the stadium 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.180
 exactly where you will arrive 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.970
 at the stage is where people have 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.730
 access to the upper bleachers by these 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.000
 ramps here and the level of the cabins 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.970
 then here it is that the people reach for 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.830
 more than 7,000 jobs in retirement or 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.200
 already the more than 500 internal vacancies 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.300
 people have the same facility here as 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.670
 people have of the proximity of this 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.270
 here begins the great spectacle of the cup 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.270
 of the world 2014 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.500
 in these galleries here they are all 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.220
 will be transformed into rooms all 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.170
 shall be processed and appliances which 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.060
 be used after the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.930
 world for any kind of exploitation 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.930
 commercial 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.670
 this part that calls the grandstand 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.630
 lower will house and around 30 thousand 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.540
 people 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.430
 above it we have the cabins are 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.200
 two levels of cabin where we go 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.729
 approximately six thousand and 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.350
 two hundred people 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.119
 and up there what we call 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.289
 upper bleacher 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.870
 we have approximately 36 thousand places 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.540
 therefore I am one of the largest 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.530
 country with the capacity of 72 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.750
 one thousand places 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.600
 a seat for everyone and with 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.819
 total visibility without any blind spots 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.900
 this whole audience comes out of the stadium in 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.230
 eight minutes 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.290
 This was all very well thought of. 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.080
 There are several curiosities in the stadium. 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.519
 one of them is that up there that is the 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.989
 famous compression ring is is the ring that 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.410
 sustain the pillars is what gives 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.010
 support of the pillars and others 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.590
 things 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.140
 this ring goes to the guinness book that 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.480
 is the largest compression ring made in the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.000
 football stadium in the world no 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.220
 stadium in no world no 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.330
 building in the world had a ring 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.790
 understanding as big as this one 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.660
 then this stage besides being a 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.460
 stage is the ideal stage where 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.780
 people who have made all the 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.230
 more than that he the stadium 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.180
 water that I know will fall 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.940
 in our coverage of the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.270
 large screens large cisterns and will be 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.570
 used on our lawns and 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.170
 our toilets above and 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.520
 not understanding we will have plates 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.180
 solar collectors are 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.720
 photovoltaic plants that will generate 2.5 mega 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.210
 Watts 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.930
 this corresponds to illuminating more than a thousand 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.540
 houses 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.020
 this will bring sustainability to the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.459
 city the stadium it sustains itself 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.990
 this is the biggest one was the most 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.990
 important that we will leave a legacy 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.940
 and it's right there being that grass that 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.709
 effectively starts the world cup 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.959
 because the Confederations Cup 2013 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.080
 in a year that will open here 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.080
 state
