00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
demonstrate the solo and then I'll talk

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:46.990 
demonstrate the solo and then I'll talk
talk<00:05:34.190> through<00:05:34.400> what's<00:05:34.520> going<00:05:34.550> on<00:05:44.320> okay<00:05:45.320> so<00:05:46.000> the

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
talk through what's going on okay so the

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000 
talk through what's going on okay so the
trickiest<00:05:47.330> bit<00:05:47.570> is<00:05:47.720> if<00:05:47.840> you're<00:05:47.960> not<00:05:47.990> if<00:05:48.890> you

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
trickiest bit is if you're not if you

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.230 
trickiest bit is if you're not if you
haven't<00:05:49.250> really<00:05:49.430> tried<00:05:49.580> Travis<00:05:50.030> picking

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
haven't really tried Travis picking

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.280 
haven't really tried Travis picking
before<00:05:50.570> then<00:05:50.750> that's<00:05:50.900> going<00:05:51.020> to<00:05:51.080> be<00:05:51.200> the

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
before then that's going to be the

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.070 
before then that's going to be the
toughest<00:05:51.650> bit<00:05:51.830> is<00:05:51.950> maintaining<00:05:52.520> that<00:05:52.610> bass

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
toughest bit is maintaining that bass

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.630 
toughest bit is maintaining that bass
jinwu<00:05:54.110> these<00:05:54.410> first<00:05:54.620> few<00:05:54.740> notes<00:05:55.010> I<00:05:55.250> mean<00:05:55.550> you

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
jinwu these first few notes I mean you

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.600 
jinwu these first few notes I mean you
can<00:05:55.790> leave<00:05:56.390> it<00:05:56.570> out<00:05:56.660> until<00:05:57.500> you<00:05:57.560> get<00:05:58.400> to<00:05:58.520> the

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
can leave it out until you get to the

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.740 
can leave it out until you get to the
stage<00:05:58.820> where<00:05:58.850> you<00:05:59.030> can<00:05:59.090> do<00:05:59.270> it<00:05:59.360> and<00:05:59.480> just<00:05:59.510> play

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
stage where you can do it and just play

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.690 
stage where you can do it and just play
the<00:05:59.780> high<00:05:59.990> notes<00:06:00.200> but<00:06:00.470> it<00:06:01.040> does<00:06:01.280> sound<00:06:01.430> a<00:06:01.580> lot

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
the high notes but it does sound a lot

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.070 
the high notes but it does sound a lot
better<00:06:01.910> if<00:06:02.090> you<00:06:02.180> can<00:06:02.270> keep<00:06:02.450> those<00:06:02.570> business

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
better if you can keep those business

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.260 
better if you can keep those business
going<00:06:03.290> doing<00:06:03.470> that<00:06:03.650> first<00:06:03.890> bit<00:06:04.190> so<00:06:05.060> you<00:06:05.120> just

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
going doing that first bit so you just

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.720 
going doing that first bit so you just
sliding<00:06:05.720> up<00:06:05.840> to<00:06:06.110> the<00:06:06.320> 12th<00:06:06.650> fret<00:06:06.770> on<00:06:07.100> the<00:06:07.490> first

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
sliding up to the 12th fret on the first

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.630 
sliding up to the 12th fret on the first
string<00:06:07.850> whilst<00:06:08.750> hitting<00:06:09.230> the<00:06:09.470> open<00:06:09.800> six

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640 
string whilst hitting the open six

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.200 
string whilst hitting the open six
string<00:06:10.850> at<00:06:10.940> the<00:06:11.000> same<00:06:11.120> time<00:06:12.550> but<00:06:13.550> that's<00:06:14.060> the

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
string at the same time but that's the

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.870 
string at the same time but that's the
way<00:06:14.330> you<00:06:14.390> start<00:06:14.480> you<00:06:15.110> got<00:06:15.260> to<00:06:15.350> keep<00:06:15.440> that

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
way you start you got to keep that

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.010 
way you start you got to keep that
rhythm<00:06:16.880> going<00:06:17.150> between<00:06:17.330> the<00:06:17.540> 6th<00:06:17.840> and<00:06:17.870> the<00:06:17.990> 4th

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
rhythm going between the 6th and the 4th

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:25.810 
rhythm going between the 6th and the 4th
string<00:06:23.530> and<00:06:24.530> say<00:06:25.280> that's<00:06:25.490> going<00:06:25.580> to<00:06:25.640> be<00:06:25.730> the

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
string and say that's going to be the

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.100 
string and say that's going to be the
toughest<00:06:26.150> bit<00:06:26.360> it's<00:06:26.600> just<00:06:26.750> getting<00:06:27.020> that

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
toughest bit it's just getting that

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.530 
toughest bit it's just getting that
first<00:06:27.350> bit<00:06:27.650> so<00:06:28.010> you<00:06:28.100> slowed<00:06:28.310> up<00:06:28.490> basically<00:06:29.450> the

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
first bit so you slowed up basically the

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.930 
first bit so you slowed up basically the
high<00:06:29.690> notes<00:06:29.870> I<00:06:32.650> just<00:06:33.650> get<00:06:34.280> few<00:06:34.490> times<00:06:34.670> on<00:06:34.820> the

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
high notes I just get few times on the

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.930 
high notes I just get few times on the
top<00:06:35.150> fret<00:06:35.990> then<00:06:36.830> you<00:06:37.130> slide<00:06:37.370> down<00:06:37.400> from<00:06:37.850> the

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
top fret then you slide down from the

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.670 
top fret then you slide down from the
third<00:06:38.120> to<00:06:38.150> the<00:06:38.270> second<00:06:38.690> and<00:06:38.810> then<00:06:38.900> hit<00:06:39.050> open

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.030 

and<00:06:42.680> then<00:06:43.220> you're<00:06:43.370> going<00:06:43.460> to<00:06:43.520> pull<00:06:43.730> off<00:06:43.880> on<00:06:44.180> the

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040 
and then you're going to pull off on the

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.790 
and then you're going to pull off on the
second<00:06:46.040> fret<00:06:46.220> of<00:06:46.250> the<00:06:46.400> fifth<00:06:46.940> string<00:06:47.770> and<00:06:48.770> just

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
second fret of the fifth string and just

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.420 
second fret of the fifth string and just
pinch<00:06:49.370> the<00:06:49.880> fourth<00:06:50.300> fret<00:06:50.570> and<00:06:50.930> the<00:06:51.410> 1st<00:06:51.440> ed

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
pinch the fourth fret and the 1st ed

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.540 
pinch the fourth fret and the 1st ed
site<00:06:52.760> fourth<00:06:53.060> string<00:06:53.300> and<00:06:53.630> the<00:06:54.500> first<00:06:55.040> rule<00:06:55.250> is

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
site fourth string and the first rule is

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.770 
site fourth string and the first rule is
even<00:06:57.550> and<00:06:58.550> then<00:06:58.670> this<00:06:59.300> is<00:06:59.420> basically<00:06:59.660> the

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
even and then this is basically the

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.390 
even and then this is basically the
baseline<00:07:02.260> so<00:07:03.260> you<00:07:03.320> pull<00:07:03.470> it<00:07:03.590> out<00:07:03.740> pulling<00:07:04.220> off

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
baseline so you pull it out pulling off

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.300 
baseline so you pull it out pulling off
there<00:07:04.670> from<00:07:04.850> second<00:07:05.120> to<00:07:05.150> even<00:07:05.980> then<00:07:06.980> hitting

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
there from second to even then hitting

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.520 
there from second to even then hitting
the<00:07:07.340> six<00:07:07.610> ring<00:07:07.790> it<00:07:07.880> from<00:07:08.060> and<00:07:08.630> do<00:07:09.440> fishing<00:07:09.740> even

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 
the six ring it from and do fishing even

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.340 
the six ring it from and do fishing even
so<00:07:12.530> this<00:07:12.920> ring<00:07:13.070> open<00:07:13.340> second<00:07:14.180> F<00:07:14.420> 2nd<00:07:15.050> fret<00:07:15.260> and

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:15.350 
so this ring open second F 2nd fret and

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:24.090 
so this ring open second F 2nd fret and
fifth<00:07:15.530> string<00:07:15.680> and<00:07:16.000> then<00:07:17.000> forcing<00:07:17.420> open<00:07:17.540> so

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.260 

and<00:07:25.100> then<00:07:25.250> you<00:07:25.400> can<00:07:25.520> just<00:07:25.640> improvise<00:07:26.000> with<00:07:26.180> the

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
and then you can just improvise with the

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.730 
and then you can just improvise with the
other<00:07:26.450> fingers<00:07:26.750> just<00:07:26.870> to<00:07:26.990> fill<00:07:27.200> in<00:07:27.320> in<00:07:27.530> between

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 
other fingers just to fill in in between

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:37.540 
other fingers just to fill in in between
so<00:07:28.520> just<00:07:35.650> but<00:07:36.650> that's<00:07:36.770> basically<00:07:37.010> the<00:07:37.280> gist<00:07:37.400> of

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:37.550 
so just but that's basically the gist of

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.980 
so just but that's basically the gist of
it<00:07:37.640> and<00:07:37.790> then<00:07:37.880> it<00:07:37.970> goes<00:07:38.090> back<00:07:38.270> into<00:07:38.450> the<00:07:38.570> the

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:38.990 
it and then it goes back into the the

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:47.740 
it and then it goes back into the the
chorus<00:07:39.260> fit<00:07:39.580> hang<00:07:40.580> on<00:07:46.150> now<00:07:47.150> though<00:07:47.330> it<00:07:47.480> doesn't

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:47.750 
chorus fit hang on now though it doesn't

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:55.120 
chorus fit hang on now though it doesn't
play<00:07:47.960> that<00:07:48.700> ending<00:07:49.700> video<00:07:49.880> just<00:07:50.240> go<00:07:54.010> and<00:07:55.010> then

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.130 
play that ending video just go and then

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.280 
play that ending video just go and then
you<00:07:55.250> go<00:07:55.490> into<00:07:55.670> the<00:07:55.850> slide<00:07:56.060> rather<00:07:57.050> than<00:07:57.140> doing

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:57.290 
you go into the slide rather than doing

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:03.010 
you go into the slide rather than doing
this<00:07:57.410> yeah<00:08:00.280> that's<00:08:01.280> basically<00:08:01.640> the<00:08:01.900> the<00:08:02.900> whole

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.020 
this yeah that's basically the the whole

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.260 
this yeah that's basically the the whole
section<00:08:03.800> I'm<00:08:04.280> not<00:08:04.460> but<00:08:04.850> the<00:08:05.000> best<00:08:05.120> they

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.270 
section I'm not but the best they

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.610 
section I'm not but the best they
explained<00:08:05.630> Travis<00:08:06.020> pick<00:08:06.200> and<00:08:06.350> so<00:08:06.470> that's

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:06.620 
explained Travis pick and so that's

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.660 
explained Travis pick and so that's
something<00:08:06.920> you<00:08:07.010> might<00:08:07.100> have<00:08:07.160> to<00:08:07.370> look<00:08:07.520> up

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:07.670 
something you might have to look up
