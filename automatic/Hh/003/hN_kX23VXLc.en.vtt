00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.649
 then 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.420
 how come I make this video like never 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.659
 came the idea of ​​putting this online 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.549
 tutorial because when in its time e 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.690
 I was looking for information about the taking 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.460
 percolate I tried searching sites 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.619
 in short, all the videos on youtube 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.729
 they explained words like they did but never 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.130
 no one to show me 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.070
 actually of the practice as 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.950
 apply those concepts and then here I am 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.380
 here trying to explain to you how much 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.970
 I also learned in the field as you will see 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.970
 at the end of the video also at my expense 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.950
 very well how we start then 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.900
 we start drawing our fish which 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.300
 in this case it is precisely the pike with 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.040
 its typical typical beak paper let's say 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.320
 in particular we will begin to look 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.390
 the fish from below 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.390
 therefore we draw I percolate 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.280
 let's place four firms 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.790
 of loves our hand behind it runs through it 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.790
 some fish 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.160
 we have the index that must be 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.710
 positioned at the top closer to the lis 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.710
 of the snout and below the middle 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.049
 the annular 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.540
 the min 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.540
 no 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.209
 the points indicated by the design that 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.280
 let's go red 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.610
 obviously these are indicative points 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.560
 in the sense that we know that the more fish 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.450
 small is more difficult to carry out 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.400
 this grip because our own 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.890
 hands come in he certainly had to overcome e 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.440
 resigned of the fish's head though 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.250
 this example this tutorial is a 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.250
 general character 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.710
 great but once ours 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.390
 companies have entered the 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.460
 fish what we have to do action 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.680
 we must do then first of all not 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.070
 we have to go all the way we 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.930
 touch the palate of a fish otherwise 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.180
 will cut us in with the following we must 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.040
 once the two are right, enter 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.900
 them because they really grab it 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.230
 then close the pinecone hand in 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.810
 this way 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.150
 I assure you that I saw this could 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.130
 seem difficult to twist I know that many 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.840
 of you they will put in front of the 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.730
 screen to try and try this again 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.500
 gesture but I assure you that once that 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.750
 you are in front of the fish these will come 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.120
 completely natural because it is the form 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.040
 same of the percol that invites you to 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.440
 carry out such movement therefore not 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.490
 worry in the socket we will have that 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.670
 precisely the thumb will position itself 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.290
 outside the percolation the fingers le 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.819
 four more fingers instead will be 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.599
 inside fist closed 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.840
 I recommend you keep your fingers firmly on the 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.239
 only because the fish could 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.709
 squirm and maybe free yourself 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.660
 also the coupon that precisely with i 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.660
 teeth and certainly not pleasant 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.240
 at this point the topic should 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.630
 be clear if by chance you should have 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.340
 still doubts, however, here I propose 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.220
 the view of the same operation however 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.660
 lateral the view of the fish that 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.480
 likely minds you might find 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.580
 in front of you when you were 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.310
 skinny one should arrive should 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.930
 get there so let's go to 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.930
 to eat the fish laterally 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.380
 let's repeat the same 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.360
 proceeding we said in 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.660
 previously we go to get the fish 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.640
 the fish will arrive arrive we go to 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.640
 place our four technicians 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.310
 medium annulare little finger under the percola 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.370
 and we are going to separate it for that 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.730
 from the point body we start to open it 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.730
 pardon 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.110
 another that life is inside 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.180
 what the fish brochure has 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.530
 told to take revenge to tighten the 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.530
 hand to fist 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.950
 ok once we close our hand 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:17.010
 a fist our thumb will go to 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:22.100
 position yourself slightly below 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.100
 of the mandible of the fish as shown 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.030
 recapping life inside the 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:38.720
 so that they open percola 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.710
 I insert the fingers close in June in 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.710
 this final situation 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.310
 follows 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.580
 ok we dedicate this last part of 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.290
 error video and errors that are 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.490
 easier to commit we see that 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.490
 what they could entail 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.589
 therefore we have error number one 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:11.009
 said that we have our fish and draws 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:11.009
 a section 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.520
 from the left side of the fish 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.060
 so we have our per 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.750
 below the peril what we find 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:30.150
 we find the branches 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.160
 what happens when we raise 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.950
 the fish for over with happens that 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.460
 precisely the weight of the fish moves away 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.890
 lopergol from the body 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.870
 if we were to accidentally go to 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.820
 put your fingers 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.440
 within the branches of 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.610
 fish if I have to take along with the 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.230
 so also the francs what they can 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.230
 happen that the banks themselves 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.900
 could break 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.060
 and this would cause damage 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.380
 very serious to the pc that might not even 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.380
 survive release 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.540
 another mistake he can 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.530
 this is precisely what to commit in the moment 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.860
 of the photo sometimes we like but for 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.390
 take the fish turn it towards the 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.220
 camera towards the camera 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.740
 what happens with this 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.440
 twist our fingers and they will not follow 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.880
 perfectly the movement of the fish 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.920
 will tend to take up more position 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.440
 natural 

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.710
 what can happen can happen that 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.720
 the fish's lenses come into contact 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.150
 with your fingers and I can assure you 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.230
 that those teeth are spun like razors 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:44.660
 I speak therefore from personal experience 

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:47.500
 remember to pay close attention 

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.500
 at this stage 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.120
 I hope this video was from 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.240
 your liking 

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.960
 if you have doubts and comments 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.960
 next guys
