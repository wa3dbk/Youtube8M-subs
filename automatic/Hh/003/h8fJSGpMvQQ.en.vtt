00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.400
 first issue september tech news is 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.750
 a format in which I the best 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.519
 technology news of the last month 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.050
 presentation and technology is always on 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.840
 first of the month 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.059
 minute to the first theme in august this 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.230
 year i introduced nintendo 3ds 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.000
 the theme is a bit older 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.490
 but it's also the first one technically 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.930
 follow that as it may, a second it 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.890
 is, so to speak, the cheap version of the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.570
 nintendo 3ds 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.920
 however, there are a few succinct ones 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.119
 differences is the biggest 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.920
 probably the missing 3d 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.269
 Although you can play games of the 3ds 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.199
 But only play as the name suggests 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.850
 in 2d 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.230
 in contrast to all the other s 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.710
 You can not do models in two 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.270
 fold 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.410
 Although so all fit not necessarily because 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.640
 his pockets rheine and the condition 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.710
 maybe feels a little different 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.540
 but that should not be a real intel 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.370
 scare off how to send that to the sender 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.289
 turned , the lower display is smaller 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.219
 as the upper screen has 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.450
 of course, again on one 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.219
 resistive touchscreen that is, he 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.239
 responds to pressure from the handheld 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.530
 nintendo will be on 12 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.910
 buy october to come to the market 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.300
 can you give them white red and black 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.530
 blue 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.230
 The purchase price is probably included 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.670
 130 euros and is therefore 170 euros cheaper 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.980
 as the 3d variant 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.320
 the next topic might not be many 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.930
 you are interested in iphone 5 in september 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.260
 found an apple keynote in cupertino 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.119
 instead of 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.670
 the main theme of this event was that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.650
 iphone 5s and the iphone 5 c im 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.630
 Comparison to the iphone 5 has become 0 5 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.200
 in design and display almost nothing 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.880
 changed 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.439
 the only two differences are that 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.420
 It is available in three colors gold 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.159
 space gray silver and it at home 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.960
 button not because the well-known around 4 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.299
 But there is a colored ring for it 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.369
 the homebutton around this one features 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.560
 so to speak, the new phoenix center too 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.329
 Touch sensor called this should be the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.770
 guarantee the highest security 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.880
 you can unlock it with iphone 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.890
 and also buyers from the itunes store 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.140
 working in the new iphone plugged course 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.970
 also a new processor of the apple acer 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.100
 if chip is a dual core processor 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.659
 apple will this cpu on 64 bit 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.119
 changed promises faster 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.770
 animations the iphone 5 camera it 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.060
 was also changed slightly so can 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.890
 now up to ten pictures per second 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.850
 shoot and you can do that later 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.619
 Best looking out 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.329
 In addition, she has a dual led 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.130
 One can use this technology to create space 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.750
 make better night shots and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.030
 also adds a newest fashion 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.360
 function which 120 frames per second 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.800
 allows 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.140
 the form of apple mentioned yes 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.729
 additionally also the iphone 5 presented 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.500
 it is supposed to be a cheaper version of the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.360
 iphones are supposed to work in principle 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.580
 technology of the iphone 5 c right now with 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.450
 of the iphone 5 are like differences 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.340
 however available 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.840
 the iphone 5 for example in five 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.970
 different colors available and out 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.170
 a plastic housing otherwise manufactured 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.780
 let's make a small difference 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.510
 who recognize the new cheap iphone 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.530
 wants to grow with at least 599 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.959
 calculate euro 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.270
 that's so much cheaper than 900 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.950
 euro expensive iphone 5 it is doubtful 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.780
 Apple also has the sale of 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.820
 iPhone 5 completely set 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.040
 however, the older iphone 4s model still 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.140
 in the market, we now come to 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.570
 next topic samsung has on the ifa 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.880
 In 2010 samsung galaxy gio in berlin 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.130
 presented this is a ur but no 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.380
 normal watch but a smart watch the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.030
 Operation is via a 16 3 inch 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.010
 big touchscreen and a button 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.780
 the most part, however, must be about one 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.280
 compatible samsung smartphone disturbed 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.770
 At the moment these are only the galaxy 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.239
 note 3 and 10.1 in conjunction with 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.370
 These devices can be the galaxy the 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.209
 Making calls showing sms and photos 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.160
 and record videos 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.230
 june can be customized 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.680
 over 70 for optimized android apps 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.720
 use 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.940
 The battery should be 24 hours according to Samsung 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.110
 stop the price is unknown as 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.489
 Last time I would like to go back to the 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.049
 latest version of android received 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.239
 or at least the rumors 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.250
 and that goes to the android 4.4 kit kat 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.080
 the us american blog nine to five 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.330
 Google has alleged pictures of the mobile 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.920
 Operating system shown on it looks 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.049
 the settings the homescreen the 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.220
 News app and phone app everything 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.160
 looks as flat as some might 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.140
 57 know the photos match the color 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.440
 the notification bar of the respective app 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.150
 on 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.920
 if the pictures are still real 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.930
 unclear rumors say google 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.769
 Android 4.4 have patients October 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.690
 publish 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.640
 okay that was it because of technical 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.470
 edition all important links besides

 of course, a positive rating 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.410
