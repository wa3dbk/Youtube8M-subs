00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.060
 Having a phone with Full HD display, fast processor and stereo speakers gives comfort and satisfaction, 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.360
 but using only the browser or e-mail, it's hard to use this potential. 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.280
 That's why we present you 3 games that will squeeze all your juices from your phones 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.120
 We used the latest flagship model from HTC One to demonstrate 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.480
 When it comes to car racing, there is probably no more advanced graphics than Real Racing 3 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.080
 The word "real", meaning real, real, appears here for a reason. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.200
 The game features real, licensed cars, authentic routes, 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.640
 and the player is racing with live opponents in Multi Player mode, 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.980
 or with their previously saved passes when friends are currently not connected to the network. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.120
 The game is of the freemium type. 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.680
 I mean, it's free to install and play it, 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.760
 but to speed up development and promotions, 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.580
 the player can buy extra points for real money, 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.080
 which can irritate in some cases. 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.660
 However, in terms of graphics, or the pleasure of driving 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.860
 it's hard to accuse this game. 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.460
 Let's go to the next proposals. 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.480
 If we're talking about shooters, coming from what we know from computers and consoles, 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.160
 it is undoubtedly Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour. 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.640
 It offers both an interesting single player mode, 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.460
 as well as an extensive multiplayer mode that competes with each other. 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.860
 If you are looking for a classic armed conflict and full control over the character 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.140
 with a first-person view, 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.880
 you should be interested in Modern Combat 4. 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.960
 The final proposal in our ranking is Bladeslinger. 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.920
 Unique and crazy combination of western climates, firearms and fight with knives and swords. 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.440
 The creators wanted to create one of the best-looking games for phones and tablets. 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.600
 They certainly did it. 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.120
 Killing monsters with the help of impressive combos, consisting of shots and swinging the sword, 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.480
 It gives a lot of satisfaction and looks spectacular. 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.100
 The more so that to perform the so-called maneuver finishing the combo, 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.220
 draw the right shape with your finger on the screen, 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.220
 which adds extra flavor and difficulty to the game. 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.560
 However, not enough to discourage the player 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.900
 We wish you a lot of fun!
