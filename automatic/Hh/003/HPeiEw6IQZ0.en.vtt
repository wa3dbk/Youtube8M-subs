00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.980 

when<00:00:00.659> to<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.290> iPod<00:00:01.949> now<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.159> pants<00:00:02.669> were<00:00:02.990> the

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
when to the iPod now the pants were the

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.950 
when to the iPod now the pants were the
sort<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.319> volume<00:00:04.560> buttons<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:06.299> circuit

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
sort of volume buttons and the circuit

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.879 
sort of volume buttons and the circuit
lives<00:00:07.529> now<00:00:07.950> it's<00:00:08.189> here<00:00:09.500> but<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.559> think<00:00:10.830> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
lives now it's here but I think the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.570 
lives now it's here but I think the
problem<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:11.700> was<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.540> there<00:00:13.370> was<00:00:14.370> there

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
problem is what was on there was there

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.450 
problem is what was on there was there
that<00:00:14.700> black<00:00:14.910> bit<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.210> electricians<00:00:15.690> tape<00:00:16.460> now

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
that black bit of electricians tape now

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.810 
that black bit of electricians tape now
what<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.730> should<00:00:17.910> look<00:00:17.940> like<00:00:18.410> is<00:00:19.580> this<00:00:20.580> here

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
what it should look like is this here

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.870 
what it should look like is this here
this<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.150> exactly<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.720> same<00:00:21.869> pretty<00:00:22.140> much

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
this is exactly the same pretty much

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.589 
this is exactly the same pretty much
track<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.180> focus<00:00:26.150> okay<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.359> white

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
track it in focus okay this white

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.269 
track it in focus okay this white
component<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> connector<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.160> that

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
component here is the connector and that

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.900 
component here is the connector and that
black<00:00:29.699> tab<00:00:30.330> there<00:00:31.040> you<00:00:32.040> press<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.369> down<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
black tab there you press that down to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.580 
black tab there you press that down to
make<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> cable<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.780> comes<00:00:33.899> into<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.380> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
make the cable that comes into here and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.440 
make the cable that comes into here and
grip<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.890> contacts<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> inside<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
grip the contacts on the inside of the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.740 
grip the contacts on the inside of the
switch<00:00:37.550> connector<00:00:38.550> should<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.760> say<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.180> that

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
switch connector should I say and that

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.410 
switch connector should I say and that
doesn't<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.309> been<00:00:41.430> damaged<00:00:41.910> so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
doesn't have one so it's been damaged so

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.869 
doesn't have one so it's been damaged so
I'm<00:00:42.540> thinking<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.379> why<00:00:43.620> these<00:00:44.460> volume

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
I'm thinking that is why these volume

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.690 
I'm thinking that is why these volume
buttons<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.390> stopped<00:00:45.600> working<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:47.039> as

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
buttons have stopped working so as

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.940 
buttons have stopped working so as
you've<00:00:47.879> seen<00:00:48.390> I've<00:00:48.600> got<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.870> component<00:00:49.800> here

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you've seen I've got this component here

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.529 
you've seen I've got this component here
I'm<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:50.910> taking<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> whole<00:00:51.510> thing

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
I'm going to be taking the whole thing

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.510 
I'm going to be taking the whole thing
out<00:00:52.079> once<00:00:52.379> I've<00:00:52.620> moved<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.930> assembly<00:00:54.930> here

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
out once I've moved this assembly here

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
out once I've moved this assembly here
putting<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.750> then<00:00:57.960> hopefully<00:00:58.170> that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
putting this in and then hopefully that

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.310 
putting this in and then hopefully that
will<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> volume<00:00:59.430> buttons<00:00:59.760> working<00:01:00.180> in

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
will get the volume buttons working in

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.520 
will get the volume buttons working in
volume<00:01:01.320> control<00:01:02.160> loom<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.199> see

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
volume control loom is in as you can see

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100 
volume control loom is in as you can see
just<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.760> there's<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> y<00:01:06.330> part<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> body

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
just here there's the y part of the body

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.289 
just here there's the y part of the body
of<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> connector<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.460> also<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> black<00:01:08.970> tab

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
of the connector and also the black tab

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.750 
of the connector and also the black tab
that<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.510> pushed<00:01:09.750> out<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.729> connector<00:01:11.729> here

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that I pushed out so this connector here

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.149 
that I pushed out so this connector here
is<00:01:12.150> sort<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.479> pushed<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.229> they're<00:01:13.530> secured

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
is sort of pushed in and they're secured

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.980 
is sort of pushed in and they're secured
just<00:01:15.200> left<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.619> off<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:19.490> go

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
just left of this off but if I can go

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
just left of this off but if I can go
okay<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.140> well<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> other<00:01:22.920> part<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
okay so well the other part of it is the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.920 
okay so well the other part of it is the
switch<00:01:25.049> here<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.530> that's<00:01:26.490> working<00:01:26.700> again<00:01:27.450> once

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
switch here so that's working again once

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.810 
switch here so that's working again once
hope<00:01:28.259> that's<00:01:28.710> working<00:01:29.040> again<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.250> also<00:01:29.460> I

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
hope that's working again and also I

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.940 
hope that's working again and also I
would<00:01:30.630> say<00:01:30.780> yeah<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.320> screwing

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
would say yeah it's just screwing

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.039 
would say yeah it's just screwing
everything<00:01:32.189> back<00:01:32.460> down<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.210> they're<00:01:33.600> testing

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
everything back down and they're testing

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.080 
everything back down and they're testing
okay<00:01:34.530> right<00:01:34.890> once<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.579> we're<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.970> switch

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
okay right once so we're going to switch

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210 
okay right once so we're going to switch
back<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.229> I'm<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.070> gonna

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
back on like we have now I'm just gonna

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.050 
back on like we have now I'm just gonna
go<00:01:38.490> far<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.600> volume<00:01:40.009> down<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.759> then

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
go far just in the volume down and then

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.039 
go far just in the volume down and then
back<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:43.520> that's<00:01:44.520> looking<00:01:44.880> good<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.780> doing<00:01:45.960> a

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
back up that's looking good it's doing a

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.639 
back up that's looking good it's doing a
lot<00:01:46.140> mother<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:46.530> he<00:01:46.619> did<00:01:46.829> before

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
lot mother what he did before

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.200 
lot mother what he did before
still<00:01:49.649> got<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> internal<00:01:50.490> speaker<00:01:50.670> working

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
still got the internal speaker working

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.840 
still got the internal speaker working
so<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.570> fine<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.770> all<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.310> remains<00:01:53.640> now

then for this repair enough is a new

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.410 
then for this repair enough is a new
earphone<00:02:02.070> chuck<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.759> go<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.060> there<00:02:03.210> that's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
earphone chuck it to go in there that's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.090 
earphone chuck it to go in there that's
what's<00:02:03.570> gonna<00:02:03.659> be<00:02:03.810> happening<00:02:03.930> next<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.860> then

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
what's gonna be happening next and then

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.969 
what's gonna be happening next and then
a<00:02:05.340> digitizer<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.479> top<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.649> will<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.860> like

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
a digitizer on top and it will be like

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.280 
a digitizer on top and it will be like
new
