remarkable<00:00:13.559> breakthroughs<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.250> design<00:00:14.700> and

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
remarkable breakthroughs in design and

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.080 
remarkable breakthroughs in design and
technology<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.199> all<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:17.130> our<00:00:17.250> previous<00:00:17.490> models

of<00:00:18.210> iPhone<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:19.410> realized<00:00:20.210> we<00:00:21.210> should<00:00:21.320> find<00:00:22.320> a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
of iPhone we realized we should find a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.839 
of iPhone we realized we should find a
way<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:23.189> let<00:00:23.660> poor<00:00:24.660> people<00:00:25.170> buy<00:00:25.439> these<00:00:25.849> we

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
way to let poor people buy these we

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.609 
way to let poor people buy these we
realized<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.359> poor<00:00:27.660> people<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.320> actually

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
realized that poor people do actually

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.130 
realized that poor people do actually
have<00:00:29.160> some<00:00:29.220> money<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:30.330> not<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> lot<00:00:30.779> mind<00:00:31.019> you

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
have some money it's not a lot mind you

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.799 
have some money it's not a lot mind you
but<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.380> does<00:00:31.560> exist<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.030> thought<00:00:33.210> we'd

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
but it does exist so we thought we'd

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.170 
but it does exist so we thought we'd
like<00:00:34.020> some<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.469> poor<00:00:34.710> people<00:00:34.890> money<00:00:35.280> so

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
like some of that poor people money so

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.229 
like some of that poor people money so
we<00:00:36.390> designed<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.079> more<00:00:37.530> less<00:00:38.250> advanced<00:00:38.850> version

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
we designed a more less advanced version

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
we designed a more less advanced version
of<00:00:39.360> our<00:00:39.480> previous<00:00:39.930> products<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.680> marketed

idea<00:00:45.420> existed<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.289> until<00:00:46.410> moments<00:00:47.160> ago<00:00:47.399> we

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
idea existed up until moments ago we

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.540 
idea existed up until moments ago we
knew<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.960> couldn't<00:00:49.320> talk<00:00:49.530> down<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.280> poor

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
knew we couldn't talk down to poor

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.170 
knew we couldn't talk down to poor
people<00:00:51.079> they<00:00:52.079> wouldn't<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.340> rich

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
people they wouldn't like that and rich

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.729

people<00:00:54.629> would<00:00:54.750> pretend<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.680> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
people would pretend not to like it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.750

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
either so we had to find a way to mask

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.299 
either so we had to find a way to mask
