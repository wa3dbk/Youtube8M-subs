2100<00:00:06.420> today<00:00:06.660> this<00:00:06.839> is<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.020> network<00:00:07.410> attached

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
2100 today this is a network attached

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.070 
2100 today this is a network attached
storage<00:00:07.859> device<00:00:08.370> in<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.700> my<00:00:08.940> cloud<00:00:09.269> line<00:00:09.570> it's

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
storage device in the my cloud line it's

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.200 
storage device in the my cloud line it's
got<00:00:10.230> many<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.679> same<00:00:10.769> features<00:00:11.400> as<00:00:11.610> some<00:00:12.120> of

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
got many of the same features as some of

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.060 
got many of the same features as some of
their<00:00:12.330> older<00:00:12.690> my<00:00:12.870> cloud<00:00:13.170> drives<00:00:13.500> but<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
their older my cloud drives but it's a

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.799 
their older my cloud drives but it's a
lot<00:00:14.280> faster<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.000> that's<00:00:15.120> really<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.630> it

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
lot faster so that's really really it

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.730 
lot faster so that's really really it
looks<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.049> they're<00:00:16.170> they<00:00:16.260> put<00:00:16.410> their<00:00:16.529> focus

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
looks like they're they put their focus

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.050 
looks like they're they put their focus
in<00:00:17.039> was<00:00:17.190> trying<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.490> make<00:00:17.640> these<00:00:17.760> drives

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
in was trying to make these drives

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.029 
in was trying to make these drives
perform<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.050> little<00:00:19.289> bit<00:00:19.410> better<00:00:19.590> than<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
perform a little bit better than the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.560 
perform a little bit better than the
ones<00:00:20.250> they<00:00:20.369> released<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.760> couple<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.090> years<00:00:21.300> ago

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
ones they released a couple of years ago

what<00:00:21.930> we're<00:00:22.050> gonna<00:00:22.140> do<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.500> video<00:00:22.710> is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
what we're gonna do in this video is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.890 
what we're gonna do in this video is
focus<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.789> differences<00:00:24.300> between<00:00:24.539> this

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
focus on the differences between this

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.500 
focus on the differences between this
e^x<00:00:25.289> 2100<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.279> some<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.820> other<00:00:27.000> my<00:00:27.210> clouds

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
e^x 2100 and some of the other my clouds

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.970 
e^x 2100 and some of the other my clouds
we've<00:00:27.660> looked<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> past<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:28.859> you're

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
we've looked at in the past if you're

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
we've looked at in the past if you're
interested<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.519> how<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:29.849> operate<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.840> all

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
interested in how they operate and all

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.420 
interested in how they operate and all
the<00:00:31.050> nitty<00:00:31.230> gritty<00:00:31.289> about<00:00:31.740> setting<00:00:32.009> up<00:00:32.070> users

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the nitty gritty about setting up users

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.979 
the nitty gritty about setting up users
and<00:00:32.640> everything<00:00:32.910> else<00:00:33.059> I've<00:00:33.270> got<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.660> lot<00:00:33.960> of

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and everything else I've got a lot of

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.319 
and everything else I've got a lot of
content<00:00:34.500> almost<00:00:34.710> two<00:00:34.860> hours<00:00:34.890> worth<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:36.090> my

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
content almost two hours worth on my

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.150 
content almost two hours worth on my
channel<00:00:36.719> about<00:00:36.780> how<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.770> different<00:00:38.129> things

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
channel about how to do different things

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.799 
channel about how to do different things
with<00:00:38.399> these<00:00:38.610> drives<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.210> will<00:00:39.360> perform

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
with these drives and this will perform

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.990 
with these drives and this will perform
largely<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.800> same<00:00:41.040> because<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> has<00:00:41.610> most<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
largely the same because it has most of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.280 
largely the same because it has most of
the<00:00:42.059> same<00:00:42.300> features<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.930> we'll<00:00:43.020> step<00:00:43.230> through

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the same features and we'll step through

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.260 
the same features and we'll step through
some<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> those<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.640> few<00:00:44.850> minutes<00:00:45.120> when<00:00:45.239> we

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
some of those in a few minutes when we

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.270 
some of those in a few minutes when we
get<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.899> control<00:00:46.230> panel<00:00:46.260> portion<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
get to the control panel portion of the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.279 
get to the control panel portion of the
review<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.420> dual<00:00:48.660> drive<00:00:48.930> unit

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
review but this is a dual drive unit

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.709 
review but this is a dual drive unit
it's<00:00:49.440> got<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.129> WD<00:00:50.520> red<00:00:50.730> drives<00:00:51.030> onboard<00:00:51.600> as

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
it's got the WD red drives onboard as

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.450 
it's got the WD red drives onboard as
you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.989> see<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.739> drives<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.160> are<00:00:53.219> kind<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
you can see the drives that are kind of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
you can see the drives that are kind of
spring<00:00:53.789> loaded<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.329> there's<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.870> door<00:00:55.079> has<00:00:55.289> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
spring loaded so there's the door has to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.840 
spring loaded so there's the door has to
hold<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.920> place<00:00:56.129> which<00:00:56.460> makes<00:00:56.640> me<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.789> little

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
hold it in place which makes me a little

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.430 
hold it in place which makes me a little
bit<00:00:57.120> nervous<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.809> see<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.199> drive<00:00:58.410> just

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
bit nervous you can see the drive just

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.930 
bit nervous you can see the drive just
kind<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.800> wants<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> pop<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> time<00:00:59.879> so

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
kind of wants to pop out all the time so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.700 
kind of wants to pop out all the time so
you<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> push<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> drive<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.260> then

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you have to push the drive in and then

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.290 
you have to push the drive in and then
use<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> door<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.460> kind<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.699> snap<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.149> into

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
use the door to kind of snap it into

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
use the door to kind of snap it into
place<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.840> hold<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> does<00:01:05.430> have

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
place and hold it there so it does have

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
place and hold it there so it does have
a<00:01:05.610> lot<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> tension<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:06.840> do<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
a lot of tension on it so they do you

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.750 
a lot of tension on it so they do you
know<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.740> really<00:01:07.830> comes<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
know really it really comes out at you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.940 
know really it really comes out at you
when<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.630> open<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.170> I'm<00:01:10.500> sure<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.860> gonna

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
when you open it up I'm sure it's gonna

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.109 
when you open it up I'm sure it's gonna
be<00:01:11.040> fine<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:11.760> something<00:01:12.090> that

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
be fine this is not something that

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.429 
be fine this is not something that
you're<00:01:12.299> always<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:12.869> doing<00:01:13.200> with

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you're always going to be doing with

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.870 
you're always going to be doing with
these<00:01:13.590> devices<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.400> ponine<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> doors

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
these devices you know ponine the doors

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880 
these devices you know ponine the doors
and<00:01:15.030> closing<00:01:15.360> them<00:01:15.450> frequently<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.710> is

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and closing them frequently but it is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.200 
and closing them frequently but it is
something<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> bear<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.700> mind<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:18.060> you're

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
something just to bear in mind if you're

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.270 
something just to bear in mind if you're

having two drives in a RAID one

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.720 
having two drives in a RAID one
configuration<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:22.920> always<00:02:23.250> want<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.520> back

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
configuration you always want to back

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.980 
configuration you always want to back
this<00:02:23.910> up<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.240> have<00:02:24.330> something<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.690> can<00:02:24.810> take

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
this up and have something you can take

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.050 
this up and have something you can take
off-site<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.160> can<00:02:26.280> set<00:02:26.459> up<00:02:26.490> automated

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
off-site so you can set up automated

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.300 
off-site so you can set up automated
backups<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> USB<00:02:28.620> port<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.980> think<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.160> can

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
backups to the USB port I think you can

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.520 
backups to the USB port I think you can
use<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.550> front<00:02:29.730> port<00:02:30.000> also<00:02:30.180> as<00:02:30.930> an<00:02:31.110> additional

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
use the front port also as an additional

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.320 
use the front port also as an additional

port for an external drive if you so

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.030 
port for an external drive if you so

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
it's really noisy for an extended period

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.030 
it's really noisy for an extended period
of<00:02:48.630> time<00:02:48.870> while<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.140> drive<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.590> booting<00:02:49.920> up

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
of time while the drive is booting up

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.100 
of time while the drive is booting up
but<00:02:50.610> once<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:50.940> booted<00:02:51.390> up<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.660> settles<00:02:51.959> down

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
but once it is booted up it settles down

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.570 
but once it is booted up it settles down
and<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.410> really<00:02:52.560> don't<00:02:52.830> hear<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.250> all<00:02:53.400> that

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
and you really don't hear it all that

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.160 
and you really don't hear it all that
much<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.910> would<00:02:53.940> imagine<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.510> would<00:02:54.540> get<00:02:54.750> noisy

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
much I would imagine it would get noisy

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.199 
much I would imagine it would get noisy
again<00:02:55.320> if<00:02:56.220> you're<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.580> know<00:02:56.670> really<00:02:56.910> pushing

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
again if you're you know really pushing

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.180 
again if you're you know really pushing
the<00:02:57.300> drives<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.959> very<00:02:58.260> warm<00:02:58.530> environment

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
the drives in a very warm environment

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.250 
the drives in a very warm environment
but<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.340> think<00:02:59.580> generally<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.630> fan<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.080> not

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
but I think generally the fan is not

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.140 
but I think generally the fan is not
going<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.620> be<00:03:01.769> too<00:03:02.070> audible<00:03:02.580> throughout<00:03:02.940> its

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
going to be too audible throughout its

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.090 
going to be too audible throughout its
usage<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:03.720> I'm<00:03:03.780> gonna<00:03:03.930> do<00:03:04.050> now<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.260> boot<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:04.980> up

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
usage so I'm gonna do now is boot it up

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.470 
usage so I'm gonna do now is boot it up
and<00:03:05.340> we're<00:03:05.610> gonna<00:03:05.670> take<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> look<00:03:06.120> at<00:03:06.330> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
and we're gonna take a look at the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.759 
and we're gonna take a look at the
control<00:03:06.810> panel<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.230> then<00:03:07.320> look<00:03:07.530> at<00:03:07.590> some

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
control panel and then look at some

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.710 
control panel and then look at some
benchmarks<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.700> here<00:03:08.880> we<00:03:08.970> are<00:03:09.000> at<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.390> control

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
benchmarks so here we are at the control

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.759 
benchmarks so here we are at the control
panel<00:03:09.870> they<00:03:10.080> did<00:03:10.230> make<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.440> look<00:03:10.739> different

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
panel they did make it look different

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.949 
panel they did make it look different
it's<00:03:11.250> now<00:03:11.430> got<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.150> white<00:03:12.360> background<00:03:12.870> with

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
it's now got a white background with

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.930 
it's now got a white background with
some<00:03:12.989> different<00:03:13.350> icons<00:03:13.739> but<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.580> largely

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
some different icons but it is largely

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.060 
some different icons but it is largely
the<00:03:15.090> same<00:03:15.510> exact<00:03:15.989> thing<00:03:16.230> as<00:03:16.470> their<00:03:16.739> prior

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
the same exact thing as their prior

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.130 
the same exact thing as their prior
versions<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.850> set<00:03:18.120> up<00:03:18.209> users<00:03:18.600> exactly<00:03:19.019> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
versions so you set up users exactly the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.990 
versions so you set up users exactly the
same<00:03:19.350> way<00:03:19.530> but<00:03:20.130> they<00:03:20.250> did<00:03:20.400> their<00:03:20.579> one<00:03:20.790> nice

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
same way but they did their one nice

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.270 
same way but they did their one nice
thing<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.510> share<00:03:21.720> side<00:03:22.019> here<00:03:22.350> is<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.709> the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
thing on the share side here is that the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.370 
thing on the share side here is that the
public<00:03:23.610> folder<00:03:23.820> now<00:03:24.090> can<00:03:24.390> be<00:03:24.540> restricted<00:03:25.019> from

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
public folder now can be restricted from

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.900 
public folder now can be restricted from
access<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.190> people<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.610> only<00:03:26.790> have

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
access to people that only have

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.300 
access to people that only have
usernames<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.780> passwords<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.530> before<00:03:28.920> of

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
usernames and passwords so before of

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.530 
usernames and passwords so before of
course<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.700> could<00:03:29.820> set<00:03:29.970> up<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.209> know<00:03:30.329> a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
course you could set up you know a

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.880 
course you could set up you know a
hundred<00:03:30.750> different<00:03:31.140> folders<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.590> were<00:03:31.709> all

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
hundred different folders that were all

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.160 
hundred different folders that were all
restricted<00:03:32.430> but<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.269> public<00:03:33.630> folder<00:03:33.840> was

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
restricted but the public folder was

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.690 
restricted but the public folder was
always<00:03:34.500> available<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:35.040> anyone<00:03:35.340> who<00:03:35.489> had

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
always available to anyone who had

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.880 
always available to anyone who had
access<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.180> your<00:03:36.360> network<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:37.739> now

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
access to your network you can now

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.130 
access to your network you can now
restrict<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.579> public<00:03:38.880> folder<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.360> here<00:03:39.390> just

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
restrict the public folder in here just

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.229 
restrict the public folder in here just
by<00:03:40.260> turning<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.769> public<00:03:41.130> option<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.760> off<00:03:42.030> I

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
by turning the public option to off I

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.910 
by turning the public option to off I
just<00:03:42.390> turned<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.630> back<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.650> get<00:03:43.799> the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
just turned it back on but you get the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.590 
just turned it back on but you get the
idea<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.850> that's<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.150> really<00:03:45.420> nice<00:03:45.540> feature

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
idea and that's a really nice feature

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.660 
idea and that's a really nice feature
now<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.410> means<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.739> only<00:03:47.010> people<00:03:47.519> that

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
now so that means that only people that

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.430 
now so that means that only people that
have<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> username<00:03:48.269> or<00:03:48.420> password<00:03:48.540> can<00:03:49.290> get

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
have a username or password can get

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.229 
have a username or password can get
access<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:49.920> your<00:03:50.190> drive<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.700> simple<00:03:51.060> thing

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
access to your drive is a simple thing

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.330 
access to your drive is a simple thing
but<00:03:51.299> it<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.350> nice<00:03:52.650> new<00:03:52.920> feature<00:03:53.190> that

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
but it is a nice new feature that

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.610 
but it is a nice new feature that
they've<00:03:53.700> added<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.780> mix<00:03:54.989> here<00:03:55.200> cloud

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
they've added to the mix here cloud

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.610 
they've added to the mix here cloud
access<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.549> same<00:03:56.760> same<00:03:57.209> app<00:03:57.450> as<00:03:57.750> before<00:03:58.320> so

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
access is the same same app as before so

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.199 
access is the same same app as before so
the<00:03:58.739> WD<00:03:59.070> my<00:03:59.220> cloud<00:03:59.519> app<00:03:59.730> that<00:04:00.000> if<00:04:00.090> you're

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
the WD my cloud app that if you're

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.819 
the WD my cloud app that if you're
already<00:04:00.390> using<00:04:00.510> where<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.350> saw<00:04:01.560> him<00:04:01.590> on<00:04:01.709> my

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
already using where you saw him on my

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.740 
already using where you saw him on my
other<00:04:01.950> videos<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.640> app<00:04:03.000> you'll<00:04:03.299> use<00:04:03.540> to

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
other videos is the app you'll use to

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.720 
other videos is the app you'll use to
access<00:04:04.230> this<00:04:04.440> drive<00:04:04.769> it's<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.130> same<00:04:05.340> exact

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
access this drive it's the same exact

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.449 
access this drive it's the same exact
procedure<00:04:06.600> there<00:04:06.959> on<00:04:07.170> backups<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.130> only<00:04:08.340> new

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
procedure there on backups the only new

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.580 
procedure there on backups the only new
option<00:04:08.820> here<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.209> camera<00:04:09.630> backup<00:04:10.200> option

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
option here is the camera backup option

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.470 
option here is the camera backup option
and<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.769> is<00:04:10.980> where<00:04:11.160> you'll<00:04:11.310> use<00:04:11.579> that<00:04:11.609> little

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
and that is where you'll use that little

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.150 
and that is where you'll use that little
port<00:04:12.780> on<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.140> front<00:04:13.170> here<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.799> can<00:04:13.890> detect

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
port on the front here and it can detect

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.069 
port on the front here and it can detect
a<00:04:14.340> camera<00:04:14.640> when<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:14.910> plugged<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:16.019> you

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
a camera when it's plugged in and you

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.719 
a camera when it's plugged in and you
can<00:04:16.229> also<00:04:16.350> decide<00:04:16.799> where<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.280> want<00:04:17.519> those

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
can also decide where you want those

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.120 
can also decide where you want those
those<00:04:18.630> files<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.169> get<00:04:19.260> transferred<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.799> when

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
those files to get transferred to when

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.590 
those files to get transferred to when
you<00:04:20.250> do<00:04:20.400> plug<00:04:20.669> them<00:04:20.850> in<00:04:20.970> what's<00:04:21.150> nice<00:04:21.329> is<00:04:21.479> that

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
you do plug them in what's nice is that

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.080 
you do plug them in what's nice is that
it<00:04:21.720> will<00:04:21.810> create<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.080> new<00:04:22.289> folder<00:04:22.610> based<00:04:23.610> on<00:04:23.849> the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
it will create a new folder based on the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.770 
it will create a new folder based on the
day

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
day

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.320 
day
date<00:04:25.110> but<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.800> can<00:04:25.920> also<00:04:26.070> change<00:04:27.000> these

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
date but you can also change these

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.970 
date but you can also change these
options<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:28.050> make<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.350> fault<00:04:28.590> of<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.770> date

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
options to make the fault of the date

those<00:04:31.170> lines<00:04:31.320> even<00:04:31.560> something<00:04:31.950> custom<00:04:32.340> if<00:04:32.460> you

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
those lines even something custom if you

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.730 
those lines even something custom if you
wish<00:04:32.760> to<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:33.270> think<00:04:33.750> having<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:34.200> done<00:04:34.350> by<00:04:34.500> date

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
wish to I think having it done by date

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.320 
wish to I think having it done by date
is<00:04:34.889> pretty<00:04:35.100> pretty<00:04:35.400> handy<00:04:35.820> there<00:04:35.970> so<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.210> can

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
is pretty pretty handy there so you can

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.420 
is pretty pretty handy there so you can
go<00:04:36.510> ahead<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.900> grab<00:04:37.530> your<00:04:37.560> camera<00:04:38.070> plug<00:04:38.310> it

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
go ahead and grab your camera plug it

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.520 
go ahead and grab your camera plug it
into<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.970> USB<00:04:39.210> port<00:04:39.360> here<00:04:39.840> push<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.230> button

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
into the USB port here push the button

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.470 
into the USB port here push the button
and<00:04:40.710> it'll<00:04:41.100> dump<00:04:41.370> everything<00:04:41.610> into<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.030> folder

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
and it'll dump everything into a folder

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.810 
and it'll dump everything into a folder
that<00:04:42.630> was<00:04:42.810> dated<00:04:43.230> with<00:04:43.380> today's<00:04:43.740> date<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.700> can

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
that was dated with today's date you can

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.580 
that was dated with today's date you can
also<00:04:44.970> set<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.389> automatically<00:04:45.930> do<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.230> so

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
also set it to automatically do that so

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.230 
also set it to automatically do that so
you<00:04:46.650> could<00:04:46.950> just<00:04:47.160> turn<00:04:47.310> this<00:04:47.430> option<00:04:47.669> on<00:04:47.940> and

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
you could just turn this option on and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.879 
you could just turn this option on and
then<00:04:48.540> any<00:04:48.690> time<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.990> detects<00:04:49.290> that<00:04:49.380> camera

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
then any time it detects that camera

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.270 
then any time it detects that camera
it'll<00:04:50.070> just<00:04:50.370> dump<00:04:50.700> everything<00:04:50.870> right<00:04:51.870> out<00:04:52.080> to

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
it'll just dump everything right out to

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.680 
it'll just dump everything right out to
your<00:04:53.280> Nass<00:04:53.639> tribe<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.270> can<00:04:54.389> get<00:04:54.510> access

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
your Nass tribe and you can get access

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.360 
your Nass tribe and you can get access
to<00:04:54.870> those<00:04:54.990> files<00:04:55.230> over<00:04:55.560> your<00:04:55.830> network<00:04:56.190> which

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
to those files over your network which

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.280 
to those files over your network which
is<00:04:56.520> pretty<00:04:57.180> handy<00:04:57.390> there<00:04:57.750> but<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:57.960> can<00:04:58.080> tell<00:04:58.200> you

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
is pretty handy there but I can tell you

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.960 
is pretty handy there but I can tell you
beyond<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:58.830> this<00:04:59.040> is<00:04:59.190> pretty<00:04:59.400> much<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.790> same

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
beyond that this is pretty much the same

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.860 
beyond that this is pretty much the same
product<00:05:00.419> as<00:05:00.540> before<00:05:01.040> except<00:05:02.040> in<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.340> area<00:05:02.730> of

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
product as before except in the area of

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.930 
product as before except in the area of
performance<00:05:03.870> this<00:05:04.050> is<00:05:04.370> lightning<00:05:05.370> fast<00:05:05.640> at

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
performance this is lightning fast at

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.520 
performance this is lightning fast at
least<00:05:05.970> compared<00:05:06.480> to<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.660> old<00:05:06.960> one<00:05:07.230> so<00:05:07.380> let's

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
least compared to the old one so let's

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.409 
least compared to the old one so let's
take<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.710> look<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.100> see<00:05:08.550> what<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:08.850> does<00:05:08.880> perform

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
take a look and see what it does perform

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.600 
take a look and see what it does perform
at<00:05:09.570> so<00:05:10.350> I'm<00:05:10.440> really<00:05:10.740> satisfied<00:05:10.950> with<00:05:11.310> the

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
at so I'm really satisfied with the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.010 
at so I'm really satisfied with the
speeds<00:05:11.880> we're<00:05:12.090> seeing<00:05:12.300> out<00:05:12.510> of<00:05:12.540> this<00:05:12.840> new

WD My cloud reviews I've been very happy
with<00:05:24.240> how<00:05:24.780> easy<00:05:25.050> they<00:05:25.260> are<00:05:25.290> to<00:05:25.410> use<00:05:25.680> but<00:05:25.889> the

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
with how easy they are to use but the

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.500 
with how easy they are to use but the
performance<00:05:26.400> wasn't<00:05:26.550> always<00:05:26.850> there<00:05:27.180> for<00:05:27.419> this

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
performance wasn't always there for this

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.450 
performance wasn't always there for this
kind<00:05:27.720> of<00:05:27.840> high<00:05:28.020> bandwidth<00:05:28.530> work<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:29.070> now<00:05:29.430> it's

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
kind of high bandwidth work and now it's

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.159 
kind of high bandwidth work and now it's
pretty<00:05:29.729> much<00:05:29.820> saturating<00:05:30.540> my<00:05:30.660> Gigabit

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
pretty much saturating my Gigabit

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.780 
pretty much saturating my Gigabit
Ethernet<00:05:31.400> connection<00:05:32.400> I've<00:05:32.490> got<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.640> pretty

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
Ethernet connection I've got a pretty

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.580 
Ethernet connection I've got a pretty
cheap<00:05:33.090> switch<00:05:33.419> down<00:05:33.660> below<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.110> table<00:05:34.440> here

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
cheap switch down below the table here

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.770 
cheap switch down below the table here
so<00:05:34.740> I'm<00:05:34.800> not<00:05:34.830> expecting<00:05:35.010> the<00:05:35.970> full<00:05:36.210> gigabit

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
so I'm not expecting the full gigabit

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.659 
so I'm not expecting the full gigabit
but<00:05:36.930> I'm<00:05:36.990> really<00:05:37.320> seeing<00:05:37.560> what<00:05:37.890> we<00:05:38.220> should<00:05:38.490> be

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
but I'm really seeing what we should be

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.190 
but I'm really seeing what we should be
seeing<00:05:38.940> out<00:05:39.180> of<00:05:39.300> a<00:05:39.390> device<00:05:39.690> that's<00:05:39.930> really

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
seeing out of a device that's really

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.080 
seeing out of a device that's really
pushing<00:05:40.560> that<00:05:40.680> network<00:05:41.130> to<00:05:41.789> where<00:05:41.970> it<00:05:42.060> should

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
pushing that network to where it should

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.670 
pushing that network to where it should
go<00:05:42.300> so<00:05:42.780> I<00:05:42.810> think<00:05:42.900> they've<00:05:43.200> done<00:05:43.229> a<00:05:43.410> nice<00:05:43.620> job

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
go so I think they've done a nice job

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.340 
go so I think they've done a nice job
here<00:05:44.190> really<00:05:44.460> focusing<00:05:45.150> on<00:05:45.360> getting<00:05:46.110> their

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
here really focusing on getting their

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.140 
here really focusing on getting their
performance<00:05:46.890> up<00:05:47.070> on<00:05:47.220> this<00:05:47.370> new<00:05:47.610> drive<00:05:47.880> which

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
performance up on this new drive which

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.610 
performance up on this new drive which
is<00:05:48.300> definitely<00:05:48.630> what<00:05:49.050> they've<00:05:49.229> done<00:05:49.440> so<00:05:49.560> they

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
is definitely what they've done so they

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.110 
is definitely what they've done so they
put<00:05:49.770> a<00:05:49.800> higher<00:05:49.979> performance<00:05:50.400> processor<00:05:50.970> on

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
put a higher performance processor on

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.180 
put a higher performance processor on
there<00:05:51.300> so<00:05:51.419> it<00:05:51.479> can<00:05:51.570> process<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:52.620> i/o<00:05:52.770> a<00:05:52.979> little

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
there so it can process the i/o a little

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.610 
there so it can process the i/o a little
bit<00:05:53.310> faster<00:05:53.729> there's<00:05:54.120> also<00:05:54.270> more<00:05:54.510> RAM<00:05:54.900> also<00:05:55.470> so

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
bit faster there's also more RAM also so

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.950 
bit faster there's also more RAM also so
as<00:05:55.740> we<00:05:55.860> start<00:05:56.070> seeing<00:05:56.310> some<00:05:56.490> more<00:05:56.880> apps<00:05:57.539> come

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
as we start seeing some more apps come

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.390 
as we start seeing some more apps come
out<00:05:58.080> for<00:05:58.320> these<00:05:58.440> types<00:05:58.740> of<00:05:58.860> devices<00:05:59.160> that

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
out for these types of devices that

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.100 
out for these types of devices that
should<00:05:59.640> be<00:05:59.729> able<00:05:59.820> to<00:05:59.970> handle<00:06:00.570> a<00:06:00.780> bunch<00:06:00.990> of

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
should be able to handle a bunch of

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.659 
should be able to handle a bunch of
things<00:06:01.289> in<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:01.590> background<00:06:02.070> it<00:06:02.190> has<00:06:02.310> all<00:06:02.550> the

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
things in the background it has all the

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.090 
things in the background it has all the
features<00:06:03.030> of<00:06:03.060> the<00:06:03.750> other<00:06:03.900> WD<00:06:04.350> My<00:06:04.530> cloud<00:06:04.590> drives

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
features of the other WD My cloud drives

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.130 
features of the other WD My cloud drives
as<00:06:05.340> well<00:06:05.669> so<00:06:06.330> if<00:06:06.390> you're<00:06:06.510> looking<00:06:06.630> for<00:06:06.930> one<00:06:07.050> of

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
as well so if you're looking for one of

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.450 
as well so if you're looking for one of
these<00:06:07.229> things<00:06:07.440> and<00:06:07.830> you<00:06:08.250> know<00:06:08.310> maybe

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
these things and you know maybe

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.400 
these things and you know maybe
contemplating<00:06:09.210> the<00:06:09.300> ex2<00:06:09.930> or<00:06:10.140> some<00:06:10.260> of<00:06:10.350> the

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
contemplating the ex2 or some of the

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.440 
contemplating the ex2 or some of the
other<00:06:10.560> WD<00:06:11.010> NASA<00:06:11.430> devices<00:06:12.000> I<00:06:12.030> would<00:06:12.270> take<00:06:12.419> a

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
other WD NASA devices I would take a

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.690 
other WD NASA devices I would take a
look<00:06:12.690> at<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:13.500> new<00:06:13.620> series<00:06:14.010> of<00:06:14.039> new<00:06:14.400> drives

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
look at the new series of new drives

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.719 
look at the new series of new drives
including<00:06:14.940> this<00:06:15.300> e^x<00:06:15.660> 2100<00:06:16.560> because<00:06:16.979> this<00:06:17.580> is

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
including this e^x 2100 because this is

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.219 
including this e^x 2100 because this is
finally<00:06:18.090> delivering<00:06:18.479> the<00:06:18.630> performance<00:06:18.930> that

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
finally delivering the performance that

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.860 
finally delivering the performance that
it<00:06:19.950> should<00:06:20.310> and<00:06:20.610> it's<00:06:20.940> got<00:06:21.120> that<00:06:21.300> really<00:06:21.600> nice

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
it should and it's got that really nice

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.260 
it should and it's got that really nice
interface<00:06:22.400> along<00:06:23.400> with<00:06:23.640> it<00:06:23.850> too<00:06:24.000> which<00:06:24.180> i

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
interface along with it too which i

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.940 
interface along with it too which i
think<00:06:24.330> is<00:06:24.600> a<00:06:24.720> makes<00:06:25.320> it<00:06:25.410> a<00:06:25.470> really<00:06:25.830> good

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
think is a makes it a really good

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.790 
think is a makes it a really good
product<00:06:26.250> so<00:06:26.400> that<00:06:26.490> is<00:06:26.700> the<00:06:26.850> e^x<00:06:27.240> 2100<00:06:28.140> I<00:06:28.289> like

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
product so that is the e^x 2100 I like

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.590 
product so that is the e^x 2100 I like
it<00:06:28.979> and<00:06:29.100> this<00:06:29.460> is<00:06:29.640> LAN<00:06:29.820> Seidman<00:06:30.270> thanks<00:06:30.479> for

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
it and this is LAN Seidman thanks for

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.730 
it and this is LAN Seidman thanks for
watching

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740
