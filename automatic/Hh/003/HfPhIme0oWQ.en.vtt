with dr. Richtofen that's where he works

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.670 
with dr. Richtofen that's where he works
dr.<00:00:33.719> Richtofen<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.230> meet<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.620> shi<00:00:34.920> no<00:00:35.040> numa<00:00:35.450> but

dr. Richtofen we meet in shi no numa but

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.700 
dr. Richtofen we meet in shi no numa but
the<00:00:37.680> meteor<00:00:38.280> Tunguska<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.600> lands<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.350> around

the meteor Tunguska it lands and around

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.080 
the meteor Tunguska it lands and around
it<00:00:40.980> they<00:00:41.940> find<00:00:42.300> element<00:00:42.899> 115<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.129> dr.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
it they find element 115 and dr.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.869 
it they find element 115 and dr.
Richtofen<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:46.050> lead<00:00:46.289> scientist<00:00:46.860> he<00:00:47.520> takes

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
Richtofen the lead scientist he takes

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.290 
Richtofen the lead scientist he takes
element<00:00:48.539> 115<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.620> he<00:00:50.160> experiments<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:51.000> it

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
element 115 and he experiments with it

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.389 
element 115 and he experiments with it
and<00:00:51.719> he<00:00:51.809> finds<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.320> they<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.770> control

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
and he finds that they can control

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.450 
and he finds that they can control
electricity<00:00:54.170> like<00:00:55.170> free<00:00:55.590> energy<00:00:56.039> which<00:00:56.309> is

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
electricity like free energy which is

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.860 
electricity like free energy which is
where<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> Wunderwaffe<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:58.230> dg2<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
where the Wunderwaffe the dg2 and

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.720 
where the Wunderwaffe the dg2 and
electric<00:01:00.870> barriers<00:01:01.379> come<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.399> them

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
electric barriers come in that's them

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.969 
electric barriers come in that's them
manipulating<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> electricity<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.500> pretty

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
manipulating the electricity to pretty

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.800 
manipulating the electricity to pretty
much<00:01:05.100> make<00:01:05.360> whatever<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.689> want<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> he

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
much make whatever they want and so he

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.030 
much make whatever they want and so he
takes<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:11.510> element<00:01:12.510> 115<00:01:12.780> dr.<00:01:13.380> Richtofen<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
takes the element 115 dr. Richtofen and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.160 
takes the element 115 dr. Richtofen and
he<00:01:14.400> wants<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.790> try<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.150> make<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.479> teleporter

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

you look on the box that said 115 my

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.360 
you look on the box that said 115 my
theory<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.829> that<00:03:29.450> um<00:03:30.590> virtua<00:03:31.590> fan<00:03:31.769> he<00:03:31.980> lived<00:03:32.250> in

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
theory is that um virtua fan he lived in

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.520 
theory is that um virtua fan he lived in
the<00:03:32.459> doctors<00:03:32.880> quarters<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.569> he<00:03:34.380> was

the doctors quarters and he was

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.979 
the doctors quarters and he was
gathering<00:03:35.040> element<00:03:35.760> 115<00:03:36.000> from<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.630> meteor

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
gathering element 115 from the meteor

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.390

that<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.410> see<00:03:37.680> by<00:03:37.950> storage<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:40.190> really<00:03:41.190> he

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
that you see by storage and really he

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.640 
that you see by storage and really he
takes<00:03:41.669> the<00:03:41.940> element<00:03:42.569> 115<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.169> that's<00:03:43.410> where

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
takes the element 115 and that's where

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.930 
takes the element 115 and that's where
he<00:03:43.799> experiments<00:03:44.340> with<00:03:44.489> with<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.269> there<00:03:45.510> until

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
he experiments with with it there until

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.039 
he experiments with with it there until
