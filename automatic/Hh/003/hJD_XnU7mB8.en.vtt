00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.129
 Hello dear friends I want to be here 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.810
 to a question about car service here 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.950
 about business related 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.539
 cars with their service in 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.289
 repair and so on question sounds 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.939
 as follows survives in canada 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.759
 car business car services 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.720
 auto disassembly painting 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:36.800
 judging by the prices of cars demand is small 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.800
 and not cost-effective 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.789
 missed your glass read eternal 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:51.300
 the question is okay and as for the questions 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:54.120
 the service is very simple wounded very 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.640
 very very very popular view here 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.460
 small business is huge here 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.769
 amount of almost well in each 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.980
 quarter exactly there for 2 to 3 masterfully 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.830
 car will be with what it is connected 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.000
 This is primarily due to the fact that 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.759
 difference from our countries and the people here on 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.420
 99 percent are not used to poking around in 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:23.040
 machines, therefore, absolutely any work 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.790
 whether it is work related to oil change 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.610
 whether it's work is about replacing 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.189
 light bulbs in the car there and so on all 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.600
 these works are done in garages and 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.020
 Alexander workshops 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.270
 respectively machines millions market 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.600
 labor respectively huge people 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.009
 who work in this area without 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.830
 a piece of bread you definitely will not stay 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:55.009
 the cost of the car here is actually 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.630
 play the opposite thing in which 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.700
 plan 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.700
 meaning you 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.000
 meaning that people buy cars 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.000
 much earlier 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.980
 much earlier than our home 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:21.200
 the machine is more affordable and therefore the machine 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.540
 you can buy how to drive there start 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.600
 16 and 17 years old so again the labor market 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.760
 every year for people who are for nobody in 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.800
 the field is only growing because 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.350
 number of customers every year too 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.060
 only grows 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:43.549
 now he is painting there and other things 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.549
 more than a thousand is not even a painting question 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.880
 oh format yes which more prevail 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.880
 here 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.500
 need masterful 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.640
 mostly we are here of course 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:02.379
 dominated by mechanical workshops which 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.409
 removed the chassis and engine 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:10.280
 almost everywhere I saw there are corners 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:12.730
 for repair very for repair and for 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.590
 tire change for tire change 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.739
 that is, balancing disassembly and so 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.739
 further rubber tires tires 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.739
 very few workshops directly 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.629
 garages where do paint work 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.230
 As a rule, paint work is done 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.069
 already either at dealers or there any 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.840
 larger on the shooting gallery 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.160
 proper runes not so often wrong 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.340
 lot 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.340
 at the cost of work depending on 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.510
 degree of repair I heard and saw that 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.310
 garages offer painting item 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.030
 for about two hundred three hundred dollars 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.490
 element but here let's say I'm in june 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.870
 will do 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.270
 body repair is not there lapped 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.600
 on insurance 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.330
 I'm honestly shocked because I will 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.440
 do and dipper and dealers shot for 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.440
 painting for this rear bumper and 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:24.960
 rear wing painting 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:27.690
 account insurance company account at 1600 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.800
 dollars that is in my opinion it 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.630
 about 2 times higher than the price at the very 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.310
 actually work which had to be 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.740
 do here such here 10 price tags and what 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.420
 I also want to say about this a and 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.940
 accordingly, as for 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.750
 work mechanics pay mechanics then 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.400
 mechanics here on hiv and newbies i just 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.740
 talked with a step which this 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.650
 engaged in his time at the beginners 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.320
 get from 15 dollars an hour these are the ones 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.510
 who feed there bring bring and those 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:06.380
 which with hands with head they 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.760
 earn and 25 and 40 dollars per hour 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.530
 forty of course you're already busting 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.540
 that's 25 dollars an hour that's it 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.969
 normal average dachshund 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.319
 mechanic 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:23.379
 in a garage in montreal at 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:25.759
 accordingly when we fold 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.159
 pricing for their services having given when 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:31.999
 we give the car to the repair we have to 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:34.689
 understand that the cost of repair will be 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:36.799
 stream into yourself 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:40.399
 ingredients are not in the necessary amount there 

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:42.520
 talking about painting and directly 

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:45.610
 work master 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.129
 25 dollars per hour conditional critters for this 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.210
 personally hours how he will walk on your 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.970
 cars 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.650
 probably all about this, I hope that 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.449
 I said once again that here 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.440
 a huge number of Russian just 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.440
 really competently and 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.990
 I think that 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.830
 Here is this topic that never 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.830
 will remain without 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.930
 the rest of the reward is people 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.500
 which topic they always work 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:25.170
 Adam such what 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.170
 bark you all the best and goodbye
