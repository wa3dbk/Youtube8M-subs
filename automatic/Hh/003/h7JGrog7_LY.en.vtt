this this those are going to be moved in
a<00:02:48.290> few<00:02:48.500> inches<00:02:49.420> because<00:02:50.420> um<00:02:51.010> once<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.099> start

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
a few inches because um once you start

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.289 
a few inches because um once you start
drilling<00:02:52.549> these<00:02:53.319> sometimes<00:02:54.319> they<00:02:55.269> crack<00:02:56.269> a

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
drilling these sometimes they crack a

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.330 
drilling these sometimes they crack a
