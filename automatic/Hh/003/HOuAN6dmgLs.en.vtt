00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.900
 I think it's 48 but it's right before 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:37.190
 I think you thought 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.890
 I think other people do not think so, but in fact 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.670
 Here 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.810

 I think it is difficult to understand 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.150
 It means that I think you still ejaculation of love and want to sneak in behind aki 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.360

 It is red though 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.820

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.990
 This anything at this time 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:47.210
 I did not have anything, I understand that the pot of the club will do 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:47.930
 Oh yes, please keep the same number of ninefold on the adjacent card with the red card and say 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.680

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:28.960
 Then I said that I will use 8 cards this time, and I'm spreading it, but I'm breaking it 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.960
 Because it counts with this one because there are 12345678 breaks 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.200

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.740
 2 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:06.240
 In the end because this has become two 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.410
 Count this as one 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.460

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.490
 Then 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.980
 From here 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.909

 While saying that we are mixing with soccer black, actually there are already three or more 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:35.850
 Since it has become in the end this two in the high you'll be counted as one this 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:39.950
 It seems like this early yes 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:45.980
 Then you get goofor like this 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:47.310
 Then I come to the pitch from the top once more 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.290

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.960
 And because this is two now 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.590
 It will be like this 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.590
