over it

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.230 
over it
the<00:05:08.680> paper<00:05:08.890> is<00:05:09.040> really<00:05:09.070> thick<00:05:09.670> on<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.000> mole

the paper is really thick on the mole
skin<00:05:10.420> very<00:05:11.380> smooth<00:05:12.390> and<00:05:13.390> I<00:05:13.900> noticed<00:05:14.260> at<00:05:14.710> the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
skin very smooth and I noticed at the

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.320 
skin very smooth and I noticed at the
beginning<00:05:15.160> of<00:05:15.790> using<00:05:16.210> this

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
beginning of using this

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.510 
beginning of using this
now<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.870> rollerball<00:05:19.380> worked<00:05:19.680> just<00:05:19.830> fine<00:05:19.919> but

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
now the rollerball worked just fine but

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.909 
now the rollerball worked just fine but
fountain<00:05:21.090> pen<00:05:21.330> ink<00:05:21.600> that<00:05:21.960> kneelers<00:05:22.620> black

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
fountain pen ink that kneelers black

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.689 
fountain pen ink that kneelers black
would<00:05:23.580> almost<00:05:24.180> beat<00:05:24.660> up<00:05:24.870> if<00:05:25.139> that's<00:05:25.290> I<00:05:25.949> don't

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
would almost beat up if that's I don't

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:27.490 
would almost beat up if that's I don't
know

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
know

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.050 
know
beat<00:05:28.500> up<00:05:28.680> is<00:05:28.830> too<00:05:28.979> strong<00:05:29.370> to<00:05:29.550> say<00:05:29.729> but<00:05:29.790> that's

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
beat up is too strong to say but that's

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.600 
beat up is too strong to say but that's
kind<00:05:30.419> of<00:05:30.510> what<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:30.810> did<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.470> for<00:05:32.100> some<00:05:32.280> reason

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
kind of what it did and for some reason

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.310 
kind of what it did and for some reason
years<00:05:32.820> later<00:05:33.000> maybe<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.419> wears<00:05:33.570> off<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:34.169> the

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
years later maybe it wears off and the

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.360 
years later maybe it wears off and the
wear<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:34.560> tear<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:34.979> rubbing<00:05:35.250> of<00:05:35.310> the

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
wear and tear and the rubbing of the

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.570 
wear and tear and the rubbing of the
pages<00:05:35.669> it<00:05:36.570> goes<00:05:36.990> in<00:05:37.229> and<00:05:37.470> it<00:05:37.650> settles<00:05:38.040> really

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
pages it goes in and it settles really

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.090 
pages it goes in and it settles really
quick<00:05:38.850> and<00:05:39.330> it<00:05:39.570> dries<00:05:39.840> fast<00:05:40.199> I<00:05:40.380> can<00:05:40.590> write<00:05:40.889> and

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
quick and it dries fast I can write and

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.980 
quick and it dries fast I can write and
then<00:05:41.190> smear<00:05:41.639> it<00:05:41.729> within<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.240> few<00:05:42.389> seconds<00:05:42.780> but

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
then smear it within a few seconds but

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.900 
then smear it within a few seconds but
so<00:05:43.560> I'm<00:05:43.770> really<00:05:44.010> excited<00:05:44.160> to<00:05:44.310> use<00:05:44.400> my<00:05:44.520> Stillman

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
so I'm really excited to use my Stillman

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.090 
so I'm really excited to use my Stillman
and<00:05:44.970> burn<00:05:45.210> it's<00:05:46.110> probably<00:05:46.350> gonna<00:05:46.440> be<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:46.919> few

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
and burn it's probably gonna be a few

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.800 
and burn it's probably gonna be a few
weeks<00:05:47.520> maybe<00:05:47.760> I'll<00:05:47.970> start<00:05:48.150> journaling<00:05:48.419> more

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
weeks maybe I'll start journaling more

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.719 
weeks maybe I'll start journaling more
and<00:05:49.020> get<00:05:49.350> through<00:05:49.560> this<00:05:49.710> I<00:05:49.949> do<00:05:50.460> a<00:05:50.550> lot<00:05:50.700> of

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
and get through this I do a lot of

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.520 
and get through this I do a lot of
drawing<00:05:51.090> too<00:05:51.330> and<00:05:51.479> I<00:05:51.510> keep<00:05:51.690> this<00:05:51.840> with<00:05:52.320> me

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
drawing too and I keep this with me

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.490 
drawing too and I keep this with me
probably<00:05:52.979> 98%<00:05:53.760> of<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.240> time<00:05:54.290> it's<00:05:55.290> a<00:05:55.350> good

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
probably 98% of the time it's a good

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.370 
probably 98% of the time it's a good
idea<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.950> keep<00:05:56.400> pen<00:05:56.669> and<00:05:56.820> paper<00:05:56.970> handy<00:05:57.380> so

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
idea to keep pen and paper handy so

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.830 
idea to keep pen and paper handy so
anyway<00:05:58.710> there<00:05:59.130> you<00:05:59.310> go<00:05:59.460> can't<00:06:00.389> wait<00:06:00.479> to<00:06:00.600> use<00:06:00.630> it

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
anyway there you go can't wait to use it

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.960 
anyway there you go can't wait to use it
with<00:06:00.960> so<00:06:01.110> far<00:06:01.290> it<00:06:02.100> looks<00:06:02.130> really<00:06:02.430> nice<00:06:02.550> tasty

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
with so far it looks really nice tasty

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.919 
with so far it looks really nice tasty
takes<00:06:03.540> me<00:06:03.780> well<00:06:04.080> later
