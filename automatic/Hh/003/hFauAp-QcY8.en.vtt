consistency in the power I love the way
they<00:00:28.980> turned<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.609> way<00:00:29.760> they<00:00:29.880> hold<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> power

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
they turned the way they hold the power

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.470 
they turned the way they hold the power
to<00:00:30.630> its<00:00:30.929> through<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.260> turn<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:32.180> like<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> bar

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
to its through the turn I like the bar

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.690 
to its through the turn I like the bar
pressure<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.960> don't<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.190> feel<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> Chi

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
pressure I don't like to feel the Chi

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.000 
pressure I don't like to feel the Chi
where<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.930> time<00:00:37.140> especially<00:00:37.500> when

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
where it is all the time especially when

I'm riding waves ah a lot the pump
I've<00:00:42.540> been<00:00:42.719> kiting<00:00:43.020> I'd<00:00:43.950> say<00:00:44.160> about<00:00:44.280> six<00:00:44.610> seven

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
I've been kiting I'd say about six seven

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.790 
I've been kiting I'd say about six seven
years<00:00:45.090> now

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
years now

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.229 
years now
straight<00:00:46.800> over<00:00:46.829> from<00:00:47.250> windsurfing<00:00:47.730> peddling

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
straight over from windsurfing peddling

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.229 
straight over from windsurfing peddling
mean<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.539> wish<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.649> had<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> North<00:00:50.760> kite<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
mean one wish I had a North kite in the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.760 
mean one wish I had a North kite in the
beginning<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.780> first<00:00:52.020> cut<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.320> after<00:00:52.620> that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
beginning of my first cut and after that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.709 
beginning of my first cut and after that
I've<00:00:52.980> only<00:00:53.219> been<00:00:53.430> riding<00:00:54.059> switch<00:00:54.449> so

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
I've only been riding switch so

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
I've only been riding switch so
basically<00:00:54.989> after<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.649> out<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.039> three<00:00:56.190> years

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
basically after we out for three years

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.250 
basically after we out for three years
at<00:00:56.579> least<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:57.270> why<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.750> want<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.199> this

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
at least what why do you want for this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.430 
at least what why do you want for this
much<00:00:58.469> very<00:00:58.850> it's<00:00:59.850> maybe<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> price<00:01:01.020> because

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
much very it's maybe the price because

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.150 
much very it's maybe the price because
it's<00:01:01.559> affordable

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
it's affordable

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.520 
it's affordable
they<00:01:02.489> were<00:01:02.550> waived<00:01:02.910> cheaper<00:01:03.840> than<00:01:04.019> any<00:01:04.260> kite

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
they were waived cheaper than any kite

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
they were waived cheaper than any kite
and<00:01:04.769> built<00:01:04.949> better<00:01:05.220> actually<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.240> more

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and built better actually you know more

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200 
and built better actually you know more
you<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.560> had<00:01:07.799> Nash<00:01:08.010> kites<00:01:08.340> blow<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.000> me

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
you know had Nash kites blow up on me

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.120 
you know had Nash kites blow up on me
and<00:01:09.479> these<00:01:09.720> things<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.049> will<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.680> rolled<00:01:10.920> in

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
and these things just will get rolled in

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
and these things just will get rolled in
huge<00:01:11.400> waves<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.119> keep<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.510> they're

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
huge waves and they keep going they're

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.780 
huge waves and they keep going they're
great<00:01:13.049> tried<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> few<00:01:13.770> other<00:01:13.860> kites<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.549> this

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
great tried a few other kites and this

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.840 
great tried a few other kites and this
is<00:01:15.000> by<00:01:15.869> far<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.680> one<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.220> performs<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> best

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
is by far the one that performs the best

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.450 
is by far the one that performs the best
in<00:01:18.240> my<00:01:18.420> opinion<00:01:18.450> I've<00:01:19.439> been<00:01:19.680> using<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.220> Nash

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
in my opinion I've been using the Nash

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.109 
in my opinion I've been using the Nash
bolt<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.610> using<00:01:23.790> because

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
bolt and it's I was using because

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.870 
bolt and it's I was using because
there's<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.390> real<00:01:24.630> safe<00:01:24.930> kite<00:01:25.430> but<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.580> was<00:01:26.700> real

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
there's a real safe kite but it was real

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.539 
there's a real safe kite but it was real
slow<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:27.869> kind<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> holding<00:01:29.070> me<00:01:29.280> back

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
slow and it was kind of holding me back

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.090 
slow and it was kind of holding me back
I<00:01:29.579> think<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.210> my<00:01:30.360> my<00:01:30.900> tidying<00:01:31.350> abilities<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
I think for my my tidying abilities and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.780 
I think for my my tidying abilities and
then<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.670> soon<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.150> got<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.460> switch<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
then as soon as I got on the switch and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.569 
then as soon as I got on the switch and
instantly<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> knew<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.740> was<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
instantly I knew that that was the the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.819 
instantly I knew that that was the the
kite<00:01:38.790> for<00:01:39.030> me<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> mean<00:01:39.630> instantly<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.680> had

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
kite for me I mean instantly all I had

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.100 
kite for me I mean instantly all I had
was<00:01:41.009> Nash<00:01:41.369> before<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.880> went<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> switch<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
was Nash before I went to switch and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.050 
was Nash before I went to switch and
yeah<00:01:43.439> these<00:01:43.590> are<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:44.189> superior<00:01:44.610> those

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
yeah these are way superior those

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.969 
yeah these are way superior those
especially<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:46.020> wave<00:01:46.200> riding<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.799> was<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
especially for wave riding I was a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.710 
especially for wave riding I was a
die-hard<00:01:47.310> cabrini<00:01:48.149> guy<00:01:48.590> for<00:01:49.590> four<00:01:49.799> years<00:01:50.130> I

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
die-hard cabrini guy for four years I

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.630 
die-hard cabrini guy for four years I
switched<00:01:51.720> over<00:01:51.899> come<00:01:52.290> Brina<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.920> switch<00:01:53.250> kites

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
switched over come Brina to switch kites

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.380 
switched over come Brina to switch kites
cuz<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.930> increased<00:01:55.320> turn<00:01:55.619> speed

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
cuz I like the increased turn speed

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.080 
cuz I like the increased turn speed
maneuverability<00:01:57.390> easy<00:01:57.869> relaunch<00:01:59.090> consistent

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
maneuverability easy relaunch consistent

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.320 
maneuverability easy relaunch consistent
power<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> Woodman

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
power just like the Woodman

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.420 
power just like the Woodman
from<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.750> leading<00:02:02.930> edge<00:02:03.170> like<00:02:03.770> competing<00:02:04.310> in

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
from the leading edge like competing in

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.130 
from the leading edge like competing in
a<00:02:04.460> cottage<00:02:04.940> suddenly<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.540> can<00:02:05.690> roll<00:02:05.870> it<00:02:05.990> back

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
a cottage suddenly you can roll it back

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.889 
a cottage suddenly you can roll it back
