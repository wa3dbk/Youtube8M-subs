00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello very good to all welcome from 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.020
 new to the channel today I'm still here in 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.380
 the boat to old work I have there my 5 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.200
 2500 with its graph 78 70 has four 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.289
 hard drives inside a conventional ssd 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.580
 I have connected then two monitors keyboards 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.109
 mouse to the microphone almost everything for usb 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.269
 everything I've gone through the same strip 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.160
 including the router that is today 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.500
 back that I 've also put it here for 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.150
 can do the test and thanks to this 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.679
 gadget that you saw in a video 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.719
 previous let's see what is the consumption 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.520
 electric all the whole set 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.290
 complete ie computer with router and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.450
 all the test I'm going to do it alone 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.550
 for one hour but good is going to give us 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.879
 an approximate calculation so nothing 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.070
 guys let's see the consumption once 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.079
 all the equipment off we will check that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.910
 the meter electricity meter 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.890
 current is completely zero this 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.629
 that you are seeing here I am passing the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.070
 values ​​and putting these to zero we're going to 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.260
 turn on the equipment 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.270
 there it is we see the voltage and we see the 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.400
 mouse how it's turned on let's go to 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.010
 turn on the computer there we see how 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.130
 turn on and let's start to vary the 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:13.330
 values ​​there you are seeing 24 seconds of 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.840
 running 130 amps and we're going to 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.280
 move to watts 155 watts in there to this 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.170
 is in the tests where I was 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.770
 doing in which the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.140
 3d marc as you see 267 consumption shakes 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.780
 using the two monitors 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.939
 270 here we can see another one of the tests 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.000
 what I did in this case was already the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.409
 final result was playing at 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.240
 infinite bioshock and at the same time 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.869
 I would be open to the other with and bull with 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.030
 with the explorer and how do you see the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.030
 consumption was maintained about 213 watts 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.650
 good to the maximum consumption that I have 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.510
 got this 270 270 watts like 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.210
 you see there the player a lot of 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.450
 chrome eyelashes and we have here the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.280
 performance test say that the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.780
 true, it is forcing us to extrabase 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.940
 there is forcing the graph quite 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.700
 to work at the top has many 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.489
 particles 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.190
 and there you see it 267 270 although it has not been 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.470
 that we are reaching the final time of 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.690
 one hour to know the exact consumption 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.450
 so let's move a sector to see 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.280
 so we can see it well and we're going to 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.760
 see the values ​​we have obtained 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.579
 325 5 watts maximum consumption has been 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.069
 a peak amps overload there's no 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.819
 hertz 49 is very good the factor of 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:45.269
 0 62 looks power is reached and 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.120
 the exact time in normal periods of 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.520
 consumption that is now is 164 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.250
 good 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.070
 the maximums have been 2 with 29 was a 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.170
 peak watts 180 now and in the test 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.480
 230 good performance depends on the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.380
 graphic the graph 6 stop pretty 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.150
 pretty the valleys but good as it was 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.370
 consumption of a PC gamer, we have it 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.900
 into account let's leave it in volts and 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:15.810
 what we are going to go now we have 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:19.470
 one hour 29 seconds is 6 49 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.880
 we see that good total consumption have been 0 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:30.450
 23 watts and the consumption of one hour to 1 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:32.130
 I mean 0.116 cents per kilowatt and what 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.660
 that has consumed in one hour our 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:39.410
 computer are 2 cents that is 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.200
 we see there one hour I consume two cents 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.500
 we already know what this equipment consumes 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.680
 guys then this team 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.020
 will consume those two cents per hour 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.750
 The truth is that I have 24 hours at 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.870
 Well, it would be quite a bit of caldito 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.940
 we would be talking about around 48 50 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.800
 cents a day would be about 15 a month 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.240
 taking into account that we should 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.070
 be playing that the two screens 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.050
 they should be on like that 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.180
 I said it of two pandas and of course 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.880
 that I connected there is also a router 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.000
 just above the computer you can see it 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.579
 the computer has one two three four 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.530
 five fans 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.299
 there's not much more to say is a 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.370
 average computer used by the bank 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.199
 I work in files I hope this 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.759
 serve to calculate more on consumption 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.439
 of these computers puts as you have 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.379
 I could see in the video the truth is 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:33.169
 that consumption is not as high as 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:35.419
 they make us believe sometimes that it is true 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.099
 that the test has made serve games 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.840
 and things that stress the 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.610
 computer and what it consumes the most is 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.349
 graphic we have seen it when 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.469
 activate a game or anything how it 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:48.070
 it was shooting consumption so really the 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.330
 maximum consumption as that 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.100
 in mind that you should be playing 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.870
 all day on the computer or all 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.820
 ground the two screens on 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.310
 et cetera etcetera that few people 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.950
 they assign guys I hope that I have 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.010
 served as help if you want you know 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.290
 know something else that consumes that 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.790
 I do not like to charge a mobile for example 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.560
 anything else you can leave me 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.120
 in the comments of this video I will do 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.890
 measurements I will make a video and 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.890
 I will teach that it consumes that not 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.330
 gadgets and good to remember that if you 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.890
 he liked the video just saying of 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.600
 santé you can support it by a like and 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.400
 can you follow me on twitter on facebook or 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.410
 any my two youtube channels with 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.410
 this I say goodbye and until the next video
