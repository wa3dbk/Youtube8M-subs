well<00:00:07.990> you<00:00:08.230> know<00:00:08.320> the<00:00:08.440> first<00:00:08.650> one<00:00:08.770> would<00:00:08.860> be<00:00:08.920> is

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
well you know the first one would be is

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.720 
well you know the first one would be is
if<00:00:09.130> you<00:00:09.400> ever<00:00:09.550> were<00:00:09.730> a<00:00:09.760> smoker<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:11.200> alone

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
if you ever were a smoker that alone

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.850 
if you ever were a smoker that alone
it's<00:00:12.730> good<00:00:12.880> that<00:00:13.030> you<00:00:13.090> quit<00:00:13.270> and<00:00:13.750> data<00:00:14.559> shows

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
it's good that you quit and data shows

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.620 
it's good that you quit and data shows
that<00:00:14.889> as<00:00:15.219> time<00:00:15.430> passes<00:00:15.730> the<00:00:16.000> damage<00:00:16.480> you've

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
that as time passes the damage you've

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.360 
that as time passes the damage you've
potentially<00:00:17.110> done<00:00:17.290> to<00:00:17.560> your<00:00:17.950> lungs<00:00:18.100> and<00:00:18.310> the

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.370 
potentially done to your lungs and the

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.279 
potentially done to your lungs and the
rest<00:00:18.580> of<00:00:18.700> your<00:00:18.820> body<00:00:18.970> is<00:00:19.300> starts<00:00:20.170> to

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
rest of your body is starts to

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.150 
rest of your body is starts to
essentially<00:00:21.160> shrink<00:00:22.060> if<00:00:22.210> you<00:00:22.330> will<00:00:22.480> and<00:00:22.720> so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
essentially shrink if you will and so

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.500 
essentially shrink if you will and so
there's<00:00:24.160> it's<00:00:24.430> truly<00:00:24.910> never<00:00:25.120> too<00:00:25.330> late<00:00:25.360> to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
there's it's truly never too late to

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.550 
there's it's truly never too late to
quit<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.400> I<00:00:27.610> think<00:00:28.300> commonly<00:00:28.840> people<00:00:29.230> say<00:00:29.500> to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
quit but I think commonly people say to

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.980 
quit but I think commonly people say to
us<00:00:29.770> how<00:00:30.040> I'm<00:00:30.310> not<00:00:30.910> all<00:00:31.060> that<00:00:31.090> short<00:00:31.630> of<00:00:31.720> breath

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
us how I'm not all that short of breath

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.799 
us how I'm not all that short of breath
as<00:00:32.380> if<00:00:32.860> there<00:00:33.280> was<00:00:33.430> an<00:00:33.579> acceptable<00:00:34.210> level<00:00:34.480> of

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
as if there was an acceptable level of

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.479 
as if there was an acceptable level of
shortness<00:00:35.260> of<00:00:35.379> breath<00:00:35.620> so<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.190> first<00:00:36.399> thing

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
shortness of breath so the first thing

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.540 
shortness of breath so the first thing
would<00:00:36.790> be<00:00:36.910> is<00:00:37.030> to<00:00:37.210> reflect<00:00:37.450> honestly<00:00:38.140> about

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
would be is to reflect honestly about

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.310 
would be is to reflect honestly about
your<00:00:39.550> limitations<00:00:40.420> with<00:00:40.570> exercise<00:00:41.079> and

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
your limitations with exercise and

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.930 
your limitations with exercise and
activity<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.010> are<00:00:42.100> those<00:00:42.339> limits<00:00:42.760> because

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
activity and are those limits because

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.810 
activity and are those limits because
you<00:00:43.870> become<00:00:44.199> truly<00:00:44.649> less<00:00:44.920> active<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.609> you

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
you become truly less active and you

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.450 
you become truly less active and you
just<00:00:46.120> started<00:00:46.719> to<00:00:46.809> slug<00:00:47.109> it<00:00:47.140> out<00:00:47.350> or<00:00:48.010> is<00:00:48.339> it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
just started to slug it out or is it

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.310 
just started to slug it out or is it
because<00:00:48.579> you<00:00:48.969> actually<00:00:49.210> find<00:00:49.570> limitations

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
because you actually find limitations

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.979 
because you actually find limitations
because<00:00:50.499> you<00:00:50.800> have<00:00:51.010> trouble<00:00:51.309> breathing<00:00:51.989> if

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
because you have trouble breathing if

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.410 
because you have trouble breathing if
your<00:00:53.289> occupation<00:00:53.730> exposes<00:00:54.730> you<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:54.879> a<00:00:55.030> lot<00:00:55.269> of

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.479 
programs for and some of those disorders
as<00:04:07.599> they<00:04:07.750> progress<00:04:07.959> ultimately<00:04:08.860> require

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
as they progress ultimately require

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.400 
as they progress ultimately require
transplant<00:04:10.090> as<00:04:10.360> part<00:04:10.599> of<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.750> management

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.270 

actually<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:15.440> lot<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.680> exciting<00:04:15.920> things<00:04:16.040> going

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
actually a lot of exciting things going

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.330 
actually a lot of exciting things going
on<00:04:16.520> in<00:04:16.640> pulmonary<00:04:17.440> with<00:04:18.440> diagnostic<00:04:18.830> side

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
on in pulmonary with diagnostic side

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.590 
on in pulmonary with diagnostic side
we've<00:04:19.640> had<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:19.790> lot<00:04:19.910> of<00:04:19.970> advances<00:04:20.450> in

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
we've had a lot of advances in

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.650 
we've had a lot of advances in
bronchoscopy<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.650> that's<00:04:21.890> allowing<00:04:22.550> us<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:22.910> do

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
bronchoscopy so that's allowing us to do

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.070 
bronchoscopy so that's allowing us to do
more<00:04:24.310> for<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.400> patients<00:04:25.940> with<00:04:26.270> less<00:04:26.750> levels

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
more for the patients with less levels

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.870 
more for the patients with less levels

therapeutic<00:04:31.790> side<00:04:32.000> there's<00:04:32.300> more<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.570> more

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
therapeutic side there's more and more

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.720
