 because I hold the blow is 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.130
 really days where I could not have 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:21.769
 to go to the hall it happened once 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.749
 for the moment I was the exercises 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.519
 house so do not hesitate to compensate and 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.589
 still play sports even if you 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.239
 can not go to the room and you 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.909
 see in session number 2 the 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.949
 exercises without really adapted to compensate 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:36.440
 the excesses we were able to make at Christmas and 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.789
 that we will certainly make the day 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.829
 of the year but worry us band is 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.570
 all in the same basket but we do not 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.890
 loose nothing and we continue I make you 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.989
 big kisses good luck 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.969
 and so it's gone for training 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.829
 room at night so to start as 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.449
 usually to attack with 3 to 5 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.429
 minutes of cardiovascular warm-up 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.899
 on the cardio device so the bike 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.609
 elliptical like that or on another 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.140
 device all that really matters 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.269
 increase the body temperature is 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.469
 to prepare the body for the effort 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.120
 then you will be able to attack that 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.580
 the first exercise the back slits 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.830
 alternating veeva repetition to do in 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.600
 alternate man 10 on each side next 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.280
 you take a minute and a half to rest 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.320
 the douars do that in all four times 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.180
 this really concedes take a big step 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.770
 backwards and bring back the leg 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.600
 pushing back with his talent for 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.040
 the front leg and their and the work and 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.320
 the thighs but also the glutes 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.700
 to complicate the cosip will make the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.320
 alternating hands france is just at 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.460
 keep your back straight and of course to 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.460
 gainer suck your order 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 m 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.000
 then after your four sets of 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.780
 bronzes will be able to chain with a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.070
 super 7 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.350
 that is, you are going to have to 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.119
 chain two exercises hear you 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.979
 you will first start with 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.960
 rehearsals to the planet we think well 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.729
 keep your back pressed against the backrest 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.679
 you will be able to work the crises 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.049
 also the glutes indicates the abbot 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.459
 thigh and your calves and everything would be 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.579
 is nice said repetition you go 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.750
 having to follow up with two repetitions 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.640
 Honecker lakers so be it 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.200
 sitting position as a concern be the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.030
 lying down is above all it's 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.289
 there the game you bring back balloon is 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.849
 so there you worked mostly the 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.560
 hamstring hamstrings the back of the thighs and 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.149
 also the calves so ten replicas 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.380
 on the press then right away 12 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.030
 repeat at the lakers 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.250
 then you blow for only 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.840
 a minute 15 and we should do that 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.370
 three times including three series 10 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.370
 repetitions plus two repetitions 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.489
 then after that it's super sat we're going 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.020
 continue always with a camera 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.370
 this time to target the glutes 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.410
 you will have to do 10 reps 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.730
 on each side then you blow 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.770
 for a minute and you do that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.630
 three times really focus on the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.610
 glutes work you use a 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.739
 device be like this does not exist 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.150
 sometimes lying on the back 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.980
 if they still count erased really 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.110
 focused on the work of the glutes of 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.060
 quickly climb the leg against 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.819
 down quietly targeting the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.930
 maximum we will gluteus and of course you 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.930
 do it on each side 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.010
 or 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.989
 and then you will be able to follow 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.390
 with another super 7 or there you go 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.319
 to link a work of the adductors 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.689
 inside the chips with the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.340
 adductors the experienced thigh so 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.959
 you do 20 reps on each 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.239
 exercise is so you start with 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.129
 inside the adductors either on the 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.150
 machine be like the small option 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.680
 vignette could break through with a 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.239
 elastic or there by cons must do 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.209
 one leg at a time and not well 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.709
 do the repetition of each side so 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.629
 we always train to blow 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.970
 combourg tight legs and inspired 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.470
 when you spread is exact and the 20 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.959
 repetitions she chained with the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.000
 abductors outside the thighs too 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.590
 so the little one is the gluteal way going on 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.269
 at the hips always the same 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.010
 beautiful voice repetition be the machine 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.870
 either you do that it's not 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.069
 the device with an elastico vaudoise 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.620
 so was the two rooms on the turn 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.659
 and the seaco makes a side elevation 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.379
 on the side of course on each side at 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.000
 leg level 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.010
 so we do not repair chains 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.629
 adductors 20 repulsion abductors on 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.650
 suffers for a minute and you have to 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.650
 do that 3 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.099
 then we'll do a job from the top of 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.290
 body with the pottery draw she has to 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.819
 repeat 15 repetition in draw you 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.340
 bring there down to the chest 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.689
 and to inspire you to go back 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.389
 in it's really about keeping the rate at 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:18.310
 bind right and to squeeze the wind to be 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.530
 so it's there you'll work the 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.780
 back and a little bit your lavender biceps 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.340
 and strand of which 15 the petition then you 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.360
 blow for a minute or two 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.360
 people three times 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.110
 and finally of course taxes with 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.790
 young or auby you have 30 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.320
 repetition to do like that must you 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.660
 put the Roman chieuse new well 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.160
 plated my knees horizontally they 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.080
 were going to pick up on the sides 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.460
 more go get diagonally you 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.790
 will feel the work at the level of 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.830
 cut 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.990
 the abs could see it's very very 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.100
 hard and o2 do 30 repeat without 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.740
 will stop blowing you during 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.660
 limit or do three series that makes 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.130
 very quickly it hurts very ripe for and 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.760
 count went to the end it's the 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.760
 end the training 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.650
 2 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.200
 or
