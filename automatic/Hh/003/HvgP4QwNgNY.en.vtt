rigged has quite a lot of control

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.290 
rigged has quite a lot of control
options<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.130> means<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.430> it's<00:00:26.640> fairly

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
options but that means that it's fairly

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.269 
options but that means that it's fairly
simple<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.720> find<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.260> good<00:00:28.619> balance<00:00:28.680> for<00:00:29.130> the

light

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
light

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.290 
light
she's<00:00:33.870> pretty<00:00:34.110> responsive<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:36.120> course

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
she's pretty responsive and of course

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.720 
she's pretty responsive and of course
with<00:00:36.480> all<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.630> controls<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.770> really

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
with all the controls here it's really

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.479 
with all the controls here it's really
easy<00:00:39.050> to<00:00:40.430> attack<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.870> drive<00:00:42.870> or<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.460> you<00:00:44.460> know

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
easy to attack to drive or to you know

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.529 
easy to attack to drive or to you know
bare<00:00:44.850> away<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.539> she's<00:00:46.289> very<00:00:46.350> simply<00:00:46.950> sailed

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
bare away so she's very simply sailed

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.090 
bare away so she's very simply sailed
you<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.719> need<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> second<00:00:49.320> person<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.010> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
you do need a second person because you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.880 
you do need a second person because you
need<00:00:50.280> somebody<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:51.289> slip<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> lines<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
need somebody to slip the lines on the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.490 
need somebody to slip the lines on the
winches<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.480> sail<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.870> easily<00:00:55.320> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
winches but you can sail that easily to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.529 
winches but you can sail that easily to
up<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> key<00:00:56.760> feature<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.120> any<00:00:57.300> modern

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
up so a key feature for any modern

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.959 
up so a key feature for any modern
luxury<00:00:58.020> boats<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.800> bathing<00:00:59.190> platform<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
luxury boats is a bathing platform and

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.709 
luxury boats is a bathing platform and
the<00:01:00.149> ML<00:01:00.359> 55<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.989> no<00:01:01.079> exception<00:01:01.620> as

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
the ML 55 is no exception as

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.910 
the ML 55 is no exception as
hydraulically<00:01:03.719> operated<00:01:03.780> bathing<00:01:04.500> platform

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
hydraulically operated bathing platform

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.350 
hydraulically operated bathing platform
but<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.100> advantage<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
but the advantage of this is that it

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.140 
but the advantage of this is that it
tucks<00:01:06.570> away<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:07.140> nicely<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> front

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
tucks away very nicely on the front

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.240 
tucks away very nicely on the front

larger NOAA add of course the Maine
which<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.440> quite<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> small<00:01:41.340> sail<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.450> it

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
which is quite a small sail but it

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.320 
which is quite a small sail but it
balances<00:01:42.720> well<00:01:43.229> with<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.650> mizzen<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:45.119> there

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
balances well with the mizzen so there

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.620 
balances well with the mizzen so there
