00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 europes keppler de 2 duo and today on 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.589
 the channel with a template and I have 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.969
 so made you here a small tablet 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.740
 and you can here the text &amp; skin 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.940
 change and before that what happened there today 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.199
 tomorrow so in ugly banner 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.150
 charged he did not notice himself 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 grew so like I know what he 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.090
 why uploaded but sorry for that 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.510
 I think the banner here a lot 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.220
 better 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.680
 and you can just fold and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.109
 because your name rain rain clap and 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.580
 then it looks cool in any case 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.960
 is just here are so folders there 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.340
 he goes to the text that here likely 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.230
 do not delete it and that's the texture 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 you do not see one that is seen 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.890
 a little different if you do that 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.420
 you can do that under it 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.010
 here 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:48.570
 Just write instead of the boss 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:50.600
 I'll just write with it 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.370
 can see how that works 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.320
 mostly a bit apart and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 then you have here 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.469
 you just get these lines 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.030
 have to go up a bit 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.590
 down as you want it makes you 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.060
 far up now than, 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.280
 makes her here now and it there 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.100
 For example , we still have to go here 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.630
 of course you can do that too 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.030
 erase away so here 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.439
 if I have to do this , that overlaps 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.710
 You can do that later 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.580
 erase is still in any case 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.960
 you have to stop too 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.080
 a bit to deal with yourself 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.119
 because that's why there should still be one 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.439
 Rumpfummeln a bit around it I think 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.850
 that's no problem , yes 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.430
 In any case you can just 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.630
 yes, everything pretended and then have 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.390
 you have the skin here you can too 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.540
 You can just go in there outside 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.070
 do your rows and memorial here the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.240
 splinters behind that you can too 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.520
 then move a bit with yours 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.350
 skin adjust and I think that would be 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 then no problem then you can 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.979
 write your name in any case 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.509
 and any background that 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.439
 you can actually let her 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.000
 also because of me a little bit because 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.310
 I do not really care about the environment 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.259
 But I think that she knocks too much 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.159
 from and yes if you like that then 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.890
 ends up just turning down too 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.429
 a new channel even wants me very much 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.860
 looking forward 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.650
 and yes I am happy and see you 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.189
 get people 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.189
 ciao
