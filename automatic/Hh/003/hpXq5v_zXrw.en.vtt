not<00:01:37.200> see<00:01:37.470> though<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> way<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.220> take<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> hard

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
not see though is a way to take the hard

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.669 
not see though is a way to take the hard
drive<00:01:39.240> out<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.630> upgrade<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> would

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
drive out to upgrade it like you would

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.310 
drive out to upgrade it like you would
on<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.850> current<00:01:42.210> ps3<00:01:42.630> which<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> little

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
on the current ps3 which is a little

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.809 
on the current ps3 which is a little
disappointing<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:46.369> then<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.580> have

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
disappointing but and then here we have

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.430 
disappointing but and then here we have
the<00:01:47.970> existing<00:01:48.420> ps3<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:48.959> when<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.259> little

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
the existing ps3 so when you do a little

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.279 
the existing ps3 so when you do a little
side<00:01:49.679> by<00:01:49.860> side<00:01:50.100> comparison<00:01:50.729> here<00:01:51.110> they<00:01:52.110> look

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
side by side comparison here they look

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.639 
side by side comparison here they look
to<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.549> pretty<00:01:53.549> much<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.850> same<00:01:54.439> length<00:01:55.439> this

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
to be pretty much the same length this

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.910 
to be pretty much the same length this
way<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.819> it's<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.179> shorter<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:58.890> little

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
way so it's just shorter and a little

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.559 
way so it's just shorter and a little
bit<00:01:59.130> thinner<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.789> look<00:02:00.000> at<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.149> from<00:02:00.209> the<00:02:00.390> top

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
bit thinner you look at it from the top

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.719 
bit thinner you look at it from the top
you<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.869> pass<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.340> quite<00:02:02.610> as

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you can pass you that it's not quite as

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.719 
you can pass you that it's not quite as
fat<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.500> basically<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.740> height<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.220> I

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
fat but basically it's a height and I

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.360 
fat but basically it's a height and I
guess<00:02:06.569> with<00:02:06.810> drop<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.890> weight<00:02:10.890> wise<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.340> is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
guess with drop and weight wise it is

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.580 
guess with drop and weight wise it is
definitely<00:02:11.610> lighter<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.569> still<00:02:12.870> feel<00:02:13.110> solid

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
definitely lighter you still feel solid

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.780 
definitely lighter you still feel solid
doesn't<00:02:13.860> feel<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.069> it's<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.370> know<00:02:14.549> stuff

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
doesn't feel like it's you know stuff

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.509 
doesn't feel like it's you know stuff
moving<00:02:15.090> around<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.420> there<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:16.130> power<00:02:17.130> eject

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
moving around in there the power eject

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.460 
moving around in there the power eject
buttons<00:02:17.819> are<00:02:17.910> now<00:02:18.060> actual<00:02:18.569> tactile<00:02:19.440> buttons

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
buttons are now actual tactile buttons

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.770 
buttons are now actual tactile buttons
as<00:02:19.980> opposed<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.549> you<00:02:21.269> know<00:02:21.299> whatever<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.720> was

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
as opposed to you know whatever this was

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.560 
as opposed to you know whatever this was
before

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
before

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.120 
before
yeah<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:24.750> there<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.020> go<00:02:25.050> two<00:02:25.530> USB<00:02:25.830> ports<00:02:25.860> in

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
yeah so there you go two USB ports in

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.120 
yeah so there you go two USB ports in
the<00:02:26.160> front<00:02:27.200> history<00:02:28.550> history<00:02:29.550> not<00:02:30.240> slim<00:02:30.510> ps3

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
the front history history not slim ps3

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.380 
the front history history not slim ps3
and<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:32.490> got<00:02:32.610> quick<00:02:32.760> update<00:02:33.000> from<00:02:33.150> Sony
