00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.250
 and then everybody who is that which measures well 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.949
 coming back another video in this video 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.770
 I'm here a server that he accepts 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.130
 pirate and original but what we saw and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.680
 this one is a follower of minecraft 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.630
 was able to set bich and bich in the template 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.000
 asks for a slash for you to play has to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 play in version 1.1 1.5 if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 and very well but stay here a little bit 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.700
 things just mick and shovel just to speak 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.989
 For those who do not think so, but he does not 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.940
 this is just a video bringing a new 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:54.420
 serves over here right gives a tip for you and a 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:02.609
 a map he invited me to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:04.260
 playing with him is this real money and he 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.180
 won a lot from him alone so he got me 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.890
 invited to play with him and he 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.650
 call big big block x of how can you see 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.420
 What in his world am I playing with? 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.400
 he and he let me get all the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.920
 things of them so there was a control 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.000
 I can come to his house. 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.090
 and use when I came I can not use the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.409
 machines that is blocked but it 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:39.509
 It did me a lot of good but do not ask him. 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.939
 ask for things I do not think will work 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.240
 So even if I made this little house with a 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.100
 I kick the inter and I think I'm not 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:55.490
 focusing on how the machine of the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.490
 things that will certainly start new 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:03.180
 state resources but even then 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.700
 That I made this little shore, it's cool, I 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.940
 I made a system of how much here with 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.349
 available the ball has a man box I 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.349
 Can I come down here? 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.790
 I will also have up here was the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.000
 chosen was a secret passage that 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.909
 I did it nec and I found it very interesting you 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.650
 can you not use so much more 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.299
 you create a world 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.639
 if you buy a post world some 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.819
 beautiful things then, how can you 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:37.609
 I can see but one so much and ask for 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.090
 advance and when I have the casting 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.049
 world a going local is loading 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.659
 huh 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.220
 It's like a lobby check like 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.069
 You can see he also gave me a 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.290
 helmet the team holder really 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.040
 relevant electrical pec these two 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.849
 on here 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.879
 in fact I found his old house 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:07.090
 and how can you see his old house 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:07.090
 It's there, we're very well here. 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:17.829
 him he had nothing here that is 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.829
 to apply did not have anything say so is 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.690
 say so right up who knows that 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.949
 pec in this mold 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.400
 only he needs some apps 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:33.500
 for transformer to run then it 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.609
 did not have a captive audience in it then 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.489
 I asked and I did some power applications you and 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:43.729
 things that are called here are 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:47.599
 different ok very well you can see too 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:53.290
 I can make light on the sites says the 7 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:53.290
 see where monsters can be born and I go there 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:03.470
 right click and put there and create a 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:05.209
 light there and now that region can not 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.659
 but I can not 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:12.549
 many lights many lights lights lights 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.549
 light lights 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:22.900
 I think it's infinite here, let's say like that, right? 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:25.780
 but the interesting thing is that this world here 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.990
 It's fine with the other. 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.010
 with a 5 berg this world here if you have 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.560
 raining 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:38.230
 maybe normal is not seeing if you have 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:41.980
 Night and Sunday are said to say no 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.690
 It does not matter if the other location is 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.320
 night or day 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.030
 so here is unb and how can i speak like 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.669
 if you can see the card is raining or 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.669
 oats or 12 3 to 1 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.600
 as you can see here in the normal world 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.790
 It's raining but the world that he is 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.800
 He is not there because it's late at night. 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:12.730
 here will mount here 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:13.510
 let's say so are times e and forecast of 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.300
 rain 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.490
 Ours and metrology are all very different 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.560
 so this is very interesting then you 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.690
 You do not have to ask for a kitchen. Let's sleep. 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.210
 because sometimes a climb too 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.190
 The hard team to ask for is so good. 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.350
 So you only have one world of yours. 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.500
 mascot has to pay r 100 until 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.830
 unfortunately a little bit but you will get 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.600
 simply a cool place that 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.610
 You can control the time. 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.510
 if it were day or night things 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:47.140
 stuff like that is not very well then 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.910
 server is there in the description hyper 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.360
 server will have the inscription who want 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.440
 can play and as I said is pirate and to 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.750
 nice control 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.419
 If you like this video it's a video 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.690
 very short and just wanted to call us so 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.070
 presenting a new server is for whom 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.590
 a lot of people like to play in 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:09.250
 servers then it is a server of 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.080
 ftp bug that is in the way of pec a snack 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.060
 I do not know if I said statue but I think 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.390
 that many people understood and the version that 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:21.580
 you have thrown at it that I remember is 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:26.050
 a point 1.5 and ends with 5 with 11 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:30.610
 Points 51 is a 11,585 I do not think it's a 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:33.570
 point 1.5 people I'm staying here alone 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.220
 You liked this video so it's 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.009
