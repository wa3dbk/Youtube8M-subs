get yourself run over during the
practice<00:00:16.529> sessions<00:00:17.070> but<00:00:17.490> interestingly<00:00:17.940> for

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
practice sessions but interestingly for

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.939 
practice sessions but interestingly for
the<00:00:18.600> drivers<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> lot<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> left-hand

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the drivers a lot of the left-hand

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.890 
the drivers a lot of the left-hand
corners<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> high<00:00:20.699> speed<00:00:20.970> corners<00:00:21.210> so

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
corners are the high speed corners so

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.810 
corners are the high speed corners so
it's<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.710> physical<00:00:22.890> thing<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:23.519> spend

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
it's really a physical thing they spend

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.240 
it's really a physical thing they spend
most<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> year<00:00:24.630> turning<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.920> their

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
most of the year turning right so their

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.220 
most of the year turning right so their
neck<00:00:26.460> gets<00:00:26.789> very<00:00:26.939> strong<00:00:27.300> upholding<00:00:27.869> itself

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
neck gets very strong upholding itself

up<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.560> right-hand<00:00:28.890> corners<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:29.789> go<00:00:29.910> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
up in right-hand corners and they go to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.089 
up in right-hand corners and they go to
Brazil<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.510> there<00:00:30.720> normally<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.560> can't<00:00:31.830> hold<00:00:31.980> my

foreign<00:01:14.310> will<00:01:14.729> packed<00:01:15.270> into<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.900> tiny

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
foreign will packed into this tiny

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.050 
foreign will packed into this tiny
little<00:01:16.650> haddock<00:01:17.159> area<00:01:17.549> which<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.880> think

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
little haddock area which I think

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.219 
little haddock area which I think
probably<00:01:18.210> must<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.630> been<00:01:18.720> built<00:01:18.900> before<00:01:19.020> I

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
probably must have been built before I

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.740 
probably must have been built before I
was<00:01:19.439> born<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.400> old<00:01:20.700> Brazil<00:01:21.450> it's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
was born so it really is old Brazil it's

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.450 
was born so it really is old Brazil it's
a<00:01:21.930> great<00:01:22.110> place<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.500> end<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> season<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.340> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
a great place to end the season it's a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.950 
a great place to end the season it's a
sacred<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.820> enjoy<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> circuit<00:01:24.869> my

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
sacred I enjoy it's a circuit my

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.630 
sacred I enjoy it's a circuit my
teammate<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.439> always<00:01:25.710> very<00:01:25.830> good<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.159> his<00:01:26.460> home

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
teammate is always very good at his home

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.920 
teammate is always very good at his home
race<00:01:26.820> I've<00:01:27.090> always<00:01:27.299> enjoyed<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.659> there<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
race I've always enjoyed it there and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.060 
race I've always enjoyed it there and
again<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.350> never<00:01:28.500> know<00:01:28.619> where<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> weather

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
again you never know where the weather

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.429 
again you never know where the weather
in<00:01:29.430> Brazil<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.390> time<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.630> year<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.259> could

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
in Brazil at that time of year it could

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.160 
in Brazil at that time of year it could
be<00:01:31.619> beautifully<00:01:32.250> sunny<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.090> hot<00:01:33.270> or<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.990> could

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
be beautifully sunny and hot or it could

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140 
be beautifully sunny and hot or it could
be<00:01:34.200> rainy<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.220> miserable<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:36.060> have

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
be rainy and really miserable so we have

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.660 
be rainy and really miserable so we have
