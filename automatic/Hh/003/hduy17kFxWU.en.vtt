00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.360
 let's proceed to disarm a console 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.760
 Slim in the super slim version as 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.840
 many recognize in the base we have the 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.840
 hard drive cover 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:28.500
 we just slide and take it off 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.730
 the other lids we make light pressure 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.730
 to separate 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.970
 and you vote to do it 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.330
 in the same way 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.330
 the other base 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.930
 we see inside a screw that 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.930
 subject 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.010
 the wireless network card 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.600
 it's a screw 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.600
 clumsy of number 10 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.400
 now we see that you have insurance 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.400
 plastic just throw it 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.860
 here we have the guarantee stamp 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.909
 It is worth mentioning that anything that 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.909
 let's do not give the guarantee of your equipment 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.729
 low 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.010
 now we remove all the screws 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.370
 the long screws we identify ourselves 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:10.200
 with the letters 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:12.190
 I know it would be one two three four five 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.210
 people screws that hold the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.210
 housing on the other side 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.120
 they are awkward screws also in terms 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.120
 from 10 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.870
 with this we could remove 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.700
 the complete housing 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.069
 but how do we have to get all the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.640
 plate we will also remove the others 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.640
 screws 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.280
 plus 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.500
 now the screws that hold 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.620
 the heatsink 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.620
 they are clumsy number 9 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.500
 well, this can not be done by the base or 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.830
 the front better said 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.140
 help one click 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.700
 we are going to eject the tray so that we 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.700
 can of freedom of movement 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.370
 we remove the top cover and this one does not 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.980
 they will pull it 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.980
 do you have a nest 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.709
 here only glue 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.709
 they take out 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.920
 this is the one that you take out with care for 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.920
 not hurt him 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.050
 once it takes off 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.050
 this one comes out easy 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.850
 disconnect the reader 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.110
 as we already removed all the others 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.740
 We screws and remove the pieces 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.740
 of plastic 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.650
 this screw is also of the number god 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.860
 and this piece of plastic is held by 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.860
 a screw on this side 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.409
 so that they do not bother us, it is not necessary 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.629
 but so that they do not absorb for the purpose of 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.289
 final this video we will remove all 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:05.939
 the cables 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.939
 and that you can see it 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.020
 we also remove the screws that 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.020
 hold the torque on the ignition panel 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.759
 now doing a slight pressure towards 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:32.879
 opposite let's release the jala card 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:35.960
 the more you face the event do not go to 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.960
 force the nasal card 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.280
 here 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.180
 up to here the disarming phase of the 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.979
 console 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.979
 what follows would be to install the chip
