00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.119 

so<00:00:00.450> we<00:00:00.840> don't<00:00:01.020> actually<00:00:01.199> want<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.620> echo<00:00:01.860> out

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
so we don't actually want to echo out

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.770 
so we don't actually want to echo out
the<00:00:02.250> IP<00:00:02.520> addresses<00:00:02.790> we<00:00:03.060> just<00:00:03.240> want<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.540> use

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
the IP addresses we just want to use

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.760 
the IP addresses we just want to use
them<00:00:03.959> inside<00:00:04.290> here<00:00:04.350> so<00:00:05.279> I'm<00:00:05.580> going<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.850> create

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
them inside here so I'm going to create

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.980 
them inside here so I'm going to create
a<00:00:07.770> variable<00:00:08.760> called<00:00:08.910> IP<00:00:11.210> single<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.690> that's

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
a variable called IP single and that's

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.320 
a variable called IP single and that's
equal<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.590> each<00:00:13.740> one<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.730> can<00:00:14.849> use<00:00:15.089> this

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
equal to each one so we can use this

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.279 
equal to each one so we can use this
variable<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.619> check<00:00:17.090> whether<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.330> user's<00:00:19.109> IP

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
variable to check whether the user's IP

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.620 
variable to check whether the user's IP
address<00:00:19.800> which<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.189> up<00:00:20.340> here<00:00:20.570> corresponds<00:00:21.570> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
address which is up here corresponds to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.939 
address which is up here corresponds to
one<00:00:21.930> already<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.680> here<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.150> say<00:00:24.480> if<00:00:24.949> we

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
one already in here so we can say if we

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.589 
one already in here so we can say if we
can<00:00:26.070> say<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:26.660> IP<00:00:28.010> address<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.340> equal<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.390> so

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
can say if IP address is equal to so

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.540 
can say if IP address is equal to so
using<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.929> double<00:00:31.349> equals<00:00:31.830> comparison

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
using a double equals comparison

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.010 
using a double equals comparison
operator<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.239> equal<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:34.290> IP<00:00:34.969> single<00:00:36.020> do

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
operator is equal to IP single do

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.760 
operator is equal to IP single do
something<00:00:37.700> otherwise<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:39.180> something<00:00:39.510> else

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
something otherwise do something else

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.080 
something otherwise do something else
now<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.890> actual<00:00:41.190> fact<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.520> don't<00:00:41.730> need<00:00:41.879> this

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
now in actual fact we don't need this

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.000 
now in actual fact we don't need this
if-else<00:00:42.690> statement<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.559> need<00:00:43.710> an<00:00:43.829> if

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
if-else statement we just need an if

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.090 
if-else statement we just need an if
statement<00:00:44.250> because<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.719> if<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.230> IP

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
statement because if the if the IP

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.209 
statement because if the if the IP
address<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:48.270> there<00:00:48.980> actually<00:00:49.980> let's<00:00:50.129> think

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
address is in there actually let's think

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.189 
address is in there actually let's think
about<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.520> logically<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.570> IP<00:00:51.870> address

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
about this logically if the IP address

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.189 
about this logically if the IP address
is<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.739> there<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.430> don't<00:00:53.730> want<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.210> record<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
is in there we don't want to record the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.410 
is in there we don't want to record the
IP<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.520> say<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.920> if<00:00:58.969> IP<00:00:59.969> address

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
IP so what we can say is if IP address

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.329 
IP so what we can say is if IP address
doesn't<00:01:01.289> equal<00:01:01.620> IP<00:01:01.859> single<00:01:03.589> so<00:01:04.589> essentially

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
doesn't equal IP single so essentially

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.530 
doesn't equal IP single so essentially
what<00:01:05.489> we're<00:01:05.670> doing<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.060> we're<00:01:06.270> looping

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
what we're doing is we're looping

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.289 
what we're doing is we're looping
through<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.229> IP<00:01:07.500> dot<00:01:07.950> txt<00:01:08.340> file<00:01:08.700> we're

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
through this IP dot txt file we're

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.179 
through this IP dot txt file we're
checking<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> user's<00:01:10.320> IP<00:01:10.439> addresses<00:01:11.010> -

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
checking of the user's IP addresses -

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.670 
checking of the user's IP addresses -
this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.610> equal<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.600> first<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.170> then

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
this is equal to this one first and then

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.109 
this is equal to this one first and then
we're<00:01:13.830> checking<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.369> equal<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.880> one

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
we're checking if it's equal to this one

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.859 
we're checking if it's equal to this one
now<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.200> equal<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.869> if

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
now if it is equal to this one or if

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.100 
now if it is equal to this one or if
it's<00:01:18.990> not<00:01:19.229> equal<00:01:19.560> rather<00:01:19.830> we're<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> say

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
it's not equal rather we're going to say

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.590 
it's not equal rather we're going to say
found<00:01:22.250> equals<00:01:24.229> false<00:01:25.640> otherwise<00:01:26.640> we're<00:01:27.479> going

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
found equals false otherwise we're going

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.530 
found equals false otherwise we're going
to<00:01:27.659> say

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.100 

come<00:01:31.050> back<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.320> found<00:01:32.310> equals<00:01:33.270> true<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
come back up here found equals true and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
come back up here found equals true and
the<00:01:34.290> reason<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.830> this<00:01:34.980> is<00:01:35.040> because<00:01:35.310> we're

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the reason we do this is because we're

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.200 
the reason we do this is because we're
in<00:01:35.940> a<00:01:36.030> loop<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:37.080> we<00:01:37.950> don't<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.340> increment<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
in a loop here we don't to increment the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.140 
in a loop here we don't to increment the
value<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:40.080> count<00:01:40.890> dot<00:01:41.100> txt<00:01:41.520> file

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
value of the count dot txt file

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.450 
value of the count dot txt file
inside<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.870> loop<00:01:43.170> because<00:01:43.800> if<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.010> increment

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
inside a loop because if we increment

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.430 
inside a loop because if we increment
the<00:01:44.670> value<00:01:45.120> of<00:01:45.420> something<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.870> a<00:01:45.990> loop<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
the value of something in a loop is

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.440 
the value of something in a loop is
going<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.070> performed<00:01:47.580> over<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.150> over<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
going to be performed over and over and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.270 
going to be performed over and over and
over<00:01:48.540> again<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.620> want<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.010> create<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
over again so we want to create a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.880 
over again so we want to create a
boolean<00:01:50.850> value<00:01:51.150> could<00:01:51.570> found<00:01:51.990> which<00:01:52.620> is<00:01:52.650> going

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
boolean value could found which is going

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.740 
boolean value could found which is going
to<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:53.100> equal<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.460> either<00:01:53.700> true<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.090> false

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
to be equal to either true or false

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.260 
to be equal to either true or false
then<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:55.410> we<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.100> under<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.940> for

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
then what we can do is under this for

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.040 
then what we can do is under this for
each<00:01:58.370> under<00:01:59.370> this<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.760> each<00:01:59.940> here<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.870> can

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
each under this for each here we can

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.070 
each under this for each here we can
then<00:02:01.080> say<00:02:01.759> if<00:02:03.140> found<00:02:04.140> equals<00:02:04.920> false<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:06.080> in

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
then say if found equals false and in

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.870 
then say if found equals false and in
here<00:02:07.410> what<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.830> do<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.869> increment<00:02:10.880> count

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
here what we can do is increment count

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.220 
here what we can do is increment count
txt<00:02:12.810> value<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.850> let's<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.390> test<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:15.930> first

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
txt value so let's just test this first

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.780 
txt value so let's just test this first
of<00:02:16.410> all<00:02:16.500> we<00:02:16.820> can<00:02:17.820> echo<00:02:18.209> here<00:02:18.650> IP<00:02:19.650> not<00:02:20.160> found<00:02:20.490> and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
of all we can echo here IP not found and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.970 
of all we can echo here IP not found and
in<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.270> case<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.780> IP<00:02:21.959> address<00:02:22.410> not<00:02:22.680> being

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
in the case of the IP address not being

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.250 
in the case of the IP address not being
found<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:24.330> can<00:02:24.480> increment<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.959> value<00:02:25.080> of

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
found we can increment the value of

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.460 
found we can increment the value of
count<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.430> let's<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.760> test<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.120> works

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
count so let's just test this works

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.699 
count so let's just test this works
refresh<00:02:28.790> IP<00:02:29.790> not<00:02:30.180> found<00:02:30.510> oh<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.230> should<00:02:31.590> have

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
refresh IP not found oh it should have

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.370 
refresh IP not found oh it should have
been<00:02:35.060> okay<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.269> think<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.600> problem<00:02:36.930> here<00:02:37.200> is

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
been okay so I think the problem here is

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.170 
been okay so I think the problem here is
that<00:02:37.410> we've<00:02:37.650> declared<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.340> outside<00:02:39.000> our

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
that we've declared this outside our

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.660 
that we've declared this outside our
function<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.810> we<00:02:40.739> need<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.250> if<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:41.489> pop

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
function so we need to do is if we pop

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.020 
function so we need to do is if we pop
this<00:02:41.790> inside<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.390> our<00:02:42.510> function<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:44.730> in

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
this inside of our function just in

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.340 
this inside of our function just in
there<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:47.760> refresh<00:02:48.269> Oh<00:02:49.040> No<00:02:51.049> okay<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:52.110> let's

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
there and we refresh Oh No okay so let's

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.720 
there and we refresh Oh No okay so let's
try<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.650> determine<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.160> problem<00:02:53.370> with<00:02:53.610> this

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
try and determine the problem with this

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.030 
try and determine the problem with this
let's<00:02:53.970> echo<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.540> up<00:02:54.750> first<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.230> all<00:02:55.350> and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
let's echo this up first of all and

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.990 
let's echo this up first of all and
refresh<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.470> let's<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.130> look<00:02:59.310> inside<00:02:59.489> our

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
refresh so let's have a look inside our

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.320 
refresh so let's have a look inside our
IP<00:03:00.720> dot<00:03:01.170> txt<00:03:01.590> that's<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.640> first<00:03:03.000> line

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
IP dot txt that's on the first line

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.539 
IP dot txt that's on the first line
there<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:03.989> we'll<00:03:04.680> go<00:03:04.769> through<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.040> debug<00:03:05.340> this

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
there so we'll go through and debug this

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.880 
there so we'll go through and debug this
carefully<00:03:06.540> probably<00:03:07.380> just<00:03:07.560> something<00:03:07.739> that

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
carefully probably just something that

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.850 
carefully probably just something that
I've<00:03:08.100> completely<00:03:08.970> missed<00:03:09.440> echo<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.680> out

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.100 

and<00:03:15.220> that's<00:03:15.460> one<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.910> 7.1.1<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:18.450> if<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.750> is

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
and that's one to 7.1.1 so if that is

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.990 
and that's one to 7.1.1 so if that is
equal<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.530> my<00:03:20.800> IP<00:03:21.330> IP<00:03:22.330> address<00:03:24.000> underscore

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
equal to my IP IP address underscore

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.100 
equal to my IP IP address underscore
address<00:03:25.360> doesn't<00:03:25.780> equal<00:03:26.320> IP<00:03:27.240> single<00:03:28.240> found

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
address doesn't equal IP single found

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.380 
address doesn't equal IP single found
equals<00:03:29.560> false<00:03:30.480> found<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.630> was<00:03:31.900> true<00:03:32.440> oh<00:03:33.360> okay<00:03:34.360> I

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
equals false found it was true oh okay I

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.280 
equals false found it was true oh okay I
understand

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
understand

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.660 
understand
so<00:03:35.800> if<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.750> found<00:03:38.050> we<00:03:38.590> need<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:38.950> say<00:03:39.190> if<00:03:39.490> it's

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
so if it is found we need to say if it's

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.700 
so if it is found we need to say if it's
not<00:03:39.850> found<00:03:40.030> we<00:03:40.210> need<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.450> say<00:03:40.570> found<00:03:40.870> equals<00:03:41.380> I

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
not found we need to say found equals I

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.480 
not found we need to say found equals I
get<00:03:42.370> false<00:03:42.900> otherwise<00:03:43.900> found<00:03:44.830> equals<00:03:45.220> true

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
get false otherwise found equals true

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.910 
get false otherwise found equals true
and<00:03:46.000> we<00:03:46.270> need<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.540> say<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:47.020> found<00:03:47.770> equals<00:03:48.220> true

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
and we need to say it found equals true

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.260 
and we need to say it found equals true
and<00:03:50.920> we<00:03:51.400> run<00:03:51.610> this<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:54.430> means<00:03:54.850> our<00:03:54.970> IP<00:03:55.240> address

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
and we run this it means our IP address

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.600 
and we run this it means our IP address
has<00:03:55.600> been<00:03:55.630> found<00:03:56.080> however<00:03:56.709> if<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:57.340> was<00:03:57.459> to

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
has been found however if I was to

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.630 
has been found however if I was to
remove<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:59.260> IP<00:03:59.530> address<00:03:59.680> we<00:04:00.130> can<00:04:00.160> keep<00:04:00.430> this

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
remove this IP address we can keep this

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.370 
remove this IP address we can keep this
one<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.120> refresh<00:04:03.480> no<00:04:04.480> no<00:04:04.720> okay

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
one and refresh no no okay

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.720 
one and refresh no no okay
hold<00:04:05.560> on<00:04:05.650> let's<00:04:05.920> take<00:04:06.040> another<00:04:06.220> look<00:04:06.520> at<00:04:06.640> this

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
hold on let's take another look at this

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.680 
hold on let's take another look at this
let's<00:04:07.570> put<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.590> back<00:04:08.770> in<00:04:08.980> there<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:10.420> this<00:04:10.540> is

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
let's put that back in there so this is

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.180 
let's put that back in there so this is
probably<00:04:10.959> great<00:04:11.170> I've<00:04:11.350> made<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.560> mistake<00:04:11.740> you

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
probably great I've made a mistake you

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.970 
probably great I've made a mistake you
can<00:04:12.370> follow<00:04:12.580> me<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.650> see<00:04:14.650> what<00:04:14.770> I've<00:04:14.860> done

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
can follow me and see what I've done

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.370 
can follow me and see what I've done
wrong<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:15.790> if<00:04:15.850> IP<00:04:16.209> address<00:04:16.450> doesn't<00:04:16.840> equal<00:04:17.140> IP

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
wrong so if IP address doesn't equal IP

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.810 
wrong so if IP address doesn't equal IP
single<00:04:19.709> found<00:04:20.709> equals<00:04:21.280> false

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
single found equals false

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.890 
single found equals false
if<00:04:22.030> found<00:04:22.780> equals<00:04:23.260> false<00:04:24.010> is<00:04:24.460> equal<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.940> false

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.870 

right<00:04:28.900> okay<00:04:29.230> I<00:04:29.260> think<00:04:29.440> I've<00:04:29.650> sort<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.580> worked

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
right okay I think I've sort of worked

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.620 
right okay I think I've sort of worked
out<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.210> problem<00:04:32.040> now<00:04:33.040> I'll<00:04:33.880> tell<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.390> why

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
out the problem now I'll tell you why

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.930 
out the problem now I'll tell you why
this<00:04:34.690> isn't<00:04:35.050> working<00:04:35.169> first<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:35.919> all<00:04:36.040> how<00:04:36.910> to

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
this isn't working first of all how to

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.440 
this isn't working first of all how to
have<00:04:37.419> had<00:04:37.540> a<00:04:37.570> little<00:04:37.750> look<00:04:38.020> at<00:04:38.169> it<00:04:38.640> and<00:04:39.640> I've

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
have had a little look at it and I've

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.330 
have had a little look at it and I've
and<00:04:40.660> I've<00:04:41.290> sort<00:04:41.470> of<00:04:41.560> worked<00:04:41.740> out<00:04:41.919> what's<00:04:42.130> wrong

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
and I've sort of worked out what's wrong

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.360 
and I've sort of worked out what's wrong
so<00:04:43.000> what's<00:04:43.780> happening<00:04:44.169> is<00:04:44.350> is<00:04:44.530> where<00:04:44.800> because

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
so what's happening is is where because

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.840 
so what's happening is is where because
we're<00:04:45.520> looping<00:04:45.700> through<00:04:46.060> every<00:04:46.630> IP<00:04:46.810> address

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
we're looping through every IP address

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.950 
we're looping through every IP address
first<00:04:48.850> of<00:04:49.060> all<00:04:49.180> we're<00:04:49.330> going<00:04:49.419> to<00:04:49.480> set<00:04:49.780> the

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
first of all we're going to set the

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.280 
first of all we're going to set the
boolean<00:04:50.350> found<00:04:50.940> found<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.210> variable<00:04:53.020> found

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
boolean found found the variable found

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.390 
boolean found found the variable found
which<00:04:53.530> is<00:04:53.560> a<00:04:53.710> boolean<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.910> true<00:04:54.940> and<00:04:56.220> then<00:04:57.220> what

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
which is a boolean to true and then what

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.840 
which is a boolean to true and then what
we're<00:04:57.550> going<00:04:57.669> to<00:04:57.700> do<00:04:57.910> is<00:05:00.660> yeah<00:05:01.660> so<00:05:01.960> okay<00:05:02.620> so<00:05:03.400> I<00:05:03.669> P

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
we're going to do is yeah so okay so I P

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.969 
we're going to do is yeah so okay so I P
address<00:05:04.240> doesn't<00:05:04.510> equal<00:05:04.990> IP<00:05:05.260> single<00:05:05.800> let's

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
address doesn't equal IP single let's

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.340 
address doesn't equal IP single let's
change<00:05:06.250> this<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.520> equals<00:05:07.150> equals<00:05:07.540> and<00:05:08.200> we'll

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
change this to equals equals and we'll

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.469 
change this to equals equals and we'll
change<00:05:08.560> this<00:05:08.800> around<00:05:09.010> so<00:05:09.850> it's<00:05:10.000> just<00:05:10.150> easier

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
change this around so it's just easier

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.770 
change this around so it's just easier
to<00:05:10.690> grasp<00:05:11.229> so<00:05:11.919> if<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.310> IP<00:05:12.490> address<00:05:12.970> in<00:05:13.240> the

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
to grasp so if the IP address in the

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.380 
to grasp so if the IP address in the
file<00:05:14.410> does<00:05:14.890> equal<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.430> IP<00:05:15.850> address<00:05:16.120> of<00:05:16.240> the

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
file does equal the IP address of the

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.190 
file does equal the IP address of the
user<00:05:16.500> then<00:05:17.500> found<00:05:17.830> equals<00:05:18.190> true<00:05:18.460> so<00:05:19.200> therefore

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
user then found equals true so therefore

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.560 
user then found equals true so therefore
if<00:05:20.440> found<00:05:21.040> equals<00:05:21.490> true<00:05:22.620> we<00:05:23.620> want<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:24.010> say

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
if found equals true we want to say

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.000 
if found equals true we want to say
already<00:05:28.780> or<00:05:29.780> will<00:05:30.200> just<00:05:30.380> say<00:05:30.470> fountain<00:05:30.800> for

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
already or will just say fountain for

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.260 
already or will just say fountain for
now<00:05:32.290> so<00:05:33.290> otherwise<00:05:34.010> once<00:05:34.340> say<00:05:34.520> folks<00:05:34.850> however

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
now so otherwise once say folks however

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.450 
now so otherwise once say folks however
when<00:05:35.450> we<00:05:35.570> go<00:05:35.720> through<00:05:35.750> again<00:05:36.380> it's<00:05:37.160> going<00:05:37.400> to

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
when we go through again it's going to

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.490 
when we go through again it's going to
check<00:05:37.700> the<00:05:37.910> second<00:05:38.330> one<00:05:38.480> and<00:05:38.720> put<00:05:39.230> this<00:05:39.320> to

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
check the second one and put this to

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.410 
check the second one and put this to
false<00:05:39.770> automatically<00:05:40.610> we're<00:05:41.060> not<00:05:41.180> keeping

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
false automatically we're not keeping

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.690 
false automatically we're not keeping
the<00:05:41.780> same<00:05:42.020> value<00:05:42.350> of<00:05:42.500> found<00:05:42.770> therefore

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
the same value of found therefore

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.940 
the same value of found therefore
underneath<00:05:44.210> each<00:05:44.420> one<00:05:44.480> of<00:05:44.870> these<00:05:45.020> we<00:05:45.620> want<00:05:45.830> to

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
underneath each one of these we want to

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.300 
underneath each one of these we want to
use<00:05:46.220> break<00:05:46.930> so<00:05:47.930> we're<00:05:48.080> only<00:05:48.260> finding<00:05:48.740> the<00:05:49.130> IP

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
use break so we're only finding the IP

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.650 
use break so we're only finding the IP
address<00:05:49.820> and<00:05:50.060> then<00:05:50.300> breaking<00:05:52.210> in<00:05:53.210> fact<00:05:53.420> we<00:05:53.510> can

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
address and then breaking in fact we can

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.470 
address and then breaking in fact we can
say<00:05:54.490> folks<00:05:55.490> keep<00:05:55.820> that<00:05:55.940> as<00:05:56.060> folks<00:05:56.210> that's

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
say folks keep that as folks that's

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.990 
say folks keep that as folks that's
absolutely<00:05:56.810> fine<00:05:56.990> so<00:05:57.230> now<00:05:58.220> if<00:05:58.610> we<00:05:58.820> were<00:05:58.970> to

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
absolutely fine so now if we were to

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.220 
absolutely fine so now if we were to
refresh<00:05:59.930> it<00:06:00.680> says<00:06:01.460> found<00:06:01.790> because<00:06:02.510> it's<00:06:02.960> found

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
refresh it says found because it's found

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.430 
refresh it says found because it's found
within<00:06:03.530> here<00:06:04.030> so<00:06:05.030> all<00:06:05.150> break<00:06:05.390> is<00:06:05.630> doing<00:06:05.930> is<00:06:06.110> if

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
within here so all break is doing is if

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.410 
within here so all break is doing is if
it<00:06:06.530> is<00:06:06.680> found<00:06:07.190> we<00:06:07.760> don't<00:06:07.970> need<00:06:08.090> any<00:06:08.240> more

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420 
it is found we don't need any more

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.300 
it is found we don't need any more
information<00:06:09.050> so<00:06:09.380> we're<00:06:09.530> breaking<00:06:09.800> out<00:06:10.280> of

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
information so we're breaking out of

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.640 
information so we're breaking out of
this<00:06:10.580> current<00:06:10.970> loop<00:06:11.090> it's<00:06:11.960> for<00:06:12.200> each<00:06:12.380> here

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
this current loop it's for each here

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.280 
this current loop it's for each here
okay<00:06:13.310> so<00:06:14.000> obviously<00:06:14.630> if<00:06:14.750> we<00:06:14.870> were<00:06:15.020> to<00:06:15.080> put<00:06:15.260> a

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
okay so obviously if we were to put a

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.780 
okay so obviously if we were to put a
break<00:06:15.590> here<00:06:15.890> and<00:06:15.920> it<00:06:16.070> wasn't<00:06:16.250> found<00:06:16.580> would

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
break here and it wasn't found would

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.520 
break here and it wasn't found would
break<00:06:17.000> out<00:06:17.180> straight<00:06:17.480> away<00:06:17.660> we<00:06:18.110> want<00:06:18.290> to<00:06:18.350> keep

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
break out straight away we want to keep

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.110 
break out straight away we want to keep
going<00:06:18.770> through<00:06:19.010> the<00:06:19.130> file<00:06:19.340> until<00:06:19.580> it's<00:06:19.910> found

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
going through the file until it's found

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.000 
going through the file until it's found
so<00:06:20.480> logically<00:06:20.840> looking<00:06:21.260> at<00:06:21.380> this<00:06:21.530> I<00:06:21.740> was

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
so logically looking at this I was

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.670 
so logically looking at this I was
confused<00:06:22.460> and<00:06:23.330> you<00:06:23.870> may<00:06:24.050> be<00:06:24.110> at<00:06:24.290> this<00:06:24.440> stage

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
confused and you may be at this stage

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.380 
confused and you may be at this stage
but<00:06:24.860> just<00:06:25.070> have<00:06:25.190> a<00:06:25.220> good<00:06:25.400> look<00:06:25.610> and<00:06:25.790> try<00:06:26.300> and

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
but just have a good look and try and

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.680 
but just have a good look and try and
understand<00:06:26.810> why<00:06:27.020> we<00:06:27.200> break<00:06:27.440> out
