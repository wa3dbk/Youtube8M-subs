oh yes a former first mentor I'm here to
talk<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.619> you<00:00:32.710> today<00:00:32.860> about<00:00:33.220> the<00:00:33.580> importance

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
talk to you today about the importance

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.290 
talk to you today about the importance
of<00:00:34.239> design<00:00:34.980> look<00:00:35.980> I<00:00:36.250> don't<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.730> first<00:00:36.940> seasons

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
of design look I don't the first seasons

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.990 
of design look I don't the first seasons
like<00:00:37.510> it's<00:00:38.020> intense<00:00:38.580> everyone<00:00:39.580> wants<00:00:39.879> more

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
like it's intense everyone wants more

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.930 
like it's intense everyone wants more
time<00:00:40.270> right<00:00:40.660> well<00:00:41.500> you<00:00:42.160> don't<00:00:42.280> get<00:00:42.430> more<00:00:42.640> time

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
time right well you don't get more time

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.350 
time right well you don't get more time
no<00:00:43.600> no<00:00:44.410> you<00:00:44.470> know<00:00:44.680> but<00:00:45.250> through<00:00:45.489> design<00:00:45.879> you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
no no you know but through design you

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.090 
no no you know but through design you
can<00:00:46.540> make<00:00:46.690> better<00:00:46.989> use<00:00:47.110> of<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.620> time<00:00:47.650> that<00:00:47.890> you

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
can make better use of the time that you

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.670 
can make better use of the time that you
have<00:00:48.340> to<00:00:48.640> be<00:00:49.000> more<00:00:49.300> efficient<00:00:49.840> and<00:00:49.960> get<00:00:50.500> more

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
have to be more efficient and get more

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.800 
have to be more efficient and get more
done<00:00:50.920> now<00:00:51.700> I<00:00:51.730> know<00:00:51.910> it's<00:00:52.150> tempting<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.570> just

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
done now I know it's tempting to just

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.420 
done now I know it's tempting to just
grab<00:00:53.110> a<00:00:53.140> piece<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.560> aluminum<00:00:54.130> and<00:00:54.250> start

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
grab a piece of aluminum and start

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.740 
grab a piece of aluminum and start
building<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.760> first<00:00:55.060> thing<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.360> pops<00:00:55.570> in

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
building the first thing that pops in

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.190 
building the first thing that pops in
your<00:00:55.780> head<00:00:55.900> I<00:00:56.290> know<00:00:56.650> I<00:00:57.130> have<00:00:57.670> but<00:00:58.600> this<00:00:58.720> really

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
your head I know I have but this really

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.470 
your head I know I have but this really
only<00:00:59.380> works<00:00:59.829> for<00:01:00.070> very<00:01:00.430> simple<00:01:00.760> challenges

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
only works for very simple challenges

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.469 
only works for very simple challenges
and<00:01:01.660> as<00:01:02.140> we<00:01:02.290> all<00:01:02.410> know<00:01:02.440> first<00:01:03.370> is<00:01:03.670> anything<00:01:04.239> but

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
and as we all know first is anything but

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:05.010 
and as we all know first is anything but
simple

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
capabilities that you want given the

time that you have requires careful

time that you have requires careful
thinking<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:15.160> design<00:01:15.520> process<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.240> your

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
thinking the design process is your

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.870 
thinking the design process is your
roadmap<00:01:16.840> through<00:01:17.350> this<00:01:17.470> minefield<00:01:17.880> seeing

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
roadmap through this minefield seeing

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.340 
roadmap through this minefield seeing
that<00:01:19.090> journey<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.660> understanding<00:01:20.259> the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
that journey and understanding the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.469 
that journey and understanding the
process<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.979> design<00:01:21.280> is<00:01:21.520> what<00:01:21.790> this<00:01:22.000> video<00:01:22.300> is

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
process of design is what this video is

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.590 
process of design is what this video is
all<00:01:22.780> about<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:24.490> you're<00:01:24.729> saying<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.360> already

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
all about now you're saying I already

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.270 
all about now you're saying I already
know<00:01:25.869> all<00:01:26.020> this<00:01:26.229> grant<00:01:26.590> what's<00:01:27.130> the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
know all this grant what's the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.130 
know all this grant what's the
difference<00:01:27.729> well<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.630> difference<00:01:28.660> I'm

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
difference well the difference I'm

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.809 
difference well the difference I'm
suggesting<00:01:29.380> is<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:29.920> you<00:01:30.039> pay<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.280> little<00:01:30.520> more

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
suggesting is that you pay a little more

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.880 
suggesting is that you pay a little more
attention<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.539> very<00:01:31.750> early<00:01:32.289> stages<00:01:32.590> of

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
attention to the very early stages of

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.160 
attention to the very early stages of
your<00:01:33.039> design<00:01:33.310> process<00:01:33.899> now<00:01:34.899> you're<00:01:35.020> probably

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
your design process now you're probably

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.340 
your design process now you're probably
thinking<00:01:35.350> whoa<00:01:35.709> whoa<00:01:35.860> whoa<00:01:36.130> we<00:01:36.910> do<00:01:37.149> design<00:01:37.600> we

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
thinking whoa whoa whoa we do design we

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.900 
thinking whoa whoa whoa we do design we
draw<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.709> on<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.830> piece<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.130> paper<00:01:39.429> or<00:01:39.759> on<00:01:39.789> a

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
draw it on a piece of paper or on a

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.630 
draw it on a piece of paper or on a
whiteboard<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.690> then<00:01:40.780> we<00:01:40.899> build<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.350> well

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
whiteboard and then we build it well

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.550 
whiteboard and then we build it well
before<00:01:42.640> charging<00:01:43.330> forward<00:01:43.600> to<00:01:43.810> making<00:01:44.050> parts

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
before charging forward to making parts

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.889 
before charging forward to making parts
just<00:01:45.160> take<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.369> little<00:01:45.700> time<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.270> make<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.539> study

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
just take a little time to make a study

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.139 
just take a little time to make a study
model<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.890> can<00:01:48.099> be<00:01:48.220> in<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.399> computer<00:01:48.819> using

doesn't matter what you use as long as
it<00:01:56.679> helps<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.039> work<00:01:57.310> out<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.700> problems

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it helps you work out the problems

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.980 
it helps you work out the problems
because<00:01:59.259> let's<00:01:59.860> face<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.149> making<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.240> part<00:02:01.509> over

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
and over and over again is not only

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.859 
and over and over again is not only
frustrating<00:02:04.840> but<00:02:05.259> also<00:02:05.440> very<00:02:05.890> time-consuming

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
frustrating but also very time-consuming

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.529
