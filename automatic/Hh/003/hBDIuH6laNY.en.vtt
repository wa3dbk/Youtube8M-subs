one<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.900> the<00:00:46.989> greatest<00:00:48.120> innovations<00:00:49.120> on<00:00:49.960> the

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
one of the greatest innovations on the

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.910 
one of the greatest innovations on the
Honda<00:00:50.980> is<00:00:51.160> this<00:00:52.030> inverter<00:00:52.540> system<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.769> what

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
Honda is this inverter system and what

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.770 
Honda is this inverter system and what
the<00:00:53.949> inverter<00:00:54.400> system<00:00:54.699> does<00:00:55.150> is<00:00:55.420> it<00:00:55.570> allows

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
the inverter system does is it allows

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.119 
the inverter system does is it allows
the<00:00:56.650> generator<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.699> clean<00:00:58.330> up<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:59.199> AC<00:00:59.350> signal

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
the generator to clean up the AC signal

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.579 
the generator to clean up the AC signal
going<00:01:00.400> out<00:01:00.760> so<00:01:01.600> that<00:01:01.809> like<00:01:02.110> on<00:01:02.320> most

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
going out so that like on most

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.030 
going out so that like on most
generators<00:01:03.400> of<00:01:04.239> this<00:01:04.420> size<00:01:04.720> what<00:01:05.470> happens<00:01:05.830> is

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
generators of this size what happens is

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.850 
generators of this size what happens is
there's<00:01:06.280> certain<00:01:06.729> fluctuation<00:01:07.690> in<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.619> AC

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
there's certain fluctuation in the AC

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.450 
there's certain fluctuation in the AC
waveform<00:01:09.460> that<00:01:10.210> goes<00:01:10.450> out<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:12.100> item

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
waveform that goes out so that the item

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.760 
waveform that goes out so that the item
that<00:01:12.670> you're<00:01:12.790> operating<00:01:13.420> doesn't<00:01:14.049> get<00:01:14.229> the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
that you're operating doesn't get the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.250 
that you're operating doesn't get the
cleanest<00:01:15.280> signal<00:01:15.760> now<00:01:16.060> that's<00:01:16.299> not<00:01:16.689> important

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
cleanest signal now that's not important

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.320 
cleanest signal now that's not important
if<00:01:17.320> you're<00:01:17.470> running<00:01:17.680> a<00:01:17.979> incandescent<00:01:18.909> light

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
if you're running a incandescent light

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.899 
if you're running a incandescent light
bulb<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.710> it<00:01:20.860> is<00:01:21.010> important<00:01:21.610> if<00:01:21.760> you're

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
bulb but it is important if you're

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.030 
bulb but it is important if you're
running<00:01:22.119> your<00:01:22.450> computer<00:01:22.630> or<00:01:23.530> sensitive

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
running your computer or sensitive

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.510 
running your computer or sensitive
electronic<00:01:25.229> items<00:01:26.229> so<00:01:26.470> what<00:01:26.680> this<00:01:26.830> does<00:01:27.100> is<00:01:27.340> it

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
electronic items so what this does is it

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.819 
electronic items so what this does is it
takes<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:28.060> electricity<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.020> takes<00:01:29.829> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
takes the electricity and takes a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.130 
takes the electricity and takes a
mechanical<00:01:32.829> waveform<00:01:33.549> and<00:01:34.149> it<00:01:34.479> turns<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.960> into

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
mechanical waveform and it turns it into

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.109 
mechanical waveform and it turns it into
a<00:01:35.679> much<00:01:36.250> cleaner<00:01:37.020> digital<00:01:38.020> waveform<00:01:38.829> that<00:01:39.820> can

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
a much cleaner digital waveform that can

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.609 
a much cleaner digital waveform that can
be<00:01:40.240> used<00:01:40.479> on<00:01:40.719> the<00:01:40.899> computer<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.499> other

be used on the computer and other
sensitive<00:01:42.070> items

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
sensitive items

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.919 
sensitive items
it<00:01:43.359> also<00:01:43.509> has<00:01:43.899> what's<00:01:44.259> known<00:01:44.499> as<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.799> Connell

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
it also has what's known as a Connell

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.649 
it also has what's known as a Connell
eco<00:01:46.929> throttle<00:01:47.499> and<00:01:47.710> on<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.310> Eco<00:01:48.640> throttle<00:01:49.090> it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
eco throttle and on the Eco throttle it

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.410 
eco throttle and on the Eco throttle it
allows<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.399> generator<00:01:51.399> itself<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:52.030> decide

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
allows the generator itself to decide

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.300 
allows the generator itself to decide
how<00:01:53.200> much<00:01:53.560> power<00:01:54.460> how<00:01:55.329> much<00:01:55.390> fuel<00:01:56.020> is<00:01:56.350> needed

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
how much power how much fuel is needed

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.359 
how much power how much fuel is needed
to<00:01:57.520> run<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.759> particular<00:01:58.149> item<00:01:58.600> so<00:01:59.140> if<00:01:59.829> you<00:02:00.039> turn

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
to run a particular item so if you turn

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.669 
to run a particular item so if you turn
this<00:02:00.549> thing<00:02:00.609> on<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:01.179> all<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.170> were<00:02:02.319> running

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
this thing on and all you were running

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.219 
this thing on and all you were running
on<00:02:02.829> it<00:02:02.979> was<00:02:03.609> a<00:02:03.640> simple<00:02:04.210> 100<00:02:05.170> watt<00:02:06.060> computer<00:02:07.229> it

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
on it was a simple 100 watt computer it

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.370 
on it was a simple 100 watt computer it
would<00:02:08.440> vary<00:02:09.130> use<00:02:09.460> very<00:02:09.850> little<00:02:10.090> electrical<00:02:10.869> or

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
would vary use very little electrical or

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.940 
would vary use very little electrical or
a<00:02:11.440> very<00:02:11.770> little<00:02:12.010> gasoline<00:02:12.810> okay<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.050> then<00:02:14.740> as

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
a very little gasoline okay and then as

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.780 
a very little gasoline okay and then as
soon<00:02:15.160> as<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.580> applied<00:02:16.240> current<00:02:16.690> say<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.170> a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
soon as you applied current say to a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.290 
soon as you applied current say to a
overhead<00:02:18.790> air-conditioner<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:19.810> your<00:02:21.300> trailer

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
overhead air-conditioner in your trailer

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.420 
overhead air-conditioner in your trailer
or<00:02:22.480> motorhome<00:02:23.050> then<00:02:23.620> all<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.980> sudden<00:02:24.040> you'd

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
or motorhome then all of a sudden you'd

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.820 
or motorhome then all of a sudden you'd
hear<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.880> throttle<00:02:25.569> go<00:02:25.900> up<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.200> little<00:02:26.350> bit<00:02:26.650> as

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
hear the throttle go up a little bit as

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.080 
hear the throttle go up a little bit as
it<00:02:27.069> adjusts<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.780> amount<00:02:29.050> of

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
it adjusts to just the amount of

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.300 
it adjusts to just the amount of
electrical<00:02:31.090> requirements<00:02:32.050> now<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.069> lot<00:02:33.280> of

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
electrical requirements now in a lot of

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.050 
electrical requirements now in a lot of
generators<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.540> have<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:35.460> choke<00:02:36.460> this

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
generators you have a choke this

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.339 
generators you have a choke this
generator<00:02:37.600> is

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
generator is

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.819 
generator is
cold<00:02:38.680> right<00:02:39.040> now<00:02:39.099> and<00:02:40.590> normally<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:41.799> a

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
cold right now and normally on a

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.739 
cold right now and normally on a
generator<00:02:42.400> you'd<00:02:42.670> have<00:02:42.849> to<00:02:43.060> pull<00:02:43.329> the<00:02:43.510> little

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:43.749 
generator you'd have to pull the little

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.890 
generator you'd have to pull the little
knob<00:02:43.959> on<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.290> choke<00:02:44.760> get<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.879> started<00:02:46.389> then

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
knob on the choke get it started then

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.589 
knob on the choke get it started then
when<00:02:47.409> the<00:02:47.590> engine<00:02:47.920> got<00:02:48.040> worn<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.939> put<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.389> the

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
when the engine got worn you put in the

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.190 
when the engine got worn you put in the
choke<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.439> this<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:50.829> it's<00:02:51.159> automatic<00:02:51.849> so<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
choke on this one it's automatic so the

record the sound on a generator because
the<00:03:18.460> mechanics<00:03:19.460> of<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.730> camera<00:03:20.300> that<00:03:20.480> I'm

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
the mechanics of the camera that I'm

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.710 
the mechanics of the camera that I'm
holding<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:22.100> it<00:03:22.610> seems<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.150> have<00:03:23.270> a<00:03:23.300> different

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
holding it it seems to have a different

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.300 
holding it it seems to have a different
frequency<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.680> picks<00:03:24.920> up<00:03:25.100> on

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
frequency that it picks up on

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.610 
frequency that it picks up on
differently<00:03:26.180> than<00:03:26.420> what<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.840> human<00:03:27.230> ear<00:03:27.410> does

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
differently than what the human ear does

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.440 
differently than what the human ear does
so<00:03:28.370> right<00:03:28.580> now<00:03:28.790> we're<00:03:29.060> about<00:03:29.090> oh<00:03:30.160> maybe<00:03:31.160> 10<00:03:32.060> 15

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
so right now we're about oh maybe 10 15

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.470 
so right now we're about oh maybe 10 15
feet<00:03:33.020> from<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.380> generator<00:03:33.890> and<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.880> can<00:03:35.090> hear

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
feet from the generator and you can hear

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.260 
feet from the generator and you can hear
as<00:03:35.630> I<00:03:36.110> walk<00:03:36.350> even<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.770> little<00:03:36.950> bit<00:03:37.190> further<00:03:37.400> the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
as I walk even a little bit further the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.970 
as I walk even a little bit further the
sound<00:03:38.630> dissipating<00:03:39.640> almost<00:03:40.640> to<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:40.910> mile

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
sound dissipating almost to a mile

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.530 
sound dissipating almost to a mile
hum<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:44.860> if<00:03:45.860> I<00:03:46.100> walk<00:03:46.850> away<00:03:47.060> from<00:03:47.180> the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
hum and if I walk away from the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.840 
hum and if I walk away from the
generator<00:03:48.020> like<00:03:48.760> down<00:03:49.760> my<00:03:50.090> driveway<00:03:51.250> or<00:03:52.250> even

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
generator like down my driveway or even

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.010 
generator like down my driveway or even
behind<00:03:53.210> these<00:03:53.510> plant<00:03:54.850> containers<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:56.870> hear

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
behind these plant containers you hear

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.490 
behind these plant containers you hear
the<00:03:57.170> generator<00:03:57.710> is<00:03:57.950> almost<00:03:58.930> well<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.320> can

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
the generator is almost well you can

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.740 
the generator is almost well you can
just<00:04:00.680> barely<00:04:00.890> hear<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.370> by<00:04:01.520> human<00:04:02.030> ear<00:04:02.270> and

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
just barely hear it by human ear and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.330 
just barely hear it by human ear and
right<00:04:02.930> now<00:04:03.110> we're<00:04:03.290> on<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.440> muffler<00:04:03.890> side<00:04:04.160> of

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
right now we're on the muffler side of

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.680 
right now we're on the muffler side of
it<00:04:04.460> so<00:04:04.610> this<00:04:04.730> would<00:04:04.940> even<00:04:05.060> be<00:04:05.210> the<00:04:05.450> loudest

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
it so this would even be the loudest

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.320 
it so this would even be the loudest
side<00:04:06.140> so<00:04:06.980> if<00:04:07.100> I<00:04:07.220> come<00:04:07.430> down<00:04:07.460> the<00:04:07.880> driveway<00:04:08.150> a

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
side so if I come down the driveway a

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.490 
side so if I come down the driveway a
little<00:04:08.690> bit<00:04:09.220> you<00:04:10.220> can<00:04:10.370> probably<00:04:10.700> hear<00:04:11.390> like<00:04:12.290> I

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
little bit you can probably hear like I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.030 
little bit you can probably hear like I
can<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:13.070> birds<00:04:13.820> and<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.180> trees<00:04:14.210> and<00:04:15.040> the

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
can the birds and the trees and the

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.120 
can the birds and the trees and the
sound<00:04:16.760> of<00:04:17.000> cars<00:04:17.210> going<00:04:17.540> down<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:18.080> street<00:04:18.859> more

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
sound of cars going down the street more

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.849 
sound of cars going down the street more
than<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:19.489> can<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.730> generator<00:04:20.390> itself<00:04:20.859> now

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
than you can the generator itself now

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.680 
than you can the generator itself now
let<00:04:22.340> me<00:04:22.430> show<00:04:22.610> you<00:04:22.670> another<00:04:23.000> feature<00:04:23.120> that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
let me show you another feature that

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.129 
let me show you another feature that
this<00:04:23.840> particular<00:04:24.230> generator<00:04:24.920> has

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
this particular generator has

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:33.309 
this particular generator has
is<00:04:28.270> hard<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.389> move<00:04:29.659> it<00:04:29.780> about<00:04:31.870> thank<00:04:32.870> God<00:04:33.110> is

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
is hard to move it about thank God is

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.450 
is hard to move it about thank God is

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
can easily move this generator wherever

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:56.830 
can easily move this generator wherever
that's<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:45.990> that's<00:04:46.530> my<00:04:46.770> generator
