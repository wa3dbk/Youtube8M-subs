00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
what do you think about it I don't know

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.499 
what do you think about it I don't know
any<00:01:02.030> fast<00:01:02.690> driver<00:01:03.230> who<00:01:03.590> respects<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.509> curbs

any fast driver who respects the curbs
that's<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.899> first<00:01:06.170> rule<00:01:06.380> when<00:01:06.710> you're<00:01:06.950> in

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130

karting is that anything which can be
tipped<00:01:10.009> if<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.789> can<00:01:11.119> go<00:01:11.479> straight<00:01:11.869> when

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
tipped if you can go straight when

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.260 
tipped if you can go straight when
there's<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.710> corner<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.340> will<00:01:13.369> do<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:13.820> until

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
there's a corner you will do that until

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.980 
there's a corner you will do that until
the<00:01:14.420> race<00:01:14.600> director<00:01:16.600> complains<00:01:17.600> about<00:01:17.780> it

the race director complains about it

the race director complains about it
that's<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.229> first<00:01:18.470> rule<00:01:18.619> of<00:01:18.679> any<00:01:19.009> driver<00:01:20.170> and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
that's the first rule of any driver and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.010 
that's the first rule of any driver and
the<00:01:21.289> second<00:01:21.590> one<00:01:21.679> is<00:01:21.709> i<00:01:21.860> love<00:01:22.310> i<00:01:22.940> love<00:01:24.310> tarmac

the second one is i love i love tarmac

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
in terms of safety we need to think

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.249 
in terms of safety we need to think
about<00:01:44.929> penalizing<00:01:45.770> probably<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:47.259> drivers

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
about penalizing probably and drivers

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
type of power delivery that's the one of

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.160 
type of power delivery that's the one of
the<00:02:08.440> sublime<00:02:09.440> injen<00:02:09.950> that's<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.420> best<00:02:11.420> engine

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
the sublime injen that's the best engine

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.900 
the sublime injen that's the best engine
but<00:02:12.290> it's<00:02:12.410> very<00:02:12.650> inefficient<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.489> terms<00:02:13.550> of

yes

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
yes

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.870 
yes
I<00:02:17.560> think<00:02:18.560> we<00:02:18.680> need<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.830> give<00:02:19.100> opportunities<00:02:19.700> to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
I think we need to give opportunities to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.820 
I think we need to give opportunities to
all<00:02:20.120> drivers<00:02:20.450> not<00:02:20.870> only<00:02:21.140> young<00:02:21.380> drivers

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
all drivers not only young drivers

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.370 
all drivers not only young drivers
because<00:02:22.010> what's<00:02:22.340> not<00:02:22.520> normal<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.420> delma

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
because what's not normal is that delma

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.760 
because what's not normal is that delma
alligator<00:02:24.800> sweaty<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.340> with<00:02:25.550> 21<00:02:26.170> he<00:02:27.170> who's<00:02:27.410> 21

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
alligator sweaty and with 21 he who's 21

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.740 
alligator sweaty and with 21 he who's 21
is<00:02:28.430> not<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.670> young<00:02:28.910> driver<00:02:29.060> anymore<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.630> think

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
is not a young driver anymore I think

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.420 
is not a young driver anymore I think
that<00:02:30.050> we<00:02:30.170> need<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.350> be<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.560> little<00:02:30.620> bit<00:02:31.250> more

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430

about this young drivers maybe not that

it<00:02:50.060> but<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:50.330> think<00:02:50.900> that's<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.200> no-no<00:02:52.959> thinking

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
it but I think that's a no-no thinking

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.920 
it but I think that's a no-no thinking
that<00:02:54.170> it's<00:02:54.320> better<00:02:54.590> not<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.450> come<00:02:56.450> out<00:02:56.600> some

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
that it's better not to come out some

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.670 
that it's better not to come out some
try<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.650> have<00:02:57.890> fresh<00:02:58.520> tires<00:02:59.410> it<00:03:00.410> would<00:03:00.590> be

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
try to have fresh tires it would be

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.530 
try to have fresh tires it would be
different<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:01.400> season<00:03:01.459> because<00:03:01.880> last<00:03:02.270> year

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
different this season because last year

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.030 
different this season because last year
there<00:03:02.780> was<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:02.959> high<00:03:03.170> decoration<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.830> times

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
there was a high decoration of the times

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.670 
there was a high decoration of the times
but<00:03:04.220> what<00:03:04.400> purely<00:03:04.790> has<00:03:04.940> done<00:03:05.150> has<00:03:05.390> been<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.870> to

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
but what purely has done has been to to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.880 
but what purely has done has been to to
bring<00:03:06.890> all<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:07.790> compounds<00:03:08.750> closer<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.770> make

bring all this compounds closer to make

bring all this compounds closer to make
them<00:03:10.070> more<00:03:10.280> similar<00:03:10.670> but<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:10.970> supersoft<00:03:11.390> is

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
them more similar but the supersoft is

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.650 
them more similar but the supersoft is
going<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.840> be<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.739> same<00:03:12.950> but<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:13.820> very<00:03:14.000> bad<00:03:14.390> I

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
going to be the same but it's very bad I

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.350

we'll<00:04:27.599> see<00:04:27.840> if<00:04:28.289> we<00:04:28.590> can<00:04:28.830> manage<00:04:29.039> to<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:31.050> test<00:04:31.349> in

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
we'll see if we can manage to to test in

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.760 
we'll see if we can manage to to test in
Barcelona<00:04:32.900> hopefully<00:04:33.900> on<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.139> final<00:04:34.620> day<00:04:34.650> or

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
Barcelona hopefully on the final day or

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.409 
Barcelona hopefully on the final day or
as<00:04:35.189> Pedro<00:04:35.550> said<00:04:35.699> before<00:04:36.090> maybe<00:04:36.539> on<00:04:36.810> monday<00:04:38.419> but

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
as Pedro said before maybe on monday but

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.730 
as Pedro said before maybe on monday but
I<00:04:39.479> think<00:04:39.840> we<00:04:39.930> should<00:04:39.960> look<00:04:40.199> forward<00:04:40.439> to<00:04:40.530> a<00:04:40.560> good

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
I think we should look forward to a good

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.740 
I think we should look forward to a good
year<00:04:40.979> none<00:04:41.879> of<00:04:41.909> us<00:04:42.060> can<00:04:42.240> be<00:04:42.360> really<00:04:42.569> sure

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
year none of us can be really sure

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.860 
year none of us can be really sure
sitting<00:04:43.199> here<00:04:44.030> quite<00:04:45.030> who's<00:04:45.270> quickest<00:04:45.719> or

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
sitting here quite who's quickest or

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.330 
sitting here quite who's quickest or
who's<00:04:46.289> carrying<00:04:46.560> what<00:04:46.800> not<00:04:46.979> least<00:04:47.159> of<00:04:47.280> which

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
who's carrying what not least of which

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.649 
who's carrying what not least of which
because<00:04:47.789> a<00:04:47.819> lot<00:04:48.030> of<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.150> teams<00:04:48.360> will<00:04:48.569> be

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
because a lot of the teams will be

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.689 
because a lot of the teams will be
bringing<00:04:48.900> big<00:04:49.590> upgrade<00:04:49.770> packages<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.550> this

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
bringing big upgrade packages to this

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.209 
bringing big upgrade packages to this
this<00:04:51.060> next<00:04:51.330> test<00:04:51.740> we've<00:04:52.740> seen<00:04:52.889> one<00:04:53.009> or<00:04:53.099> two

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
this next test we've seen one or two

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:54.649 
this next test we've seen one or two
teams<00:04:53.430> trying<00:04:53.669> to<00:04:53.759> shuffle<00:04:53.969> the<00:04:54.120> team<00:04:54.389> a<00:04:54.419> day

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
teams trying to shuffle the team a day

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.629 
teams trying to shuffle the team a day
later<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.590> one<00:04:55.740> thing<00:04:55.919> all<00:04:56.009> of<00:04:56.159> us<00:04:56.280> would<00:04:56.460> like

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
later the one thing all of us would like

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.200 
later the one thing all of us would like
is<00:04:56.789> one<00:04:56.969> more<00:04:57.120> week<00:04:57.389> I<00:04:57.629> assure<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.169> that

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
is one more week I assure you of that

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.100 
is one more week I assure you of that
but<00:05:00.210> I<00:05:00.240> think<00:05:00.330> with<00:05:00.569> a<00:05:00.599> number<00:05:00.810> of<00:05:00.900> World

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
but I think with a number of World

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.779 
but I think with a number of World
Championship<00:05:01.590> drivers<00:05:01.919> that<00:05:02.069> we<00:05:02.190> have<00:05:02.400> and

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
Championship drivers that we have and

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.790 
Championship drivers that we have and
the<00:05:03.210> competitive<00:05:03.750> with<00:05:03.960> pace<00:05:04.259> we've<00:05:04.530> seen

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
the competitive with pace we've seen

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.249 
the competitive with pace we've seen
from<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.550> number<00:05:05.729> of<00:05:05.789> cars<00:05:06.030> so<00:05:06.240> far<00:05:06.509> I<00:05:06.719> think<00:05:06.990> the

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
from a number of cars so far I think the

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.930 
from a number of cars so far I think the
one<00:05:07.349> thing<00:05:07.409> we<00:05:07.620> can<00:05:07.800> look<00:05:07.949> forward<00:05:08.159> to<00:05:08.280> is<00:05:08.580> the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
one thing we can look forward to is the

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.100 
one thing we can look forward to is the
first<00:05:09.210> quarter<00:05:09.509> this<00:05:09.719> can<00:05:09.870> be<00:05:09.930> really

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
first quarter this can be really

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.080 
first quarter this can be really
exciting<00:05:10.620> so<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:11.250> racing<00:05:11.580> should<00:05:11.729> be<00:05:11.819> really

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
exciting so the racing should be really

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.550 
exciting so the racing should be really
good<00:05:12.270> for<00:05:12.509> the<00:05:12.599> first<00:05:12.810> first<00:05:13.199> half<00:05:13.379> of<00:05:13.500> this

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
good for the first first half of this

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.249 
good for the first first half of this
year<00:05:16.520> well<00:05:17.520> of<00:05:17.669> course<00:05:17.699> we<00:05:18.000> we<00:05:18.389> have<00:05:18.479> to<00:05:18.719> see<00:05:18.930> we

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.990 
know we have via we have been forced to
time<00:05:55.319> as<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.710> young<00:05:55.919> team<00:05:56.159> and<00:05:56.460> we<00:05:56.639> have<00:05:56.729> to<00:05:56.940> be

time as a young team and we have to be
very<00:05:57.150> strong<00:05:57.560> competitors<00:05:58.560> ahead<00:05:58.770> of<00:05:58.919> us<00:05:59.089> they

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:00.089 
very strong competitors ahead of us they

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:02.089 
very strong competitors ahead of us they
have<00:06:00.210> six<00:06:00.479> cars<00:06:00.719> as<00:06:00.990> you<00:06:01.169> know<00:06:01.289> so<00:06:01.589> you<00:06:01.620> then<00:06:01.979> to

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
have six cars as you know so you then to

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.329 
have six cars as you know so you then to
go<00:06:02.330> to<00:06:03.330> jump<00:06:03.599> into<00:06:03.779> that<00:06:04.110> these<00:06:04.469> six<00:06:04.770> cars<00:06:05.069> and

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:05.339 
go to jump into that these six cars and

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.730 
go to jump into that these six cars and
a<00:06:05.370> regular<00:06:05.550> basis<00:06:06.150> is<00:06:06.330> quite<00:06:06.599> it's<00:06:07.020> quite<00:06:07.080> a

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
a regular basis is quite it's quite a

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.529 
a regular basis is quite it's quite a
tough<00:06:08.279> job<00:06:08.940> to<00:06:09.150> do<00:06:09.300> but<00:06:09.479> ultimately<00:06:10.110> we<00:06:10.440> want

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
tough job to do but ultimately we want

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.740 
tough job to do but ultimately we want
to<00:06:13.159> to<00:06:14.159> be<00:06:14.310> successful<00:06:14.610> in<00:06:14.940> that<00:06:14.969> respect<00:06:15.509> and

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
to to be successful in that respect and

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.659 
to to be successful in that respect and
hopefully<00:06:16.409> we<00:06:16.529> can<00:06:16.710> make<00:06:16.860> a<00:06:16.919> first<00:06:17.190> seven<00:06:17.580> this
