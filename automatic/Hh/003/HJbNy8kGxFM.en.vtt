00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
but the other people I organized it with

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.850 
but the other people I organized it with
they<00:00:08.910> made<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.809> rest<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.230> happen<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:10.830> I

Adam and Tom and so you guys who are
about<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.430> enter<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.120> blindfolded<00:00:40.020> yeah

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
about to enter the blindfolded yeah

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.740 
about to enter the blindfolded yeah
three<00:00:41.250> by<00:00:41.399> three<00:00:41.550> by<00:00:41.610> three<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.570> right

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
three by three by three is that right

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.430 
three by three by three is that right
yep<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.219> tough<00:00:44.700> event<00:00:45.000> yeah<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.050> it's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
yep it's a tough event yeah but it's

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.529 
yep it's a tough event yeah but it's
probably<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.770> my<00:00:46.890> favorites<00:00:47.280> how<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:48.300> you

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
probably on my favorites how do you

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.569 
probably on my favorites how do you
solve<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.140> its<00:00:49.289> hue<00:00:49.559> without<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.370> able<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
solve with its hue without be able to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.110 
solve with its hue without be able to
see<00:00:50.730> it

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
see it

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.389 
see it
um<00:00:51.360> there<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.440> there<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> method<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.219> not

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
um there is there is a method it's not

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.939 
um there is there is a method it's not
the<00:00:53.489> same<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:53.820> solving<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.559> normally<00:00:55.559> yeah

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the same as solving it normally yeah

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.610 
the same as solving it normally yeah
some<00:00:56.430> people<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.760> differently<00:00:57.559> personally<00:00:58.559> I

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
some people do differently personally I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.959 
some people do differently personally I
do<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> series<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.550> numbers<00:00:59.940> and

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
do it with a series of numbers and

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.970 
do it with a series of numbers and
letters<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.570> associating<00:01:01.050> colors<00:01:01.379> twelve

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
letters and associating colors twelve

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.310 
letters and associating colors twelve
edges<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.370> count<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.730> fours<00:01:03.019> three<00:01:04.019> sets<00:01:04.199> of

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
edges I count in fours three sets of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.820 
edges I count in fours three sets of
four<00:01:05.360> yeah<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.990> everyone<00:01:07.500> has<00:01:07.619> their<00:01:07.740> own

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
four yeah it's everyone has their own

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
four yeah it's everyone has their own
way<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> doing<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.460> how<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> solve<00:01:09.869> your

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
way of doing it how do you solve your

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.590 
way of doing it how do you solve your
cue<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.130> pretty<00:01:11.670> similarly<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.299> using

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
cue I do pretty similarly like using

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.980 
cue I do pretty similarly like using
letters<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.860> yeah<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> use<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> three<00:01:15.570> sets<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
letters and yeah I use the three sets of

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.630 
letters and yeah I use the three sets of
four<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.650> make<00:01:16.770> twelve<00:01:17.100> because<00:01:17.400> there's<00:01:17.549> 12

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
four to make twelve because there's 12

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.999 
four to make twelve because there's 12
edges<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.570> yeah<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.780> mean<00:01:19.020> slightly<00:01:19.560> very

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
edges and yeah I mean slightly very

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.170 
edges and yeah I mean slightly very
slightly<00:01:20.040> different<00:01:20.310> solving<00:01:20.790> method<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.150> I

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
slightly different solving method but I

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
slightly different solving method but I
think<00:01:21.390> safe<00:01:21.600> sane<00:01:22.140> memorizing<00:01:22.710> method<00:01:23.040> like

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
think safe sane memorizing method like

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.399 
think safe sane memorizing method like
letters<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.880> stuff<00:01:24.060> yeah<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.960> how<00:01:25.110> does<00:01:25.170> fun

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
letters and stuff yeah and how does fun

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.810 
letters and stuff yeah and how does fun
compare<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.799> how<00:01:25.920> fast<00:01:26.189> could<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.490> solve<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
compare so how fast could you solve a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.280 
compare so how fast could you solve a
three<00:01:26.970> by<00:01:27.119> three<00:01:27.270> by<00:01:27.299> three<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.170> hear

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
three by three by three if you can hear

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.800 
three by three by three if you can hear
just<00:01:28.380> normal<00:01:28.799> seeing<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.250> normally<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
just normal seeing it normally I do it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.560 
just normal seeing it normally I do it
in<00:01:30.900> an<00:01:31.020> average<00:01:31.500> 16<00:01:32.250> seconds<00:01:34.939> 16<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.060> well<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
in an average 16 seconds 16 as well and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.539 
in an average 16 seconds 16 as well and
so<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.439> blindfolded<00:01:38.040> how<00:01:38.310> does<00:01:38.460> that

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
so then but blindfolded how does that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.950 
so then but blindfolded how does that
impact<00:01:38.670> suppose<00:01:39.360> there's<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> completely

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
impact suppose there's a completely

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.450 
impact suppose there's a completely
different<00:01:40.229> challenge<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.740> different

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
different challenge but different

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.780

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
really specific technique you can learn

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.430 
really specific technique you can learn
and<00:04:48.790> all<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.000> methods<00:04:49.150> on<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:49.930> internet

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
and all the methods on the internet

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.190 
and all the methods on the internet
though<00:04:50.740> like<00:04:51.610> a<00:04:51.640> few<00:04:52.480> if<00:04:52.810> you're<00:04:52.930> not<00:04:53.050> planning

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
though like a few if you're not planning

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.570 
though like a few if you're not planning
on<00:04:53.380> getting<00:04:53.500> too<00:04:53.740> fast<00:04:53.980> you<00:04:54.130> can<00:04:54.250> learn<00:04:54.340> a<00:04:54.370> sort

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
on getting too fast you can learn a sort

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.310 
on getting too fast you can learn a sort
of<00:04:54.640> simple<00:04:54.850> method<00:04:55.240> just<00:04:55.360> to<00:04:55.480> be<00:04:56.080> able<00:04:56.140> to

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
of simple method just to be able to

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.050 
of simple method just to be able to
solve<00:04:56.500> it<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:56.710> that's<00:04:56.980> also<00:04:57.130> quite<00:04:57.400> fun<00:04:57.580> so

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
solve it and that's also quite fun so
