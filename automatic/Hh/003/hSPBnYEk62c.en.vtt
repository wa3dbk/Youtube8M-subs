00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.170 

I<00:00:21.440> think<00:00:22.010> over<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.490> course<00:00:22.580> of<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:22.910> last<00:00:23.030> few

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
I think over the course of the last few

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.260 
I think over the course of the last few
years<00:00:23.360> when<00:00:23.780> works<00:00:24.369> change<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:25.610> a<00:00:25.640> degree<00:00:25.850> I

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
years when works change to a degree I

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.900 
years when works change to a degree I
started<00:00:27.260> with<00:00:27.440> just<00:00:27.800> these<00:00:27.950> photos<00:00:28.369> of<00:00:28.580> light

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
started with just these photos of light

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.910 
started with just these photos of light
moving<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:29.960> I<00:00:30.290> just<00:00:30.410> found<00:00:30.560> him<00:00:30.710> really

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
moving and I just found him really

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.080 
moving and I just found him really
interesting<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:31.460> thought<00:00:31.640> when<00:00:31.820> they<00:00:31.939> all

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
interesting and thought when they all

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.900 
interesting and thought when they all
maybe<00:00:32.330> I<00:00:32.450> should<00:00:32.630> paint<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.220> for<00:00:34.489> a<00:00:34.550> good

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
maybe I should paint this so for a good

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.520 
maybe I should paint this so for a good
three<00:00:35.180> or<00:00:35.210> four<00:00:35.450> years<00:00:35.600> it<00:00:35.870> was<00:00:35.989> just<00:00:36.290> heavy

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
three or four years it was just heavy

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.570 
three or four years it was just heavy
oil<00:00:36.830> messy<00:00:37.700> night<00:00:37.940> scenes<00:00:38.920> then<00:00:39.920> one<00:00:40.250> day<00:00:40.430> it

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
oil messy night scenes then one day it

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.790 
oil messy night scenes then one day it
sort<00:00:40.850> of<00:00:40.930> progressed<00:00:41.930> from<00:00:42.110> that<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.559> a<00:00:42.590> little

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
sort of progressed from that to a little

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.100 
sort of progressed from that to a little
more<00:00:43.040> abstract<00:00:43.699> application<00:00:44.570> of<00:00:44.690> oil<00:00:44.900> but

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
more abstract application of oil but

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.160 
more abstract application of oil but
still<00:00:45.320> all<00:00:45.590> how<00:00:46.190> loyal<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:46.940> then<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:47.809> started

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
still all how loyal and then I started

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.869 
still all how loyal and then I started
integrating<00:00:48.440> more<00:00:48.830> and<00:00:48.980> more<00:00:49.100> text<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:49.790> then

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
integrating more and more text and then

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.090 
integrating more and more text and then
it<00:00:49.970> became<00:00:50.150> more<00:00:50.330> about<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.600> text<00:00:50.989> than<00:00:51.290> the

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
it became more about the text than the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.660 
it became more about the text than the
pain<00:00:52.339> and<00:00:52.870> I<00:00:53.870> started<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:55.100> know<00:00:55.129> trying<00:00:55.489> new

best artists in the world live here but
they're<00:04:55.590> more<00:04:55.830> in<00:04:55.920> their<00:04:56.040> own<00:04:56.160> worlds<00:04:56.700> and

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
they're more in their own worlds and

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.990 
they're more in their own worlds and
then<00:04:57.450> another<00:04:57.630> towns
