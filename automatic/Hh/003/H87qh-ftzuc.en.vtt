 I also have another biography I should rather be followed in theaters 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 so with a photographer these lights my next 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.970
 therefore 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.580
 difficulty because in any case it is not easy to follow me in all diets is not 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.540
 but I will do a photographic book in all the theaters of the world went away 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.909
 naturally for reasons of perfection study 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.130
 doing themselves to go into the temple of the jeep opera music would skillfully go them 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.929

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.190
 around the culture &amp; decker italy 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.430

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.470
 it is free to help artists and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.870
 I understand that it is and there are difficulties in theaters but we must try to save the 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.430
 dance because common 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.420
