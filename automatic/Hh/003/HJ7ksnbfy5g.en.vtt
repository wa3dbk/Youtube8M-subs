00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
little extra sort of shine to it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.110 
little extra sort of shine to it
is<00:01:00.239> brush<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> touch<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> egg<00:01:02.550> wash<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
is brush it with a touch of egg wash a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.660 
is brush it with a touch of egg wash a
little<00:01:03.690> touch<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.899> egg<00:01:04.260> milk<00:01:04.739> mixed<00:01:05.580> together

little touch of egg milk mixed together

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.210 
little touch of egg milk mixed together
and<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.780> would<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.170> baked<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and this would then be baked in a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.550 
and this would then be baked in a
preheated<00:01:08.460> oven<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.090> wanted<00:01:09.390> about<00:01:09.630> 220

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
preheated oven you wanted about 220

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.890 
preheated oven you wanted about 220
that's<00:01:10.770> probably<00:01:11.010> better<00:01:11.130> gas<00:01:11.880> mark<00:01:12.150> 7<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.750> 8

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that's probably better gas mark 7 to 8

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690 
that's probably better gas mark 7 to 8
really<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.740> will<00:01:13.830> take<00:01:13.950> about<00:01:13.979> 20-25

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
really and it will take about 20-25

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.380 
really and it will take about 20-25
minutes<00:01:15.630> until<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:16.619> crispy

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
minutes until it's really crispy

heavily<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.110> icing<00:01:58.530> sugar<00:01:58.560> now<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.759> seems<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
heavily with icing sugar now it seems a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.060 
heavily with icing sugar now it seems a
little<00:02:00.299> extravagant<00:02:00.689> again<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.680> but

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
little extravagant again and it is but

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.700 
little extravagant again and it is but
you're<00:02:02.579> going<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.909> get<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.270> sort<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.710> little

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
does work very very well the next stage

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.280 
does work very very well the next stage
is<00:02:55.910> going<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.180> be<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.299> actual<00:02:56.599> pastry<00:02:56.840> cream

cream<00:03:01.400> but<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:01.819> can<00:03:02.329> of<00:03:02.480> course<00:03:02.690> just<00:03:02.750> use

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
cream but you can of course just use

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.509
