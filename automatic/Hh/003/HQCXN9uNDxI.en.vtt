00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello everyone in this video we are going to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.620
 show how to breed silkworms in 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.640
 house since they are one of the first 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.620
 animals that 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.420
 of those who take care of the children the 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.690
 smallest of the house 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.300
 here are the worms 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.710
 As you can see they do not stop eating 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.710
 feed yourself with mulberry leaves 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.760
 those who have not begun to form the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.650
 cocoon 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.650
 there we see a finished cocoon 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:38.390
 the worm is already becoming 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.770
 in butterfly 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.030
 and there we see one 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.030
 that are already becoming 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.690
 to get into the cocoon 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.710
 as you can see to have worms 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.050
 silk at home does not need more than a 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.640
 box a box to which you have to 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.730
 practice the woman is a cover for 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.740
 that they do not lack the air to the two 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.740
 worms 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.350
 depending of course on the amount of 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.920
 worms that we are going to have in this case 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.890
 that there are 12 in this box 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.330
 and good that they do not lack their food 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.330
 preferred the leaves of the mulberry 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.460
 As you can see, there are only four left 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.760
 worms of the twelve to form the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.320
 cocoon 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.300
 meanwhile they keep devouring 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.229
 those that remain are devouring leaves of 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.229
 purple mulberry 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.270
 you have to change the box let's say the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.270
 environment every couple of days or 3 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.390
 change the dry leaves that already 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.030
 remains of dry leaves that remain 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.240
 and defecating and putting leaves 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.240
 fresh 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.289
 to manipulate them when they are from this 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.409
 size is easy because you take them from the 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.860
 head stretches gently and leaves threads 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.620
 it can be a box 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.050
 empty while both clean and 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.679
 put back in their box with leaves 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.730
 new of fresh mulberry leaves 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.620
 around the month is when they start to 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.110
 form the cocoons the worms 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.190
 they tend to become yellowish and 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:25.069
 they stop eating and start knitting 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.670
 the buds 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.319
 the box can be left uncovered 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.230
 perfectly since they while 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.360
 have fresh mulberry leaves is 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.920
 impossible to leave 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.930
 that leaves in the box 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.020
 and on the other hand the moths can not 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.319
 neither are they able to leave the 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.319
 box 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.210
 there we can see another worm 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.210
 building what will be your new home 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.910
 then how do you look yellowish 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.490
 which is the one that indicates that it is ready 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.570
 for 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.570
 the now the cocoon 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.159
 as you can see all the worms have been 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.609
 become cocoons and have even 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:24.270
 born some butterflies so the 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.910
 first phase of silk worms 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.310
 has now finished waiting for all 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.660
 the butterflies come out of their cocoons 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.660
 and start laying eggs
