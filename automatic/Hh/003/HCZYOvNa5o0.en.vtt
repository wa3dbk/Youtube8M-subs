the thing is solid

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.790 
the thing is solid
it's<00:01:03.640> like<00:01:03.850> milled<00:01:04.630> out<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:04.900> one<00:01:05.080> block<00:01:05.560> of

lot<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.200> great<00:01:08.350> features<00:01:08.590> but<00:01:09.070> as<00:01:09.910> far<00:01:10.090> as

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
lot of great features but as far as

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.210 
lot of great features but as far as
getting<00:01:10.690> a<00:01:10.869> good<00:01:11.020> picture<00:01:11.290> with<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:11.560> hand

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
getting a good picture with it hand

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.889 
getting a good picture with it hand
holding<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.759> had<00:01:12.940> quite<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.210> quite<00:01:13.660> a<00:01:13.690> difficult

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
holding I had quite a quite a difficult

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.719 
holding I had quite a quite a difficult
time<00:01:14.290> especially<00:01:14.920> in<00:01:15.040> low<00:01:15.190> light<00:01:15.430> you<00:01:15.640> know

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
time especially in low light you know

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.850 
time especially in low light you know
the<00:01:15.880> shutter<00:01:16.090> speeds<00:01:16.420> are<00:01:16.570> loved<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:16.990> it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
the shutter speeds are loved and it

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.650 
the shutter speeds are loved and it
really<00:01:18.040> struggles<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.580> focus<00:01:19.000> in<00:01:19.210> in<00:01:19.479> those

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
really struggles to focus in in those

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.560 
really struggles to focus in in those
scenarios<00:01:19.899> so<00:01:20.560> for<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:21.460> type<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.729> use<00:01:22.090> the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
scenarios so for that type of use the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.389 
scenarios so for that type of use the
camera<00:01:22.930> really<00:01:23.320> didn't<00:01:23.500> work<00:01:23.649> too<00:01:23.830> well<00:01:23.860> in<00:01:24.250> my

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
camera really didn't work too well in my

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.760 
camera really didn't work too well in my
opinion<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.450> had<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.660> use<00:01:25.780> manual<00:01:26.050> focus<00:01:26.290> a

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
opinion and I had to use manual focus a

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.530 
opinion and I had to use manual focus a

the menu system it's a pretty easy menu
system<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.129> get<00:02:26.280> around<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.849> thing<00:02:27.030> also

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
system to get around this thing also

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.449 
system to get around this thing also
takes<00:02:27.540> video<00:02:28.200> footage<00:02:28.620> but<00:02:28.859> the<00:02:29.220> video

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
takes video footage but the video

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.910 
takes video footage but the video
footage<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.939> such<00:02:30.629> so<00:02:30.900> low<00:02:31.079> resolution<00:02:31.739> that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
footage is such so low resolution that

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.740 
footage is such so low resolution that
it's<00:02:32.159> not<00:02:32.340> really<00:02:32.609> I<00:02:32.760> mean<00:02:32.819> it's<00:02:33.060> cool<00:02:33.239> for<00:02:33.269> I

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
it's not really I mean it's cool for I

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.089 
it's not really I mean it's cool for I
guess<00:02:34.290> if<00:02:34.409> you<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.620> want<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.799> record

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
guess if you just want to record

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.399 
guess if you just want to record
something<00:02:35.310> quick<00:02:35.670> but<00:02:36.000> my<00:02:36.450> iPhone<00:02:36.870> Records

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
something quick but my iPhone Records

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.470 
something quick but my iPhone Records
better<00:02:37.590> video<00:02:37.889> basically<00:02:38.549> so<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.120> feature

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
better video basically so that feature

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.830 
better video basically so that feature
not<00:02:40.260> really<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.650> impressed<00:02:41.010> with<00:02:41.159> that

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
not really that impressed with that

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.420 
not really that impressed with that
and<00:02:43.500> then<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.739> just<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.099> have<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.250> make<00:02:44.400> sure

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
you have to take the cap off I think I'm

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.559 
you have to take the cap off I think I'm
gonna<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:47.130> hit<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.430> lens<00:02:47.849> with<00:02:48.120> my<00:02:48.239> finger

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
gonna just hit the lens with my finger

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.420 
gonna just hit the lens with my finger
yeah<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.530> have<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.680> make<00:02:49.739> sure<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.040> take<00:02:50.220> cap

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
off before you turn it off and get you a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.949 
off before you turn it off and get you a
welcome<00:02:52.590> screen<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:54.180> has<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.450> histogram

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
welcome screen and it has the histogram

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.320 
welcome screen and it has the histogram
and<00:02:55.110> all<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.349> stuff<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:56.250> really<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:57.000> cool<00:02:57.239> and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
and all that stuff it really is cool and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.089 
and all that stuff it really is cool and
you<00:02:57.420> can<00:02:57.540> see<00:02:57.720> how<00:02:57.870> far<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.290> lens<00:02:58.500> comes<00:02:58.860> out

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
you can see how far the lens comes out

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.009 
you can see how far the lens comes out
and<00:02:59.370> that's<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.060> lens<00:03:00.239> just<00:03:00.360> goes<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.870> its

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
and that's it the lens just goes to its

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.540 
and that's it the lens just goes to its
position<00:03:01.319> into<00:03:01.620> men<00:03:01.769> said<00:03:01.980> there's<00:03:02.190> no<00:03:02.310> zoom

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
position into men said there's no zoom

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.759 
position into men said there's no zoom
on<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.910> camera<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:04.019> fixed<00:03:04.349> focal

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
on this camera it's just a fixed focal

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.650 
on this camera it's just a fixed focal
line<00:03:04.860> it's<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.519> really<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.269> pretty<00:03:06.480> nice

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
line it's it really is a pretty nice

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.750 
line it's it really is a pretty nice
focal<00:03:07.080> length<00:03:07.230> because<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.190> aperture<00:03:08.640> on

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
focal length because the aperture on

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.699 
focal length because the aperture on
this<00:03:08.910> thing<00:03:09.090> goes<00:03:09.239> down<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.630> F<00:03:09.750> 2.8<00:03:10.349> which<00:03:10.560> is

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
this thing goes down to F 2.8 which is

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.890 
this thing goes down to F 2.8 which is
pretty<00:03:10.950> big<00:03:11.190> for<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.970> point-and-shoot<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.840> you

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
pretty big for a point-and-shoot so you

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.780 
pretty big for a point-and-shoot so you
can<00:03:13.019> get<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> nice<00:03:13.380> depth<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.950> field<00:03:14.280> way<00:03:14.730> so

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
can get a nice depth of field way so

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.390 
can get a nice depth of field way so
you're<00:03:15.060> zoomed<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.540> more<00:03:15.569> than<00:03:16.049> typical<00:03:16.739> on<00:03:17.340> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
you're zoomed in more than typical on a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.270 
you're zoomed in more than typical on a
point-and-shoot<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.330> therefore<00:03:18.780> at<00:03:19.019> F<00:03:19.170> 2.8<00:03:19.680> if

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
point-and-shoot so therefore at F 2.8 if

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.800 
point-and-shoot so therefore at F 2.8 if
you're<00:03:20.489> pretty<00:03:20.670> close<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> subject<00:03:21.569> you<00:03:21.660> can

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
you're pretty close to a subject you can

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.539 
you're pretty close to a subject you can
bouquet<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> background<00:03:22.950> out<00:03:23.100> pretty<00:03:23.310> nice

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
bouquet the background out pretty nice

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.420 
bouquet the background out pretty nice
and<00:03:23.880> get<00:03:24.209> real<00:03:24.450> nice<00:03:24.660> separation<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.500> another

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
and get real nice separation and another

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.800 
and get real nice separation and another
thing<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.730> helps<00:03:26.940> with<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.450> sensor

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
thing that helps with that is the sensor

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.449 
thing that helps with that is the sensor
in<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.049> thing<00:03:28.230> you're<00:03:28.709> getting<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.010> really

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
in this thing you're getting a really

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.059 
in this thing you're getting a really
large<00:03:29.819> sensor<00:03:30.269> in<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:31.110> very<00:03:31.470> small<00:03:31.799> camera

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
large sensor in a very small camera

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.589 
large sensor in a very small camera
which<00:03:32.519> are<00:03:32.670> going<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:32.880> give<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.180> really<00:03:33.360> good

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
which are going to give you really good

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.210 
which are going to give you really good
pictures<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:34.769> true<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.190> thing

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
pictures and and it's true this thing

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.640 
pictures and and it's true this thing
does<00:03:35.940> take<00:03:36.180> great<00:03:36.420> pictures<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:36.959> as<00:03:37.440> long<00:03:37.590> as

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
does take great pictures and as long as

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
things like that it's pretty much just

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.180 
things like that it's pretty much just
designed<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.569> take<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.170> good<00:04:01.410> picture<00:04:01.620> at<00:04:01.980> one

focal<00:04:02.609> length<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.030> that's<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.420> coming<00:04:03.720> from<00:04:03.870> a

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
focal length and that's it coming from a

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
12 or something like Nikon is equivalent

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.539 
12 or something like Nikon is equivalent
just<00:04:10.140> because<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.530> has<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.680> lot<00:04:10.950> more<00:04:10.980> features

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
just because it has a lot more features

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.280 
just because it has a lot more features
for<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.940> same<00:04:12.120> amount<00:04:12.329> of<00:04:12.450> money<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.989> picture

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
for the same amount of money the picture

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.620 
for the same amount of money the picture
quality<00:04:13.440> might<00:04:13.829> not<00:04:13.980> be<00:04:14.130> quite<00:04:14.459> as<00:04:14.670> good<00:04:14.880> but

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
quality might not be quite as good but

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.870

you know I have a 5d mark ii for that as

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.310 
you know I have a 5d mark ii for that as

I thought that was definitely worth

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.120 
I thought that was definitely worth
