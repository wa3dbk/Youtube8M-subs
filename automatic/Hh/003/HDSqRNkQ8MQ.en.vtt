00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
it all that sugar raises insulin it

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.969 
it all that sugar raises insulin it
raises<00:02:02.969> your<00:02:03.000> insulin<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:03.750> pins<00:02:04.439> up<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.829> then

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
raises your insulin but pins up and then

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.119

look<00:05:07.220> at<00:05:07.310> my<00:05:07.370> blood<00:05:07.580> test<00:05:07.849> from<00:05:07.970> here<00:05:08.240> and

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
look at my blood test from here and

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.719 
look at my blood test from here and
you're<00:05:08.509> out<00:05:08.539> always<00:05:09.289> low<00:05:09.440> tries<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:10.099> always<00:05:10.490> eat

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
you're out always low tries I always eat

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:11.290 
you're out always low tries I always eat
enough<00:05:10.940> though

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
enough though

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.149 
enough though
so<00:05:11.449> get<00:05:11.659> if<00:05:12.020> you're<00:05:12.199> a<00:05:12.229> fruitarian<00:05:12.680> who

so get if you're a fruitarian who

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.550 
so get if you're a fruitarian who
doesn't<00:05:13.520> eat<00:05:13.639> enough<00:05:14.259> you'll<00:05:15.259> be<00:05:15.349> burning

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
doesn't eat enough you'll be burning

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.010 
doesn't eat enough you'll be burning
probably<00:05:16.130> more<00:05:16.250> fat<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.819> that<00:05:17.210> can<00:05:17.360> be

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
probably more fat and that can be

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.020 
probably more fat and that can be

more triglycerides in the blood as your

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.430 
more triglycerides in the blood as your

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
because you become more effective at

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.089 
because you become more effective at
burning<00:05:30.889> fat<00:05:31.310> so<00:05:32.030> elevated<00:05:32.990> triglycerides<00:05:33.740> it

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
burning fat so elevated triglycerides it

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.230 
burning fat so elevated triglycerides it
doesn't<00:05:34.310> mean<00:05:34.430> mean<00:05:34.610> much<00:05:34.849> it<00:05:35.030> could<00:05:35.150> be

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
doesn't mean mean much it could be

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.149 
doesn't mean mean much it could be
stressed<00:05:35.570> as<00:05:35.719> well<00:05:35.930> so<00:05:36.229> there's<00:05:36.409> there's<00:05:36.889> many

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
stressed as well so there's there's many

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.490 
stressed as well so there's there's many
factors<00:05:37.639> in<00:05:37.759> elevated<00:05:38.240> triglycerides<00:05:38.810> it

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
factors in elevated triglycerides it

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.640 
factors in elevated triglycerides it
doesn't<00:05:39.710> always<00:05:40.479> you<00:05:41.479> know<00:05:41.570> mean<00:05:41.990> a<00:05:42.020> bad<00:05:42.289> thing

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
doesn't always you know mean a bad thing

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.649 
doesn't always you know mean a bad thing
so<00:05:42.919> yet<00:05:43.400> look<00:05:43.580> at<00:05:43.639> the<00:05:43.699> person<00:05:44.240> is<00:05:44.389> a<00:05:44.419> person

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:44.659 
so yet look at the person is a person

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:48.129 
so yet look at the person is a person
obese<00:05:45.229> are<00:05:46.159> they<00:05:46.310> smoking<00:05:46.729> donate<00:05:47.599> heart<00:05:47.870> and

klystron assad's and yet they're

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.779 
klystron assad's and yet they're
probably<00:05:51.860> at<00:05:52.039> risk<00:05:52.219> there<00:05:52.430> if<00:05:52.550> it's<00:05:52.699> a

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
probably at risk there if it's a

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.730

otherwise healthy lifestyle it's not a

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.200 
otherwise healthy lifestyle it's not a
real<00:05:56.810> concern<00:05:57.139> last<00:05:57.889> one<00:05:58.159> is<00:05:58.310> I<00:05:58.490> only<00:05:58.940> ate

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
real concern last one is I only ate

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.029 
real concern last one is I only ate
grass-fed<00:05:59.780> so<00:06:00.080> I'm<00:06:00.139> better<00:06:00.590> for<00:06:00.770> the<00:06:00.830> planet

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
grass-fed so I'm better for the planet

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.409 
grass-fed so I'm better for the planet
I'll<00:06:01.219> tell<00:06:01.400> you<00:06:01.460> what<00:06:01.580> grass<00:06:01.880> heads<00:06:02.240> the

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
I'll tell you what grass heads the

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:03.999 
I'll tell you what grass heads the
fucking<00:06:02.719> worst<00:06:02.930> thing<00:06:03.199> for<00:06:03.349> the<00:06:03.409> planet<00:06:03.620> why

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
fucking worst thing for the planet why

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.520 
fucking worst thing for the planet why
is<00:06:04.069> that<00:06:04.219> because<00:06:04.520> grass-fed<00:06:05.389> takes<00:06:06.110> up<00:06:06.319> more

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
is that because grass-fed takes up more

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.490 
is that because grass-fed takes up more
room<00:06:06.590> than<00:06:06.979> any<00:06:07.639> other<00:06:07.819> crop<00:06:08.180> because<00:06:09.139> grass

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
room than any other crop because grass

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.600 
room than any other crop because grass
is<00:06:09.800> so<00:06:10.009> nutrient<00:06:10.610> so<00:06:11.330> calorie<00:06:12.610> withering

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
is so nutrient so calorie withering
