hey everybody so I thought I would show
you<00:00:02.730> this<00:00:03.000> one<00:00:03.419> diagram<00:00:03.929> here<00:00:04.230> again<00:00:04.560> we're

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
you this one diagram here again we're

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.260 
you this one diagram here again we're
about<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.130> move<00:00:05.279> on<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.730> move<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.029> different

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
about to move on and move to a different

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.419 
about to move on and move to a different
painting<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.080> Michelangelo's<00:00:07.950> which<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
painting of Michelangelo's which is the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.759 
painting of Michelangelo's which is the
conversion<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.000> Saul<00:00:09.330> but<00:00:10.110> before<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:10.410> move<00:00:10.620> to

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
conversion of Saul but before we move to

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.589 
conversion of Saul but before we move to
that<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.219> thought<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:11.910> would<00:00:12.059> just<00:00:12.210> touch<00:00:12.389> on

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
that I thought we would just touch on

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.950 
that I thought we would just touch on
this<00:00:12.750> one<00:00:12.990> more<00:00:13.200> time<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:14.120> and<00:00:15.120> show<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.690> that

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
this one more time and and show you that

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.260 
this one more time and and show you that
the<00:00:16.379> greys<00:00:16.619> anatomy<00:00:16.859> brain<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.760> how<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.910> fits

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the greys anatomy brain and how it fits

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.400 
the greys anatomy brain and how it fits
on<00:00:18.510> top<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.100> creation<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.580> adam<00:00:20.820> i<00:00:21.410> wanted

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
on top of the creation of adam i wanted

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.500 
on top of the creation of adam i wanted
to<00:00:22.470> show<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.710> something<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.070> i<00:00:23.130> did<00:00:23.510> knowing

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
to show you something that i did knowing

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.730 
to show you something that i did knowing
that<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.869> creation<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.350> adam<00:00:25.590> locks<00:00:26.460> into<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
that the creation of adam locks into the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.099 
that the creation of adam locks into the
greys<00:00:28.740> anatomy<00:00:28.920> brain<00:00:29.519> then<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.689> means<00:00:30.869> that

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
greys anatomy brain then that means that

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.600 
greys anatomy brain then that means that
we<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.349> take<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> greys<00:00:31.859> anatomy<00:00:32.040> brain

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
we can take the greys anatomy brain

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.389 
we can take the greys anatomy brain
since<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.360> creation<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.320> adam<00:00:34.500> also<00:00:35.070> locks

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
since the creation of adam also locks

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.150 
since the creation of adam also locks
into<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.180> Orion<00:00:36.630> Nebula<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.950> use

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
into the Orion Nebula and we can use

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.190 
into the Orion Nebula and we can use
that<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.640> lock<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.120> greys<00:00:39.360> anatomy<00:00:39.570> brain

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that and lock the greys anatomy brain

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.770 
that and lock the greys anatomy brain
into<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> Orion<00:00:41.160> Nebula<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.820> that's<00:00:42.690> what

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
into the Orion Nebula and that's what

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.450 
into the Orion Nebula and that's what
we're<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.200> next<00:00:43.410> now<00:00:43.770> after<00:00:44.340> this

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
we're going to do next now after this

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.950 
we're going to do next now after this
we're<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> move<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.270> past<00:00:45.660> this

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
we're going to move on past this

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.549 
we're going to move on past this
creation<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.739> adam<00:00:46.920> i<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.360> heard<00:00:48.600> any

any kind of a debate whatsoever based on

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.810 
any kind of a debate whatsoever based on
the<00:00:59.910> images<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.930> i<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.109> shown<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.739> far

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
the images that i have shown you so far

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.429 
the images that i have shown you so far
based<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> image<00:01:03.480> recognition<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:04.290> goes

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
based on the image recognition that goes

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.469 
based on the image recognition that goes
all<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.680> way<00:01:04.799> down<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.280> detail<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.360> i'm

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
all the way down to the detail so i'm

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.359 
all the way down to the detail so i'm
going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.840> assume<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.350> point<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.950> there

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
going to assume at this point that there

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.100 
going to assume at this point that there
is<00:01:08.490> no<00:01:08.729> argument<00:01:09.030> since<00:01:09.390> no<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.689> has<00:01:09.810> produced

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
is no argument since no one has produced

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.490 
is no argument since no one has produced
one<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> what<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
one so what we see here is we see the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
one so what we see here is we see the
greys<00:01:13.710> anatomy<00:01:13.920> brain<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.760> top<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
greys anatomy brain on top of the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.929 
greys anatomy brain on top of the
Creation<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.900> Adam<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:17.820> in

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
Creation of Adam as you can see there in

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.980 
Creation of Adam as you can see there in
the<00:01:18.030> middle<00:01:18.320> we<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.830> how<00:01:20.990> Michelangelo

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the middle we can see how Michelangelo

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.440 
the middle we can see how Michelangelo
has<00:01:22.530> used<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.100> cingulate<00:01:23.549> gyrus<00:01:23.610> which<00:01:24.060> sits

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
has used the cingulate gyrus which sits

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.570 
has used the cingulate gyrus which sits
on<00:01:24.600> top<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> corpus<00:01:25.320> callosum<00:01:25.580> to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
on top of the corpus callosum to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.630 
on top of the corpus callosum to
represent<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.720> area<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.350> God's<00:01:28.799> arm<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
represent the area of God's arm and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.319 
represent the area of God's arm and
God's<00:01:30.060> head<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.630> his<00:01:30.720> chest<00:01:31.020> area<00:01:31.400> okay<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.210> now

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
God's head in his chest area okay so now

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.850 
God's head in his chest area okay so now
if<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:33.509> take<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> look<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> Orion<00:01:34.740> Nebula

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
if we take a look at the Orion Nebula

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.780 
if we take a look at the Orion Nebula
which<00:01:37.860> has<00:01:38.009> also<00:01:38.220> been<00:01:38.520> proven<00:01:40.670> since<00:01:41.670> we

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
which has also been proven since we

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.819 
which has also been proven since we
already<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> greys<00:01:43.110> anatomy<00:01:43.290> brain

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
already have the greys anatomy brain

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.950 
already have the greys anatomy brain
locked<00:01:44.250> into<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> creation<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.180> adam<00:01:45.360> all<00:01:45.750> we

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
locked into the creation of adam all we

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.289 
locked into the creation of adam all we
have<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.340> take<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> creation<00:01:48.210> of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
have to do is just take the creation of

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.090 
have to do is just take the creation of
adam<00:01:48.540> or<00:01:48.899> excuse<00:01:49.110> me<00:01:49.140> take<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.590> brain<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
adam or excuse me take the brain and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.399 
adam or excuse me take the brain and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
lock it into the Orion Nebula now what

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.859 
lock it into the Orion Nebula now what
you're<00:01:52.500> seeing<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> left<00:01:53.490> is

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
you're seeing here on the left is

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.620 
you're seeing here on the left is
actually<00:01:54.869> only<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.560> Orion<00:01:55.890> Nebula<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.630> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
actually only the Orion Nebula and the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.770 
actually only the Orion Nebula and the
greys<00:01:58.079> anatomy<00:01:58.320> brain<00:01:59.180> but<00:02:00.180> I've<00:02:00.270> zoomed<00:02:00.509> into

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
greys anatomy brain but I've zoomed into

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.319 
greys anatomy brain but I've zoomed into
a<00:02:00.899> couple<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.380> spots<00:02:01.680> or<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.549> spot<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:02.909> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
a couple of spots or one spot for you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.690 
a couple of spots or one spot for you
you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.049> see<00:02:04.229> specifically<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.369> see<00:02:05.549> her

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
you can see specifically you can see her

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.600 
you can see specifically you can see her
head<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.719> how<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.740> line<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
head and you can see how the line of the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.910 
head and you can see how the line of the
cingulate<00:02:09.420> gyrus<00:02:09.479> passes<00:02:10.440> right<00:02:10.590> through<00:02:10.649> her

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
cingulate gyrus passes right through her

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920 
cingulate gyrus passes right through her
forehead

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
forehead

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.390 
forehead
and<00:02:12.049> you<00:02:12.319> can<00:02:12.469> see<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.769> exact<00:02:13.159> same

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
and you can see that the exact same

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.520 
and you can see that the exact same
thing<00:02:13.640> happens<00:02:14.060> right<00:02:14.299> here<00:02:14.689> in<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.260> nebula

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
thing happens right here in the nebula

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.619 
thing happens right here in the nebula
and<00:02:16.250> if<00:02:16.549> you<00:02:16.640> want<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.849> compare<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.180> two<00:02:17.420> down

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
and if you want to compare the two down

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.179 
and if you want to compare the two down
here<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.049> can<00:02:18.200> compare<00:02:18.469> the<00:02:18.620> two<00:02:18.769> down<00:02:18.920> here

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
here you can compare the two down here

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.740 
here you can compare the two down here
right<00:02:19.400> here<00:02:20.409> and<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:22.670> brings<00:02:22.879> this<00:02:23.329> being

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
right here and that brings this being

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.009 
right here and that brings this being
the<00:02:24.469> anatomy<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.849> we<00:02:26.000> see<00:02:26.239> as<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.780> brain

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
the anatomy that we see as the brain

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.759 
the anatomy that we see as the brain
right<00:02:27.709> here<00:02:28.099> inside<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.359> Orion<00:02:29.629> Nebula<00:02:29.959> and

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
right here inside the Orion Nebula and

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.410 
right here inside the Orion Nebula and
one<00:02:30.920> thing<00:02:31.069> you'll<00:02:31.189> also<00:02:31.400> notice<00:02:31.819> is<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.150> if

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
one thing you'll also notice is that if

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.500 
one thing you'll also notice is that if
you<00:02:32.629> use<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.409> geometry<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.519> greys

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
you use the geometry of the greys

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.110 
you use the geometry of the greys
anatomy<00:02:35.719> bring<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.980> can<00:02:37.129> also<00:02:37.310> locate<00:02:37.730> other

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
anatomy bring you can also locate other

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.629 
anatomy bring you can also locate other
things<00:02:38.420> as<00:02:38.569> well<00:02:38.599> as<00:02:39.079> you<00:02:39.590> can<00:02:39.739> see<00:02:39.950> gobs<00:02:40.219> arm

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
things as well as you can see gobs arm

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.360 
things as well as you can see gobs arm
right<00:02:41.450> here<00:02:41.510> which<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.019> a<00:02:42.049> single<00:02:42.409> hrs<00:02:42.950> passes

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
right here which is a single hrs passes

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.789 
right here which is a single hrs passes
right<00:02:43.519> over<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:43.879> forehead<00:02:44.329> in<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.799> Orion

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
right over on forehead in this Orion

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.920 
right over on forehead in this Orion
Nebula<00:02:46.159> area<00:02:46.609> and<00:02:47.090> remember<00:02:47.299> this<00:02:47.569> is<00:02:47.629> only

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
Nebula area and remember this is only

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.539 
Nebula area and remember this is only
this<00:02:48.349> has<00:02:48.500> nothing<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:48.889> do<00:02:48.980> with<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.159> creation

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
this has nothing to do with the creation

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.129 
this has nothing to do with the creation
of<00:02:49.609> adam<00:02:49.790> right<00:02:50.060> here<00:02:50.239> this<00:02:50.629> is<00:02:50.689> only<00:02:51.019> the

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
of adam right here this is only the

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.830 
of adam right here this is only the
brain<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.799> Orion<00:02:52.129> Nebula<00:02:52.569> and<00:02:53.569> as<00:02:53.720> we

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
brain and the Orion Nebula and as we

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.589 
brain and the Orion Nebula and as we
move<00:02:54.169> all<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.919> way<00:02:54.950> through<00:02:55.370> we<00:02:56.090> can<00:02:56.269> capture

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
move all the way through we can capture

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.729 
move all the way through we can capture
those<00:02:57.230> detailed<00:02:57.769> areas<00:02:58.069> for<00:02:58.609> example<00:03:02.620> if<00:03:03.620> we

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
those detailed areas for example if we

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.170 
those detailed areas for example if we
wanted<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.010> take<00:03:04.159> a<00:03:04.219> look<00:03:04.430> at<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.639> area<00:03:05.000> that

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
wanted to take a look at the area that

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.759 
wanted to take a look at the area that
represents<00:03:06.639> God's<00:03:07.639> had<00:03:08.450> in<00:03:08.689> his<00:03:08.810> ear<00:03:09.290> what

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
represents God's had in his ear what

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.339 
represents God's had in his ear what
we're<00:03:09.919> calling<00:03:10.069> God<00:03:10.489> anyway<00:03:11.169> which<00:03:12.169> is

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
we're calling God anyway which is

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.399 
we're calling God anyway which is
actually<00:03:12.560> Adam<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.790> first<00:03:13.819> Adam<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:15.019> can<00:03:15.169> see

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
actually Adam the first Adam you can see

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:16.629 
actually Adam the first Adam you can see
it<00:03:15.500> right<00:03:15.680> here<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.159> you<00:03:16.220> can<00:03:16.370> see<00:03:16.609> the

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
it right here and you can see the

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.339 
it right here and you can see the
cingulate<00:03:17.150> gyrus<00:03:17.209> as<00:03:17.659> it<00:03:17.780> comes<00:03:17.959> around<00:03:18.079> and

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
cingulate gyrus as it comes around and

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.649 
cingulate gyrus as it comes around and
passes<00:03:18.650> over<00:03:18.829> a<00:03:18.859> forehead<00:03:19.310> this<00:03:20.060> area<00:03:20.479> right

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
passes over a forehead this area right

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.530 
passes over a forehead this area right
here<00:03:20.769> represents<00:03:21.769> his<00:03:21.979> ear<00:03:22.340> his<00:03:22.549> mouth<00:03:22.849> his

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
here represents his ear his mouth his

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.140 
here represents his ear his mouth his
eye<00:03:23.900> his<00:03:24.199> cheek<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:24.769> if<00:03:25.190> we<00:03:25.340> scroll<00:03:25.639> over<00:03:25.909> if

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
eye his cheek and if we scroll over if

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.449 
eye his cheek and if we scroll over if
we<00:03:26.269> would<00:03:26.389> do<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.569> direct<00:03:26.870> rectangle<00:03:27.680> over<00:03:27.979> we

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
we would do a direct rectangle over we

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.979 
we would do a direct rectangle over we
would<00:03:28.609> see<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.879> same<00:03:29.060> thing<00:03:29.389> and<00:03:29.659> the<00:03:29.750> lines

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
would see the same thing and the lines

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.559 
would see the same thing and the lines
here's<00:03:30.349> his<00:03:30.470> ear<00:03:30.829> and<00:03:30.949> in<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.879> same<00:03:32.060> area<00:03:32.359> as

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
here's his ear and in the same area as

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.800 
here's his ear and in the same area as
well<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:34.250> if<00:03:34.370> we<00:03:34.489> zoom<00:03:34.519> out<00:03:34.939> we<00:03:35.540> could<00:03:35.689> actually

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
well so if we zoom out we could actually

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.080 
well so if we zoom out we could actually
draw<00:03:36.139> a<00:03:36.169> rectangle<00:03:36.919> and<00:03:37.069> see<00:03:37.639> that<00:03:37.760> those<00:03:37.909> are

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
draw a rectangle and see that those are

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.569 
draw a rectangle and see that those are
both<00:03:38.209> level<00:03:38.629> in<00:03:38.750> both<00:03:38.900> areas<00:03:39.139> but<00:03:39.949> this<00:03:40.189> area

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
both level in both areas but this area

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.219 
both level in both areas but this area
right<00:03:40.759> here<00:03:40.819> is<00:03:41.000> really<00:03:41.329> easy<00:03:41.509> to<00:03:41.720> zoom<00:03:41.930> in<00:03:42.079> and

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:42.229 
right here is really easy to zoom in and

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.009 
right here is really easy to zoom in and
show<00:03:42.290> you<00:03:42.639> so<00:03:43.639> we're<00:03:44.030> about<00:03:44.299> to<00:03:44.449> move<00:03:44.599> on<00:03:44.780> the

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
show you so we're about to move on the

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.210 
show you so we're about to move on the
next<00:03:45.109> thing<00:03:45.349> we're<00:03:45.439> going<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.590> take<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.799> look<00:03:46.009> at

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
next thing we're going to take a look at

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.920 
next thing we're going to take a look at
is<00:03:46.459> we're<00:03:46.909> going<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.060> take<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.299> look<00:03:47.509> at<00:03:47.689> the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
is we're going to take a look at the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.499 
is we're going to take a look at the
next<00:03:48.349> one<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.949> Michelangelo<00:03:49.669> dead<00:03:49.939> when<00:03:50.479> she

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:50.509 
next one that Michelangelo dead when she

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.569 
next one that Michelangelo dead when she
did<00:03:50.780> in<00:03:50.900> 1542<00:03:51.680> was<00:03:52.040> just<00:03:52.250> called<00:03:52.430> the

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
did in 1542 was just called the

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.759 
did in 1542 was just called the
conversion<00:03:53.060> of<00:03:53.120> Saul<00:03:53.419> it's<00:03:54.290> actually<00:03:54.650> the

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
conversion of Saul it's actually the

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.159 
conversion of Saul it's actually the
same<00:03:54.799> thing<00:03:55.370> he<00:03:56.060> painted<00:03:56.449> the<00:03:56.540> Orion<00:03:56.840> Nebula

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
same thing he painted the Orion Nebula

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:58.780 
same thing he painted the Orion Nebula
but<00:03:57.439> specifically<00:03:57.949> he<00:03:58.159> focused<00:03:58.609> on<00:03:58.729> the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
but specifically he focused on the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.969 
but specifically he focused on the
trapezium<00:03:59.540> area<00:03:59.900> which<00:04:00.439> is<00:04:00.590> this<00:04:00.739> yellow

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979 
trapezium area which is this yellow

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.920 
trapezium area which is this yellow
triangle<00:04:01.639> area<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:02.090> we<00:04:02.150> see<00:04:02.389> right<00:04:02.599> here<00:04:02.810> in

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
triangle area that we see right here in

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.039 
triangle area that we see right here in
the<00:04:03.019> inside<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.500> Orion<00:04:03.769> Nebula<00:04:04.720> what<00:04:05.720> he<00:04:05.870> has

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
the inside the Orion Nebula what he has

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.140 
the inside the Orion Nebula what he has
on<00:04:06.079> top<00:04:06.590> of<00:04:06.739> that<00:04:06.919> is<00:04:07.459> he<00:04:07.729> has<00:04:08.079> Jesus<00:04:09.079> or<00:04:09.290> Christ

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
on top of that is he has Jesus or Christ

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.280 
on top of that is he has Jesus or Christ
floating<00:04:11.150> on<00:04:11.269> top<00:04:11.299> of<00:04:11.629> the<00:04:11.720> Orion<00:04:11.810> Nebula

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
floating on top of the Orion Nebula

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.640 
floating on top of the Orion Nebula
shooting<00:04:12.739> a<00:04:12.799> ray<00:04:12.979> down<00:04:13.220> it's<00:04:13.430> all<00:04:14.650> it's

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
shooting a ray down it's all it's

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.740 
shooting a ray down it's all it's
basically<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.310> same<00:04:16.430> theme<00:04:17.000> as<00:04:17.030> we<00:04:17.479> see<00:04:17.630> in

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
basically the same theme as we see in

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.509 
basically the same theme as we see in
the<00:04:17.840> creation<00:04:18.139> of<00:04:18.289> adam<00:04:18.500> because<00:04:19.340> in<00:04:19.430> the

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
the creation of adam because in the

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.759 
the creation of adam because in the
creation<00:04:19.789> of<00:04:19.940> adam<00:04:20.120> we<00:04:20.479> actually<00:04:20.810> see<00:04:21.049> God<00:04:21.739> in

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
creation of adam we actually see God in

this cloud reaching out to touch

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.090 
this cloud reaching out to touch
Adam<00:04:23.919> it's<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.610> same<00:04:24.880> kind<00:04:25.750> of<00:04:25.840> theme<00:04:26.110> just

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
Adam it's the same kind of theme just

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.280 
Adam it's the same kind of theme just
expressed<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.699> little<00:04:27.910> bit<00:04:28.000> differently<00:04:28.389> now

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
expressed a little bit differently now

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.409 
expressed a little bit differently now
when<00:04:29.410> we<00:04:29.470> take<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.680> look<00:04:29.860> at<00:04:29.979> history<00:04:30.400> we<00:04:31.150> see

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
when we take a look at history we see

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.659 
when we take a look at history we see
that<00:04:31.780> Christ<00:04:32.680> we<00:04:33.370> see<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:34.860> Adam<00:04:35.860> we<00:04:36.310> see<00:04:36.520> that

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
that Christ we see that Adam we see that

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.430 
that Christ we see that Adam we see that
all<00:04:36.850> these<00:04:37.030> areas<00:04:37.540> they<00:04:37.690> represent<00:04:38.139> the<00:04:38.199> same

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
all these areas they represent the same

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.600 
all these areas they represent the same
thing<00:04:38.710> but<00:04:38.830> they're<00:04:38.979> all<00:04:39.100> pointing<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.520> the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
thing but they're all pointing to the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.400 
thing but they're all pointing to the
Orion<00:04:39.850> Nebula<00:04:40.180> but<00:04:40.870> what<00:04:40.960> we're<00:04:41.080> going<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.260> do

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
Orion Nebula but what we're going to do

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.530 
Orion Nebula but what we're going to do
is<00:04:41.530> we're<00:04:41.650> going<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.830> get<00:04:41.919> into<00:04:41.979> that<00:04:42.190> next<00:04:42.540> I'm

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
is we're going to get into that next I'm

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.600 
is we're going to get into that next I'm
going<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:43.900> assume<00:04:44.169> at<00:04:44.350> this<00:04:44.380> point<00:04:44.560> that<00:04:45.070> says

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
going to assume at this point that says

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.219 
going to assume at this point that says
no<00:04:45.880> one<00:04:46.060> has<00:04:46.270> produced<00:04:46.600> and<00:04:46.930> you're<00:04:47.050> welcome

no one has produced and you're welcome
to<00:04:47.440> do<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.650> this<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.370> your<00:04:48.490> chance<00:04:49.139> produced<00:04:50.139> a

to do it this is your chance produced a

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.100 
to do it this is your chance produced a
video<00:04:50.680> that<00:04:51.280> comes<00:04:52.240> up<00:04:52.479> with<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.660> debate<00:04:53.080> that

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
video that comes up with a debate that

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.310 
video that comes up with a debate that
shows<00:04:53.650> me<00:04:53.979> how<00:04:54.790> I<00:04:54.820> am<00:04:55.150> wrong<00:04:55.449> about<00:04:55.479> the<00:04:55.930> images

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
shows me how I am wrong about the images

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.689 
shows me how I am wrong about the images
in<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.650> Orion<00:04:56.949> Nebula<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.490> image

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
in the Orion Nebula the image

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.270 
in the Orion Nebula the image
recognition<00:04:57.940> that<00:04:58.449> I've<00:04:58.570> shown<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:59.010> in<00:05:00.010> both

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
recognition that I've shown you in both

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.000 
recognition that I've shown you in both
the<00:05:00.460> brain<00:05:00.760> and<00:05:01.090> in<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.050> orion<00:05:02.350> nebula<00:05:02.680> itself

the brain and in the orion nebula itself

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.219 
the brain and in the orion nebula itself
and<00:05:05.490> I'm<00:05:06.490> willing<00:05:06.789> to<00:05:06.910> bet<00:05:07.000> that<00:05:07.449> after<00:05:08.050> two

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
and I'm willing to bet that after two

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.000 
and I'm willing to bet that after two
years<00:05:08.260> that<00:05:09.220> no<00:05:09.430> one<00:05:09.580> is<00:05:09.669> able<00:05:09.760> to<00:05:09.940> do<00:05:10.090> that<00:05:11.010> but

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
years that no one is able to do that but

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.800 
years that no one is able to do that but
this<00:05:12.100> is<00:05:12.250> your<00:05:12.280> chance<00:05:12.610> we're<00:05:13.510> going<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.690> move

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
this is your chance we're going to move

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.990 
this is your chance we're going to move
on<00:05:13.960> past<00:05:14.320> out<00:05:14.590> past<00:05:15.010> this<00:05:15.220> and<00:05:15.280> look<00:05:15.760> at<00:05:15.880> the

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
on past out past this and look at the

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000 
on past out past this and look at the
conversion<00:05:16.510> of<00:05:16.570> Saul<00:05:16.780> next<00:05:17.350> because

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
conversion of Saul next because

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.430 
conversion of Saul next because
Michelangelo<00:05:18.789> was<00:05:18.880> very<00:05:19.150> connected<00:05:19.479> and<00:05:19.840> this

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
Michelangelo was very connected and this

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.710 
Michelangelo was very connected and this
is<00:05:20.590> where<00:05:20.740> he<00:05:20.860> was<00:05:20.979> connected<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.490> and<00:05:21.910> he's

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
is where he was connected to and he's

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.240 
is where he was connected to and he's
painting<00:05:23.080> something<00:05:23.229> very<00:05:23.530> similar<00:05:23.860> in<00:05:24.010> the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
painting something very similar in the

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.490 
painting something very similar in the
conversion<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.699> Saul<00:05:25.169> so<00:05:26.169> I<00:05:26.229> hope<00:05:26.320> you<00:05:26.470> guys

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
conversion of Saul so I hope you guys

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.129 
conversion of Saul so I hope you guys
