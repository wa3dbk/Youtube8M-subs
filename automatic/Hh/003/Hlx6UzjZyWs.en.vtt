00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.590 
everything else like that from the same
family<00:02:41.870> needs<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.830> be<00:02:43.040> done<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.490> exactly<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
family needs to be done in exactly the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.190 
family needs to be done in exactly the
same<00:02:44.630> way<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:45.730> we'll<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:47.030> give<00:02:47.270> those<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.720> very

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
same way so we'll just give those a very

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.470 
same way so we'll just give those a very
good<00:02:48.650> watering<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.400> then<00:02:55.760> when<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.060> waters

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
good watering and then when the waters

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.449 
good watering and then when the waters
something<00:02:57.020> you're<00:02:57.350> just<00:02:57.560> put<00:02:57.770> a<00:02:57.800> few<00:02:58.100> slug

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
something you're just put a few slug

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.480 
something you're just put a few slug
pellets<00:02:58.870> round<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.200> if<00:03:00.380> it's<00:03:00.770> like<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.220> like

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
pellets round and if it's like you like

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.300 
pellets round and if it's like you like
these<00:03:01.670> once<00:03:01.910> they<00:03:02.090> get<00:03:02.240> to<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.450> certain<00:03:02.630> size

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
these once they get to a certain size

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.400 
these once they get to a certain size
then<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.580> won't<00:03:04.880> need<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.600> worry<00:03:05.870> about<00:03:05.989> that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
then it won't need to worry about that

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.979 
then it won't need to worry about that
but<00:03:07.190> they<00:03:07.370> will<00:03:07.580> grow<00:03:07.760> very<00:03:08.150> very<00:03:08.270> rapidly

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
but they will grow very very rapidly

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.300 
but they will grow very very rapidly
