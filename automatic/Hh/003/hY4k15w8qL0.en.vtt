00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.329
 It also controls frizz 3 and 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.790

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.960
 a lot to see people with color protection 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.420
 so who has colored hair is 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.400
 great for letting that color live 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.080
 longer lasting color but also for 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.630
 who does not have to colored hair 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.490
 the baby and the baby is also very 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.920
 important to maintain the health of 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.200
 hair days and benefit number is 6 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.970
 For you that have that problem of 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.270
 embarrassed break your hair is very 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.010
 Fininho makes a lot of knots or nothing else 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.530
 of chemicals a little more hair 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.580
 becomes more delicate in the 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.200
 time to comb 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.020
 so here you already have a product going 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.930
 make your life easier in the brushing time 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.910
 to comb the hair better the knots and even 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.830
 even after you have untangled and 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.050
 everything else is seen that it will not 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.240
 embarrassment along the way will not 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.360
 form both us and form if you 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.250
 had not used number 7 besides 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.630
 untangle people keep their hairstyle 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.580
 longer 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.160
 so if you for example made a brush 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.770
 and such he will be able to hold this 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.690
 place and using and nickel environments do not 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.010
 have proven to comb their hair wet because 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.780
 this is very delicate 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.690
 it is not recommended that you comb the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.220
 wet hair because you can break the 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.620
 hair fiber hair is more 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.810
 susceptible to breaking when you tried 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.330
 but here you also have this 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.030
 protection then if you pass all over the 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.610
 hair spreads well goes asking how 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.620
 care or with a wide-toothed comb or 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.930
 with those larger brushes those 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.120
 This makes everything easy for him. 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.610
 protects and prevents your hair from wearing 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.140
 during brushing or during 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.850
 you wet it with wet hair 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.340
 We 're already closing with the key. 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.709
 gold then one of the benefits I found 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.840
 very nice that prevents the formation of 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.000
 double points because it points double people 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.830
 It is when the hair begins to say to 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.239
 you who are in need of help 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.500
 treatment option 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.410
 then this prevention is very important 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.510
 you can not let your hair get hurt 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.150
 Can not let your hair reach 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.590
 get very dry try to do 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.170
 always a maintenance and with a 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.480
 product is obtained by using it 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.120
 once a week or every time you 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.330
 you can prevent a series of 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.739
 damage and ultimate benefit volume to 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.180
 hair 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.300
 that's what I told you to 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.960
 who likes very smooth hair is not the 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.479
 question 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.400
 Of course it makes the brush much easier for me 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.380
 I'll show you now how I 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.259
 I like to apply so I'm spraying on 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.210
 the entire length as the same fingers 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.400
 finish giving a taste dresser 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.740
 a lot of taking our hair out with 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.289
 the fingers or the wide-toothed comb 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.449
 So I go there and I feel the hand I feel 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.180
 very uniformly that I applied in a 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.849
 uniform and trade simply to 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.490
 Brush without the brush then I make a 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:57.669
 drying the hair by placing the air jet 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.380
 direction going down and taking the 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.819
 excess moisture 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.319
 when I feel that the hair is already 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.150
 practically forwarded checkers 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.710
 with the brush because I like 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.740
 more natural effect but if you like 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.599
 that brush or modeling brush that the 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.580
 people already gave a tip here is your 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.050
 criterion to completion but this is a 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.789
 product that I see that for those who have the 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.220
 hair very thin and gives you a 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.560
 including some friends have and 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.000
 she likes it very much because she 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.009
 Does that hair linger with the 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.870
 hair with a little more body one 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.479
 little more swing and this is natural 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.030
 this is very nice of course a book 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.729
 beautiful our many women like 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.340
 many women want a little more 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.400
 of balance more naturalness also something 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.440
 that it should be taken more seriously 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.259
 Wave all slips 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.090
 It is pretty clear but we will also dose of 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.860
 sometimes a little volume is good 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.289
 so this is a super produtinho 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.000

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.729

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.199
 doing the maintenance of a hair 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.810
