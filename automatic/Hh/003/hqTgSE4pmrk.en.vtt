00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.569
 hi girls this breathed tutorial 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.549
 on August 15th I thought cabbage 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.350
 but not much as mid-August as it starts 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.260
 all not done and then I was trying 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.789
 new colors today and michele I tried 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.470
 on an eye called haug I like how 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.010
 make up a tutorial and then it is 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.730
 a tutorial inspired by the sea at 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.950
 relaxing holidays with champagne than me 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.170
 I do not drink so maybe it does not matter obi 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.760
 however, all these things very well 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.289
 here you see it is colored but not too much e 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.640
 cheerful fun if you're a little ready 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.800
 others look good with tanning if 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.539
 you are Mediterranean girls if you are 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.219
 northern savena girls all because 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.870
 however, they are colors above all 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.079
 dies however where of the truth this 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.420
 blue here electric on dies 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.979
 it doesn't even matter to you blondes put it on 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.569
 you even if you have light eyes do not 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.569
 import girls 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:01:03.339
 follow the tutorial beginning with a primer 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:01:05.500
 this of the aerf then to make more 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:12.159
 intense colors use a white pencil 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:15.009
 also this as a basis this eden style 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.750
 but any white pencil looks like 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.750
 without creamy to be nuanced 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.210
 the first break is how to use this one 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:33.009
 of the pupa number eyeshadow vamp compact 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.470
 number 305 putting the first part 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:40.799
 of the eye except in the corner 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.799
 more immediate internal 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.430
 ok then second eye shadow they want 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.600
 use is always always cooked this 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:01.540
 but the number 402 is a champagne color and 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.540
 I put this after the green water 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.580
 the inner corner 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.610
 at this point I take the color from 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.040
 part naked the third to the brown yes 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.799
 also called naked with a 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:31.489
 small gradient brush and this 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:32.540
 I will use it to give a lot of definition 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.769
 clear then can get up 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.769
 at the inner corner without being afraid 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.430
 the fact that pa is helping 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.099
 to avoid 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.480
 do you remember the disco ball effect in 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.579
 this point because the third those who 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.420
 this always opaque electric blue by 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:59.299
 babe testing in the first time 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.280
 use and since a pleasure other like 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.659
 It felt like a good festival and we pass by 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.459
 tutorial however I don't know how to say yet 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.349
 I'm 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.769
 in the long run because if not the first 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.260
 once I try them for this here it is 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.750
 very little is if much pay much understood 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.760
 so be careful for a moment because it 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.139
 put in the outer corner the most 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.230
 near the junction of the 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.230
 eyelashes 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.550
 I slowly bring it up 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.860
 and in helping with the fact that this how many 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.390
 I say if you see this square then 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.270
 what ever happened because I can 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:53.010
 precisely to be precise and for example a 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:04:04.350
 give a little tongue effect an hour in 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:06.239
 in or co produced once after having 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.709
 made this kind of triangle 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.320
 he takes a brush from shades that 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.760
 where we used brown first 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:18.120
 than slightly the bottom towards blue in 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.950
 so that it is not too blocking nor the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.840
 compact but a little more widespread 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:29.340
 towards the brownish then 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.340
 not always the many below 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.040
 at this point I take the eyeshadows of 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:49.320
 first to make the 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:51.740
 black color again on teal e 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.979
 I also take the champagne color 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:05:01.380
 also here to make it slightly more 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:05.960
 intense then I get from the liners but 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.960
 this is from the liquid clarins 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.050
 where there is the champagne color it emits gods 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.940
 glitter always with champagne here 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.600
 I am still of the dome number 001 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:29.710
 but there are so many brands because it is 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.120
 one of the colors a little more classic than that 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.730
 that I noticed that they tend to eat 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.530
 color more paper not so much here but here if 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:40.240
 they do not dry and you close the eye 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:42.640
 a little the color is worth the folds then the 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.500
 ours is a problem only of these or in 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.500
 general number usually never happened 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.450
 he puts a few and I try not to close 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.030
 immediately the eye but wait for that 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:00.370
 they dry out because they are just maybe 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:03.340
 instead they are still liquid Algerian 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.830
 poor people go into the folds and while 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:11.580
 expects them to make pig climbing 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.580
 this is the max medium white medium 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.340
 do not put in 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.860
 ok it's below as the last step in the rhyme 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:33.930
 inside I put the butter-colored pencil of 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:36.720
 snow pastel makeup these are so 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:40.350
 the eyes finished for the video go to 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:44.720
 use now this diego blush from 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:48.360
 palm number 51 that the species of 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:51.170
 pinkish brown that to see it so not 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.090
 I gave him a quarter to actually say it is 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:57.420
 fantastic and looks like a lot to 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.190
 my favorite club of the tart 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.550
 what we talked about in 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.550
 video 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.210
 we keep the lips very natural puts 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:13.460
 just fit a bit of a physical 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.460
 press this and debit a number 0 5 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.130
 this therefore is the hostility I hope that 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.730
 both liked it 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.730
 beauty
