with the support I don't know my trouble
I<00:03:46.979> think<00:03:47.010> that's<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.519> answer<00:03:47.849> is<00:03:47.970> it's<00:03:48.150> always

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
I think that's the answer is it's always

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.119 
I think that's the answer is it's always
down<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.049> driver<00:03:49.319> in<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.650> end<00:03:49.799> isn't<00:03:49.979> it

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
down to the driver in the end isn't it

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.219 
down to the driver in the end isn't it
