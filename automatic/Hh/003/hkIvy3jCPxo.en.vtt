00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
so you come up with a model code we need

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.999 
so you come up with a model code we need
to<00:00:02.909> know<00:00:03.060> four<00:00:03.389> things<00:00:03.689> we<00:00:04.380> need<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.589> know<00:00:04.859> the

shaft is in it we need to know the width
of<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.360> housing<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.259> can<00:00:13.410> determine<00:00:13.710> gear

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
of the housing so we can determine gear

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.269 
of the housing so we can determine gear
width<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:15.000> need<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.389> know<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.809> port<00:00:16.560> locations

width we need to know the port locations

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.710 
width we need to know the port locations
and<00:00:17.550> what<00:00:17.760> ports<00:00:18.150> are<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.890> so<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.279> case

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
and what ports are in it so in this case

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.560 
and what ports are in it so in this case
we<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:23.480> four<00:00:24.480> inch<00:00:24.689> pilot<00:00:26.390> three<00:00:27.390> nine

seven five which would be seven eights
we<00:00:37.200> know<00:00:37.380> there<00:00:37.559> are<00:00:37.590> thirteen<00:00:38.280> teeth<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.850> it

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
we know there are thirteen teeth in it

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.580 
we know there are thirteen teeth in it
that's<00:00:39.360> seven<00:00:39.809> eight<00:00:39.930> thirteen<00:00:40.469> tooth<00:00:42.020> if<00:00:43.020> we

that's seven eight thirteen tooth if we

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.810 
that's seven eight thirteen tooth if we
measure<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.190> housing<00:00:44.760> height<00:00:45.200> which<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.060 
top to the bottom in this case a ruler
doesn't<00:00:53.579> go<00:00:53.850> big<00:00:54.090> enough<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.680> we're<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.010> to

our sheet six and a quarter inches tells

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
our sheet six and a quarter inches tells
us<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.670> P<00:01:08.670> 5000<00:01:09.630> series<00:01:09.979> if<00:01:10.979> they

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
us that this is a P 5000 series if they

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.640 
us that this is a P 5000 series if they

is<00:02:10.390> our<00:02:10.690> thread<00:02:10.990> size<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:11.740> we<00:02:11.860> know<00:02:12.040> that's<00:02:12.190> an

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
is our thread size so we know that's an

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.600 
is our thread size so we know that's an

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
inch and a quarter pipe we have the same

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.240 
inch and a quarter pipe we have the same

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
size port on both sides so we would

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.290 
size port on both sides so we would
assume<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.180> by<00:02:19.570> rotational<00:02:20.440> unit

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
assume that this is a by rotational unit

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.530 
assume that this is a by rotational unit
if<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.720> had<00:02:23.500> smaller<00:02:24.100> port<00:02:24.640> sizes<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.420> they

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
if it had smaller port sizes and they

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.300 
if it had smaller port sizes and they
were<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.810> same<00:02:25.840> size<00:02:26.290> we<00:02:26.680> could<00:02:26.920> assume<00:02:27.280> that

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
were the same size we could assume that

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.800 
were the same size we could assume that
it's<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.730> motor<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:29.850> in<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:31.060> case<00:02:31.300> we<00:02:31.540> know

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
it's a motor and in this case we know

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
it's a motor and in this case we know
it's<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.110> pump<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:34.110> that's<00:02:35.110> what<00:02:35.320> we<00:02:35.470> have<00:02:35.680> to

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
it's a pump so that's what we have to

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.410 
it's a pump so that's what we have to
deal<00:02:36.010> with<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:37.870> particular<00:02:38.500> unit<00:02:38.890> has<00:02:39.310> a

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
deal with this particular unit has a

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.960 
deal with this particular unit has a
shaft<00:02:40.420> bearing<00:02:40.989> in<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.640> said<00:02:42.850> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
shaft bearing in it and it said the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.760 
shaft bearing in it and it said the
shaft<00:02:43.209> bearing<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:43.690> held<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.080> with<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.410> snap

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
shaft bearing is held in with the snap

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.340 
shaft bearing is held in with the snap
ring<00:02:45.070> if<00:02:45.670> we<00:02:45.910> were<00:02:46.060> looking<00:02:46.209> at<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.720> seal<00:02:46.989> here

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
ring if we were looking at the seal here

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.770 
ring if we were looking at the seal here
we<00:02:47.530> would<00:02:47.709> know<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:47.920> did<00:02:48.220> not<00:02:48.459> have<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:49.060> shaft

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
we would know it did not have a shaft

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.660 
we would know it did not have a shaft
bearing<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:52.030> with<00:02:52.330> all<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:52.930> mind<00:02:53.459> we<00:02:54.459> know

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
bearing so with all that in mind we know

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.860 
bearing so with all that in mind we know
that<00:02:54.850> our<00:02:56.250> our<00:02:57.250> code<00:02:57.730> number<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.269> going<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.480> be

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
that our our code number is going to be

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.280 
that our our code number is going to be
a<00:02:58.900> P<00:02:59.320> for<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.680> pump<00:03:00.040> we<00:03:00.700> know<00:03:00.880> this<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.290> 5100

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
a P for a pump we know this is a 5100

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.030 
a P for a pump we know this is a 5100
series<00:03:02.739> or<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.790> 5000<00:03:04.780> series<00:03:04.989> we<00:03:05.350> don't<00:03:05.769> know<00:03:05.920> if

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
series or a 5000 series we don't know if

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.100 
series or a 5000 series we don't know if
it's<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.250> 5100<00:03:07.030> because<00:03:07.299> we<00:03:07.450> don't<00:03:07.660> know<00:03:07.900> we

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
it's a 5100 because we don't know we

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.990 
it's a 5100 because we don't know we
can't<00:03:08.350> see<00:03:08.709> inside<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.400> see<00:03:09.610> if<00:03:09.700> there<00:03:09.970> are

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
can't see inside to see if there are

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.430 
can't see inside to see if there are
dowel<00:03:10.900> pins<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.720> would<00:03:13.900> be<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.080> P<00:03:14.820> 5,000<00:03:15.820> a

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
dowel pins so it would be a P 5,000 a

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.470 
dowel pins so it would be a P 5,000 a
and<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:18.549> four<00:03:19.090> bolt<00:03:19.390> B<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.739> by<00:03:21.730> rotational

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
and the four bolt B and by rotational

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.800 
and the four bolt B and by rotational
with<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.690> shaft<00:03:22.989> bearing<00:03:23.440> it's<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.680> 531<00:03:24.519> code<00:03:24.850> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
with a shaft bearing it's a 531 code the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.039 
with a shaft bearing it's a 531 code the
back<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.320> this<00:03:26.440> pump<00:03:26.769> has<00:03:26.980> no<00:03:27.340> ports<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.120> so

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
back of this pump has no ports in it so

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.960 
back of this pump has no ports in it so
we<00:03:29.260> know<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.440> code<00:03:29.980> is<00:03:30.190> going<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.400> be<00:03:30.549> an<00:03:30.640> ad

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
we know that code is going to be an ad

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:40.620 
we know that code is going to be an ad
so<00:03:31.630> we've<00:03:31.810> got<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.019> P<00:03:32.340> 5000<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:36.299> 531<00:03:37.299> ad<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.700> the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
so we've got a P 5000 a 531 ad the the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.500 
so we've got a P 5000 a 531 ad the the
coding<00:03:41.350> for<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.790> inch<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.030> quarter<00:03:43.209> by<00:03:43.390> inch

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
coding for a inch and a quarter by inch

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.890 
coding for a inch and a quarter by inch
and<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.930> quarter<00:03:44.110> pipe<00:03:44.470> as<00:03:44.769> XK<00:03:45.549> so<00:03:46.420> we<00:03:46.600> would<00:03:46.750> add

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
and a quarter pipe as XK so we would add

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.340 
and a quarter pipe as XK so we would add
an<00:03:47.049> XK<00:03:47.650> we<00:03:48.340> would<00:03:48.489> add<00:03:48.670> a<00:03:48.700> 25<00:03:49.540> for<00:03:49.959> two<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.320> a

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
an XK we would add a 25 for two and a

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.670 
an XK we would add a 25 for two and a
half<00:03:50.560> inch<00:03:50.829> gear<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:52.510> shaft<00:03:52.959> code<00:03:53.350> for
