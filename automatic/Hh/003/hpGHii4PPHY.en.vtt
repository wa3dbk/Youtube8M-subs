00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979

Cole can help bridge the gap between

both<00:02:21.010> players<00:02:21.220> were<00:02:21.460> very<00:02:21.670> creative<00:02:22.210> on<00:02:22.330> the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
both players were very creative on the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.590 
both players were very creative on the
wings<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:23.430> they<00:02:24.430> all<00:02:24.550> both<00:02:24.940> them<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.270> had<00:02:25.420> some

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
wings and they all both them I had some

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.500 
wings and they all both them I had some
pace<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:25.960> some<00:02:26.110> trickery<00:02:26.350> so<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.010> think

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
pace and some trickery so I think

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.330

really seen any highlights of him on
YouTube<00:02:47.560> mainly<00:02:47.920> because<00:02:48.070> there<00:02:48.370> are<00:02:48.520> none

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
YouTube mainly because there are none

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.900 
YouTube mainly because there are none
but<00:02:49.810> I'm<00:02:50.800> hearing<00:02:51.100> great<00:02:51.220> things<00:02:51.310> about<00:02:51.580> him

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
but I'm hearing great things about him

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.940 
but I'm hearing great things about him
I've<00:02:52.360> read<00:02:52.540> his<00:02:52.570> bio<00:02:52.810> he's<00:02:53.140> about<00:02:53.410> six<00:02:53.770> foot

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
I've read his bio he's about six foot

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.580 
I've read his bio he's about six foot
two<00:02:54.190> he's<00:02:54.610> big<00:02:55.030> physical<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:56.020> I<00:02:56.290> think<00:02:56.470> it

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
two he's big physical and I think it

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.590 
two he's big physical and I think it
could<00:02:56.680> really<00:02:56.740> be<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.790> nice<00:02:58.000> compliment<00:02:58.570> to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
could really be a nice compliment to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.480 
could really be a nice compliment to
Torres<00:02:58.960> obviously<00:02:59.440> Torres<00:02:59.800> sometimes<00:03:00.250> gets

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
Torres obviously Torres sometimes gets

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.790 
Torres obviously Torres sometimes gets
stranded<00:03:01.330> out<00:03:01.600> there<00:03:01.630> in<00:03:01.930> front<00:03:02.140> as<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.500> lone

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
stranded out there in front as a lone

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.590 
stranded out there in front as a lone
striker<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.460> he<00:03:03.580> really<00:03:04.060> needs<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.450> support

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
striker and he really needs the support

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.140 
striker and he really needs the support
and<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:05.140> think<00:03:05.350> Remy<00:03:05.560> will<00:03:05.800> be<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:05.980> perfect<00:03:06.880> match

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
and I think Remy will be a perfect match

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.200 
and I think Remy will be a perfect match
for<00:03:08.050> him<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.650> sort<00:03:08.860> of<00:03:08.920> draw<00:03:09.640> some<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.150> the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
for him to sort of draw some of the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.700 
for him to sort of draw some of the
physical<00:03:10.450> attention<00:03:10.810> from<00:03:11.080> Torres<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.620> we

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
physical attention from Torres and we

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.380 
physical attention from Torres and we
all<00:03:11.830> know<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.010> when<00:03:12.430> Torres<00:03:12.850> gets<00:03:13.240> hit

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
all know that when Torres gets hit

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.090 
all know that when Torres gets hit
around<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:13.870> gets<00:03:14.020> physical<00:03:14.380> attention<00:03:14.560> he

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
around and gets physical attention he

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.860 
around and gets physical attention he
tends<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.490> be<00:03:15.610> off<00:03:15.730> his<00:03:15.850> game<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.750> I'm<00:03:16.810> very

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
tends to be off his game so I'm very

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:37.689 
subject to change who knows what

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.019

formation<00:05:37.990> mahajan<00:05:38.529> will<00:05:38.680> play<00:05:38.830> I<00:05:39.069> know

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:40.029 
formation mahajan will play I know

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:41.639 
formation mahajan will play I know
obviously<00:05:40.270> it's<00:05:40.629> going<00:05:40.659> to<00:05:40.810> change<00:05:40.870> because

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:41.649 
obviously it's going to change because

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:43.499 
obviously it's going to change because
whether<00:05:42.099> we<00:05:42.250> get<00:05:42.430> more<00:05:42.580> players<00:05:42.849> or<00:05:43.210> some<00:05:43.360> more

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
whether we get more players or some more

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.719 
whether we get more players or some more
players<00:05:43.750> I<00:05:44.050> think<00:05:44.589> mascherano<00:05:44.979> is<00:05:45.189> very<00:05:45.490> very

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
players I think mascherano is very very

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.490 
players I think mascherano is very very
likely<00:05:46.029> to<00:05:46.300> leave<00:05:46.449> I<00:05:46.599> think<00:05:46.779> he<00:05:46.930> will<00:05:47.139> leave<00:05:47.319> or

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
likely to leave I think he will leave or

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.439 
likely to leave I think he will leave or
enter<00:05:47.589> for<00:05:47.949> probably<00:05:48.250> around<00:05:48.849> 30<00:05:49.180> million

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
enter for probably around 30 million

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.420 
enter for probably around 30 million
pounds<00:05:49.990> so<00:05:50.500> hopefully<00:05:50.649> that<00:05:50.919> will<00:05:51.009> open<00:05:51.159> up

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
pounds so hopefully that will open up

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.689 
pounds so hopefully that will open up
some<00:05:51.610> funds<00:05:51.939> to<00:05:52.270> bring<00:05:52.629> in<00:05:52.779> a<00:05:53.310> high-class<00:05:54.310> left

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
some funds to bring in a high-class left

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.969 
some funds to bring in a high-class left
back<00:05:54.879> maybe<00:05:55.659> another<00:05:56.020> midfielder<00:05:56.319> and<00:05:56.800> maybe

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
back maybe another midfielder and maybe

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.029 
back maybe another midfielder and maybe
a<00:05:57.129> another<00:05:58.089> striker<00:05:58.419> who<00:05:58.719> knows<00:05:58.930> but<00:05:59.229> that<00:05:59.500> 30

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
a another striker who knows but that 30

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.950 
a another striker who knows but that 30
million<00:06:00.339> pounds<00:06:00.669> that<00:06:00.819> Mascherano<00:06:01.300> is<00:06:01.689> going

million pounds that Mascherano is going

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.600 
million pounds that Mascherano is going
to<00:06:02.020> bring<00:06:02.379> in<00:06:02.529> probably<00:06:02.949> from<00:06:03.099> a<00:06:03.189> sale<00:06:03.399> is

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
to bring in probably from a sale is

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.700 
to bring in probably from a sale is
really<00:06:03.819> going<00:06:03.909> to<00:06:03.969> help<00:06:04.089> us<00:06:04.300> I'm<00:06:04.569> not<00:06:05.469> really

really going to help us I'm not really

that<00:06:05.919> confident<00:06:06.310> having<00:06:06.520> Lucas<00:06:06.939> take<00:06:07.120> over

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419

his<00:06:07.509> role<00:06:07.750> I<00:06:07.960> do<00:06:08.469> think<00:06:08.889> that<00:06:09.009> we<00:06:09.250> would<00:06:09.399> need

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
his role I do think that we would need

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.920 
his role I do think that we would need
to<00:06:09.639> sign<00:06:09.789> another<00:06:09.909> defensive<00:06:10.479> midfielder<00:06:10.899> or

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
to sign another defensive midfielder or

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.990 
to sign another defensive midfielder or
a<00:06:11.050> place<00:06:11.259> master<00:06:11.649> anto<00:06:11.919> so<00:06:12.490> if<00:06:12.610> you<00:06:12.699> guys<00:06:12.789> have
