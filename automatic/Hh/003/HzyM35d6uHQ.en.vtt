00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:32.249
 You will find a refuge where 

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:33.620
 good Cuba

 as expected at the door 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.079
 You can customize your first weapon for personal and cardboard 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.210

 know where there is a work table 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.880
