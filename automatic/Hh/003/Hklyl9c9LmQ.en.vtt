00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
numerous steps that you can use to make

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.029 
numerous steps that you can use to make
your<00:00:17.150> computer<00:00:17.330> run<00:00:17.599> about<00:00:17.900> 30<00:00:18.289> to<00:00:18.529> 40<00:00:18.770> percent

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
your computer run about 30 to 40 percent

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.089 
your computer run about 30 to 40 percent
faster<00:00:19.310> than<00:00:19.700> it<00:00:19.820> was<00:00:20.000> before<00:00:20.800> so<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:21.890> first

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
faster than it was before so the first

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.440 
faster than it was before so the first
thing<00:00:22.160> we're<00:00:22.340> going<00:00:22.490> to<00:00:22.550> do<00:00:22.700> is<00:00:22.849> go<00:00:23.000> to<00:00:23.060> start
