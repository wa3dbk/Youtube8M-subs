00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
that's what they're gonna have to do is

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.240 
that's what they're gonna have to do is
adapt<00:06:53.020> to<00:06:53.290> it<00:06:53.410> probably<00:06:53.710> not<00:06:53.949> going<00:06:54.070> to<00:06:54.160> be

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
adapt to it probably not going to be

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.740 
adapt to it probably not going to be
able<00:06:54.340> to<00:06:54.490> get<00:06:54.639> to<00:06:54.790> that<00:06:54.940> breaking<00:06:55.240> point<00:06:55.540> they

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
able to get to that breaking point they

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.240 
able to get to that breaking point they
were<00:06:55.810> in<00:06:56.050> practice<00:06:56.470> just<00:06:56.590> gonna<00:06:56.889> have<00:06:57.040> to<00:06:57.100> kind

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
were in practice just gonna have to kind

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.650 
were in practice just gonna have to kind
of<00:06:57.280> take<00:06:57.460> things<00:06:57.699> easy<00:06:57.910> here<00:06:58.270> they're<00:06:58.540> gonna

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660 
of take things easy here they're gonna

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.060 
of take things easy here they're gonna
be<00:06:58.840> working<00:06:59.290> so<00:06:59.500> on<00:06:59.650> the<00:06:59.740> steering<00:06:59.979> wheel

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.890 
hasn't changed it is still a 90 and lap
price<00:07:06.190> which<00:07:06.400> means<00:07:06.430> pit<00:07:06.940> strategy<00:07:07.479> and<00:07:07.630> fuel

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
price which means pit strategy and fuel

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.330 
price which means pit strategy and fuel
strategy<00:07:08.290> very<00:07:08.590> important<00:07:09.010> to<00:07:09.100> calculate

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
strategy very important to calculate

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.250 
strategy very important to calculate
okay<00:07:09.820> crew<00:07:10.030> chief<00:07:10.210> explained<00:07:10.570> to<00:07:10.690> us<00:07:10.720> how<00:07:10.960> you

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.260 
okay crew chief explained to us how you

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.050 
okay crew chief explained to us how you
do<00:07:11.440> that<00:07:11.650> the<00:07:12.160> pit<00:07:12.310> strategy<00:07:12.700> on<00:07:12.820> the<00:07:12.910> road

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
do that the pit strategy on the road

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.330 
do that the pit strategy on the road
course<00:07:13.330> looks<00:07:13.660> very<00:07:13.870> simple<00:07:14.139> on<00:07:14.380> paper<00:07:14.410> 90

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.340 
course looks very simple on paper 90

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.280 
course looks very simple on paper 90
laughs<00:07:15.520> race<00:07:15.760> and<00:07:16.060> let's<00:07:16.240> say<00:07:16.360> you<00:07:16.450> go<00:07:16.600> 35<00:07:17.050> laps

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:17.290 
laughs race and let's say you go 35 laps

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.900 
laughs race and let's say you go 35 laps
which<00:07:17.590> is<00:07:17.740> about<00:07:17.950> an<00:07:18.070> average<00:07:18.430> that<00:07:18.850> means

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:18.910 
which is about an average that means

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.390 
which is about an average that means
you'll<00:07:19.240> make<00:07:19.389> your<00:07:19.540> last<00:07:19.780> pit<00:07:20.139> stop<00:07:20.169> on<00:07:20.560> lap<00:07:20.740> 55

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
you'll make your last pit stop on lap 55

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.550 
you'll make your last pit stop on lap 55
and<00:07:21.970> if<00:07:22.120> you<00:07:22.210> can<00:07:22.360> go<00:07:22.479> 35<00:07:22.960> laps<00:07:23.169> and<00:07:23.440> you'll

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 
and if you can go 35 laps and you'll

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.100 
and if you can go 35 laps and you'll
make<00:07:23.710> your<00:07:23.830> first<00:07:24.160> pit<00:07:24.610> stop<00:07:24.639> on<00:07:25.030> lap<00:07:25.180> 20<00:07:25.630> now

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
make your first pit stop on lap 20 now

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.540 
make your first pit stop on lap 20 now
where<00:07:26.410> it<00:07:26.500> gets<00:07:26.650> tricky<00:07:26.800> is<00:07:27.010> you<00:07:27.220> get<00:07:27.340> it<00:07:27.430> about

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
where it gets tricky is you get it about

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.279 
where it gets tricky is you get it about
twice<00:07:27.850> the<00:07:27.880> fuel<00:07:28.240> mileage<00:07:28.389> under<00:07:28.810> caution

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:29.289 
twice the fuel mileage under caution

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:30.750 
twice the fuel mileage under caution
than<00:07:29.440> you<00:07:29.530> do<00:07:29.710> under<00:07:30.280> green<00:07:30.520> flag<00:07:30.550> conditions

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:30.760 
than you do under green flag conditions

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.120 
than you do under green flag conditions
so<00:07:31.419> the<00:07:31.600> crew<00:07:31.750> chiefs<00:07:32.020> will<00:07:32.530> be<00:07:32.650> trying<00:07:32.979> to

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.130 
so the crew chiefs will be trying to

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.610 
so the crew chiefs will be trying to
predict<00:07:33.610> just<00:07:34.210> how<00:07:34.419> far<00:07:34.750> that<00:07:35.139> they<00:07:35.260> can<00:07:35.440> go

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620 
predict just how far that they can go

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.469 
predict just how far that they can go
based<00:07:36.220> on<00:07:36.370> how<00:07:36.430> many<00:07:36.580> caution<00:07:37.060> laps<00:07:37.210> that<00:07:37.330> they

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 
based on how many caution laps that they

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:39.690 
based on how many caution laps that they
think<00:07:37.539> that<00:07:37.780> will<00:07:38.020> get<00:07:38.260> so<00:07:38.620> that's<00:07:39.430> where<00:07:39.610> it

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:39.700 
think that will get so that's where it

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.980 
think that will get so that's where it
gets<00:07:39.789> tricky<00:07:40.000> and<00:07:40.270> it<00:07:40.360> gets<00:07:40.479> kind<00:07:40.600> of<00:07:40.720> risky

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
gets tricky and it gets kind of risky

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.090 
gets tricky and it gets kind of risky
for<00:07:41.110> the<00:07:41.200> crew<00:07:41.320> chiefs<00:07:41.530> to<00:07:41.620> make<00:07:41.770> that<00:07:41.950> call

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.100 
for the crew chiefs to make that call

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.890 
for the crew chiefs to make that call
but<00:07:42.550> you<00:07:42.669> have<00:07:42.820> to<00:07:42.970> do<00:07:43.090> it<00:07:43.210> to<00:07:43.330> be<00:07:43.419> successful

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:43.900 
but you have to do it to be successful

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.270 
but you have to do it to be successful
here<00:07:44.080> Jen<00:07:44.380> we're<00:07:44.500> thinking<00:07:44.770> the<00:07:44.860> second<00:07:45.130> grade

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 
here Jen we're thinking the second grade

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.409 
here Jen we're thinking the second grade
when<00:07:45.400> they<00:07:45.430> taught<00:07:45.669> you<00:07:45.820> to<00:07:45.910> count<00:07:46.150> backwards

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:46.419 
when they taught you to count backwards

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:47.909 
when they taught you to count backwards
it<00:07:46.780> would<00:07:46.870> help<00:07:46.960> you<00:07:47.110> be<00:07:47.229> a<00:07:47.260> better<00:07:47.320> crew<00:07:47.680> chief

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 
it would help you be a better crew chief

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:52.260 
it would help you be a better crew chief
you<00:07:48.039> know<00:07:48.370> no<00:07:50.610> that's<00:07:51.610> what<00:07:51.789> you<00:07:51.910> got<00:07:52.060> to<00:07:52.090> do
