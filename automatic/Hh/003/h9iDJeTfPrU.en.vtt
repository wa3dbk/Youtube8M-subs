00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:11.280
 it is my first video and on the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.330
 Idea came after my ex-husband 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.430
 had to exchange cable thought 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.140
 maybe someone has one too 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.960
 camera or a similar model below 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 I want or have to lick the bank 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.869
 also swap and do not know how to do that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.590
 it opens so i am though i have 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.329
 all visible screws removed 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.910
 as if wilder in the device herumgezerrt 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.620
 and respect plastic is of course that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.300
 Suddenly, of course, it's very robust 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.820
 has not really yielded but 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.160
 I have not opened the camera 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.350
 It's half an hour 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:58.140
 But the success was not there 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:05.640
 I already wanted to give up the came 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:09.000
 idea that I this plastic thing in 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.170
 cassettes bay are me more 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.020
 to look at it and it seemed like something to me 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.369
 you could certainly move it and 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.000
 remote ausknipsen characterized was the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.430
 even so and behind this 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.400
 plastic cladding were found again 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:35.490
 Two screws this plastic 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.950
 Of course I could have stopped 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.119
 to hear the plastic as I wanted 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.810
 finally know what stopped 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:47.680
 The camera is not open 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.370
 well why would i use this flex track 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:55.410
 replace the cable 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:59.340
 for a simple reason that one 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.340
 maybe see 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.090
 the flexible is broken 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.510
 the normal signs of wear 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.070
 through the constant opening and closing 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:22.630
 of the display and that becomes flexible everyone 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:25.630
 currently claims and breaks 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.440
 Just then you go and buy 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.420
 a new spare part must be natural 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.209
 see if the spare part of his device 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:46.060
 fits the toile that costs 12 300 euro 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:50.140
 and then I use it to open the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.080
 Camera quite cheap watchmaker tool 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.330
 that gets 41 of europas considered 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.330
 threw 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.940
 the money for my purposes i would like 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.790
 completely natural is a tool 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.820
 To open such would have to buy one 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.250
 but not the little slit 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.950
 screwdrivers are the little ones 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.040
 to be screwed 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:20.790
 Of course I missed it 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:24.220
 small screws rotate as far as 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.610
 that they come back to their place 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:31.510
 but I think the screws are 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.450
 not too different the whole 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.459
 should explain itself 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.390
 self-explanatory and his seven 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.810
 have black screws and look here 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.180
 we also see a black area 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.070
 screwing is maybe 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.110
 was prettier but not before 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:04:02.290
 thought 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:04:03.450
 so comes the little one because they see 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.910
 can 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.340
 here next to the blue double is one 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.900
 free socket 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.500
 There is a brown brace to this 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.500
 to open 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.010
 then you can use your football cable there 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:29.080
 pull out again and scattered 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.820
 use everything accordingly 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:43.330
 self-explanatory is as I said that 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:49.510
 is not a thing if you are now 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:52.050
 maybe not the flex track have that 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:57.940
 have to swap velcro 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.830
 There is also the LCD when he opens march 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.860
 Just click on the brown lock 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:13.480
 to get rid of the flex band 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:16.480
 of course, because the lcp still free 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.880
 it happens by simply doing it all 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.780
 ausknipsen 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:26.620
 here are small little mirrors removed 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:29.730
 and you just right he gets in with us 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.730
 So that's enough 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:39.040
 these two plastic parts that dig 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.700
 formats here in this folding and 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:49.320
 turned mechanism are indeed pretty 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:51.670
 from here, though, that's to say 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.070
 not meant to open 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:06:00.460
 it is very filigree 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:03.970
 These pens are a bit gross motor 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.010
 should that catch yours maybe yes 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.180
 maybe the right helping hands 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.760
 maybe still behind 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:16.350
 sticking there is then for eternity 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:20.110
 yes that is still to say so 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.910
 need to configure the I spoke 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.080
 I do not have to do that now 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:29.260
 Everything is explained 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.720
 before the plastic has to be here again 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.530
 Spot 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:38.080
 after that comes the little one's on it 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.630
 that's all it can do 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.980
 everything self-explanatory 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:46.810
 you can do that maybe yes 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.320
 the video is helpful and so i know 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.050
 not this one would like to see that 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.380
 is my first video 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:59.290
 but yes we see ourselves selling badly 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:02.860
 is interchangeable that can not 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.790
 real thing they all screw 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.920
 have removed 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:11.080
 also the plastic shaft and the one 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.300
 does not look until this is removed 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.770
 to have 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:19.540
 then your camera works too 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:23.950
 Again, as you should thank me 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:26.760
 me and would be glad if the 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.760
 comments on it
