00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.150
 this new video the hard disk the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.220
 I introduce you today is definite 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.530
 no normal hard drive why she did that 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:19.800
 word because it carries in the name and more 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:22.140
 you get to see the intro delivered 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.750
 she will be in a relatively appealing 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.210
 carton in there then we have first 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.519
 accessory a power adapter with the respective 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.710
 adapter for the corresponding country for 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.870
 the direct connection with the computer 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.780
 or mac you get a usb here 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.489
 3 on micro usb 3 cable except the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.379
 hard disk view which I here by the way 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.450
 with the maximum memory of two 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.980
 terabyte you still get 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.350
 a small kubik guide for the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.059
 unsuspecting entry we come now to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.469
 hard disk is completely made up 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.719
 plastic and come with one 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.210
 honed gray top therefore 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.250
 By the way, there are more colors, unfortunately 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.620
 not bottom right then finds the way 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.930
 a not very spectacular igloo logo 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.059
 his place and top left there are 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 to admire two little lambs one 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.530
 stands for activated wlan and the the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.840
 right next to it whether the hard drive 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.520
 must be charged or just on 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 Strom would have been with this but steer 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.250
 There is even a beginning to shine 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.920
 in the top left you can press a button 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.570
 and already like the hard drive 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.610
 in addition, connection for that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.020
 cable up in the middle then we have 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.670
 nothing exciting and we do not 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.330
 We can completely complete the functions 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.790
 dedicate 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.140
 since we could have usb3 on board 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.909
 unbelievable a data from the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.860
 copy hard disk or on the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.780
 sexpartys move while writing 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.930
 So you can copy so roughly 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.970
 a mega the number of 120 mbit / s can 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.130
 of course always something that varies too 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.810
 the computer arrives or laptop 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.369
 those who are just saying so in 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.530
 use from when reading so 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.610
 move reaches the strong as well 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.250
 about 120 megabits per second noted the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.630
 Values ​​are enormous and believe me 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.670
 it definitely applies in the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.560
 note usage even if now quite so 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.479
 big movies with several gigabytes 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.649
 shifts that it then just in a few 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.600
 seconds is already there 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.000
 But you can go to a smartphone or 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.950
 has tablet can not connect a cable 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.450
 the company sigel come up with something 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.350
 Leave the data on the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.750
 hard drive completely 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.330
 simply without a cable on such a device 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.010
 can transfer the hard disk radiated 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.780
 namely when you turn on a wifi 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.850
 network out so you can then get in 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.430
 log in this wlan network and with 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.530
 the free seagate media app entirely 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.460
 easy on everything on the hard drive 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.170
 access 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.210
 it is then just for not only for 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.310
 ios but also android windows phone 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.380
 and even the Amazon appstore will be here 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.390
 supporting it is just extreme 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.430
 Practical when you're on vacation 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.140
 and there are not many films I have 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.910
 now on my ipad in full hd 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.700
 therefore store could be able to watch 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.590
 but just check out one can in 1000 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.700
 settle films on the hard disk 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.830
 You can probably do that too 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.400
 never on vacation 1000 movies watch 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.930
 become 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.460
 it's just about the principle if I 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.560
 Now on all features of this app 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.540
 then you would do some 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.430
 minutes to carry forward here 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.590
 but I can assure you you can 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.720
 Download all data to others 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.850
 apps can also open or her 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.640
 for example from dropbox or from 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.220
 stream your photo album data stream 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.990
 a full hd film neviges with about 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.520
 So three people can do it then 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.530
 for example, on a long 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.540
 autofahrt two other persons of 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.740
 make use of your film and everything 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.450
 play fluidly 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.520
 that was very rough with that now 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.200
 feature you can send in again on the 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.940
 read website there like that now 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.740
 All down the video is rattling 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.840
 long and we'll come easy now 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.370
 for the price of such a price 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.200
 hard disk is then not so 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.540
 Satisfying then you know here 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.280
 in germany around the 250 euro pay 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.350
 so think about it in any case 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.900
 should you like the wine feature 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.610
 pay attention to people 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.070
 Traveling a lot and always just a tablet 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.940
 this is certainly a pretty 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.650
 ingenious thing 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.600
 And here is the hard drive too 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.370
 worth it if he only at home 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.950
 also uses a stink normal 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.810
 100 euro disk without any 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.880
 special functions are available here 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.670
 example from Seagate Seagate Becker 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.230
 square desktop which has second work and 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.610
 the cost is only 80 euros I tell you 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.260
 also just put the link in the 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.210
 You can look at the description 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.590
 So if you just those features the 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.540
 not included here now 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.410
 that 's what it was with me again 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.120
 this video 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.620
 I have you all in the left as always 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.330
 the description parked and then see 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.330
 We'll meet next time
