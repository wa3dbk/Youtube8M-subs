as<00:00:00.299> you<00:00:00.390> can<00:00:00.480> see<00:00:00.719> I've<00:00:00.900> converted<00:00:01.410> my<00:00:01.740> go-kart

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
as you can see I've converted my go-kart

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.919 
as you can see I've converted my go-kart
back<00:00:02.460> into<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:02.850> regular<00:00:03.030> go-kart

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
back into a regular go-kart

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.170 
back into a regular go-kart
this<00:00:04.290> is<00:00:04.440> my<00:00:04.650> geet<00:00:04.890> setup<00:00:05.370> from<00:00:05.640> those<00:00:05.850> first

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
this is my geet setup from those first

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.700 
this is my geet setup from those first
two<00:00:06.390> tests<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.429> I<00:00:08.429> have<00:00:09.059> now<00:00:09.389> stripped<00:00:10.139> this

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
two tests and I have now stripped this

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.860 
two tests and I have now stripped this
motor<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.550> I'm<00:00:12.000> going<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.210> move<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
motor and I'm going to move on to the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.289 
motor and I'm going to move on to the
next<00:00:13.019> set<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.500> tests<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.580> last<00:00:14.790> one<00:00:15.030> didn't

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
next set of tests the last one didn't

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.029 
next set of tests the last one didn't
really<00:00:15.480> prove<00:00:15.719> anything<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.350> thought<00:00:16.410> it's

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
really prove anything so I thought it's

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.400 
really prove anything so I thought it's
time<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.340> start<00:00:17.550> again<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> knockoff

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
time to start again this is a knockoff

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.870 
time to start again this is a knockoff
of<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.890> Honda<00:00:20.550> GX<00:00:21.230> 160<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.580> here's<00:00:23.580> all<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
of a Honda GX 160 and here's all the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.019 
of a Honda GX 160 and here's all the
intake<00:00:24.240> parts<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.619> muffler<00:00:26.010> here's<00:00:26.640> my

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
intake parts and the muffler here's my

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.330 
intake parts and the muffler here's my
new<00:00:27.269> intake<00:00:27.720> adapter<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.590> my<00:00:28.859> exhaust

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
new intake adapter and my exhaust

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.759 
new intake adapter and my exhaust
adapter<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.599> we're<00:00:30.900> going<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> now<00:00:31.439> go<00:00:31.500> through

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
adapter so we're going to now go through

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.580 
adapter so we're going to now go through
the<00:00:32.250> 30-minute<00:00:33.059> burn<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.899> then<00:00:34.200> try<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the 30-minute burn in and then try the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.459 
the 30-minute burn in and then try the
water<00:00:35.070> gas<00:00:35.309> test<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:37.230> gas

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
water gas test with this one the gas

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.700 
water gas test with this one the gas
from<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> last<00:00:38.520> test<00:00:38.879> incidentally<00:00:39.780> still

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
from the last test incidentally still

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.979 
from the last test incidentally still
turns<00:00:41.010> color<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.790> from<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.540> old<00:00:42.780> motor

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
turns color this was from this old motor

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.860 
turns color this was from this old motor
here<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:44.100> gas<00:00:44.280> turns<00:00:44.670> color<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.390> consumed

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
here the gas turns color and it consumed

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.180 
here the gas turns color and it consumed
the<00:00:46.230> gas<00:00:47.180> without<00:00:48.680> apparently<00:00:49.680> consuming<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the gas without apparently consuming the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
the gas without apparently consuming the
water<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.940> don't<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.570> test<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
water so I don't know if that test is a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.950 
water so I don't know if that test is a
failure<00:00:52.350> or<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:53.100> looks<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:54.030> so

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
failure or not it looks like one so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.240 
failure or not it looks like one so
we're<00:00:55.170> gonna<00:00:55.320> try<00:00:55.590> again<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:55.980> motor

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
we're gonna try again with this motor

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.170 
we're gonna try again with this motor
and<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.699> anywhere

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and see if we get anywhere

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.860 
and see if we get anywhere
let<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> works<00:00:59.420> well<00:01:00.420> here's<00:01:00.690> my

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870

the<00:01:53.759> intake<00:01:54.119> should<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> pre<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.350> post

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
the intake should be a pre or post

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.940 
the intake should be a pre or post
reactor<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.170> there<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.649> go

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
reactor so there we go

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.830 
reactor so there we go
let's<00:01:59.130> see<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.579> thing<00:01:59.790> works

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
let's see if this thing works

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.929 
let's see if this thing works
a<00:02:03.450> slight<00:02:04.450> problem<00:02:04.960> with<00:02:04.990> my<00:02:05.320> kit<00:02:05.799> one<00:02:06.579> was

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
a slight problem with my kit one was

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.740 
a slight problem with my kit one was
this<00:02:07.810> last<00:02:08.200> T<00:02:08.890> right<00:02:09.340> here<00:02:09.750> started<00:02:10.750> uh

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
this last T right here started uh

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.720 
this last T right here started uh
threading<00:02:13.750> itself<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> am<00:02:14.950> Taedong<00:02:15.310> cuz<00:02:15.640> I

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
threading itself so I am Taedong cuz I

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.369 
threading itself so I am Taedong cuz I
don't<00:02:15.790> want<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.150> didn't<00:02:16.810> want<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.019> do<00:02:17.110> too<00:02:17.290> much

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
don't want to didn't want to do too much

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.199 
don't want to didn't want to do too much
with<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.680> while<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.040> was<00:02:18.069> running<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.610> then

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
with it while it was running and then

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.479 
with it while it was running and then
the<00:02:19.239> heat<00:02:19.599> of<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.840> running<00:02:20.019> melted<00:02:20.739> my<00:02:20.890> hose<00:02:21.129> so

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
the heat of it running melted my hose so

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.150 
the heat of it running melted my hose so
you<00:02:21.519> can<00:02:21.730> probably<00:02:21.970> see<00:02:22.299> all<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.660> goo<00:02:23.080> on<00:02:23.379> that

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
you can probably see all the goo on that

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.020 
you can probably see all the goo on that
connection<00:02:24.549> and<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.480> hose<00:02:25.690> here<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:27.030> it

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
connection and the hose here it is it

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.300 
connection and the hose here it is it
was<00:02:28.239> getting<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.599> little<00:02:28.690> warm<00:02:29.019> so<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.769> happen<00:02:30.220> to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
was getting a little warm so I happen to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.009 
was getting a little warm so I happen to
have<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.519> few<00:02:30.760> extra<00:02:30.790> parts<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.569> I've<00:02:31.750> made

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
have a few extra parts and I've made

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.809 
have a few extra parts and I've made
myself<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.620> little<00:02:32.769> copper<00:02:33.250> flare<00:02:33.610> and

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
myself a little copper flare and

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.150 
myself a little copper flare and
connector<00:02:34.569> hopefully<00:02:34.989> just<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.739> short<00:02:36.010> length

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
connector hopefully just a short length

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.890 
connector hopefully just a short length
the<00:02:36.370> copper<00:02:36.819> will<00:02:37.000> dissipate<00:02:37.510> some<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.810> the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
the copper will dissipate some of the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.069 
the copper will dissipate some of the
heat<00:02:38.079> before<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.470> gets<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.980> vinyl<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:40.079> it

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
heat before it gets to the vinyl and it

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.470 
heat before it gets to the vinyl and it
won't<00:02:41.260> melt<00:02:41.470> any<00:02:41.680> more<00:02:41.890> hose<00:02:42.209> but<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.329> was

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
won't melt any more hose but it was

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.600 
won't melt any more hose but it was
running<00:02:43.720> second<00:02:44.620> ago<00:02:44.769> my<00:02:44.950> batteries<00:02:45.370> died

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
running second ago my batteries died

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.949 
running second ago my batteries died
there's<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:45.970> other<00:02:46.090> equipment<00:02:46.599> failure<00:02:46.930> I

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
there's the other equipment failure I

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.809 
there's the other equipment failure I
had<00:02:47.200> while<00:02:47.410> I<00:02:47.440> did<00:02:47.680> get<00:02:47.829> it<00:02:47.950> running<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.519> I'm

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
had while I did get it running so I'm

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.449 
had while I did get it running so I'm
going<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.260> fix<00:02:50.260> my<00:02:50.500> new<00:02:50.650> hose<00:02:50.920> on<00:02:51.129> there<00:02:51.340> and

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
going to fix my new hose on there and

00:02:51.459 --> 00:03:45.030 
going to fix my new hose on there and
get<00:02:51.579> it<00:02:51.700> started<00:02:52.030> again

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.000 

well<00:03:45.700> we<00:03:46.060> got<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.540> motor<00:03:46.720> inside<00:03:47.379> i<00:03:47.439> drained

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
well we got the motor inside i drained

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.089 
well we got the motor inside i drained
the<00:03:48.129> fuel<00:03:48.370> tank<00:03:48.760> out<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.269> this<00:03:50.110> is<00:03:50.290> what<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.500> got

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
the fuel tank out and this is what I got

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.809 
the fuel tank out and this is what I got
putrid<00:03:51.879> colored<00:03:52.329> gas<00:03:52.659> a<00:03:53.040> tiny<00:03:54.040> little<00:03:54.519> water

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
putrid colored gas a tiny little water

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.520 
putrid colored gas a tiny little water
deposit<00:03:55.480> at<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.599> bottom<00:03:56.079> this<00:03:56.140> looks<00:03:56.409> the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
deposit at the bottom this looks the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.100 
deposit at the bottom this looks the
same<00:03:56.709> as<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:56.950> last<00:03:57.280> test<00:03:57.700> so<00:03:58.420> basically<00:03:58.870> this

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
same as the last test so basically this

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.839 
same as the last test so basically this
test<00:03:59.439> did<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.769> same<00:03:59.980> thing<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.340> last<00:04:00.489> motor

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
test did the same thing the last motor

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.280 
test did the same thing the last motor
did<00:04:01.060> has<00:04:01.209> nothing<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.569> do<00:04:01.720> with<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.870> quality

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
did has nothing to do with the quality

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.780 
did has nothing to do with the quality
of<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:02.409> motor<00:04:02.590> this<00:04:02.769> is<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:02.980> practically

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
of the motor this is a practically

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.890 
of the motor this is a practically
brand-new<00:04:04.500> motor<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.769> again<00:04:06.519> in<00:04:06.819> about<00:04:07.299> 20

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
brand-new motor and again in about 20

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.500 
brand-new motor and again in about 20
minutes<00:04:08.110> it<00:04:08.829> turned<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.370> fuel<00:04:09.730> yellow

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
minutes it turned the fuel yellow

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.069 
minutes it turned the fuel yellow
started<00:04:11.379> to<00:04:11.500> stumble<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:12.430> then<00:04:13.359> just<00:04:13.720> kind<00:04:13.959> of

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
started to stumble and then just kind of

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.370 
started to stumble and then just kind of
while<00:04:14.409> I<00:04:14.439> was<00:04:14.739> adjusting<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:15.989> fresh<00:04:16.989> air<00:04:17.320> and

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
while I was adjusting the fresh air and

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.659 
while I was adjusting the fresh air and
fuel<00:04:17.889> handles<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:19.060> died<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.919> don't<00:04:21.430> know

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
fuel handles it died so I don't know

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.360 
fuel handles it died so I don't know
that<00:04:21.930> if<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:23.110> put<00:04:23.380> any<00:04:23.500> more<00:04:23.710> gas<00:04:23.860> in<00:04:24.160> it<00:04:24.280> I

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
that if I put any more gas in it I

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.580 
that if I put any more gas in it I
wouldn't<00:04:24.580> have<00:04:24.699> had<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:24.940> same<00:04:25.120> result<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.780> did

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
wouldn't have had the same result I did

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.909 
wouldn't have had the same result I did
experiment<00:04:27.220> with<00:04:27.430> both<00:04:27.780> air<00:04:28.780> nozzles<00:04:29.710> so

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
experiment with both air nozzles so

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.810 
experiment with both air nozzles so
there's<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.490> post<00:04:31.479> reactor<00:04:32.410> fresh<00:04:33.370> air<00:04:33.610> and

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
there's the post reactor fresh air and

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.870 
there's the post reactor fresh air and
on<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.780> side<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.350> pre<00:04:35.740> reactive<00:04:36.370> fresh<00:04:36.610> air

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
on the side the pre reactive fresh air

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.659 
on the side the pre reactive fresh air
and<00:04:37.120> it<00:04:37.270> didn't<00:04:37.539> seem<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:37.780> help<00:04:38.289> one<00:04:38.979> side<00:04:39.400> or

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
and it didn't seem to help one side or

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:40.140 
and it didn't seem to help one side or
the<00:04:39.760> other

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
the other

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.330 
the other
the<00:04:40.750> rods<00:04:40.990> still<00:04:41.260> pretty<00:04:41.530> hot<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.039> I<00:04:42.100> kind<00:04:42.280> of

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
the rods still pretty hot so I kind of

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.650 
the rods still pretty hot so I kind of
had<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.520> pick<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:42.789> up<00:04:42.850> with<00:04:43.030> my<00:04:43.150> welding<00:04:43.510> gloves

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
had to pick it up with my welding gloves

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.860 
had to pick it up with my welding gloves
but<00:04:44.610> there's<00:04:45.610> weird<00:04:45.880> sets<00:04:46.210> of<00:04:46.389> rings<00:04:46.600> and<00:04:46.810> I

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
but there's weird sets of rings and I

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.020 
but there's weird sets of rings and I
wonder<00:04:47.169> if<00:04:47.289> the<00:04:47.500> rod<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:48.070> bouncing<00:04:48.910> around

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
wonder if the rod is bouncing around

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.909 
wonder if the rod is bouncing around
madly<00:04:49.690> inside<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.139> reactor<00:04:50.560> chamber<00:04:50.889> I

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
madly inside the reactor chamber I

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.719 
madly inside the reactor chamber I
wonder<00:04:51.190> if<00:04:51.250> these<00:04:51.400> rings<00:04:51.820> these<00:04:52.090> shiny<00:04:52.360> spots

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
wonder if these rings these shiny spots

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.850 
wonder if these rings these shiny spots
correspond<00:04:54.729> with<00:04:55.570> some<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.410> fittings

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
correspond with some of the fittings

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.719 
correspond with some of the fittings
because<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.820> pipe<00:04:58.120> is<00:04:58.510> going<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:59.020> get<00:04:59.729> well

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
because the pipe is going to get well

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.379 
because the pipe is going to get well
the<00:05:00.940> end<00:05:01.060> of<00:05:01.419> the<00:05:01.710> reactor<00:05:02.710> rod<00:05:03.099> are<00:05:03.490> right<00:05:04.210> not

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
the end of the reactor rod are right not

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.050 
the end of the reactor rod are right not
retro<00:05:04.870> sore<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.169> intake<00:05:05.590> pipe<00:05:06.190> are<00:05:06.580> right

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
retro sore the intake pipe are right

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.120 
retro sore the intake pipe are right
here<00:05:07.449> and<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:08.169> other<00:05:08.199> end<00:05:08.560> is<00:05:08.710> right<00:05:08.919> around

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
here and the other end is right around

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.560 
here and the other end is right around
here<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:10.740> then<00:05:11.740> I've<00:05:12.160> welded<00:05:12.430> this<00:05:12.729> coupler

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
here and then I've welded this coupler

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.379 
here and then I've welded this coupler
on<00:05:13.780> yeah<00:05:14.470> I've<00:05:14.590> just<00:05:14.620> playing<00:05:15.039> around<00:05:15.240> so<00:05:16.240> then

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
on yeah I've just playing around so then

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.089 
on yeah I've just playing around so then
I<00:05:16.449> had<00:05:16.539> to<00:05:16.630> put<00:05:16.750> another<00:05:16.960> nipple<00:05:17.229> here<00:05:17.620> so

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
I had to put another nipple here so

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.909 
I had to put another nipple here so
there's<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:18.400> gap<00:05:18.639> in<00:05:18.940> here<00:05:19.870> where<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.349> reactor

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
there's a gap in here where the reactor

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.250 
there's a gap in here where the reactor
rod<00:05:21.160> or<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.580> intake<00:05:22.000> pipe<00:05:22.240> rather<00:05:22.539> stops<00:05:22.960> and

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
rod or the intake pipe rather stops and

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.400 
rod or the intake pipe rather stops and
then<00:05:23.440> another<00:05:23.710> pipe<00:05:23.949> starts<00:05:24.720> so<00:05:25.720> I<00:05:25.750> wonder<00:05:26.260> if

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
then another pipe starts so I wonder if

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.189 
then another pipe starts so I wonder if
my<00:05:26.650> rod<00:05:27.039> is<00:05:27.340> actually<00:05:27.789> shifting<00:05:28.479> that

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
my rod is actually shifting that

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.350 
my rod is actually shifting that
direction<00:05:29.710> and<00:05:30.039> then<00:05:30.370> you<00:05:30.789> know<00:05:31.090> getting

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
direction and then you know getting

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.600 
direction and then you know getting
stuck<00:05:32.110> or<00:05:32.139> whatever<00:05:32.500> but<00:05:33.010> it's<00:05:33.250> certainly

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
stuck or whatever but it's certainly

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.580 
stuck or whatever but it's certainly
there's<00:05:34.330> a<00:05:34.389> tee<00:05:34.630> at<00:05:34.780> both<00:05:34.990> ends<00:05:35.320> I've<00:05:35.409> taken

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
there's a tee at both ends I've taken

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.439 
there's a tee at both ends I've taken
this<00:05:35.740> one<00:05:35.919> off<00:05:36.039> obviously<00:05:36.310> but<00:05:36.699> the<00:05:37.120> tee<00:05:37.330> at

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
this one off obviously but the tee at

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.060 
this one off obviously but the tee at
both<00:05:37.599> ends<00:05:37.900> make<00:05:38.080> sure<00:05:38.229> that<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.500> rod<00:05:38.680> can't

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
both ends make sure that the rod can't

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.120 
both ends make sure that the rod can't
fly<00:05:39.639> too<00:05:39.699> far<00:05:40.300> but<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:40.930> thought<00:05:41.560> the<00:05:41.710> theory<00:05:42.039> on

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
fly too far but I thought the theory on

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.870 
fly too far but I thought the theory on
this<00:05:42.310> was<00:05:42.520> the<00:05:43.270> rod<00:05:43.539> would<00:05:44.610> Center<00:05:45.610> itself

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
this was the rod would Center itself

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.839 
this was the rod would Center itself
longitudinally<00:05:46.810> in<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:47.440> intake<00:05:48.400> pipe<00:05:48.639> or

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
longitudinally in the intake pipe or

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.460 
longitudinally in the intake pipe or
actually<00:05:49.240> in<00:05:49.360> the<00:05:49.449> reactor<00:05:49.870> chamber<00:05:50.289> which<00:05:50.440> is

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
actually in the reactor chamber which is

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.860 
actually in the reactor chamber which is
going<00:05:50.800> to<00:05:50.860> be<00:05:50.949> somewhere<00:05:51.849> centered<00:05:52.270> in<00:05:52.479> this

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
going to be somewhere centered in this

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.620 
going to be somewhere centered in this
bit<00:05:53.380> where<00:05:53.590> the<00:05:53.710> exhaust<00:05:54.099> goes<00:05:54.729> so<00:05:55.270> it<00:05:55.419> should

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
bit where the exhaust goes so it should

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.450 
bit where the exhaust goes so it should
have<00:05:55.719> centered<00:05:56.020> itself<00:05:56.349> right<00:05:56.530> in<00:05:56.740> here<00:05:57.010> so<00:05:57.430> I

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
have centered itself right in here so I

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.920 
have centered itself right in here so I
don't<00:05:57.520> know<00:05:57.669> what<00:05:57.789> these<00:05:57.909> these

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
don't know what these these

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.219 
don't know what these these
we'll<00:05:59.710> have<00:05:59.889> to<00:06:00.210> we'll<00:06:01.210> have<00:06:01.330> to<00:06:01.479> see<00:06:01.690> the

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
we'll have to we'll have to see the

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.900 
we'll have to we'll have to see the
solution<00:06:02.860> to<00:06:02.979> stopping<00:06:03.250> the<00:06:03.490> rod<00:06:03.699> from

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
solution to stopping the rod from

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.850 
solution to stopping the rod from
traveling<00:06:04.449> out<00:06:04.660> of<00:06:04.720> bounds<00:06:05.470> if<00:06:05.560> you<00:06:05.680> like

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
traveling out of bounds if you like

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.240 
traveling out of bounds if you like
would<00:06:06.400> be<00:06:06.639> to<00:06:07.080> put<00:06:08.080> some<00:06:08.229> kind<00:06:08.410> of<00:06:08.440> a<00:06:08.560> stopper

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
would be to put some kind of a stopper

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.150 
would be to put some kind of a stopper
in<00:06:09.460> the<00:06:10.449> inner<00:06:10.930> pipe<00:06:11.229> and<00:06:11.590> the<00:06:11.889> only<00:06:12.009> way<00:06:12.130> I

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
in the inner pipe and the only way I

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
in the inner pipe and the only way I
could<00:06:12.250> think<00:06:12.310> of<00:06:12.460> doing<00:06:12.550> that<00:06:12.699> is<00:06:13.030> maybe

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
could think of doing that is maybe

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.210 
could think of doing that is maybe
drilling<00:06:13.630> a<00:06:13.690> hole<00:06:13.720> through<00:06:14.199> it<00:06:14.229> and<00:06:14.530> then

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
drilling a hole through it and then

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.180 
drilling a hole through it and then
hammering<00:06:15.789> a<00:06:15.960> hard<00:06:16.960> nail<00:06:17.259> through<00:06:17.590> it<00:06:17.740> so<00:06:18.160> that

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
hammering a hard nail through it so that

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.150 
hammering a hard nail through it so that
it<00:06:18.460> would<00:06:18.610> stop<00:06:18.910> on<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.419> nail<00:06:20.080> but<00:06:20.380> the<00:06:20.560> fuel

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
it would stop on the nail but the fuel

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.620 
it would stop on the nail but the fuel
would<00:06:21.400> still<00:06:21.610> be<00:06:21.729> able<00:06:21.820> to<00:06:21.970> flow<00:06:22.180> around<00:06:22.330> it

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
would still be able to flow around it

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.460 
would still be able to flow around it
without<00:06:22.690> any<00:06:22.960> trouble

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
without any trouble

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.060 
without any trouble
so<00:06:24.250> we'll<00:06:25.150> see<00:06:25.360> more<00:06:25.600> testing<00:06:26.139> as<00:06:26.680> soon<00:06:26.860> as<00:06:26.979> I

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
so we'll see more testing as soon as I

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.430 
so we'll see more testing as soon as I
get<00:06:27.160> a<00:06:27.220> chance
