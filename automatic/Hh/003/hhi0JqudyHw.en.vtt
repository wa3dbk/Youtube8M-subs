00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
expect the scene to another 15 so he

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.780 
expect the scene to another 15 so he
expects<00:02:03.570> his<00:02:03.689> title<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> be<00:02:04.560> out<00:02:04.770> dozen<00:02:05.250> 15<00:02:05.610> so

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
expects his title to be out dozen 15 so

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.580 
expects his title to be out dozen 15 so
that's<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.180> sure<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:07.079> sure<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.409> coming

for the new gravity rush game but once

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.360 
for the new gravity rush game but once
we<00:02:15.330> show<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.900> world<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.320> believe<00:02:17.070> you'll

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
this post goes to say it's been about a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.020 
this post goes to say it's been about a
year<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.100> three<00:02:50.130> months<00:02:50.340> since<00:02:50.850> we<00:02:51.000> last

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
year and three months since we last

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.840 
year and three months since we last
heard<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> new<00:02:51.960> project<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.640> should<00:02:53.820> be

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
heard of the new project so it should be

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.460 
heard of the new project so it should be
interesting<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.480> see<00:02:54.750> what<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.020> new<00:02:55.140> gravity

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
interesting to see what the new gravity

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.310 
interesting to see what the new gravity
rush<00:02:55.620> game<00:02:55.860> looks<00:02:56.070> like<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.370> year<00:02:56.970> or<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.600> year<00:02:57.750> in

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
rush game looks like a year or a year in

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.580 
rush game looks like a year or a year in
three<00:02:58.620> months<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.280> a<00:03:00.000> year<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.720> back<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.320> year

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
three months and a year that back a year

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.620 
three months and a year that back a year
and<00:03:01.710> three<00:03:01.800> months<00:03:01.980> ago<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:03.090> game<00:03:03.360> looked

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
and three months ago the game looked

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.740 
and three months ago the game looked
like<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.900> had<00:03:04.020> already<00:03:04.200> been<00:03:04.440> going<00:03:04.920> through

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
like it had already been going through

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.590 
like it had already been going through
I'm<00:03:06.750> what's<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.320> called<00:03:08.330> program<00:03:09.330> whatever

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
I'm what's it called program whatever

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.350 
I'm what's it called program whatever
being<00:03:10.230> created<00:03:10.710> because<00:03:11.130> gravity<00:03:12.030> rush<00:03:12.120> came

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
being created because gravity rush came

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.390 
being created because gravity rush came
out<00:03:12.480> during<00:03:12.630> 12<00:03:13.050> gravity<00:03:13.740> days<00:03:13.950> came<00:03:14.160> up<00:03:14.280> to

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
out during 12 gravity days came up to

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.940 
out during 12 gravity days came up to
him<00:03:14.460> 12<00:03:14.820> though<00:03:15.240> so<00:03:15.570> like<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:16.050> kid<00:03:16.440> gravity<00:03:16.800> days

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
him 12 though so like a kid gravity days

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.800 
him 12 though so like a kid gravity days
came<00:03:17.160> out<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.580> think<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.000> was<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.120> launch<00:03:18.360> game<00:03:18.600> in

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
came out I think it was a launch game in

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.570 
came out I think it was a launch game in
Japan<00:03:19.140> actually<00:03:19.500> now<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.650> think<00:03:19.950> about<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.280> so

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
Japan actually now I think about it so

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.130 
Japan actually now I think about it so
and<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:20.970> like<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.300> was<00:03:21.390> out<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.720> know<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.990> game

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
and so like it was out you know the game

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.390 
and so like it was out you know the game
was<00:03:22.290> out<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.590> they<00:03:22.680> could<00:03:22.860> have<00:03:22.950> been<00:03:23.070> working

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
was out so they could have been working

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.700 
was out so they could have been working
on<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.580> sequel<00:03:23.760> already<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:25.050> only<00:03:25.530> reason

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
on the sequel already the only reason

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.870 
on the sequel already the only reason
why<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:25.950> didn't<00:03:26.190> come<00:03:26.340> out<00:03:26.400> right<00:03:26.460> away<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
why I didn't come out right away in the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.150 
why I didn't come out right away in the
u.s.<00:03:27.090> because<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.450> localization<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.740> I<00:03:28.890> had

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
u.s. because of localization and I had

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.410 
u.s. because of localization and I had
to<00:03:29.250> go<00:03:29.340> through<00:03:29.580> all<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:30.060> whole<00:03:30.180> process

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
to go through all that the whole process

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.420 
to go through all that the whole process
so<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:30.840> delayed<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.680> but<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.040> game<00:03:32.250> was

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
so that delayed it but the game was

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.520 
so that delayed it but the game was
finished<00:03:33.000> early<00:03:33.840> on<00:03:34.020> 2012<00:03:34.800> so<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:37.080> lot<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.350> a

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
finished early on 2012 so and a lot of a

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.470 
finished early on 2012 so and a lot of a
lot<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:37.890> things<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.400> what<00:03:38.580> developers<00:03:39.060> do<00:03:39.270> is

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
lot of things that what developers do is

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.890 
lot of things that what developers do is
they<00:03:39.690> start<00:03:39.960> making<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.530> sequel<00:03:40.800> right<00:03:41.160> after

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
they start making a sequel right after

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.930 
they start making a sequel right after
they<00:03:42.900> make<00:03:43.110> first<00:03:43.590> one<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.310> maybe<00:03:44.760> they

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
they make first one and so maybe they

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.370 
they make first one and so maybe they
gave<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.270> game<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.450> couple<00:03:45.750> weeks<00:03:46.020> like<00:03:46.230> wow

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380
