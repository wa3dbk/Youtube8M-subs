00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
product is really

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.920 
product is really
great<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.040> does<00:01:23.280> come<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:23.730> a<00:01:24.210> stocking

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
cap like a wig cap and I think there's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.790 
cap like a wig cap and I think there's
two<00:01:27.510> of<00:01:27.600> them<00:01:27.660> in<00:01:27.780> here<00:01:27.810> because<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.590> all<00:01:28.770> are

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
two of them in here because we all are

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.370 
two of them in here because we all are
different<00:01:29.220> complexions<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.450> they<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:30.960> put

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
different complexions so they do put

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.990 
different complexions so they do put
like<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.740> lighter<00:01:32.010> and<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:32.670> browner<00:01:32.910> color

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
like a lighter and a more browner color

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.230 
like a lighter and a more browner color
here<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.740> number<00:01:35.160> two<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:36.060> I

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
said now from this the looks of it it's

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.430 
said now from this the looks of it it's
kind<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.940> dark<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.450> me<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.810> looks<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
kind of dark to me it looks like a

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.780 
kind of dark to me it looks like a
number<00:01:40.940> one<00:01:41.940> or<00:01:42.270> 1b<00:01:42.780> rather<00:01:43.230> it's<00:01:44.010> kind<00:01:44.730> of

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.250 
number one or 1b rather it's kind of
dark<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.540> know<00:01:45.660> what<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.900> can<00:01:46.080> deal<00:01:46.230> with

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
dark but you know what I can deal with

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.500 
dark but you know what I can deal with
that<00:01:46.500> now<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> said<00:01:47.760> this<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
that now like I said this is one of the

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.140 
that now like I said this is one of the
nicer<00:01:48.960> synthetic<00:01:49.440> units<00:01:49.800> so<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.700> got<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
nicer synthetic units so it's got the

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.360 
nicer synthetic units so it's got the
soft<00:01:51.480> lace<00:01:51.870> on<00:01:52.260> it<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.980> don't<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
soft lace on it but you don't have to

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.040 
soft lace on it but you don't have to
worry<00:01:53.490> about<00:01:53.520> gluing<00:01:54.060> yet<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
worry about gluing yet because it is a

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.500 
worry about gluing yet because it is a
little<00:01:55.440> list<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.250> does<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.820> combs

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
little list and it does have the combs

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.270 
little list and it does have the combs
now<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.229> didn't<00:01:58.470> put<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> comb<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.040> middle

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
now they didn't put a comb in the middle

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.560 
now they didn't put a comb in the middle
which<00:01:59.400> is<00:01:59.430> fine<00:01:59.790> because<00:02:00.000> I'm<00:02:00.270> not<00:02:00.300> really

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
which is fine because I'm not really

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.480 
which is fine because I'm not really
sure<00:02:00.810> why<00:02:01.140> these<00:02:01.500> big<00:02:01.680> companies<00:02:01.979> put<00:02:02.250> combs

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
sure why these big companies put combs

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.830 
sure why these big companies put combs
in<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.670> middle<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.270> defeats<00:02:03.720> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
in the middle that just defeats the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.870 
in the middle that just defeats the
whole<00:02:03.869> purpose<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.410> me<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:05.190> there's

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
whole purpose to me but there's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760 
whole purpose to me but there's
adjustable<00:02:06.540> straps<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.170> back<00:02:07.200> along<00:02:07.740> with

just change it up too quick so for the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.570

most part it is a darker color and I do

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.820 
most part it is a darker color and I do
see<00:03:11.850> like<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.150> user<00:03:12.360> Brown<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.930> but<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.709> is

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
see like the user Brown in it but it is

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.620 
see like the user Brown in it but it is
a<00:03:13.860> darker<00:03:14.459> number<00:03:14.730> too<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:14.940> I'm<00:03:15.239> just<00:03:15.390> going<00:03:15.600> to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
a darker number too so I'm just going to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.410 
a darker number too so I'm just going to
say<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.110> 1v<00:03:16.709> um<00:03:17.070> just<00:03:17.880> for<00:03:18.030> me<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.209> think

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
say this is a 1v um just for me I think

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.940 
say this is a 1v um just for me I think
this<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.720> more<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.140> one<00:03:19.410> because<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:19.860> is

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
this is more like a one because it is

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:30.010 
this is more like a one because it is
dark
