00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 Now I would like to show one more 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.309
 variant semi fangov he fit in somewhat 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.969
 slower 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.599
 rather than the previous ordinary semi funk but 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.289
 gives a very beautiful structure of the canvas 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.560
 otherwise this gum is also called corn. 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.340
 in order to tie the corn we 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.539
 in the same way we put on the front phantom 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:35.370
 single lever upper position and both 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.629
 Lever idle also set 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.829
 top position after knitting 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:46.289
 two rows we lower both levers 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:51.480
 idle and just knit 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:54.930
 two rows like this alternating mode 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.520
 idling with the formation of nakida and 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:06.320
 normal mating mode, we will connect with you 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:06.320
 maize mode nakida knit 2 rows and 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:15.240
 double crotch and second row with 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:22.729
 nakidom now I lower both levers 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:27.350
 idling and tying 2 is committed and 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:30.869
 you can clearly see two nakida which 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.990
 knit now at all with a needle 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.360
 front contour and whether they became from power 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.380
 by the way speaking lever 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.299
 nakida plays no role when 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.869
 you lowered down 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.759
 leverage the idle so you need 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.479
 will raise and lower 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:56.299
 it was treated idle and the lever 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:01.070
 naqida always remains up position 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:06.649
 here is the second row eraser and repeat 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.649
 idle up levers two kinds 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.400
 nakida 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:19.330
 idle down levers hardly 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:23.080
 This was the first option 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.610
 knitting weave corn at the same time 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.700
 on the back of the circuit we will just 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.299
 form a patterned beautiful side 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.019
 but if you do nâ€™t have any 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:41.170
 side will be facial tied on the back 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.720
 or on the front fan tour if for example 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.629
 you all product is completely connected 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.160
 maize maybe you will be more 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:55.200
 convenient second option I lower the lever 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:59.440
 nakida and i will need every two rows 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.280
 press both knock buttons and let them go 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.970
 that is, we have two rows of buttons pressed 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.180
 in two kinds I am using the button 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.540
 reset turn to knitting 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.810
 plastic but I recall that at the same time 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.269
 the patterned side we will have with you 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.269
 knit on the front fan tour
