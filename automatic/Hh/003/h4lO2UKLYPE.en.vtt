do too much research afterwards well I
mean<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.270> did<00:02:00.420> enough<00:02:00.659> research<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> realize

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
mean I did enough research to realize

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.289

what<00:02:01.469> I'd<00:02:01.710> done<00:02:01.890> wrong<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.430> particular<00:02:03.030> time

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
what I'd done wrong that particular time

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.130 
what I'd done wrong that particular time
but<00:02:04.110> there's<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.380> lot<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:04.950> wrong<00:02:06.140> most

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
but there's a lot that can go wrong most

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.460
