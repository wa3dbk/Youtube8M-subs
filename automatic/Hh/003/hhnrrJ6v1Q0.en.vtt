00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.590
 dynamo tv is presented to you by 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.830
 asti your partner for apple computer 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.270
 systems and development 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.369
 I think you saw that today 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.540
 more was in it we have more 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.270
 we wanted to make it clear 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.680
 win here no fool celebrity nix 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.910
 I think first half too little 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.560
 have a force of fore ahead 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.150
 Nevertheless, a lot of ball possession also come good 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.920
 in the rooms so full behind the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.360
 midfield but then we miss the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.220
 Flank is missing us the gate is 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.379
 us our crucial pass 213 hammer 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.050
 then forward by third more risk 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.780
 played I believe then really 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.220
 So we have had many good chances 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.650
 You can just say a lot more 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.180
 do not cleansed today 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.409
 but until the last second, too 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.159
 risk increases then tries the 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.010
 necessarily to win 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.049
 in the end a point with I think 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.940
 that we have some chances right now too 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:59.769
 have played in the second half in 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.080
 also top-class chances 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.659
 where we just graduate better 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.970
 and I think if we can do that 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.560
 improve the gt3 point home 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.940
 and of course that's bitter now 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.140
 a little stupid so we went 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.520
 really 90 minutes have a right 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.680
 Good game made in the opponent 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.750
 determined and exactly what we played 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.390
 have us in the second 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.350
 At half past time we had some good things 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.570
 but unfortunately was not rewarded today 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.070
 Of course it is a pity I say are 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.410
 now two gifted points and also 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.820
 to my great chance in the end yes me 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.440
 wants to take the ball out of the spin 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.090
 aptly ideal in the ball flies has 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.350
 Of course, far over the gate that was the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.840
 Five days either ended up in the long 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.730
 corner or engine unfortunately not rewarded 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.500
 been 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.090
 pity yes you have to, of course times 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.490
 the stuttgarter have the on the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.140
 very fast players on the outside and if he does 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.610
 because the open knife is running pretty well 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.680
 blind I believe we are so far already 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.180
 that you try to prevent it and that 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.420
 Nevertheless, we exercised pressure without 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.340
 that the senseless risk slow the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.810
 first half a good one actually 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.750
 pressing played the ball well 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.280
 to let 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.320
 maybe then really has the last one 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.850
 tick once again missed the last ball 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.020
 to a 10 attraction of my first 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.000
 half a bit shorthanded at the time 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.560
 200 degrees is much better in ours 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.970
 half time to be braver 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.580
 on the offensive we have that good too 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.170
 made some chances but how did 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.310
 unfortunately not used 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.840
 unfortunately not rewarded 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.220
 well the point is a point has completely 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.590
 simply that's who at the end of the year 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.630
 we will see what the individual 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.450
 points then under the line what then that 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.510
 means and now you can basically 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.860
 yes anyway, but say nothing due 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.470
 the gameplay whose just three 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.459
 Points in it have been simple and clear 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.640
 and clearly 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.830
 but well that happens and we have 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.330
 Defensive very well confessed think that 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.140
 is also of all honors for the guys 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.870
 the back there every case 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.880
 have dropped and therefore have 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.760
 since today not worked out so we go 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.230
 every game at the best possible but me 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.540
 think now we have two good opponents 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.180
 in front of the breast 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.070
 really important is to take points 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.330
 to leave and no points before 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.299
 everything before winter again and then 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.350
 we can in the spring 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.989
 everyone who knows the table knows how 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.519
 Fear if it is up there and we want 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.110
 now of course two home games two 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.970
 superspieler of course come opponents 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.440
 which are also in the top and there 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.610
 Of course we want to get points too 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.850
 collect the points at our home 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.850
 to keep
