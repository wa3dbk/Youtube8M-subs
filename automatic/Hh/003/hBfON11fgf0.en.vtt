00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
but um I'm shooting it like this now to

but um I'm shooting it like this now to
try<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.790> stop<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.750> my<00:01:18.869> thumb<00:01:19.110> he<00:01:19.350> rested

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
try and stop that but my thumb he rested

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.120 
try and stop that but my thumb he rested
here<00:01:20.390> trying<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.380> less<00:01:22.590> than<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> camp

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
here trying this is less than the camp

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.890 
here trying this is less than the camp
it<00:01:23.400> still<00:01:23.640> hurts<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.240> finger<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:24.780> his

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it still hurts this finger but his

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.310 
it still hurts this finger but his
fingers<00:01:25.259> fine<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:26.689> it's<00:01:27.689> how<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> reckon<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.170> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
fingers fine now it's how I reckon if I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.010 
fingers fine now it's how I reckon if I
just<00:01:28.530> move<00:01:28.799> these<00:01:29.009> down<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.780> moment

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
just move these down see if the moment

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.929 
just move these down see if the moment
it<00:01:31.200> quite<00:01:31.409> square<00:01:31.799> file<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.490> smooth<00:01:32.790> these

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it quite square file to smooth these

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.899 
it quite square file to smooth these
down<00:01:33.240> more<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.290> rounded<00:01:34.740> edge<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:35.610> hoping

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
down more of a rounded edge I'm hoping

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.960 
down more of a rounded edge I'm hoping
they'll<00:01:36.180> get<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> bit<00:01:36.570> down<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.439> hold<00:01:38.280> still<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
they'll get a bit down but hold still I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.179 
they'll get a bit down but hold still I
don't<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.900> hope<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.140> American<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:40.979> still

in<00:02:36.840> my<00:02:36.989> opinion<00:02:37.470> like<00:02:38.310> if<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.550> want<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.760> do<00:02:38.819> a

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
in my opinion like if you want to do a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.390 
in my opinion like if you want to do a
follow-up<00:02:39.209> shot<00:02:42.500> yes<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.680> makes<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.010> easy<00:02:44.160> to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
follow-up shot yes it makes it easy to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.789 
follow-up shot yes it makes it easy to
attach<00:02:44.519> them<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:45.180> I'll<00:02:45.390> show<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:45.600> mostly<00:02:45.930> do

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
attach them but I'll show you mostly do

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.030 
attach them but I'll show you mostly do
a<00:02:46.860> follow-up<00:02:47.489> shot<00:02:51.620> clipping<00:02:52.620> pull<00:02:52.799> it<00:02:52.860> back

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
a follow-up shot clipping pull it back

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.090 
a follow-up shot clipping pull it back
usually<00:02:54.000> will<00:02:54.319> unhook<00:02:55.319> from<00:02:55.380> here<00:02:55.830> when<00:02:56.010> you

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
usually will unhook from here when you

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.759 
usually will unhook from here when you
shoot<00:02:56.340> pull<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:56.970> back<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.410> comes<00:02:58.410> out<00:02:58.560> too

gaps like this not even half the size
gap<00:03:04.310> doesn't<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.900> bit<00:03:06.900> here<00:03:07.079> for<00:03:07.260> this

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
when the beans go in and your shoot you

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.920 
when the beans go in and your shoot you
can<00:03:19.350> do<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> follow-up<00:03:19.829> shot<00:03:20.250> shoot<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:21.630> will

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
can do a follow-up shot shoot this will

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.370 
can do a follow-up shot shoot this will
still<00:03:23.000> go<00:03:24.000> more<00:03:24.299> down<00:03:24.540> towards<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.230> bottom

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
still go more down towards the bottom

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.300 
still go more down towards the bottom
over<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.920> slit<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:27.060> when<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.510> pull<00:03:27.750> it

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
over the slit but when you pull it

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.000 
over the slit but when you pull it
because<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> slits<00:03:29.730> are<00:03:29.970> narrow<00:03:31.010> and

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
because the slits are narrow and

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.920 
because the slits are narrow and
actually<00:03:32.370> slides<00:03:33.000> over<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.359> slit<00:03:33.660> me<00:03:33.750> goes

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
actually slides over to slit me goes

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.190 
actually slides over to slit me goes
back<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.380> top<00:03:35.209> because<00:03:36.209> it's<00:03:36.510> about<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.989> one

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
back to the top because it's about a one

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.599 
back to the top because it's about a one
little<00:03:37.380> slip<00:03:37.680> words<00:03:37.980> in<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.190> one's<00:03:38.489> three

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
little slip words in this one's three

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.390 
little slip words in this one's three
millimeters<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:40.680> that's<00:03:40.859> what<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:41.280> about

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
millimeters so that's what I like about

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.250 
millimeters so that's what I like about
the<00:03:41.700> other<00:03:41.850> one<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.299> Polar<00:03:42.540> Bear<00:03:42.780> Swim<00:03:42.810> Shop

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
the other one the Polar Bear Swim Shop

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.099 
the other one the Polar Bear Swim Shop
against<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.190> one<00:03:44.430> either<00:03:44.670> just<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.660> widen<00:03:45.900> my

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
against this one either just to widen my

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.030 
against this one either just to widen my
opinion<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:48.810> could<00:03:48.989> attach<00:03:49.230> flat-band<00:03:49.739> see

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
opinion you could attach flat-band see

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.309 
opinion you could attach flat-band see
this<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.220> few<00:03:50.579> ways<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:51.030> reckon<00:03:51.359> I'll<00:03:51.930> be<00:03:51.989> putting

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
this a few ways I reckon I'll be putting

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.130 
this a few ways I reckon I'll be putting
it<00:03:52.440> through<00:03:52.590> here<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:54.480> then<00:03:54.630> touching<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.049> to

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
it through here and then touching it to

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.979 
it through here and then touching it to
here<00:03:55.380> just<00:03:55.769> tying<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.190> on<00:03:56.280> here<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.850> can<00:03:57.720> even

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
here just tying it on here I can even

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.720 
here just tying it on here I can even
maybe<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.350> bands<00:03:59.010> will<00:03:59.310> give<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.579> look

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
maybe the bands will give you a look

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.090 
maybe the bands will give you a look
maybe<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.269> little<00:04:00.450> bit<00:04:00.569> more<00:04:00.750> push

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
maybe a little bit more push

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.890 
maybe a little bit more push
