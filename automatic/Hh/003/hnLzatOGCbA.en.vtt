of<00:00:13.440> today's<00:00:13.500> video<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.519> be<00:00:14.730> why<00:00:15.089> I

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
of today's video is going to be why I

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.269 
of today's video is going to be why I
think<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.870> automatics<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.770> best<00:00:17.039> kind<00:00:17.220> of

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
think the automatics is the best kind of

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.490 
think the automatics is the best kind of
modern<00:00:17.520> combat<00:00:17.699> 3<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.840> start<00:00:19.140> off<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
modern combat 3 so start off with the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.590 
modern combat 3 so start off with the
iron<00:00:19.680> sights<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.369> iron<00:00:20.550> sights<00:00:20.910> are<00:00:21.090> equal<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
iron sights the iron sights are equal to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.349 
iron sights the iron sights are equal to
that<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> Bravo<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.740> ACM<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:24.150> gun

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
that of the Bravo and ACM this gun

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.300 
that of the Bravo and ACM this gun
should<00:00:24.570> be<00:00:24.630> used<00:00:24.900> as<00:00:25.140> an<00:00:25.350> assault<00:00:25.650> rifle<00:00:25.769> even

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
should be used as an assault rifle even

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.790 
should be used as an assault rifle even
though<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.119> rival<00:00:27.359> most<00:00:27.810> SMGs<00:00:28.140> at<00:00:28.590> close

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
though it can rival most SMGs at close

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.970 
though it can rival most SMGs at close
range<00:00:29.150> this<00:00:30.150> gun<00:00:30.359> also<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:31.080> spectacular<00:00:31.920> for

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
range this gun also is spectacular for

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.000 
range this gun also is spectacular for
longer<00:00:32.759> range<00:00:33.000> extended<00:00:33.750> gunfights<00:00:34.530> because

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
longer range extended gunfights because

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.910 
longer range extended gunfights because
of<00:00:35.190> its<00:00:35.370> incredible<00:00:35.550> magazine<00:00:36.270> size<00:00:36.920> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
of its incredible magazine size the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 
of its incredible magazine size the
bullet<00:00:38.219> count<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.610> only<00:00:38.850> rivaled<00:00:39.180> by<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
bullet count is only rivaled by the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080 
bullet count is only rivaled by the
shred<00:00:40.469> form<00:00:40.829> even<00:00:41.250> though<00:00:41.520> both<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.940> be

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
shred form even though both can be

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.389 
shred form even though both can be
considered<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.870> are<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.219> same<00:00:44.360> LMG<00:00:45.360> class

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
considered and are in the same LMG class

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.779 
considered and are in the same LMG class
this<00:00:47.399> gun<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:48.000> best<00:00:48.989> used<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:50.160> grip<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
this gun is best used with grip and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.680 
this gun is best used with grip and
extended<00:00:51.120> magazines

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
extended magazines

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.330 
extended magazines
extended<00:00:52.110> magazines<00:00:52.530> builds<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.039> an<00:00:53.160> already

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
extended magazines builds on an already

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
extended magazines builds on an already
strong<00:00:53.850> suit<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.480> gun<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.260> its

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
strong suit of this gun and that is its

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.209 
strong suit of this gun and that is its
magazine<00:00:55.920> size<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:57.629> grip<00:00:57.930> takes<00:00:58.620> away<00:00:58.859> almost

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
magazine size the grip takes away almost

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.910 
magazine size the grip takes away almost
all<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.180> recoil<00:01:00.629> even<00:01:01.440> though<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.770> isn't

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
all the recoil even though there isn't

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.990 
all the recoil even though there isn't
much<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.520> begin<00:01:02.640> with

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
much to begin with

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
much to begin with
therefore<00:01:03.750> using<00:01:03.960> grip<00:01:04.320> pretty<00:01:05.070> much

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
therefore using grip pretty much

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.160 
therefore using grip pretty much
eliminates<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.909> recoil<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:06.570> firing<00:01:07.080> this

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
eliminates all recoil when firing this

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.539 
eliminates all recoil when firing this
weapon<00:01:07.229> now<00:01:08.930> when<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.140> use<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.650> gun<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
weapon now when you use this gun the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
weapon now when you use this gun the
damage<00:01:12.150> rate<00:01:12.360> should<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.659> kept<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.020> mind<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
damage rate should be kept in mind the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.940 
damage rate should be kept in mind the
damage<00:01:13.830> rate<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.640> bit<00:01:15.360> slow<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.740> on

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
damage rate is a bit slow or is a bit on

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.130 
damage rate is a bit slow or is a bit on
the<00:01:17.250> lower<00:01:17.430> side<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.119> are<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.689> target

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the lower side but if you are on target

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
the lower side but if you are on target
you<00:01:19.350> should<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.740> no<00:01:19.920> problem<00:01:20.310> taking<00:01:20.520> people

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
you should have no problem taking people

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.450 
you should have no problem taking people
down<00:01:21.030> pretty<00:01:21.600> quickly<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.770> highly

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
down pretty quickly so I highly

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.670 
down pretty quickly so I highly
recommend<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.240> use<00:01:24.689> an<00:01:24.960> optic<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
recommend you not use an optic you

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.010 
recommend you not use an optic you
really<00:01:26.159> don't<00:01:26.340> need<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.509> flash<00:01:27.810> hider

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
really don't need it and the flash hider

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.200 
really don't need it and the flash hider
would<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.130> pretty<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.880> would<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
would be you know pretty it would be a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.700 
would be you know pretty it would be a
good<00:01:30.390> attachment<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> sent<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> magazine

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
good attachment but I sent a magazine

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.679 
good attachment but I sent a magazine
this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.040> much<00:01:32.189> better<00:01:32.400> as<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:33.180> gives<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.450> much

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
this is much better as it gives you much

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.210 
this is much better as it gives you much
more<00:01:33.720> ammunition<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.590> begin<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
more ammunition to begin with it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.010 
more ammunition to begin with it
increases<00:01:35.729> your<00:01:35.759> bullet<00:01:36.060> count<00:01:36.240> by<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.509> 20

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
increases your bullet count by like 20

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.800 
increases your bullet count by like 20
which<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.729> know<00:01:38.850> that's<00:01:39.270> really<00:01:39.509> really

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
which is you know that's really really

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
which is you know that's really really
good<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.439> did<00:01:41.220> call<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.759> nuke<00:01:41.970> here

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
good so I did call on this nuke here

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.620 
good so I did call on this nuke here

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
after I kill this guy mainly because I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.580 
after I kill this guy mainly because I
realized<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.810> there<00:01:46.140> was<00:01:46.229> only<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.439> couple

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
realized that there was only a couple
