I<00:00:11.809> finally<00:00:12.809> finish<00:00:13.169> my<00:00:13.200> model<00:00:13.769> spaceship

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
I finally finish my model spaceship

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.820 
I finally finish my model spaceship
let's<00:00:15.000> give<00:00:15.209> it<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.360> launch<00:00:15.629> first<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.619> have<00:00:16.740> to

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
let's give it a launch first I have to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.980 
let's give it a launch first I have to
figure<00:00:17.039> out<00:00:17.250> how<00:00:17.580> much<00:00:17.849> fuel<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.450> needs<00:00:18.480> for

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
figure out how much fuel it needs for

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.200 
figure out how much fuel it needs for
the<00:00:19.079> rocket<00:00:19.439> boosters<00:00:19.890> if<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.730> too<00:00:20.939> little

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
the rocket boosters if I have too little

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.600 
the rocket boosters if I have too little
it<00:00:21.599> won't<00:00:21.930> fly<00:00:22.169> and<00:00:22.470> if<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.919> have<00:00:23.070> too<00:00:23.310> much

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
it won't fly and if I have too much

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.729 
it won't fly and if I have too much
it'll<00:00:23.939> blow<00:00:24.270> up<00:00:24.480> we'll<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.560> try

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:25.739 
it'll blow up we'll have to try

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.179 
it'll blow up we'll have to try
different<00:00:26.130> amounts<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.849> what<00:00:27.150> works<00:00:27.480> I

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
different amounts to see what works I

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.189 
different amounts to see what works I
wonder<00:00:29.189> how<00:00:29.640> much<00:00:29.939> fuel<00:00:30.330> will<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> take<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
wonder how much fuel will it take to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.869 
wonder how much fuel will it take to
launch<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.830> rocket<00:00:34.220> let's<00:00:35.220> start<00:00:35.580> with<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
launch this rocket let's start with a

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.049 
launch this rocket let's start with a
small<00:00:36.030> booster<00:00:37.019> this<00:00:37.739> booster<00:00:38.250> needs<00:00:38.640> 10

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
small booster this booster needs 10

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.299 
small booster this booster needs 10
grams<00:00:39.449> of<00:00:39.659> fuel<00:00:40.019> well<00:00:40.559> that's<00:00:40.829> easy

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
grams of fuel well that's easy

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.700 
grams of fuel well that's easy
each<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.699> these<00:00:41.790> fuel<00:00:42.120> pieces<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.660> 1<00:00:43.050> gram<00:00:43.410> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
each of these fuel pieces is 1 gram I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.840 
each of these fuel pieces is 1 gram I
can<00:00:44.070> count<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.460> 10<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.270> add<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:45.690> pieces<00:00:45.949> 1<00:00:46.949> 2

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
can count to 10 as I add the pieces 1 2

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.040 
can count to 10 as I add the pieces 1 2
3<00:00:48.719> 4<00:00:49.620> 5<00:00:50.340> 6<00:00:51.000> 7<00:00:51.629> 8<00:00:52.020> 9<00:00:52.559> 10<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.850> booster<00:00:54.329> has<00:00:54.600> 10

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 this booster has 10

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 this booster has 10
pieces<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.649> fuel<00:00:55.890> come<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.370> let's<00:00:56.640> give<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
pieces of fuel come on let's give it a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:12.980 
pieces of fuel come on let's give it a
try<00:01:06.649> let's<00:01:07.649> try<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> bigger<00:01:08.460> booster<00:01:09.119> ok<00:01:11.990> so

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
try let's try a bigger booster ok so

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.040 
try let's try a bigger booster ok so
this<00:01:13.200> medium<00:01:13.740> booster<00:01:14.190> needs<00:01:14.550> 100<00:01:15.539> grams<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
this medium booster needs 100 grams of

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.580 
this medium booster needs 100 grams of
fuel<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.039> add<00:01:17.209> 100<00:01:18.209> pieces<00:01:18.720> that's<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.440> lot

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
fuel so we add 100 pieces that's a lot

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.040 
fuel so we add 100 pieces that's a lot
of<00:01:19.619> counting<00:01:20.160> well<00:01:20.789> let's<00:01:21.390> use<00:01:21.599> these<00:01:21.810> bigger

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
of counting well let's use these bigger

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.680 
of counting well let's use these bigger
fuel<00:01:22.410> pieces<00:01:22.770> they're<00:01:23.160> 10<00:01:23.459> grams<00:01:23.759> each<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.569> we

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
fuel pieces they're 10 grams each so we

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.380 
fuel pieces they're 10 grams each so we
have<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.959> count<00:01:25.170> by<00:01:25.349> tens<00:01:25.819> hmm<00:01:26.819> how<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.149> we

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
have to count by tens hmm how do we

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.770 
have to count by tens hmm how do we
count<00:01:27.720> by<00:01:27.840> 10<00:01:28.440> look<00:01:29.099> at<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.280> 10<00:01:29.580> gram<00:01:29.819> piece<00:01:30.209> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
count by 10 look at a 10 gram piece it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.859 
count by 10 look at a 10 gram piece it
can<00:01:30.989> be<00:01:31.110> thought<00:01:31.289> of<00:01:31.349> as<00:01:31.679> 10<00:01:32.220> tiny<00:01:32.849> one<00:01:33.569> gram

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
can be thought of as 10 tiny one gram

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.010 
can be thought of as 10 tiny one gram
pieces<00:01:34.319> stuck<00:01:34.950> together<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:36.330> count<00:01:36.569> by<00:01:36.690> tens

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
pieces stuck together to count by tens

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.290 
pieces stuck together to count by tens
you<00:01:37.770> are<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.310> adding<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> pieces

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
you are really just adding the pieces

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.559 
you are really just adding the pieces
together<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.679> right<00:01:40.920> now<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.489> have<00:01:41.670> zero<00:01:42.239> grams

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
together so right now we have zero grams

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.130 
together so right now we have zero grams
of<00:01:42.869> fuel<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.190> we<00:01:44.580> add<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.910> one<00:01:45.300> piece<00:01:45.599> we

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
of fuel but if we add this one piece we

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.589 
of fuel but if we add this one piece we
have<00:01:46.319> 10<00:01:46.679> grams<00:01:47.039> and<00:01:47.369> if<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.149> had<00:01:48.270> another

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
have 10 grams and if we had another

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.589 
have 10 grams and if we had another
brick<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:49.380> will<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.679> 210<00:01:50.369> gram<00:01:50.640> pieces<00:01:51.060> which

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
brick we will have 210 gram pieces which

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:53.210 
brick we will have 210 gram pieces which
equals<00:01:52.080> 20<00:01:52.619> grams

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
equals 20 grams

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.729 
equals 20 grams
oh<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.550> get<00:01:53.940> it<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.690> count<00:01:54.899> by<00:01:55.170> 10<00:01:55.500> because

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:55.739 
oh I get it you can count by 10 because

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:58.639 
oh I get it you can count by 10 because
each<00:01:56.129> piece<00:01:56.550> contains<00:01:57.119> 10<00:01:57.539> grams<00:01:57.569> you<00:01:58.379> just

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
each piece contains 10 grams you just

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.150 
each piece contains 10 grams you just
add<00:01:58.830> 10<00:01:59.450> exactly<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.289> add<00:02:01.500> another<00:02:01.530> brick

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
add 10 exactly so if I add another brick

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.180 
add 10 exactly so if I add another brick
I'd<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.789> 3<00:02:03.119> bricks<00:02:03.390> which<00:02:03.929> is<00:02:04.110> 10<00:02:04.440> plus<00:02:04.649> 10

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
I'd have 3 bricks which is 10 plus 10

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.690 
I'd have 3 bricks which is 10 plus 10
plus<00:02:05.399> 10<00:02:05.879> which<00:02:06.330> equals<00:02:06.929> 30<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> let's<00:02:08.520> keep

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
plus 10 which equals 30 so let's keep

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.449 
plus 10 which equals 30 so let's keep
adding<00:02:08.940> until<00:02:09.569> we<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.840> 100<00:02:10.590> grams<00:02:10.619> four

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
adding until we have 100 grams four

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.069 
adding until we have 100 grams four
bricks<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.940> 40<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.959> five<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.800> 50<00:02:14.840> 60<00:02:15.860> 70<00:02:16.860> 80<00:02:17.099> 90

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
bricks is 40 then five is 50 60 70 80 90

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.880 
bricks is 40 then five is 50 60 70 80 90
100<00:02:19.189> 10<00:02:20.189> bricks<00:02:20.519> is<00:02:20.719> 100<00:02:21.719> grams<00:02:21.959> great<00:02:22.590> work

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
100 10 bricks is 100 grams great work

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.630 
100 10 bricks is 100 grams great work
let's

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
let's

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:33.430 
let's
the<00:02:23.850> rocket<00:02:28.010> okay<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:29.400> we<00:02:29.580> go

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.340 

we<00:02:34.440> hope<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.860> fail<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:36.390> rocket<00:02:36.870> does<00:02:37.140> look

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
we hope you fail that rocket does look

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:50.330 
we hope you fail that rocket does look
pretty<00:02:37.530> cool<00:02:37.680> though

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
can I count by hundreds just like we

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.580 
can I count by hundreds just like we
counted<00:03:11.980> by<00:03:12.100> tens<00:03:12.600> exactly<00:03:13.600> we<00:03:14.260> can<00:03:14.380> think

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
counted by tens exactly we can think

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.040

about<00:03:14.680> these<00:03:14.920> 100<00:03:15.670> gram<00:03:15.880> pieces<00:03:16.330> as<00:03:16.540> being

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
about these 100 gram pieces as being

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.320 
about these 100 gram pieces as being
made<00:03:17.260> up<00:03:17.380> of<00:03:17.440> 10<00:03:17.800> 10<00:03:18.520> gram<00:03:18.850> pieces<00:03:19.270> or<00:03:20.610> 100<00:03:21.610> 1

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
made up of 10 10 gram pieces or 100 1

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.790 
made up of 10 10 gram pieces or 100 1
gram<00:03:22.630> pieces<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.970> if<00:03:25.120> one<00:03:25.390> brick<00:03:25.810> equals<00:03:26.260> 100

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
gram pieces so if one brick equals 100

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.970 
gram pieces so if one brick equals 100
grams<00:03:27.010> then<00:03:27.610> 2<00:03:27.910> bricks<00:03:28.210> will<00:03:28.510> equal<00:03:28.840> 200<00:03:29.440> grams

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
grams then 2 bricks will equal 200 grams

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.380 
grams then 2 bricks will equal 200 grams
