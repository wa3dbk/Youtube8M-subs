the<00:00:10.260> first<00:00:10.500> thing<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.889> want<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.160> go<00:00:11.309> over<00:00:11.610> is

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
the first thing I want to go over is

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.160 
the first thing I want to go over is
white<00:00:13.590> chalk<00:00:13.860> paint<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.420> nice<00:00:15.420> lunch<00:00:15.690> off<00:00:15.870> paint

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
white chalk paint a nice lunch off paint

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.540 
white chalk paint a nice lunch off paint
to<00:00:16.289> be<00:00:16.379> specific<00:00:17.570> chalk<00:00:18.570> paint<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.710> porous

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
to be specific chalk paint is a porous

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.660 
to be specific chalk paint is a porous
paint<00:00:21.270> which<00:00:21.900> means<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.710> breathable<00:00:23.100> which

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
paint which means it is breathable which

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.960 
paint which means it is breathable which
makes<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.090> ideal<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.600> paint<00:00:24.930> wood<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.340> fabric

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
makes it ideal to paint wood and fabric

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.750 
makes it ideal to paint wood and fabric
because<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.869> fabric<00:00:28.349> specifically<00:00:29.220> needs

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
because this fabric specifically needs

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.429 
because this fabric specifically needs
to<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.119> some<00:00:30.300> breathability<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:31.109> order<00:00:31.320> for

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
to have some breathability in order for

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.740 
to have some breathability in order for
it<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:31.650> feel<00:00:32.040> super<00:00:32.430> crunchy<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.450> that's

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
it to not feel super crunchy so that's

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.620 
it to not feel super crunchy so that's
why<00:00:33.930> I'm<00:00:34.140> using<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.649> nice<00:00:34.829> lunch<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.190> paint<00:00:35.630> the

have much of a pattern or if they do
really<00:00:56.280> subtle<00:00:56.850> pattern<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.719> best<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.379> they

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
really subtle pattern it's best if they

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.590 
really subtle pattern it's best if they
don't<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.489> a<00:01:00.170> raised<00:01:01.430> type<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.760> texture

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.399 
don't have a raised type of a texture
like<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> pattern<00:01:05.220> texture<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.110> then<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
like like a pattern texture and then and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.469 
like like a pattern texture and then and
this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.890> because<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.210> finished

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
this is because like the finished

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.990 
this is because like the finished
product<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.049> looks<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.710> feels<00:01:11.010> smoother

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
product just looks and feels smoother

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.670 
product just looks and feels smoother
and<00:01:12.210> better<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.659> lot<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.080> people<00:01:13.380> I've<00:01:13.470> heard

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and better a lot of people I've heard

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010 
and better a lot of people I've heard
say<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.130> feels<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.580> leather<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.180> think<00:01:15.930> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
say it feels like leather I think it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990 
say it feels like leather I think it
kind<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.200> feels<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.470> outdoor<00:01:16.950> fabric<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
kind of feels like outdoor fabric but it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.179 
kind of feels like outdoor fabric but it
gets<00:01:18.119> softer<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.750> time<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.470> that's<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.040> nice

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
gets softer with time so that's a nice

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.890 
gets softer with time so that's a nice
thing<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.729> doesn't<00:01:21.030> transfer<00:01:21.270> onto

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
thing and it doesn't transfer onto

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.370 
thing and it doesn't transfer onto
clothing<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.310> that's<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.850> great<00:01:24.540> aspect<00:01:25.170> as

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
clothing so that's a great aspect as

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.010 
clothing so that's a great aspect as
well<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:26.850> I'm<00:01:26.939> already<00:01:27.150> got

gonna start I would say with about a 1

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.219 
gonna start I would say with about a 1
to<00:02:02.350> 1<00:02:02.409> ratio<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:03.250> water<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:04.090> chalk<00:02:04.869> paint<00:02:05.079> for

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
to 1 ratio of water and chalk paint for

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.430 
to 1 ratio of water and chalk paint for
the<00:02:05.289> first<00:02:05.530> coat<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:07.360> just<00:02:08.019> pour<00:02:08.289> it<00:02:08.380> in

here add a little bit of water stir it

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.650 
here add a little bit of water stir it
up<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:12.069> consistency<00:02:12.640> is<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.239> pretty

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
up and the consistency is is pretty

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.630 
up and the consistency is is pretty
drippy<00:02:14.049> as<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.650> see<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:17.310> first<00:02:18.310> things

started but I'll show you how it works

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.030 
started but I'll show you how it works
you<00:02:22.690> just<00:02:23.250> moisten<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.610> fabric<00:02:26.040> wherever

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
you just moisten the fabric wherever

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.970 
you just moisten the fabric wherever
you're<00:02:27.160> gonna<00:02:27.280> paint<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.970> that<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.980> these

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
you're gonna paint like that and these

you're gonna paint like that and these
squirt<00:02:33.250> bottles<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.819> found<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.090> Walmart<00:02:34.540> for

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
squirt bottles I found a Walmart for

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.910 
squirt bottles I found a Walmart for
like<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> couple<00:02:35.170> bucks<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:35.590> they're<00:02:35.769> really

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
like a couple bucks so they're really

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.420 
like a couple bucks so they're really
affordable<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:37.110> you'd<00:02:38.110> rip<00:02:38.379> off<00:02:38.560> any<00:02:38.799> excess

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
affordable and you'd rip off any excess

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.720 
affordable and you'd rip off any excess
and<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.840> just<00:02:41.019> start<00:02:41.290> painting<00:02:41.700> because<00:02:42.700> it's

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
and you just start painting because it's

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.099 
and you just start painting because it's
diluted<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:44.139> much<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.819> paint<00:02:46.090> does<00:02:46.299> go

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
diluted so much the paint does go

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.340 
diluted so much the paint does go
further<00:02:47.410> than<00:02:47.769> you'd<00:02:48.040> think<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:48.730> would<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.350> it

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
further than you'd think it would and it

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.309 
further than you'd think it would and it
soaks<00:02:50.769> in<00:02:51.069> better<00:02:51.940> because<00:02:52.540> it's<00:02:52.840> watered

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
soaks in better because it's watered

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.349 
soaks in better because it's watered
down<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.799> you've<00:02:54.250> already<00:02:54.519> pre<00:02:54.880> moisten<00:02:55.269> the

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
down and you've already pre moisten the

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:02.220 
down and you've already pre moisten the
fabric<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:58.230> paint<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.620> paint<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.959> do

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
fabric so you paint and paint and you do

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.759 
fabric so you paint and paint and you do
I<00:03:02.260> would<00:03:02.530> say<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:02.829> do<00:03:03.160> three<00:03:04.090> total<00:03:04.420> coats<00:03:04.769> but

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
I would say you do three total coats but

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.220 
I would say you do three total coats but
you<00:03:06.370> made<00:03:06.579> you<00:03:06.730> less<00:03:06.880> may<00:03:07.150> only<00:03:07.329> do<00:03:07.540> two<00:03:07.930> coats

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
you made you less may only do two coats

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.280 
you made you less may only do two coats
depending<00:03:08.889> on<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:10.329> original<00:03:10.750> starting<00:03:11.049> color

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
depending on the original starting color

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.199 
depending on the original starting color
and<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.859> color<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:12.370> choose<00:03:12.670> lighter

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
and the color that you choose lighter

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.750 
and the color that you choose lighter
paint<00:03:14.019> colors<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.859> you<00:03:14.980> go<00:03:15.310> over<00:03:15.430> with

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
paint colors that you go over with

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.370 
paint colors that you go over with
darker<00:03:16.120> fabric<00:03:16.480> is<00:03:16.599> going<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.780> require<00:03:17.109> more

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
darker fabric is going to require more

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.800 
darker fabric is going to require more
coats<00:03:19.829> this<00:03:20.829> I<00:03:21.190> would<00:03:21.639> say<00:03:21.880> maybe<00:03:22.090> two<00:03:22.450> coats

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
coats this I would say maybe two coats

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.539 
coats this I would say maybe two coats
with<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.290> little<00:03:23.560> touch-up<00:03:23.769> here<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.340> there

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
with a little touch-up here and there

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.220 
with a little touch-up here and there
because<00:03:25.060> it's<00:03:25.239> already<00:03:25.510> dark<00:03:25.660> fabric<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.169> I'm

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
because it's already dark fabric and I'm

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.039 
because it's already dark fabric and I'm
painting<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.709> dark<00:03:26.889> color<00:03:27.130> oh<00:03:27.630> one<00:03:28.630> that's<00:03:28.930> a

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
the wood but then I

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.950 
the wood but then I
that<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.560> can<00:03:32.710> just<00:03:32.740> wipe<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.160> up<00:03:33.960> really

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
that you can just wipe it up really

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.630 
that you can just wipe it up really
easily<00:03:35.140> if<00:03:35.710> you<00:03:35.830> get<00:03:35.950> paint<00:03:36.160> on<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.490> wood

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
easily if you get paint on the wood

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.690 
easily if you get paint on the wood
while<00:03:37.360> you're<00:03:38.160> all<00:03:39.160> you're<00:03:39.340> painting<00:03:39.610> around

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
while you're all you're painting around

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.860 
while you're all you're painting around
the<00:03:39.850> edges<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.120> don't<00:03:40.240> have<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.450> tape<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.750> off

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
the edges you don't have to tape it off

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.400 
the edges you don't have to tape it off
just<00:03:41.230> just<00:03:42.220> get<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.520> little<00:03:42.760> bit<00:03:42.880> wet<00:03:43.090> and

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
just just get it a little bit wet and

then just wipe it off in it and it

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.660 
then just wipe it off in it and it
cleans<00:03:45.850> up<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.240> easily<00:03:46.740> so<00:03:47.740> that<00:03:48.310> is

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
cleans up really easily so that is

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.280 
cleans up really easily so that is
painting<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:49.300> fabric<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.750> after<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.140> first

second coat on velvet material just just
soften<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.720> fabric<00:04:08.020> cuz<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.260> does<00:04:08.410> feel<00:04:08.650> a

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
soften the fabric cuz it does feel a

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.050

little<00:04:08.950> bit<00:04:09.040> stiff<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.520> then<00:04:09.640> once<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:09.940> do

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
little bit stiff and then once you do

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.210 
little bit stiff and then once you do
that<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.420> softens<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:11.050> lot<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.410> then<00:04:11.830> you<00:04:11.860> can

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
areas that looks like it got a little

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.230 
areas that looks like it got a little
bit<00:04:34.960> of<00:04:35.080> uncommon<00:04:35.980> coverage<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:37.090> you'll

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
bit of uncommon coverage and you'll

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.090 
bit of uncommon coverage and you'll
notice<00:04:37.600> you<00:04:38.110> can<00:04:38.140> see<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.440> little<00:04:38.650> bit<00:04:38.830> almost

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
look splotchy in some areas just because

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.110 
look splotchy in some areas just because
it's<00:04:40.840> still<00:04:41.050> wet<00:04:41.260> so<00:04:41.950> it<00:04:42.700> doesn't<00:04:42.970> stay<00:04:43.090> that

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
it's still wet so it doesn't stay that

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.360 
it's still wet so it doesn't stay that
way<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:43.660> then<00:04:44.020> when<00:04:44.229> you<00:04:44.500> sand<00:04:44.890> it<00:04:44.979> before<00:04:45.250> you

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
way and then when you sand it before you

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.969 
way and then when you sand it before you
wax<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:45.820> it'll<00:04:46.180> look<00:04:46.390> a<00:04:46.540> little<00:04:46.810> a<00:04:47.080> little<00:04:47.890> bit

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979

I like to steal painted fabric with
clear<00:06:17.570> wax<00:06:18.190> because<00:06:19.190> it<00:06:19.310> kind<00:06:19.430> of<00:06:19.490> gives<00:06:19.670> it<00:06:19.820> a

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
with a little bit and then you just rub

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.620 
with a little bit and then you just rub
it<00:06:36.230> in<00:06:36.380> and<00:06:36.830> this<00:06:37.040> is<00:06:37.250> also<00:06:37.490> what<00:06:37.880> is<00:06:38.360> gonna

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
it in and this is also what is gonna

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.130 
it in and this is also what is gonna
make<00:06:38.870> the<00:06:39.740> material<00:06:40.400> soften<00:06:41.000> over<00:06:41.270> time<00:06:41.510> is

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
make the material soften over time is

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.510 
make the material soften over time is
the<00:06:42.200> clear<00:06:42.680> wax<00:06:42.860> and<00:06:43.400> do<00:06:44.210> not<00:06:44.390> fret<00:06:44.780> the<00:06:45.050> West

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
the clear wax and do not fret the West

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.820 
the clear wax and do not fret the West
dries<00:06:46.520> completely<00:06:47.000> and<00:06:47.630> will<00:06:48.080> not<00:06:48.320> rub<00:06:48.620> off<00:06:48.800> on

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.380 
dries completely and will not rub off on
you<00:06:49.250> so<00:06:49.790> you<00:06:50.750> don't<00:06:50.930> have<00:06:51.080> to<00:06:51.260> worry<00:06:52.060> so<00:06:53.060> it

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
you so you don't have to worry so it

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.720 
you so you don't have to worry so it
still<00:06:54.110> feels<00:06:54.380> completely<00:06:54.860> doesn't<00:06:55.040> feel<00:06:55.250> waxy

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.730 
still feels completely doesn't feel waxy

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.540 
still feels completely doesn't feel waxy
stuff<00:06:56.450> is<00:06:56.600> completely<00:06:57.110> soft<00:06:57.410> but<00:06:58.190> we<00:06:58.340> just

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
stuff is completely soft but we just

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.030 
stuff is completely soft but we just
really<00:06:58.820> just<00:06:59.060> sealed<00:06:59.480> in<00:07:00.020> it<00:07:00.830> we<00:07:00.920> basically

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.040 
really just sealed in it we basically

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.030 
really just sealed in it we basically
just<00:07:01.400> dyed<00:07:01.790> the<00:07:02.030> fabric<00:07:02.480> and<00:07:02.770> you're<00:07:03.770> sealing

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040 
just dyed the fabric and you're sealing

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.430 
just dyed the fabric and you're sealing
it<00:07:04.280> in<00:07:04.370> with<00:07:04.610> the<00:07:04.730> wax<00:07:05.710> you<00:07:06.710> can<00:07:07.360> expect<00:07:08.360> to<00:07:09.290> go

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 
it in with the wax you can expect to go

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.800 
it in with the wax you can expect to go
through<00:07:10.090> maybe<00:07:11.090> a<00:07:11.240> whole<00:07:11.540> can

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
through maybe a whole can

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.070 
through maybe a whole can
of<00:07:12.900> clear<00:07:13.830> wax<00:07:14.130> on<00:07:15.090> this<00:07:15.389> entire<00:07:15.720> thing

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 
of clear wax on this entire thing

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.220 
of clear wax on this entire thing
because<00:07:16.620> fabric<00:07:17.280> absorbs<00:07:17.970> wax<00:07:18.330> more<00:07:18.870> and

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:19.230 
because fabric absorbs wax more and

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.170 
because fabric absorbs wax more and
there's<00:07:20.160> not<00:07:20.310> really<00:07:20.610> we're<00:07:20.820> not<00:07:20.940> going<00:07:21.150> to

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 
there's not really we're not going to

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.460 
there's not really we're not going to
dilute<00:07:21.540> it<00:07:22.340> that<00:07:23.340> is<00:07:23.460> basically<00:07:23.850> how<00:07:23.970> you<00:07:24.470> wax

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.470 
dilute it that is basically how you wax

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.570 
dilute it that is basically how you wax
this<00:07:26.090> and<00:07:27.090> you'll<00:07:27.300> see<00:07:27.720> areas<00:07:28.470> that<00:07:29.370> are

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 
this and you'll see areas that are

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.820 
this and you'll see areas that are
lighter<00:07:29.880> than<00:07:30.240> than<00:07:30.960> others<00:07:31.320> and<00:07:31.530> then<00:07:31.650> you'll

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:31.830 
lighter than than others and then you'll

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.470 
lighter than than others and then you'll
you'll<00:07:32.220> know<00:07:32.490> where<00:07:32.730> you<00:07:32.850> need<00:07:32.970> to<00:07:33.120> add<00:07:33.240> in

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.480 
you'll know where you need to add in
