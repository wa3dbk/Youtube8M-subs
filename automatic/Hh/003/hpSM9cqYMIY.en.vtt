00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.470 
today based on the size of the pot
generally<00:02:40.190> I'd<00:02:40.310> use<00:02:40.460> a<00:02:40.490> smaller<00:02:40.880> pot<00:02:41.210> if<00:02:41.360> it

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
generally I'd use a smaller pot if it

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.360 
generally I'd use a smaller pot if it
was<00:02:41.570> just<00:02:41.750> myself<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.380> then<00:02:42.740> I'd<00:02:42.890> probably<00:02:43.100> be

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
was just myself and then I'd probably be

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.630 
was just myself and then I'd probably be
using<00:02:43.550> about<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.910> teaspoon<00:02:44.950> our<00:02:45.950> next<00:02:46.220> step<00:02:46.430> is

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
using about a teaspoon our next step is

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:56.410 
using about a teaspoon our next step is
to<00:02:48.430> rinse<00:02:49.430> our<00:02:49.700> tea<00:02:54.880> vintage<00:02:55.880> tea<00:02:56.090> I'm<00:02:56.240> always

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
to rinse our tea vintage tea I'm always

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.040 
to rinse our tea vintage tea I'm always
very<00:02:56.720> quick<00:02:56.990> to<00:02:57.200> perform<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.650> rinse<00:02:58.060> as<00:02:59.060> we

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
very quick to perform the rinse as we

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:09.430 
very quick to perform the rinse as we
don't<00:03:00.140> want<00:03:00.260> wasting<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.900> rinse<00:03:09.080> can<00:03:09.290> be

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
don't want wasting and the rinse can be

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.430 
don't want wasting and the rinse can be
used<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.860> help<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.520> raise<00:03:10.730> your<00:03:11.000> teapot

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
used to help to raise your teapot

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.250 
used to help to raise your teapot
pouring<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.560> over<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:14.420> teapot<00:03:14.780> will<00:03:14.960> help<00:03:15.140> to

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
pouring it over the teapot will help to

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.980 
pouring it over the teapot will help to
improve<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.650> patina<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.430> over<00:03:16.790> time<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.780> pot

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
improve the patina and over time the pot

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.270 
improve the patina and over time the pot
will<00:03:18.170> develop<00:03:18.500> nice<00:03:18.770> shiny<00:03:19.190> luster<00:03:19.960> and<00:03:21.280> it

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
will develop nice shiny luster and it

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.190 
will develop nice shiny luster and it
also<00:03:22.460> improves<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.060> function<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.690> of<00:03:23.930> the
