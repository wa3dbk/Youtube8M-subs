better navigate around obstacles I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.220 
better navigate around obstacles I
started<00:00:29.279> by<00:00:29.429> using<00:00:29.640> an<00:00:29.880> open<00:00:30.119> source<00:00:30.359> library

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
started by using an open source library

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.500 
started by using an open source library
called<00:00:31.560> recast<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.610> automatically<00:00:33.149> create<00:00:33.480> a

where characters can and can't walk I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.010 
where characters can and can't walk I
then<00:00:41.129> use<00:00:41.280> its<00:00:41.489> companion<00:00:42.000> library<00:00:42.420> called

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
then use its companion library called

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.350 
then use its companion library called
detour<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.920> find<00:00:44.160> paths<00:00:44.430> from<00:00:44.910> point<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.270> point

on<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> navigation<00:00:46.260> mesh<00:00:46.620> there's<00:00:47.489> still<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
on the navigation mesh there's still a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.279 
on the navigation mesh there's still a
lot<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> path<00:00:48.239> finding<00:00:48.600> problems<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.140> solve

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
lot of path finding problems to solve

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.490 
lot of path finding problems to solve
but<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> significant<00:00:50.910> step<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.500> related

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
but this is a significant step a related

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.709 
but this is a significant step a related
problem<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.280> jump<00:00:53.670> prediction<00:00:54.149> which<00:00:54.600> is

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
problem is jump prediction which is

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.660 
problem is jump prediction which is
figuring<00:00:55.110> out<00:00:55.260> where<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> jump<00:00:55.800> will<00:00:55.949> end<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
figuring out where a jump will end if it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.000 
figuring out where a jump will end if it
starts<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> certain<00:00:57.510> velocity<00:00:58.010> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
starts with a certain velocity the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.590 
starts with a certain velocity the
prediction<00:00:59.489> starts<00:00:59.820> by<00:01:00.000> creating<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> path

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
prediction starts by creating a path

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689 
prediction starts by creating a path
using<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.170> ballistic<00:01:01.590> trajectory<00:01:02.190> equations

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
using the ballistic trajectory equations

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.329 
using the ballistic trajectory equations
and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:02.969> using<00:01:03.690> swept<00:01:03.989> spherical<00:01:04.710> asians<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and then using swept spherical asians to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.830 
and then using swept spherical asians to
see<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> path<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.210> collide<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
see if the path will collide with the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.170 
see if the path will collide with the
environment<00:01:07.280> next<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.369> worked<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.729> inverse

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180

prediction<00:01:09.750> which<00:01:10.439> starts<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.130> target

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
prediction which starts with the target

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.399 
prediction which starts with the target
point<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.939> then<00:01:12.150> calculates<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.049> initial

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
point and then calculates the initial

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.990 
point and then calculates the initial
velocity<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> character<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.549> need<00:01:14.729> in

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
velocity the character would need in

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.600 
velocity the character would need in
order<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.420> get<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.890> this<00:01:16.890> led<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
order to get there this led to this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.030 
order to get there this led to this

click no matter how far away that point

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.719 
click no matter how far away that point
might<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.710> finally<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.890> added<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> characters

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
might be finally I added the characters
