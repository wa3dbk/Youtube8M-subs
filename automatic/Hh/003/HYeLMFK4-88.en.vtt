another fold with the same size just
like<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:59.040> you're<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> do

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
like that then you're going to do

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.280 
like that then you're going to do
another<00:00:59.610> one<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.450> another<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:00.989> inch

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
another one we can do another one inch

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.749 
another one we can do another one inch
bubble<00:01:01.700> another<00:01:02.700> full<00:01:03.059> twist<00:01:04.220> like<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
bubble another full twist like that so

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.180 
bubble another full twist like that so
now<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:05.940> have<00:01:06.210> three<00:01:06.660> full<00:01:07.200> twists<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.920> one

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
now we have three full twists with one

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.520 
now we have three full twists with one
inch<00:01:08.340> bubbles<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.820> between<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.899> piece<00:01:10.200> here

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
inch bubbles in between this piece here

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.920 
inch bubbles in between this piece here
you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> actually<00:01:11.310> break<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.759> off<00:01:11.820> let<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
you can actually break that off let the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.910 
you can actually break that off let the
air<00:01:13.050> out<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.380> tie<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:15.020> right<00:01:16.020> inside<00:01:16.440> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
air out and tie that one right inside so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.430 
air out and tie that one right inside so
it<00:01:17.009> actually<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.369> tied<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> knot<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.440> so

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
it actually we tied a knot there so

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.350 
it actually we tied a knot there so
that's<00:01:19.649> tied<00:01:19.890> off<00:01:20.069> so<00:01:20.459> now<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.880> three

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
that's tied off so now we have three

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.109 
that's tied off so now we have three
full<00:01:21.810> twists<00:01:22.319> and<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.860> two<00:01:23.130> three<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.940> inch

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
full twists and one two three one inch

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090 
full twists and one two three one inch
bolt<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.319> next<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.679> you're<00:01:25.830> only<00:01:25.890> going

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
bolt for the next one you're only going

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.949 
bolt for the next one you're only going
to<00:01:26.160> do<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> series<00:01:26.550> of<00:01:26.640> two<00:01:27.000> you're<00:01:27.690> going<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> do

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:27.959 
to do a series of two you're going to do

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:29.839 
to do a series of two you're going to do
it<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.349> inch<00:01:28.500> bubble<00:01:28.860> you're<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.789> do

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:29.849 
it a one inch bubble you're going to do

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:32.719 
it a one inch bubble you're going to do
another<00:01:30.119> full<00:01:30.390> twist<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> same<00:01:31.170> size<00:01:31.729> spin

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
another full twist the same size spin

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.520 
another full twist the same size spin
that<00:01:32.910> around<00:01:32.970> you're<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.959> do<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.050> noon<00:01:34.349> or

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that around you're going to do a noon or

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.480 
that around you're going to do a noon or
one<00:01:34.860> inch<00:01:35.009> bubble

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
one inch bubble

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.449 
one inch bubble
another<00:01:36.179> full<00:01:36.509> twist<00:01:36.979> spin<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.220> one<00:01:38.369> around

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459 
another full twist spin that one around

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.070 
another full twist spin that one around
so<00:01:38.849> now<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> series<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.780> two

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
so now you just have a series of two

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.870 
so now you just have a series of two
with<00:01:40.319> this<00:01:40.470> long<00:01:40.679> extra<00:01:41.130> piece<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
with this long extra piece this is

first of all that you make like that
this<00:03:21.790> dangly<00:03:22.390> piece<00:03:22.600> here<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.989> want<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.200> wrap

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
this dangly piece here you want to wrap

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.800 
this dangly piece here you want to wrap
that<00:03:23.560> around<00:03:23.590> just<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.160> kind<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.430> hide<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.880> so

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
that around just to kind of hide it so

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.140 
that around just to kind of hide it so
you<00:03:25.870> want<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.110> wrap<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.500> around<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.820> it<00:03:27.940> kind

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
you want to wrap that around and it kind

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.490 
you want to wrap that around and it kind
of<00:03:28.180> just<00:03:28.330> hides<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.840> in<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.080> middle<00:03:29.320> so<00:03:29.410> you

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
of just hides that in the middle so you

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.530 
of just hides that in the middle so you
don't<00:03:29.680> see

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.300 

now<00:03:36.540> you've<00:03:36.870> actually<00:03:37.020> hit<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.770> nut<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.220> you

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
now you've actually hit the nut so you

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.650 
now you've actually hit the nut so you
can't<00:03:38.520> really<00:03:38.700> see<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:38.970> down<00:03:39.210> in<00:03:39.360> there<00:03:39.480> it

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
can't really see it down in there it

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.690 
can't really see it down in there it
actually<00:03:39.930> pulls<00:03:40.260> through<00:03:40.470> once<00:03:41.460> you<00:03:41.550> have

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
actually pulls through once you have

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.550 
actually pulls through once you have
that<00:03:41.850> that's<00:03:42.150> our<00:03:42.390> body<00:03:42.660> for<00:03:43.020> a<00:03:43.050> caterpillar

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
that that's our body for a caterpillar

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.820 
that that's our body for a caterpillar
for<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.370> eyes<00:03:44.520> you're<00:03:45.360> going<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.540> take<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.960> 260

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
for the eyes you're going to take a 260

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.950 
for the eyes you're going to take a 260
you're<00:03:47.370> going<00:03:47.490> to<00:03:47.580> blow<00:03:47.730> up<00:03:47.850> just<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.600> center

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
you're going to blow up just the center

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.170 
you're going to blow up just the center
of<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.200> balloon<00:03:49.410> tie<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:49.980> knot<00:03:50.280> off<00:03:50.460> and<00:03:50.940> at

of the balloon tie the knot off and at

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.550 
of the balloon tie the knot off and at
the<00:03:51.300> end<00:03:51.420> we'll<00:03:51.540> actually<00:03:51.690> snip<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.320> so<00:03:52.470> we

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
the end we'll actually snip that so we

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.170 
the end we'll actually snip that so we
don't<00:03:52.650> have<00:03:52.800> that<00:03:53.010> knot<00:03:53.220> there<00:03:53.490> because
