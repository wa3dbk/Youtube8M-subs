00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
today on my brand new lens very exciting

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.279 
today on my brand new lens very exciting
and<00:00:12.889> here<00:00:13.730> it<00:00:13.820> is<00:00:13.869> well<00:00:14.869> here's<00:00:15.049> the<00:00:15.110> box

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
and here it is well here's the box

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.579 
and here it is well here's the box
anyway<00:00:15.590> as<00:00:15.949> thenns<00:00:16.990> its<00:00:17.990> is<00:00:18.380> a<00:00:18.680> Nikon<00:00:19.660> zoom<00:00:20.660> 43

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:21.589 
anyway as thenns its is a Nikon zoom 43

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.050 
anyway as thenns its is a Nikon zoom 43
to<00:00:21.740> 86<00:00:22.279> mil<00:00:22.519> F<00:00:23.140> 3.5<00:00:24.640> constant<00:00:25.640> aperture<00:00:25.730> lens

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
to 86 mil F 3.5 constant aperture lens

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.540 
to 86 mil F 3.5 constant aperture lens
so<00:00:27.910> why<00:00:28.910> have<00:00:29.060> I<00:00:29.150> bought<00:00:29.329> that<00:00:29.480> um<00:00:30.380> two<00:00:31.220> reasons

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
so why have I bought that um two reasons

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.180 
so why have I bought that um two reasons
why<00:00:31.730> it<00:00:32.090> sort<00:00:32.540> of<00:00:32.660> fills<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:32.960> gap<00:00:33.110> between<00:00:33.350> my<00:00:33.800> 18

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
why it sort of fills a gap between my 18

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.040 
why it sort of fills a gap between my 18
17<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:34.820> 18<00:00:35.230> 18<00:00:36.230> to<00:00:36.380> 70<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:37.130> 80<00:00:37.580> to<00:00:38.060> 200<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:38.930> it

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
17 and 18 18 to 70 and 80 to 200 so it

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.270 
17 and 18 18 to 70 and 80 to 200 so it
feels<00:00:39.200> that<00:00:39.350> little<00:00:39.530> gap<00:00:39.650> in<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:39.800> middle<00:00:39.950> I

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
feels that little gap in the middle I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.430 
feels that little gap in the middle I
wanted<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.180> try<00:00:41.510> one<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.740> older<00:00:44.170> non<00:00:45.170> auto

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
wanted to try one of the older non auto

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.280 
wanted to try one of the older non auto
focusing<00:00:46.220> and<00:00:46.550> a<00:00:46.780> non<00:00:48.130> sort<00:00:49.130> of<00:00:49.570> CPU<00:00:50.570> lens<00:00:50.900> they

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
focusing and a non sort of CPU lens they

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.080 
focusing and a non sort of CPU lens they
call<00:00:51.440> it<00:00:51.560> a<00:00:51.590> non<00:00:51.800> CPU<00:00:52.250> noise<00:00:52.400> basically<00:00:52.820> what

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
call it a non CPU noise basically what

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.750 
call it a non CPU noise basically what
that<00:00:53.120> means<00:00:53.510> is<00:00:53.810> when<00:00:53.990> you<00:00:54.020> plug<00:00:54.380> a<00:00:54.680> newer<00:00:55.460> lens

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
that means is when you plug a newer lens

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.230 
that means is when you plug a newer lens
into<00:00:56.540> a<00:00:56.870> modern<00:00:57.650> Nikon<00:00:58.160> camera<00:00:58.610> the<00:00:59.000> camera

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
into a modern Nikon camera the camera

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.390 
into a modern Nikon camera the camera
recognizes<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.290> lens<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.800> lens<00:01:00.920> tells<00:01:01.310> the

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
recognizes the lens the lens tells the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.100 
recognizes the lens the lens tells the
camera<00:01:01.670> what<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.090> what<00:01:02.450> its<00:01:02.570> focal<00:01:02.930> length

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
camera what it is what its focal length

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.550 
camera what it is what its focal length
is<00:01:03.320> what<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:03.620> maximum<00:01:04.100> aperture<00:01:04.580> is<00:01:05.049> etc<00:01:06.049> all

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
is what it maximum aperture is etc all

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.889 
is what it maximum aperture is etc all
the<00:01:06.799> data<00:01:07.009> is<00:01:07.280> then<00:01:07.430> in<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:07.700> camera<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.270> that

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
the data is then in the camera and that

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.630 
the data is then in the camera and that
uses<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:09.439> for<00:01:09.710> auto<00:01:10.070> focusing<00:01:10.939> metering<00:01:11.719> etc

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
uses it for auto focusing metering etc

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.270 
uses it for auto focusing metering etc
so<00:01:13.640> on<00:01:13.820> these<00:01:14.499> older<00:01:15.499> lenses<00:01:15.619> whilst<00:01:16.100> the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
so on these older lenses whilst the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.880 
so on these older lenses whilst the
mount<00:01:16.520> fits<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.390> it<00:01:17.509> you<00:01:18.259> know<00:01:18.289> it<00:01:18.499> fits<00:01:18.679> onto

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
mount fits and it you know it fits onto

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.639 
mount fits and it you know it fits onto
the<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.759> camera<00:01:20.090> okay<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.990> doesn't<00:01:21.170> talk<00:01:21.439> to

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
the the camera okay it doesn't talk to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.200 
the the camera okay it doesn't talk to
the<00:01:21.679> camera<00:01:22.069> so<00:01:22.219> it<00:01:22.280> doesn't<00:01:22.520> tell<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:22.880> what<00:01:23.090> it

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
the camera so it doesn't tell it what it

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.090 
the camera so it doesn't tell it what it
is<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.630> camera<00:01:23.899> goes<00:01:24.140> on<00:01:24.380> I<00:01:24.590> don't<00:01:24.710> don't

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
is so the camera goes on I don't don't

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.179 
is so the camera goes on I don't don't
know<00:01:25.219> what<00:01:25.460> what<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.210> are<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.829> you<00:01:27.829> can<00:01:27.979> still

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
know what what you are and you can still

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.469 
know what what you are and you can still
use<00:01:28.429> in<00:01:28.640> menu<00:01:28.909> et<00:01:29.030> cetera

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
use in menu et cetera

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.870 
use in menu et cetera
but<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.109> nice<00:01:30.259> thing<00:01:30.289> about<00:01:30.499> the<00:01:30.740> Nikon<00:01:30.979> d7000

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
but the nice thing about the Nikon d7000

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.090 
but the nice thing about the Nikon d7000
is<00:01:32.299> that<00:01:32.749> you<00:01:32.840> can<00:01:33.020> tell<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:33.439> what<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.920> lens

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
is that you can tell it what the lens

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.139 
is that you can tell it what the lens
eats<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.939> a<00:01:34.969> certain<00:01:35.389> degree<00:01:36.249> now<00:01:37.249> it<00:01:37.880> works

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
eats to a certain degree now it works

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.929 
eats to a certain degree now it works
better<00:01:38.840> with<00:01:39.139> prime<00:01:39.409> lenses<00:01:39.950> because<00:01:40.700> it

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
better with prime lenses because it

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.399 
better with prime lenses because it
doesn't<00:01:41.179> really<00:01:41.270> account<00:01:41.630> for<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.139> zoom

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
doesn't really account for the zoom

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.010 
doesn't really account for the zoom
function<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:43.549> this<00:01:43.700> wouldn't<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.329> don't<00:01:44.840> think

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
function so this wouldn't I don't think

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.379 
function so this wouldn't I don't think
it'd<00:01:45.139> be<00:01:45.319> ideal<00:01:45.700> buying<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:47.030> say<00:01:47.929> a<00:01:47.959> 70<00:01:48.499> to<00:01:48.649> 200

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:49.389 
it'd be ideal buying a say a 70 to 200

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:52.599 
it'd be ideal buying a say a 70 to 200
old<00:01:50.389> lens<00:01:50.749> that<00:01:51.170> that<00:01:51.499> hasn't<00:01:51.740> got<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.249> the

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
old lens that that hasn't got the the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.069 
old lens that that hasn't got the the
function<00:01:52.969> to<00:01:53.090> talk<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.569> lens<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:53.990> you'll

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
function to talk to the lens and you'll

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.889 
function to talk to the lens and you'll
see<00:01:54.289> why<00:01:54.439> in<00:01:54.469> a<00:01:54.619> minute<00:01:54.939> so<00:01:55.939> firstly<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.689> lens

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
see why in a minute so firstly the lens

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.510 
see why in a minute so firstly the lens
it's<00:01:57.469> a<00:01:57.649> lovely<00:01:57.950> little<00:01:58.130> lens<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.459> the

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
it's a lovely little lens and the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.190 
it's a lovely little lens and the
benefit<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:58.880> these<00:01:59.060> older<00:01:59.509> lenses<00:01:59.659> is<00:02:00.020> that

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
benefit of these older lenses is that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.169 
benefit of these older lenses is that
that's<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.469> constant<00:02:00.859> aperture<00:02:01.009> of<00:02:01.189> 3.5<00:02:01.789> was

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
that's a constant aperture of 3.5 was

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.059 
that's a constant aperture of 3.5 was
you<00:02:02.539> know<00:02:02.630> not<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.959> modern<00:02:03.200> lenses<00:02:03.499> are<00:02:03.740> four

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
you know not the modern lenses are four

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.209 
you know not the modern lenses are four
to<00:02:04.399> five<00:02:04.999> foot<00:02:05.179> six<00:02:05.509> or<00:02:05.869> six<00:02:06.079> point<00:02:06.319> two<00:02:06.740> or

three point five to five point six some

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.250 
three point five to five point six some
of<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.009> slightly<00:02:10.310> better<00:02:10.520> ones<00:02:10.759> are<00:02:10.959> 3.5<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.230> 4

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
of the slightly better ones are 3.5 to 4

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.429 
of the slightly better ones are 3.5 to 4
point<00:02:12.769> 5<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.209> constant<00:02:14.599> aperture<00:02:14.720> 3.5

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
point 5 this is a constant aperture 3.5

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.770 
point 5 this is a constant aperture 3.5
so<00:02:15.739> anyone's<00:02:16.069> took<00:02:16.250> away<00:02:16.430> from

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
so anyone's took away from

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.210 
so anyone's took away from
2.8<00:02:17.530> lens<00:02:17.740> so<00:02:18.280> that's<00:02:18.460> what<00:02:18.700> drew<00:02:18.970> me<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.660> I

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
2.8 lens so that's what drew me to it I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.960 
2.8 lens so that's what drew me to it I
like<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.430> fact<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:21.880> the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
like the fact that it's the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.540 
like the fact that it's the
old-fashioned<00:02:22.630> push-pull<00:02:23.290> zoom<00:02:23.680> still<00:02:24.430> have

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
old-fashioned push-pull zoom still have

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.710 
old-fashioned push-pull zoom still have
much<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.940> zoom<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.240> know<00:02:25.360> it's<00:02:25.450> not<00:02:25.540> much<00:02:25.690> of

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
much of a zoom you know it's not much of

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.360 
much of a zoom you know it's not much of
a<00:02:25.930> range<00:02:26.110> 43<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.010> 86<00:02:28.080> but<00:02:29.080> for<00:02:29.890> what<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.040> want<00:02:30.280> it

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
a range 43 to 86 but for what I want it

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.270 
a range 43 to 86 but for what I want it
for<00:02:30.610> it's<00:02:30.850> um<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.450> nice<00:02:31.570> lens<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.860> focus

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
for it's um it's a nice lens the focus

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.690 
for it's um it's a nice lens the focus
in<00:02:33.490> is<00:02:34.260> lovely<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.380> smooth<00:02:35.680> but<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.100> miles

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
in is lovely and smooth but it's miles

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.000 
in is lovely and smooth but it's miles
round<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.480> have<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.750> sort<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.020> keep<00:02:38.680> going<00:02:38.740> all

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
round you have to sort of keep going all

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.530 
round you have to sort of keep going all
the<00:02:39.040> way<00:02:39.100> around<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.610> get<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.150> you're

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
the way around to get to it so you're

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.060 
the way around to get to it so you're
not<00:02:40.570> going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.840> be<00:02:40.900> using<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.440> in

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
not going to be using this in

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.650 
not going to be using this in
circumstances<00:02:43.000> where<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.209> need<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.450> focus

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
circumstances where you need to focus

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.140 
circumstances where you need to focus
quickly<00:02:43.990> because<00:02:44.530> with<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.459> modern<00:02:45.730> digital

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
quickly because with the modern digital

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.790 
quickly because with the modern digital
SLR<00:02:46.720> scene<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.230> can't<00:02:47.410> really<00:02:47.560> tell<00:02:47.770> if

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
SLR scene you can't really tell if

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.500 
SLR scene you can't really tell if
you're<00:02:48.010> focused<00:02:48.370> anyway<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.209> know<00:02:49.330> you're

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
you're focused anyway you know you're

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.380 
you're focused anyway you know you're
relying<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.380> cannot<00:02:51.370> see<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.790> focus<00:02:52.000> on<00:02:52.300> the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
relying on cannot see and focus on the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.970 
relying on cannot see and focus on the
screen<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:52.750> it's<00:02:52.900> not<00:02:53.020> completely<00:02:53.770> accurate

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
screen so it's not completely accurate

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.050 
screen so it's not completely accurate
anyway<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:56.350> it's<00:02:57.250> going<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.610> be<00:02:57.730> for<00:02:57.970> like

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
anyway so it's going to be for like

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.830 
anyway so it's going to be for like
portrait<00:02:58.600> work<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.550> maybe<00:03:00.550> some<00:03:01.150> landscape

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
staff and you know it's going to be for

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.680 
staff and you know it's going to be for
stationary<00:03:04.120> photography<00:03:04.780> basically<00:03:06.180> but<00:03:07.180> it

and<00:03:12.220> smooth<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:13.180> then<00:03:13.870> at<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.080> back<00:03:14.260> you've

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
and smooth and then at the back you've

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.680 
and smooth and then at the back you've
got<00:03:14.620> an<00:03:15.430> aperture<00:03:15.730> ring<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.209> which<00:03:16.360> you<00:03:16.630> have

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
got an aperture ring to which you have

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.020 
got an aperture ring to which you have
to<00:03:16.780> change<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.530> change<00:03:17.560> your<00:03:17.950> aperture<00:03:18.070> so

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
to change to change your aperture so

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.310 
to change to change your aperture so
it's<00:03:19.180> not<00:03:19.330> done<00:03:19.570> electronically

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
it's not done electronically

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.720 
it's not done electronically
so<00:03:21.870> what<00:03:22.870> I'll<00:03:22.989> quickly<00:03:23.380> do<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.739> just<00:03:24.040> I'll<00:03:24.459> go

bottom and it's like about three up from
the<00:03:39.640> bottom<00:03:39.820> there's<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.780> setting<00:03:41.200> called<00:03:41.230> none

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
the bottom there's a setting called none

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.020 
CPU lens data so you just click on that
and<00:03:45.640> you've<00:03:46.060> got<00:03:46.410> one<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.829> nine<00:03:48.280> lenses<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.000> I

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
and you've got one to nine lenses and I

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.780 
and you've got one to nine lenses and I
think<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.450> can<00:03:49.570> put<00:03:49.720> nine<00:03:49.870> different<00:03:50.790> it's

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
think so you can put nine different it's

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.020 
think so you can put nine different it's
a<00:03:51.940> data<00:03:52.180> on<00:03:52.420> here<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:54.100> I've<00:03:54.370> choose<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:54.880> if

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
a data on here so I've choose this if

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.490 
a data on here so I've choose this if
this<00:03:55.239> is<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.420> only<00:03:55.510> lens<00:03:55.780> I've<00:03:55.959> got<00:03:56.140> like<00:03:56.320> this

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
this is the only lens I've got like this

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.199 
this is the only lens I've got like this
at<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.709> moment<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:57.130> its<00:03:57.250> lens<00:03:57.430> number<00:03:57.700> one<00:03:57.910> and

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
at the moment so its lens number one and

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.479 
at the moment so its lens number one and
then<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.320> get<00:03:59.440> option<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.829> put<00:03:59.950> in<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.100> focal

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
then you get option to put in the focal

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.430 
then you get option to put in the focal
length<00:04:00.519> and<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.239> maximum<00:04:01.660> aperture<00:04:01.959> or

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
length and the maximum aperture or

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.020 
length and the maximum aperture or
maximum<00:04:02.739> aperture<00:04:03.010> that's<00:04:03.190> easy<00:04:03.489> that's<00:04:03.760> a

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
maximum aperture that's easy that's a

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.970 
maximum aperture that's easy that's a
3.5<00:04:05.310> obviously<00:04:06.310> maximum<00:04:07.030> means<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.980> the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
3.5 obviously maximum means the the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.729 
3.5 obviously maximum means the the
widest<00:04:09.400> aperture<00:04:09.549> so<00:04:10.120> smallest<00:04:10.570> number<00:04:10.959> this

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
widest aperture so smallest number this

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.970 
widest aperture so smallest number this
this<00:04:11.980> lens<00:04:12.220> is<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.519> s<00:04:12.970> 3.5<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:13.750> f-22<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:14.620> maximum

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
this lens is a s 3.5 to f-22 so maximum

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.880 
this lens is a s 3.5 to f-22 so maximum
aperture<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.640> 3.5<00:04:16.180> not<00:04:16.600> 22<00:04:17.200> I<00:04:17.440> know<00:04:17.829> you

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
aperture is a 3.5 not 22 I know you

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.920 
aperture is a 3.5 not 22 I know you
probably<00:04:18.130> know<00:04:18.340> that

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
probably know that

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.810 
probably know that
so<00:04:20.930> max<00:04:21.260> Murph<00:04:21.440> Jeff<00:04:21.650> 3.5<00:04:22.160> that's<00:04:22.370> in<00:04:22.520> there

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
so max Murph Jeff 3.5 that's in there

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.040 
so max Murph Jeff 3.5 that's in there
focal<00:04:23.540> length<00:04:23.750> now<00:04:24.610> you<00:04:25.610> cannot<00:04:26.000> put<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.540> summa

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
focal length now you cannot put a summa

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.320 
focal length now you cannot put a summa
focal<00:04:27.650> length<00:04:27.830> in<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.460> have<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.910> choose

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
focal length in so you have to choose

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.720 
focal length in so you have to choose
your<00:04:29.600> focal<00:04:30.050> length<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:30.620> if<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.430> look<00:04:31.550> in<00:04:31.670> the

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
your focal length and if you look in the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.100 
your focal length and if you look in the
instructions<00:04:32.180> what<00:04:32.390> actually<00:04:32.690> tells<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:32.990> to

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
instructions what actually tells you to

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.930 
instructions what actually tells you to
do<00:04:33.230> is<00:04:33.350> if<00:04:33.440> you've<00:04:33.590> got<00:04:33.620> like<00:04:33.860> this<00:04:34.010> is<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.160> 43<00:04:34.790> to

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
do is if you've got like this is a 43 to

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.130 
do is if you've got like this is a 43 to
86<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:36.620> would<00:04:36.770> put<00:04:36.980> in<00:04:37.300> perhaps<00:04:38.300> five

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
86 you would put in perhaps five

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.860 
86 you would put in perhaps five
different<00:04:39.580> settings<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:41.210> you'd<00:04:41.510> have<00:04:41.600> one<00:04:41.750> at

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
different settings and you'd have one at

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.860 
different settings and you'd have one at
43<00:04:42.230> one<00:04:42.380> at<00:04:42.470> 51<00:04:42.950> at<00:04:43.040> 61<00:04:43.550> or<00:04:43.580> seventy<00:04:44.030> one<00:04:44.210> at<00:04:44.300> 86

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
43 one at 51 at 61 or seventy one at 86

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.600 
43 one at 51 at 61 or seventy one at 86
and<00:04:45.140> then<00:04:45.230> when<00:04:45.740> you're<00:04:45.950> zoomed<00:04:46.370> into

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
and then when you're zoomed into

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.700 
and then when you're zoomed into
whichever<00:04:46.970> one<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:47.510> go<00:04:47.690> into<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.290> menu<00:04:48.680> and

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
whichever one you go into the menu and

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.050 
whichever one you go into the menu and
choose<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.370> one<00:04:49.490> you're<00:04:49.610> on<00:04:49.670> that

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
choose the one you're on that

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.600 
choose the one you're on that
realistically<00:04:50.600> who's<00:04:50.900> gonna<00:04:51.050> do<00:04:51.230> that<00:04:51.460> so<00:04:52.460> my

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
realistically who's gonna do that so my

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.230 
realistically who's gonna do that so my
idea<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:53.270> to<00:04:53.990> go<00:04:54.140> for<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.560> middle<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.240> the

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
idea is to go for the middle and the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.820 
idea is to go for the middle and the
closest<00:04:56.660> I<00:04:56.810> can<00:04:56.870> get<00:04:57.080> to<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.320> middle<00:04:57.440> option

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
closest I can get to the middle option

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.310 
closest I can get to the middle option
is<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.130> focal<00:04:58.640> length<00:04:58.790> of<00:04:58.910> 58<00:04:59.390> mil<00:04:59.690> so<00:04:59.990> I<00:05:00.050> put<00:05:00.230> it

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
is a focal length of 58 mil so I put it

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.580 
is a focal length of 58 mil so I put it
on<00:05:00.380> 58<00:05:00.980> mil<00:05:01.220> and<00:05:01.910> what<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:02.180> does<00:05:02.390> is<00:05:03.320> with

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
on 58 mil and what that does is with

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.080 
on 58 mil and what that does is with
that<00:05:03.890> combined<00:05:04.490> with<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.700> maximum<00:05:05.000> aperture

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
that combined with the maximum aperture

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.830 
that combined with the maximum aperture
it<00:05:05.420> allows<00:05:05.780> your<00:05:06.170> camera<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:07.570> matrix<00:05:08.570> meter

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
it allows your camera to matrix meter

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.110 
it allows your camera to matrix meter
now<00:05:09.620> if<00:05:09.710> you<00:05:09.800> don't<00:05:09.980> put<00:05:10.130> that<00:05:10.160> data<00:05:10.460> in<00:05:10.670> it

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
now if you don't put that data in it

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.450 
now if you don't put that data in it
won't<00:05:11.420> matrix<00:05:11.990> meter<00:05:12.230> and<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:12.890> won't<00:05:13.190> know

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
won't matrix meter and it won't know

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.370 
won't matrix meter and it won't know
what<00:05:14.150> the<00:05:14.300> f-stop<00:05:14.570> is<00:05:14.630> it<00:05:14.840> will<00:05:14.960> just<00:05:15.110> it<00:05:15.260> will

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
what the f-stop is it will just it will

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.320 
what the f-stop is it will just it will
change<00:05:15.650> as<00:05:15.920> you<00:05:16.040> change<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.520> ring<00:05:17.030> but<00:05:17.270> it

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
change as you change the ring but it

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.390 
change as you change the ring but it
will<00:05:17.390> go<00:05:17.540> from<00:05:17.810> nought<00:05:18.260> to<00:05:18.290> 10<00:05:19.130> or<00:05:19.250> something

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
will go from nought to 10 or something

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.790 
will go from nought to 10 or something
it<00:05:19.790> doesn't<00:05:20.060> know<00:05:20.210> what<00:05:20.360> it<00:05:20.450> is<00:05:20.540> so<00:05:21.320> I've<00:05:21.470> got

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
it doesn't know what it is so I've got

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.520 
it doesn't know what it is so I've got
my<00:05:21.920> camera<00:05:22.190> now<00:05:22.490> in<00:05:22.730> aperture<00:05:23.090> priority<00:05:23.500> so<00:05:24.500> I

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
my camera now in aperture priority so I

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.660 
my camera now in aperture priority so I
set<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:24.830> aperture<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.340> aperture<00:05:25.640> ring

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
set the aperture the aperture ring

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.480 
set the aperture the aperture ring
that's<00:05:25.970> on<00:05:26.060> 3.5<00:05:26.660> it<00:05:27.500> shows<00:05:27.740> in<00:05:27.980> the<00:05:28.160> screen

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
that's on 3.5 it shows in the screen

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.640 
that's on 3.5 it shows in the screen
there's<00:05:28.700> 3.5<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.420> if<00:05:29.510> I<00:05:29.630> change<00:05:29.870> it<00:05:30.140> if<00:05:30.320> I<00:05:30.410> put

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
there's 3.5 and if I change it if I put

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.300 
there's 3.5 and if I change it if I put
6<00:05:30.950> it<00:05:31.400> changes<00:05:32.000> change<00:05:32.870> it<00:05:32.990> to<00:05:33.110> 11<00:05:33.590> it<00:05:33.770> changes

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
6 it changes change it to 11 it changes

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.640 
6 it changes change it to 11 it changes
etc<00:05:34.760> so<00:05:35.450> that<00:05:35.660> all<00:05:35.810> works<00:05:36.050> nicely<00:05:36.320> with<00:05:36.530> the

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
etc so that all works nicely with the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.110 
etc so that all works nicely with the
aperture<00:05:36.860> ring<00:05:37.100> and<00:05:37.310> that's<00:05:37.760> quite<00:05:37.970> nice

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
aperture ring and that's quite nice

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.670 
aperture ring and that's quite nice
actually<00:05:38.360> using<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:38.930> aperture<00:05:39.260> ring<00:05:39.380> there

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
actually using the aperture ring there

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.370 
actually using the aperture ring there
rather<00:05:39.950> than<00:05:40.190> totally<00:05:40.730> button<00:05:41.290> so<00:05:42.290> that's

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
rather than totally button so that's

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.670 
rather than totally button so that's
fine<00:05:42.710> I've<00:05:42.920> set<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:43.610> focal<00:05:44.510> length<00:05:44.540> to<00:05:45.380> around

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
fine I've set the focal length to around

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
fine I've set the focal length to around
the<00:05:45.890> mid<00:05:46.070> mid<00:05:46.460> range<00:05:46.730> of<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:47.120> lens<00:05:47.330> and<00:05:48.700> it

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
the mid mid range of the lens and it

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.840 
the mid mid range of the lens and it
works<00:05:49.940> absolutely<00:05:50.150> fine<00:05:50.690> it<00:05:51.680> meets<00:05:52.370> as<00:05:52.610> well

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
works absolutely fine it meets as well

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.730 
works absolutely fine it meets as well
the<00:05:54.280> the<00:05:55.280> colors<00:05:55.760> are<00:05:55.940> nice<00:05:56.030> and<00:05:56.330> rich<00:05:56.740> it

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
the the colors are nice and rich it

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.610 
the the colors are nice and rich it
gives<00:05:58.250> nice<00:05:58.700> bokeh<00:05:59.300> they<00:06:00.080> all<00:06:00.200> blow<00:06:00.380> out<00:06:00.500> the

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
gives nice bokeh they all blow out the

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.410 
gives nice bokeh they all blow out the
background<00:06:00.800> nicely<00:06:01.400> because<00:06:01.490> again<00:06:02.120> it's<00:06:02.300> the

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
background nicely because again it's the

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.190 
background nicely because again it's the
EF<00:06:02.570> 3.5<00:06:03.580> focus<00:06:04.580> in<00:06:04.790> is<00:06:05.270> not<00:06:05.570> easy<00:06:05.870> I'm<00:06:06.080> not

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
EF 3.5 focus in is not easy I'm not

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.250 
EF 3.5 focus in is not easy I'm not
gonna<00:06:06.380> lie<00:06:06.560> is<00:06:06.800> not<00:06:06.830> easy<00:06:07.370> to<00:06:07.750> autofocus<00:06:08.750> on<00:06:08.930> I

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
gonna lie is not easy to autofocus on I

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.810 
gonna lie is not easy to autofocus on I
mean<00:06:09.380> I've<00:06:09.500> been<00:06:09.530> just<00:06:09.950> testing<00:06:10.280> out<00:06:10.430> today<00:06:10.700> on

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
mean I've been just testing out today on

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.820 
mean I've been just testing out today on
my<00:06:10.970> dog<00:06:11.180> so<00:06:11.450> this<00:06:11.630> virtually<00:06:12.200> impossible<00:06:12.500> to

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
my dog so this virtually impossible to

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.980 
my dog so this virtually impossible to
get<00:06:13.160> a<00:06:13.220> shot<00:06:13.430> in<00:06:13.790> focus<00:06:14.180> what<00:06:14.540> I<00:06:14.570> ended<00:06:14.900> up

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
get a shot in focus what I ended up

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.100 
get a shot in focus what I ended up
doing<00:06:15.380> was<00:06:15.530> literally<00:06:16.270> motor<00:06:17.270> drive<00:06:17.600> in<00:06:17.840> and

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
doing was literally motor drive in and

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.020 
doing was literally motor drive in and
adjusting<00:06:18.620> the<00:06:18.710> focus<00:06:19.130> as<00:06:19.370> you<00:06:19.430> do<00:06:19.670> it<00:06:19.820> and

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
adjusting the focus as you do it and

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.300 
adjusting the focus as you do it and
then<00:06:20.240> you'll<00:06:20.390> pick<00:06:20.570> up<00:06:20.720> you<00:06:21.260> know<00:06:21.380> the<00:06:22.070> chance

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
then you'll pick up you know the chance

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.480 
then you'll pick up you know the chance
so<00:06:22.430> you'll<00:06:22.580> pick<00:06:22.730> up<00:06:22.790> a<00:06:22.910> shot<00:06:23.060> in<00:06:23.180> focus<00:06:24.040> but<00:06:25.040> as

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
so you'll pick up a shot in focus but as

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.770 
so you'll pick up a shot in focus but as
I<00:06:25.580> say<00:06:25.700> that's<00:06:25.850> not<00:06:26.030> really<00:06:26.330> what<00:06:26.450> I've<00:06:26.540> got<00:06:26.690> it

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
I say that's not really what I've got it

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.310 
I say that's not really what I've got it
for<00:06:27.020> so<00:06:27.860> there<00:06:28.490> you<00:06:28.550> have<00:06:28.610> it

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
for so there you have it

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.030 
for so there you have it
some<00:06:30.320> of<00:06:30.380> these<00:06:30.470> whole<00:06:30.620> blenders<00:06:30.890> they're

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
some of these whole blenders they're

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.460 
some of these whole blenders they're
made<00:06:31.220> in<00:06:31.340> Japan<00:06:31.700> some<00:06:32.450> are<00:06:32.570> good<00:06:32.720> some<00:06:32.750> are<00:06:33.080> bad

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
made in Japan some are good some are bad

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.830 
made in Japan some are good some are bad
there's<00:06:33.680> lots<00:06:33.830> of<00:06:33.890> reviews<00:06:34.340> on<00:06:35.030> the<00:06:35.180> Internet

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
there's lots of reviews on the Internet

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.760 
there's lots of reviews on the Internet
this<00:06:36.590> one<00:06:36.830> is<00:06:37.100> from<00:06:38.090> about<00:06:38.300> nineteen<00:06:38.810> late

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
this one is from about nineteen late

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.070 
this one is from about nineteen late
1970s<00:06:40.580> I<00:06:40.640> think<00:06:40.940> and<00:06:41.180> there<00:06:41.270> was<00:06:41.390> two<00:06:41.570> versions

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
1970s I think and there was two versions

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.440 
1970s I think and there was two versions
of<00:06:42.320> this<00:06:42.470> lens<00:06:42.710> particularly<00:06:43.460> one<00:06:44.090> had<00:06:44.330> the

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
of this lens particularly one had the

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.180 
of this lens particularly one had the
writing<00:06:44.660> inside<00:06:45.350> the<00:06:45.560> filtering<00:06:45.890> and

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
writing inside the filtering and

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.700 
writing inside the filtering and
apparently<00:06:46.610> was<00:06:46.760> rubbish<00:06:47.150> and<00:06:47.480> the<00:06:47.540> other<00:06:48.470> one

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
apparently was rubbish and the other one

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.380 
apparently was rubbish and the other one
which<00:06:49.010> is<00:06:49.190> this<00:06:49.310> one<00:06:49.370> the<00:06:49.640> later<00:06:49.790> model<00:06:50.210> has

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
which is this one the later model has

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.240 
which is this one the later model has
the<00:06:50.630> the<00:06:51.020> writing<00:06:51.290> on<00:06:51.530> the<00:06:51.680> outside<00:06:52.070> the

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
the the writing on the outside the

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.400 
the the writing on the outside the
filtering<00:06:52.580> and<00:06:52.850> is<00:06:53.600> a<00:06:53.660> you<00:06:54.140> know<00:06:54.230> an

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
filtering and is a you know an

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.980 
filtering and is a you know an
absolutely<00:06:54.770> fine<00:06:55.070> no<00:06:55.370> problems<00:06:55.820> lens<00:06:56.090> and<00:06:56.870> it

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
absolutely fine no problems lens and it

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.700 
absolutely fine no problems lens and it
works<00:06:57.170> really<00:06:57.470> well<00:06:57.650> on<00:06:57.710> digital<00:06:58.160> I<00:06:58.220> think<00:06:58.550> so

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
works really well on digital I think so

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.600 
works really well on digital I think so
anyway<00:07:00.710> that's<00:07:00.950> just<00:07:01.040> a<00:07:01.250> little<00:07:01.430> bit<00:07:01.520> of

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
anyway that's just a little bit of

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.910 
anyway that's just a little bit of
information<00:07:01.850> if<00:07:02.570> you<00:07:02.780> are<00:07:02.930> looking<00:07:03.290> to<00:07:03.530> get<00:07:03.680> a

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:03.920 
information if you are looking to get a

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.830 
information if you are looking to get a
non<00:07:04.400> CPU<00:07:05.060> older<00:07:05.720> non<00:07:06.380> auto<00:07:06.950> focusing<00:07:07.670> lens<00:07:07.970> for

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
non CPU older non auto focusing lens for

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.370 
non CPU older non auto focusing lens for
an<00:07:09.050> icon<00:07:09.350> and<00:07:10.130> so<00:07:10.340> it<00:07:10.400> does<00:07:10.580> work<00:07:10.790> and<00:07:11.450> you<00:07:12.260> do

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
an icon and so it does work and you do

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.420 
an icon and so it does work and you do
have<00:07:12.620> to<00:07:12.740> set<00:07:12.890> it<00:07:13.010> up<00:07:13.130> but<00:07:14.830> essentially<00:07:15.830> you

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
have to set it up but essentially you

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.480 
have to set it up but essentially you
know<00:07:16.550> this<00:07:16.790> is<00:07:17.120> a<00:07:17.180> as<00:07:17.870> I<00:07:18.080> said<00:07:18.260> a<00:07:18.290> 3.5<00:07:18.830> lens<00:07:19.160> I

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
know this is a as I said a 3.5 lens I

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:26.290 
know this is a as I said a 3.5 lens I
paid<00:07:21.070> about<00:07:23.260> 50<00:07:24.260> 60<00:07:24.470> quid<00:07:25.220> for<00:07:25.400> it<00:07:25.520> that's<00:07:25.910> 60

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.300 
paid about 50 60 quid for it that's 60

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.790 
paid about 50 60 quid for it that's 60
quid<00:07:26.420> for<00:07:26.630> are<00:07:26.750> they<00:07:26.840> are<00:07:26.930> paid<00:07:27.140> something

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
quid for are they are paid something

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.940 
quid for are they are paid something
like<00:07:27.980> that<00:07:28.130> if<00:07:28.340> that<00:07:28.640> and<00:07:29.530> so<00:07:30.530> it's<00:07:30.650> not<00:07:30.740> a<00:07:30.800> lot

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:30.950 
like that if that and so it's not a lot

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.350 
like that if that and so it's not a lot
of<00:07:31.010> money<00:07:31.160> to<00:07:31.370> try<00:07:31.580> it<00:07:31.640> and<00:07:31.910> it<00:07:32.000> you<00:07:32.150> know<00:07:32.240> it

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 
of money to try it and it you know it

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.060 
of money to try it and it you know it
will<00:07:32.450> hold<00:07:32.600> its<00:07:32.810> value<00:07:32.870> I<00:07:33.200> should<00:07:33.830> think<00:07:33.920> I'd

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.070 
will hold its value I should think I'd
