00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:16.770
 shooting out 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.550
 incomprehensible because of what i'm charged loop 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.710
 gardner it is simpler and see how 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.859
 will karasika reaction is done just 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.410
 is taken 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.510
 some amount of fishing line 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.980
 here is no need to save how 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.910
 she is 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:45.270
 anyway prone to abrasion take 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:50.449
 piece of fishing line and do a loop under 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.449
 feeders for the feeder knit ordinary knot 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.449
 eight 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:07.210
 and everything turns out right away but should not 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.210
 get it right away otherwise they won't bite 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:22.299
 probably will be enough shoulder 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.299
 Immediately insert a feeder into this loop 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.220
 through the swivel 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.770
 without fanaticism we measure everything in place 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.020
 remaining piece 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.010
 so that the loop under the leash was slightly lower 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.460
 feeders on this place do another 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.720
 noose 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.920
 in the same way the same not 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.920
 tricky 8 pen 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.130
 he's ready 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.930
 extra 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.259
 everything 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.770
 seven seconds right on the pond now 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.610
 leash fly away and continue our 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.680
 fascinating occupation 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:28.680
 something seemed to me that the longer 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:31.850
 occasion more actively taken may 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.850
 it seemed to check 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.040
 basically all the same only this time 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.790
 ready for 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.790
 from preston 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.970
 I do not know the hooks here on the yellow yellow 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.630
 colors and I don't think it will be 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.630
 is critical 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.349
 that is, when shooting trough we 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:14.420
 spent exactly five minutes in order 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.420
 to bandage she gardner loop 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.900
 sliding assembly here that running fedor 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.410
 a little longer to do too 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.410
 principle is not critical 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.230
 He, too, sometimes the process of fishing change 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.230
 useful if even that montage which 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.250
 worth it completely satisfied who knows 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.310
 maybe now on the gardner loop 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.610
 more bites will be visible or 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.610
 vice versa 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:04:03.280
 feeding trough 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:03.280
 poison poison 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.950
 forward
