00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.980
 by me 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.149
 m 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.110
 here a currency in the center of 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.220
 Lisbon 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.810
 but in the middle of nowhere it's here 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.450
 that companies I was legally everything 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.040
 and anything that kind of plastic 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.160
 that's what I use to create the 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.840
 wings of a butterfly and then there are plenty 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.370
 waste with which we can no longer 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:44.510
 to make money is like a house I 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.590
 can build a building with that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.129
 seems line of the city garbage 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.690
 official supplier of arthur bordallo 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.670
 since 2008 it's in landfills 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.500
 the city that the 27-year-old lisboète makes 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.790
 his shopping 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.739
 it all starts when he decides to 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.440
 to transpose in 3D the paintings of his great 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.290
 father real bordallo known for painting the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.800
 Portuguese capital to make it 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.330
 tribute 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.600
 he then chooses to be nicknamed 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.310
 bordallo segundo with its facilities 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.390
 giant arthur becomes a master of 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.729
 upcycling art 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.260
 carried by the movement green lesur 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.510
 Cycling is about giving a new 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:30.050
 function and a second waste life 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:32.000
 who poisons the city I created this 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.520
 hour with a pile of junk mostly from 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.630
 stuff coming from the river one is a 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.730
 river in the city center which is 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.170
 really polluted and that's why 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.490
 I made a fish if the pollution 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.250
 continue like this in the next 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.350
 years there will be more then I created 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.100
 this fish with waste so we 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.950
 remember it 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.420
 in 2008 Portugal is hit full 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.400
 whip by the debt crisis 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.100
 today the unemployment rate of 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.110
 young people reaches 40% over a million 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.850
 Portuguese are forced into exile 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.280
 the country is placed under guardianship and must 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.870
 apply a drastic economy plan 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.260
 developed by the fmi and the european union 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.539
 in its way bordallo segundo integrates this 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.100
 financial cataclysm by feeding his 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.590
 street art of mobile phones 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.450
 abandoned bodied bodywork and 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.320
 waste of all kinds rejected by the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.320
 consumer society 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:40.430
 never lived without the crisis 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:44.150
 I do not know the difference can be 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.560
 motivated like that it will work whatever 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.090
 happens do not sleep 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.409
 what is the point of tagging trains when 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.299
 can be a rail in 2013 the street 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.359
 artist makes a sensation on the net with 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.889
 this hijacked series customize 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.389
 the urban universe is the winning ticket 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.389
 Bordallo of segundo 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.860
 we 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.440
 this is where I'm going to help him 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.950
 shine all the garbage I use 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.300
 in my paintings is full of stuff 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.300
 different objects recovered from the street 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.730
 and in landfills 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.020
 and then here in this place here it is there 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:42.150
 that I bet I 'm doing the rest of the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:42.150
 light work 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.330
 there is no good run there is no 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.750
 good news the trash is 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.890
 bad that's why they use them 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.739
 on the other hand I work more and more 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.330
 with plastic because I think that 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:04.090
 plastic is the worst thing 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.840
 recycle to destroy under the sun of 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.290
 cache cache 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.190
 not on that day 30 km to the west 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.180
 from lisbon 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.099
 diogo machado alias hadfield de fire met 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.419
 oil on the fire gives a shot of 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.419
 young terra cotta 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.100
 enameled the famous azulejos to 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.560
 the occasion of the first street festival 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.699
 art organized by the city in 2013 was 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.860
 fuel makes illusion 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.020
 it looks like tiling but it is not 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.639
 tiling is a fresco made 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.639
 stencil and spray paint 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.770
 the pattern full of elements reminiscent 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:45.100
 qashqai here there are small boats 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:48.370
 with the sea ​​and then there are heads of 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.970
 fish here on the side there is some 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.800
 yellow paint 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.979
 this yellow painting is a lot 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.770
 used in Portuguese houses zon 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.840
 sending by you it seemed obvious 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.760
 to use this color it's so 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.180
 ugly and everybody uses all the 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.250
 time I thought ok but you're 11 years old 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.320
 on my work let's recover 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.180
 really new thing id 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.860
 at your soul's mission is to 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.870
 recycle the past through his works 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.870
 stencilled and his ceramics 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.730
 since 2009 this 34 year old artist 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.460
 reinvents the Portuguese tradition of 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.620
 azulejos his decorated earthenware tiles 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.820
 that we find everywhere without the wall at 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.820
 Portugal for eight centuries 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.199
 it's one of the last traces 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.800
 visible from the dead occupation of the 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.370
 Iberian Peninsula from 8th to 13th 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.990
 century 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.639
 these Muslim peoples are building at 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.060
 portugal of fortifications and 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.949
 mosques 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.009
 today covered with monuments 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:01.080
 Christians we are not going to taxed to 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.919
 Retrograde oil sucked by 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.900
 organic forms 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.300
 the symmetry and the blue color of the 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.070
 classic azulejos his art created so 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.600
 digitale captures the air of his time 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.479
 if you look from afar you see 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.669
 traditional classic tile but 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:21.539
 if you get close it does not have anything left 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:24.169
 see with tradition because my 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:27.780
 works are riddled with strange things 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:31.590
 even situation characters 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.060
 strange old skate boarder and 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.560
 graffiti writers at work 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.340
 today as an illustrator for 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.650
 bigger brands 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.050
 inspired by manga video games and 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.940
 pop dance culture and azulejos the 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.650
 master du trompe-l'oeil replace the 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.130
 geometric patterns by funny 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.130
 little characters 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:00.330
 people's reaction when I paint in the 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:02.970
 street is a very pretty art form 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.040
 I really like the tiles they 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.690
 save in case they do not take the 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.710
 time needed to understand what 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:12.240
 is really happening in the picture 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.050
 yet the waters are associated with the 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:19.650
 dead and something bad 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:23.180
 I like to reverse the concepts meaning to 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.180
 background I like playing with people's minds
