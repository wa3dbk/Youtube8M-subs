00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.009
 the most television we are also going to 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.170
 prepare all the other reds and I'm going to 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.040
 make a cut of cherry for me 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.750
 filling 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.300
 I'm going to put pitted cherries here 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.130
 we are going to put cherries 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.960
 dehydrated that we found in this 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.490
 walmart store 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.400
 I'm going to put vanilla sugar and a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.619
 little touch of salt let's put it on fire 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.619
 medium we will accept everything 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.660
 And also the water that I'm going to add 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.510
 with corn starch 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.140
 and water I'm going to mix this perfectly 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.140
 with the help of a fork 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.670
 this will thicken us 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.410
 and we are ready to put on fire 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.030
 medium and when they release their juices the 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.800
 cherries it's going to be time to add the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.910
 stress before so that we stay from this 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.910
 way that we already have here 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.140
 here is ready after 15 minutes 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.460
 this we have a delicious filling that 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.680
 you can also put it on top of 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.560
 a very rich vanilla ice cream ball 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.560
 and well I have puff pastry is 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.990
 an invention of the bakery that was for 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.370
 mistake remember that the chef is 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.080
 he forgot to put butter 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.370
 then when I was kneading it happened 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.250
 mind that I have not added the butter 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.410
 of intercalary weight was still happening and 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.450
 when was ready mass consisted 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.490
 ready your product realized that this 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.800
 it opened in sheets and it turns out that it appeared 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.050
 the puff pastry fusion this is the 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.450
 moment I have four rectangles what 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.700
 The only thing I did was knead them, do not cut 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.650
 the big angle and then the cut of 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.470
 approximately how much will this be 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.600
 will be 20 by 10 or so 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.710
 plus 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.840
 30 is fine whatever it is imagined that 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.009
 you are going to put 2010 and that's it 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.009
 we are going to lay eggs 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.320
 let's put it on the shore 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.229
 to knead my puff always taste 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.530
 enough flour so that I do not leave 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.530
 to paste 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.899
 we here in the program have already 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.849
 made puff pastry 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.849
 and unless it's going to be stuffed 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.439
 I like them a lot for the temple 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.780
 Sundays when you do not want to make a 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.159
 very big dessert we can use this 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.209
 part was to make these poses so 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.209
 simple and so good 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.329
 back to shore 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.110
 and we press 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.510
 with the little fingers 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.010
 ok we go from another side we already have 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.270
 previously the glue put 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.180
 we press from the sides 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.959
 little 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.959
 little 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.100
 and press 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.340
 and that we have some pretty little packages 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.840
 It's great because later they can 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.280
 take to the dessert until eating without 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.170
 pick up hand and it is delicious to a being 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.400
 another nothing else for you to be 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.700
 see them at home 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.700
 learning 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.250
 enough egg 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.080
 on the shore 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.550
 and the chef told me a very good idea 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.180
 and since I 'm always an apprentice to everything 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.260
 I'll give this idea the chip me 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.260
 it gave 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.930
 with the help of a fork 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.930
 let's press 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.440
 and it's going to stick 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.890
 we have another option this topic has it 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.510
 at home like that of Nazis 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.900
 now we go because we have the order of 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.840
 fridge 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.770
 after 20 minutes we are going to take them out 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.569
 time 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.609
 let's varnish with egg 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.780
 the egg is going to give us exactly the 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.780
 color we want 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.780
 golden 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.150
 perfectly fine thanks 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.180
 and there I go there I go there I go there pretty 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:42.759
 good as I press on these children 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.759
 let's sprinkle 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.590
 with muscovado sugar 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.590
 and I have a knife 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:55.510
 and I'm going to make some small openings 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.900
 to come out there 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.090
