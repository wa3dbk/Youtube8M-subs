00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 we do a job that is a job 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.710
 exciting but complicated by now 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.969
 and from tonight even if I have the pleasure 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.210
 all met but I'm already in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.400
 think of what we are going to do 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.439
 tomorrow and especially what are we going to do 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.550
 to prepare a match to reims again 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.010
 outside that will not be simple no 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.349
 plus considering that I read them 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.980
 looked at when we come in and it's a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.480
 team that is a fit team too 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:44.940
 in this evening aside from saying bravo to 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.360
 our Lyon friends that I like said a beautiful 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.629
 Stadium 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.170
 a beautiful lawn a beautiful public a 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.770
 nice true team I did not attack at 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.680
 my age a career of jealous but is 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.520
 delighted anyway tonight compared to 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:08.729
 what I saw has everything planned 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:10.909
 that's for sure I'm better but 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.820
 good we can not know 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.790
 we would have received binder to the mosson in this 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.659
 moment I believe the right solution 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.549
 it's not to have met lyon I 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.850
 had already seen them against lille who 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.869
 the habit of being solid also take 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.350
 three goals at the cost of your players 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:36.680
 the return of gourcuff from the boys who 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.869
 alone on the bench and who can return 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.630
 at any time and add a little bit 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.610
 of freshness and and talent they have 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.420
 recovered their wounded when we see 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.450
 already the name and complementarity of 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.920
 four defenders plus a very good 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.009
 guardian 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.299
 the middle is still a lot 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.689
 a lot of problems 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:06.210
 a network and tonight aside 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:08.819
 maybe 1 to 3 we did not need to 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.640
 this bread of this third goal which is at the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.590
 offside limit but well we will not 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.650
 talk about match facts there has been a 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.620
 period in the match it seemed to me that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.819
 of 3.1 if we manage to put a 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.849
 opportunity that seems to you when is 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:28.830
 even easy to put on and fits 3 2 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:31.170
 it may be an end of the match a 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.970
 little more fun for us with 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.040
 Lyon could have been doubted and 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.739
 behind that gives back 3 2 it's a 80 there 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.040
 a certain moment I was afraid of a 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.069
 amount of 12 even if it's in my 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.670
 coaching memories I do not know if 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.950
 it's not the first time I'm 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.840
 responsible for a team that takes a 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.060
 goal we did not know the first 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.420
 offer as much does one have to second mother 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.920
 res 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.000
 I'm trying to think but it's not 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.849
 important but after each tribute I 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.680
 for habit of already thinking about the 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.170
 preparing our match for what we have 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.379
 did not do 1 and what did I do 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:19.140
 me and not done too so I'm not going 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:23.489
 change habits already I 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.159
 think about our players 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:30.450
 if you allow with regard to this 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:34.379
 that it happened at home I give 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:39.120
 exclusivity to my players and in addition 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:40.950
 this 10th rise we have on the head I 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.659
 I'm not going to add any more 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.930
 positions on the positions we have 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.610
 already speak - lyon of the beautiful 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.409
 team of ten years what I have to say 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.049
 my players I do the maximum there 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.500
 surely allow or do your 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.989
 job and if there can be a little bit of 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.750
 reciprocity what did not work this 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:06.120
 evening I reserve it exclusively to my 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:11.640
 players what pleased me lyon team 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:17.190
 all in tics mantua and and even the stadium 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.660
 and the nautical polo everything since you 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.579
 always say not what I can say 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.579
 since all his all 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:30.159
 and I think the points we see 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.439
 in the results 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:34.659
 we look at all the teams that 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:38.439
 clings to succeed and grapple the 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:40.800
 least point and ourselves at 2 0 in the middle 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:43.840
 time we did not think it was folded 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.740
 we thought it would be with a 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.340
 third goal 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:52.629
 still that when we come back to three we 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.979
 can be said why do not we have 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.830
 ended the match with potential 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.000
 offensive but with a lot less 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.509
 solidity 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.819
 so that's the big problem of all 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.509
 teams and we come to find the 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.479
 good balance 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:10.750
 but good as I say tonight ago 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:14.590
 only comments on 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.819
 congratulations for lyon that I that I 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.330
 have to do because it's the least 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:18.819
 things 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.589
 on top of that, thank them for us 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.560
 to have received 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:26.020
 it was not obliged mrc local but we 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.689
 is still nice enough we went 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.930
 hospitable confinement that we know 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:34.029
 to be elegant one has set apart 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.189
 six or seven yellow cards on the 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:39.729
 field that's it's a joke 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:42.219
 what is especially good for me is 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.159
 that we can have relationships 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:48.659
 nice to them all the clubs that are 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.659
 opponents but not enemies 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.249
 it's me good evening to all
