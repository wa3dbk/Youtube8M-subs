00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.520
 Motorola is an innovative brand in the 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.290
 field of mobile communication them 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.750
 they were responsible for the land 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.090
 will communicate with the moon and today they continue 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.189
 innovating and this was demonstrated in the 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.350
 campaign to launch your new phone 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.939
 mobile now is one of our 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.349
 star products is currently around 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.210
 launch totally thought of 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.250
 digital for the public where we 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.110
 we are directed is the main means 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.550
 we think how the consumer is 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.739
 using digital media to 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.360
 investigate 75 percent of the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.000
 people entering a retail outlet 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.730
 they already have in their head what they will go to 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.129
 buy and translate those needs into 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.620
 a campaign a campaign where the media 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.199
 were not a complement but 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.000
 an intrinsic part of it the layer 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.949
 it was divided into three phases one stage 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.469
 from teaser what we were looking for was 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.750
 maximize the expectation for the arrival 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.969
 of this new phone the result of 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.250
 the first stage let's see the duplicates 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.320
 we had 5000 people what we use 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.000
 were two tools on one side of 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.650
 the google display network to be able 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.810
 capitalize all the demand that already 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.909
 It exists by cell phones inside 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.619
 of the digital market in Mexico and on the other 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.100
 side we were using video formats 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.140
 with 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.250
 to manage through channels of 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.650
 youtube they had to see for example 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.060
 with technology with mobile telephony and 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.130
 through our own channel 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.990
 motorola mexico also in the second 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.600
 phase that was the launch phase 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.000
 our goal was to reach and generate 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.799
 awareness we use great formats 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.780
 scope as more is within 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.159
 youtube segmented truvi videos 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.320
 also by interest categories 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.630
 blast within the content network of 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.460
 google to reach the largest number 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.740
 of possible people and finally we had 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.690
 a post-launch phase that was going 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.220
 focused to pick up all that edges and 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.509
 all that ritz that we had achieved the 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.000
 mobile medium played a very important role 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.890
 to close guidelines through the network of 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.409
 display mobile a strategy 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.450
 click-to-call where the user and was the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.920
 announcement will arrive a landing page or where 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.690
 We gave you information about the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.390
 device to call the call center 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.179
 of the operator and in this way power 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.220
 buy the device and when digital 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.890
 is exploited in this way 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.790
 results are reflected where they count most 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.530
 in sales we have exceeded all kinds of 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.540
 metric that we put the results 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.120
 we were really surprised by the clicks 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.099
 The impressions 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.140
 of people let's say unique users that 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.019
 they watched our videos more than 500 thousand 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.970
 effective views the commercial of motorola 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.500
 to register we end up being the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.030
 most recommended brand in the point of 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.860
 sale and we end up being the product 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.569
 Most recommended at the point of sale 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.599
 sales we 've had from the reviewer there 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.670
 They practically exceeded this 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.290
 that we had thought the medium 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.239
 digital did not play only a part 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.980
 within the entire launch strategy 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.930
 digital we always saw it to the best 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.239
 how good are we going to do the tele campaign 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.040
 and also digital today for me this is 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.980
 totally upside down put together a strategy 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.900
 360 degree purely digital one 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.280
 integral launch that was used the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.799
 digital media to maximize their 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.489
 results everything was overcome and 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.489
 widely
