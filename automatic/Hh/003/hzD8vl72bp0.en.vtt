00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.610
 welcome my friends out there too 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.250
 a new edition of geo tv 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.650
 and this is the topic of sin yes 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.830
 she may not sue in the fall 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.150
 The client can sweets chocolate 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.970
 something as I finish and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.920
 since i have jesum office job where i am 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.420
 nine hours a day from the desk seats 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.740
 I have to take care that you do not mind me 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.989
 I'm not overweight 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.280
 and become obese and that's why I have to 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.110
 but still every now and then 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.969
 let everyone know a little something 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.860
 sometimes you have to and i thought so 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.710
 Show in this video a little bit what the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.600
 divine hours with on a journey in 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.879
 my fridge then should be today 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.020
 watching what he did is missing 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.690
 not in there right now 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.129
 but you can ship them and then see them 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.960
 you only sin one bit 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.190
 I whipped it somehow somehow 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.190
 a sauce a shepherd simply knows 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.800
 may taste better but is 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.090
 a little sin so number two what the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.670
 climate data we are saying protein bars 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.659
 it is the protein-protein actually 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.280
 good for the muscles 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.900
 Of course it is good but if we have it 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.680
 just look at the nutrition 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.750
 at a bar of the 80 grams 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.150
 we have 35 grams of carbohydrate for that 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.619
 so five grams of sugar in riga in 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.780
 it is not for less 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.950
 as at the mars and snickers the front 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.590
 just against her the normal 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.930
 chocolate bars the hamm was more in it 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.790
 So it's okay as a sin 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.049
 Of course not good if you 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.270
 namely want to lose weight a bit 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.740
 locally then bring you such a zealous 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.360
 not further for that reason 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.579
 In between, always okay, really bad 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.060
 sinner the chocolate bar or children 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.150
 always without sin we have here 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.310
 have too 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.230
 rules are my little sins 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.810
 I even always at hand when things 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.690
 what do I want to know think okay 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.550
 Of course, sugar is in it, but at least 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.190
 a bit more protein is being used for the 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.010
 send gravel from me 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.990
 I did that for breakfast 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.750
 I always like the oatmeal now 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.280
 but what else is a sin 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.250
 for example, corplex has flex okay 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.300
 a little bit of chocolate in there and 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.250
 we are chocolate chips because otherwise 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.420
 tastes is not always clear 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.510
 if you go hungry on the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.030
 Sweet should have something delicious creamy 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.050
 is there then k7 for example 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.840
 In the evening that's just fine 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.930
 yes there we are now on 100 grams 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.640
 Only 3.1 kilos are very good and there 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.550
 tastes delicious and sweet 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.380
 we see web barry green so my tip 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.150
 for all who are also on low carb and 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.010
 really want to pay attention or 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.510
 they do not have to take and themselves 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.700
 can not afford this rule 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.560
 So not from the money so more than 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.450
 dick does it for the way it is 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.070
 In the evening you can enjoy it with chocolate 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.890
 or taste a bit like cocoa or 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.269
 with fruits yes they are actually 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.650
 my little symbols 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.730
 otherwise I have to miss my camargo 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.019
 Sweet is a bit of strawberry banana 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.620
 fructose is not really that way 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.269
 bad 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.830
 You do not have to do everything in the evening 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.080
 with taken in between organs 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.870
 as an intermediate meal 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.270
 actually a great thing that sports 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.030
 are the ones I thought the cdu has 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.110
 briefly like he also confess 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.630
 perhaps now and then a 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.230
 Doner pizza but that's what stays 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.390
 exception 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.710
 and as one would have, we pay a 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.710
 want to define a bit of muscle 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:40.050
 so freiburg you would not have the 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.120
 also exaggerates with such energydrinks and 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.950
 shows me what I sometimes too 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.480
 a tug but you have to be his 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.090
 keep borders just write me 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.490
 times the comments your sins which 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.890
 sin you have so could the fingers 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.350
 not from other stuff and she completely 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.550
 funny I think very interesting 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.959
 writes at the rhine would be happy 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.570

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.720
 you do not want to have themes yet 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.090
 have also been treated in comments in the 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.990
 eighth water what should I times 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.260
 describe 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.690
 in attacked what it would like to know 10 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.300

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.220
