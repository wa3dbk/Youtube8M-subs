say you've got a massive compartment

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.800 
say you've got a massive compartment
still<00:01:05.290> put<00:01:05.439> much<00:01:05.530> everything<00:01:06.040> in<00:01:06.159> there

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
still put much everything in there

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.550 
still put much everything in there
facing<00:01:07.810> poor<00:01:07.960> in<00:01:08.049> size<00:01:09.240> got<00:01:10.240> some<00:01:10.560> compression

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
facing poor in size got some compression

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.399 
facing poor in size got some compression
straps<00:01:11.799> quick-release<00:01:12.960> big<00:01:13.960> webbing<00:01:14.320> on

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
straps quick-release big webbing on

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.980 
straps quick-release big webbing on
there<00:01:14.680> so<00:01:14.920> it's<00:01:15.070> very<00:01:15.100> tough<00:01:15.490> as<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.690> do<00:01:16.840> your

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
there so it's very tough as you do your

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.960 
there so it's very tough as you do your
straps<00:01:17.229> up<00:01:17.409> you<00:01:17.979> can<00:01:18.130> pull<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:18.369> down<00:01:18.430> nice

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
straps up you can pull that down nice

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.560 
straps up you can pull that down nice
and<00:01:19.000> tight

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
and tight

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.820 
and tight
usually<00:01:19.840> it<00:01:19.900> gets<00:01:20.049> your<00:01:20.140> equipment<00:01:20.530> nice<00:01:20.650> and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
usually it gets your equipment nice and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.370 
usually it gets your equipment nice and
so<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:21.070> stops<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:21.790> moving<00:01:22.060> around<00:01:22.320> you've<00:01:23.320> got

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
so it stops it moving around you've got

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.859 
so it stops it moving around you've got
one<00:01:23.530> day's<00:01:23.650> top<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.010> bottom<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.810> other

one day's top and bottom on the other

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.930 
one day's top and bottom on the other
side<00:01:26.170> we've<00:01:26.500> got<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:26.650> thinner<00:01:27.159> orientation<00:01:27.729> and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
side we've got a thinner orientation and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.770 
side we've got a thinner orientation and
stage<00:01:28.810> pockets<00:01:29.430> put<00:01:30.430> your<00:01:30.520> feet<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:30.820> here<00:01:31.000> only

stage pockets put your feet in here only

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.170 
stage pockets put your feet in here only
does<00:01:31.930> it<00:01:31.990> help<00:01:32.170> protect<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:33.250> equipment

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
does it help protect the equipment

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.330 
does it help protect the equipment
inside<00:01:34.600> but<00:01:35.020> also<00:01:35.080> gives<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:35.650> more<00:01:35.799> support<00:01:36.189> as

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
inside but also gives it more support as

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.700 
inside but also gives it more support as
well<00:01:36.520> because<00:01:37.150> it<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.390> travel<00:01:37.780> bag<00:01:37.960> Akron<00:01:38.590> of

well because it is a travel bag Akron of

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.070 
well because it is a travel bag Akron of
taking<00:01:39.369> some<00:01:39.520> material<00:01:40.090> way<00:01:40.210> just<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.900> help

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
taking some material way just to help

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.480 
taking some material way just to help
them<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.350> try<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.590> try<00:01:42.010> and<00:01:42.040> reduce<00:01:42.250> some<00:01:42.430> of

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
them to try and try and reduce some of

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.520 
them to try and try and reduce some of
the<00:01:42.610> weight<00:01:42.790> so<00:01:43.570> by<00:01:43.840> having<00:01:43.930> your<00:01:44.170> fins<00:01:44.350> on<00:01:44.500> the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
the weight so by having your fins on the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.020 
the weight so by having your fins on the
top<00:01:44.770> there<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.010> protecting<00:01:45.790> your<00:01:46.000> own

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
equipment inside and also gaining a bit

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.749 
equipment inside and also gaining a bit
more<00:01:48.310> space<00:01:48.520> at<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.790> same<00:01:48.880> time

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.340 

so<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.329> up<00:01:54.509> I'll<00:01:55.020> ever<00:01:55.140> look

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
at the backpack straps on the back okay

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.539 
at the backpack straps on the back okay
so<00:02:00.119> having<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.390> look<00:02:00.479> at<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.630> back<00:02:01.369> see<00:02:02.369> here

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
so having a look at the back see here

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.270 
so having a look at the back see here
