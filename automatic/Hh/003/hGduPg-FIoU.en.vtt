00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hi everyone , everything is good then vice otto. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.560
 To enlist a new novelty for you, yes. 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.420
 the porter macbook pro 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.030
 How did I get a photo there on instagram? 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.120
 some of you know some do not 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.960
 500 not then I decided to find myself 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.609
 you 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.770
 First of all I do not want 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.560
 show or anything like that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.869
 put my story a little bit of 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.449
 my computer history with the editor 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.150
 video and why I chose to buy 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.700
 A wonderful computer to be here. 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.410
 I'm really happy, I got it. 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.980
 realize this dream that I had when 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.840
 I was 15 or 14 my father that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.520
 last present is a 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.710
 asus contribution 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.829
 at first he did not meet sustainable 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.260
 of an editor so I opted for the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.250
 easier than ever to come on a computer 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.899
 windows seven a move just as it already 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.480
 everything was fine 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.940
 he thought of pictures of account 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.520
 slept a lot of bonfire time was the sign and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.199
 the second on your screen then people have 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.960
 not much problem is that there is a time without 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.729
 record seen is because of that he as 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.130
 same assistance we almost 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.350
 freaked year later my head 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.720
 I was going to buy a car, you better take the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.520
 My work here on youtube generous 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.619
 has in fact not wanted to give only 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.130
 money as a computer because I 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.860
 I think it is very expensive the computers of 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.390
 one leave here is a thousand customers and not of themselves 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.520
 It's 4 thousand reais 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.500
 so it's very expensive in a few weeks 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.810
 behind my dad's erroneous computer 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.970
 and he became super desperate so he 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.979
 started using a notebook as it will use 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.780
 much the computer then a computer 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.049
 Being the boss 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.729
 and we have yes the opposite he was 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.799
 using enough on the computer 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.799
 until yesterday still the computer 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.259
 Oh my brother, he has a technical comedy. 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.270
 format is one more built 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.310
 computer was very slow 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.810
 so my father decided yesterday to cut the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.530
 computer on it then we went to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.009
 City 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.630
 I, my brother and I went to see how much 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.509
 price 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.390
 the macbook pro went to search several stores 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.239
 people and I found this store that sells 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.370
 what here I'm going to leave the prisoners 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.170
 the address of the store is cute 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.930
 blog that anyone else down here 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.790
 so if you do not visit the blog it's there 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.900
 to give us all the information we need 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.790
 Do you want to buy a computer? 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.430
 how are you doing 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.830
 and then I went to search the store good people 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.190
 there after so much walking of so much to look 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.790
 I think it's just anima generated is more 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.040
 Reliable and kind was cool 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.220
 the idea of â€‹â€‹buying I bought the magazine 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.530
 so he left with even more discounts 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.260
 so it 's very expensive for a computer but 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.060
 I think for me it 's worth and for 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.330
 edit account if you have money 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.000
 beauty buy but if you do not have more 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.340
 Do you have a channel on youtube? 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.099
 month or better your videos be a 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.470
 and see how it's going to get 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.410
 invest in people if you invest nothing 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.829
 go ahead so I chose to invest 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.810
 a little bit and tinkering with my potential 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.819
 that we grow every single line for 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.269
 line gets legal still people 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.269
 Good people, he comes here. 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.730
 And if from here, you want to know, it's from 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.519
 13 inch book in the three 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.620
 I did not want 11 because it 's too small 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.000
 From here he is the size of 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.859
 I'm great at 3.3 inches 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.829
 I found the e-mec colors for you then 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.989
 I decided to opt for the macbook even by the way 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.720
 transport is better because if it is 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.090
 travel blog I can already edit in 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.120
 travel because the e mec does not have 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.750
 carrying on of agency is very large 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.470
 so I found a better way to drive the 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.600
 your 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.560
 I opted for the same macbook that is the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.549
 own 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.840
 he comes in a box so at 5 he has 4 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:05.170
 gb of memory and 500 hd then superbom 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.150
 brother wanted because he is much more 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.459
 within which that gentleman is finer 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.890
 but it is very or has very little to 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.450
 memory so for me or any good 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.150
 to have a slow computer and no memory 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.329
 I opted for the same one that is faster and 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.320
 has much more memory and is excellent at 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.540
 I am very happy we seriously believe 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.150
 or leave all information is more 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.980
 techniques on the blog are for you then 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.750
 if you want to know a little bit more 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.950
 on the computer that I'm going to leave the 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.710

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.380

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:58.120

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.580
