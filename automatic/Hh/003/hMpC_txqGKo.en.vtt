then<00:01:58.649> it'll<00:01:59.009> work<00:01:59.040> fine<00:01:59.399> because<00:01:59.939> that's<00:02:00.360> come

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
then it'll work fine because that's come

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.789 
then it'll work fine because that's come
with<00:02:00.630> these<00:02:00.719> little<00:02:00.869> templates<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.619> really

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
with these little templates not really

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.130 
with these little templates not really
sure<00:02:02.180> they're<00:02:03.180> out<00:02:03.210> there's<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.840> different

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
sure they're out there's some different

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.109 
sure they're out there's some different
sizes<00:02:04.380> but<00:02:04.799> I'm<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:05.009> sure<00:02:05.219> which<00:02:05.610> ones<00:02:05.880> for

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
sizes but I'm not sure which ones for

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.999 
sizes but I'm not sure which ones for
which<00:02:06.149> try<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.990> using<00:02:07.259> them<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.500> time<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.979> I

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
which try to using them one time and I

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.339 
which try to using them one time and I
think<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.220> almost<00:02:08.399> made<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.670> worse<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.780> it

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
think it almost made it worse but it

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.050 
think it almost made it worse but it
works<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.739> fine<00:02:10.920> without<00:02:11.250> dock<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.790> just

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
works just fine without dock so I just

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.050 
works just fine without dock so I just
can<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.629> that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
can I just do that

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.030 
can I just do that
so<00:02:15.060> here's<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.930> comes<00:02:16.110> with<00:02:16.230> an<00:02:16.350> antenna<00:02:16.710> for

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
so here's that comes with an antenna for

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.620 
so here's that comes with an antenna for
radio<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.180> plug<00:02:18.360> into<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.720> back<00:02:18.870> and

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
radio and you plug into the back and

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.860 
radio and you plug into the back and
that's<00:02:21.630> what<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.900> looks<00:02:21.930> like<00:02:23.030> input<00:02:24.030> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
that's what it looks like input and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.390 
that's what it looks like input and
everything<00:02:26.990> back<00:02:27.990> one<00:02:28.710> question<00:02:29.070> was<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.370> I

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
everything back one question was is I

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.630 
everything back one question was is I
have<00:02:29.640> red<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.510> white<00:02:30.810> cables<00:02:31.530> imports<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
have red and white cables imports on the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.870 
have red and white cables imports on the
back<00:02:32.820> no<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.660> does<00:02:33.840> not

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
back no it does not

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.730 
back no it does not
unfortunately<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.120> believe<00:02:36.840> so

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
unfortunately I believe so

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.550 
unfortunately I believe so
I<00:02:38.090> don't<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:39.270> sure<00:02:39.510> what<00:02:39.840> these<00:02:39.960> two<00:02:40.350> notches

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
I don't not sure what these two notches

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.220 
I don't not sure what these two notches
are<00:02:40.950> for<00:02:41.220> they<00:02:41.580> could<00:02:41.640> be<00:02:42.150> maybe<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.080> could

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
are for they could be maybe you could

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.140 
are for they could be maybe you could
add<00:02:43.350> something<00:02:43.650> else<00:02:43.890> not<00:02:44.460> completely<00:02:45.090> sure

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
add something else not completely sure

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.140 
add something else not completely sure
see<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.200> refurbish<00:02:46.710> sticker<00:02:46.980> right<00:02:47.070> there<00:02:47.220> so

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
see the refurbish sticker right there so

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.450 
see the refurbish sticker right there so
they<00:02:49.080> might<00:02:49.260> be<00:02:49.290> something<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:50.040> don't<00:02:50.310> really

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
they might be something I don't really

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.080 
they might be something I don't really
think<00:02:50.550> so

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
think so

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.450 
think so
I'm<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.330> really<00:02:51.540> an<00:02:51.720> audio<00:02:52.460> professional

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
I'm not really an audio professional

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.660 
I'm not really an audio professional
sort<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.760> thing<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:53.970> couldn't<00:02:54.720> tell<00:02:54.900> but<00:02:55.710> right

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
sort of thing so couldn't tell but right

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.880 
sort of thing so couldn't tell but right
now<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.880> only<00:02:57.060> two<00:02:57.390> labeled<00:02:57.840> imports<00:02:58.500> are<00:02:58.680> for

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
now the only two labeled imports are for

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.340 
now the only two labeled imports are for
the<00:02:58.950> speakers<00:02:59.480> so<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.510> guess<00:03:00.720> speakers<00:03:01.140> left

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
the speakers so I guess speakers left

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.210 
the speakers so I guess speakers left
and<00:03:01.470> right<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.920> then<00:03:02.760> for<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.300> antenna<00:03:04.220> so

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
and right and then for the antenna so

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.260 
and right and then for the antenna so
and<00:03:05.670> then<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:06.210> have<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.840> speaker<00:03:08.120> cables<00:03:09.120> right

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
and then I have the speaker cables right

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.610 
and then I have the speaker cables right
here<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.470> we<00:03:10.590> got<00:03:10.770> a<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:13.140> I'm<00:03:13.260> really<00:03:13.440> not

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
here so we got a that I'm really not

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.110 
here so we got a that I'm really not
sure<00:03:13.830> if<00:03:13.980> these<00:03:14.100> are<00:03:14.160> just<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.550> standard

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
sure if these are just like a standard

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.620 
sure if these are just like a standard
cable<00:03:15.960> for<00:03:16.260> speakers<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.800> don't<00:03:16.980> believe<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.630> so

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
cable for speakers I don't believe so so

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.200 
cable for speakers I don't believe so so
but<00:03:18.960> um<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:20.130> those<00:03:20.310> are<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.520> speaker<00:03:20.850> cables

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
but um so those are the speaker cables

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.530 
but um so those are the speaker cables
that<00:03:21.840> connect<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.850> those<00:03:23.850> speakers<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:26.300> in<00:03:27.300> my

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
that connect to those speakers so in my

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.290 
that connect to those speakers so in my
opinion<00:03:27.680> overall<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:29.010> system<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> lot

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
opinion overall this system is a lot

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.180 
opinion overall this system is a lot
better<00:03:30.540> than<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:30.780> home<00:03:31.110> just<00:03:31.440> because<00:03:31.740> it<00:03:32.040> has

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
better than I home just because it has

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.250 
better than I home just because it has
better<00:03:32.790> speakers<00:03:33.330> because<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.050> pretty<00:03:34.170> much

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
better speakers because it pretty much

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.960 
better speakers because it pretty much
has<00:03:34.350> all<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.860> same<00:03:35.040> systems<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.580> doesn't<00:03:35.610> have

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
has all the same systems it doesn't have

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.180 
has all the same systems it doesn't have
an<00:03:36.060> alarm<00:03:36.330> though<00:03:36.630> which<00:03:37.080> sometimes<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.040> kind
