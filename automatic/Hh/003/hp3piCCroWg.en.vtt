Lady<00:03:39.519> Rose<00:03:40.480> plate<00:03:40.810> yeah<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:41.920> it's<00:03:42.069> more

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
Lady Rose plate yeah so it's more

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.929 
Lady Rose plate yeah so it's more
efficient<00:03:42.790> exactly<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:45.250> execution<00:03:45.849> is

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
efficient exactly the execution is

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.130 
efficient exactly the execution is
something<00:03:46.239> that's<00:03:46.329> a<00:03:46.480> lot<00:03:46.659> like<00:03:46.840> being<00:03:47.049> a

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
something that's a lot like being a

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.930
