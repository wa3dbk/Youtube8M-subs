00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
project my radio warm saw that was built

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.359 
project my radio warm saw that was built
into<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.140> original<00:01:07.590> bench<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.159> been

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
into the original bench and it's been

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.850 
into the original bench and it's been
staying<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:08.850> ever<00:01:09.210> since<00:01:09.530> various<00:01:10.530> stuff

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
staying there ever since various stuff

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.280 
staying there ever since various stuff
down<00:01:11.070> below<00:01:11.540> compressor<00:01:12.540> which<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.840> portable

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
down below compressor which is portable

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.789 
down below compressor which is portable
that<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:14.159> when<00:01:14.400> i<00:01:14.430> did<00:01:14.700> my<00:01:14.850> barroom

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
that was what when i did my barroom

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.200 
that was what when i did my barroom
various<00:01:16.799> machines<00:01:16.950> down<00:01:17.400> below<00:01:17.640> rather<00:01:17.970> than

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
various machines down below rather than

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.200 
various machines down below rather than
the<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.689> my<00:01:19.130> air<00:01:20.130> compressor<00:01:20.460> hose<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the like my air compressor hose for the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.660 
the like my air compressor hose for the
air<00:01:21.390> guns<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.110> nail<00:01:22.470> guns<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
air guns the nail guns and the like and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.880 
air guns the nail guns and the like and
this<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.689> nice<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.170> addition<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.830> I

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
this is a nice little addition and I

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.649 
this is a nice little addition and I
built<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.840> bench<00:01:27.840> top<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.430> this<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
built the bench top on this is a

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.270 
built the bench top on this is a
provable<00:01:30.659> stop<00:01:30.990> block<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.530> moves<00:01:31.740> along<00:01:32.040> this

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
provable stop block it moves along this

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.780 
provable stop block it moves along this
track<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.890> is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
track and what you can do with that is

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
track and what you can do with that is
you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.540> make<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.869> set<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> at<00:01:37.320> any<00:01:37.470> length<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
you can make it set it at any length and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.539 
you can make it set it at any length and
that<00:01:38.610> allows<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.890> bottled<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that allows you to you bottled up to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.100 
that allows you to you bottled up to
that<00:01:41.670> at<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> setting<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> gives<00:01:42.960> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that at a setting and it gives you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.160 
that at a setting and it gives you
repetitive<00:01:43.829> repetitive<00:01:44.460> cuts<00:01:44.840> back<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
repetitive repetitive cuts back and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.639 
repetitive repetitive cuts back and
forth<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.979> each<00:01:47.909> cut<00:01:48.299> will<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.750> exactly<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
forth and each cut will be exactly the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.620 
forth and each cut will be exactly the
same<00:01:49.680> length<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.000> nice<00:01:51.180> little<00:01:51.329> feature

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
same length it's a nice little feature

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.310 
same length it's a nice little feature
for<00:01:52.340> bats<00:01:53.340> cutting<00:01:53.850> stuff<00:01:54.149> again<00:01:54.780> more<00:01:55.020> stuff

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
for bats cutting stuff again more stuff

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.550 
for bats cutting stuff again more stuff
