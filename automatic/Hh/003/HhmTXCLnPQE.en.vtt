at the same time we still be using the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.200 
at the same time we still be using the
modern<00:00:58.980> tools<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.340> try<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.670> create<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.030> all

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
modern tools to try and create that all

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.959 
modern tools to try and create that all
sound<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.809> makes<00:01:01.020> sense<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.340> just

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
sound if that makes sense so I just

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:12.350 
sound if that makes sense so I just
believe<00:01:03.719> let's<00:01:03.930> see<00:01:04.049> how<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.199> goes<00:01:11.030> we<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.060> in

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360

my fender and my porous meteor but

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.190 
my fender and my porous meteor but
eventually<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.580> decided<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> go<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
eventually we decided to go for the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.460 
eventually we decided to go for the
Telecaster<00:01:26.040> straight<00:01:26.880> without<00:01:27.509> any<00:01:27.689> pedals

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
Telecaster straight without any pedals

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.870 
Telecaster straight without any pedals
into<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.579> fender<00:01:30.259> reverb<00:01:31.430> just<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.520> give<00:01:32.729> us

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
into the fender reverb just to give us

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.520 
into the fender reverb just to give us
that<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:34.820> classic<00:01:35.820> kind<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.840> sound<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that really classic kind of a sound and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.109 
that really classic kind of a sound and
the<00:01:37.619> tail<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:37.950> got<00:01:38.070> more<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.579> fuller<00:01:38.820> sound

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the tail it's got more of a fuller sound

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.240 
the tail it's got more of a fuller sound
and<00:01:39.390> straight<00:01:39.780> that's<00:01:40.409> why<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> eventually<00:01:40.890> we

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and straight that's why I eventually we

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.940 
and straight that's why I eventually we
decided<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.240> one

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.680 

so<00:01:48.950> what<00:01:49.700> we're<00:01:49.790> going<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:49.940> do<00:01:50.060> now<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.540> going

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
so what we're going to do now is going

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.200 
so what we're going to do now is going
to<00:01:50.810> mark<00:01:51.050> up<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.470> guitar<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.580> electric

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
to mark up the guitar so the electric

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.150 
to mark up the guitar so the electric
guitar<00:01:53.300> is<00:01:54.080> going<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.350> be<00:01:54.410> plugged<00:01:54.650> into<00:01:54.890> the

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
guitar is going to be plugged into the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.310 
guitar is going to be plugged into the
amplifier<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.330> amplifier<00:01:56.480> is<00:01:57.170> then

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
amplifier and the amplifier is then

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.780 
amplifier and the amplifier is then
going<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.500> be<00:01:57.590> recorded<00:01:58.070> with<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.250> condenser

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
going to be recorded with a condenser

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.610 
going to be recorded with a condenser
microphone<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.810> this<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.140> condenser

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
microphone so this is a condenser

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.830 
microphone so this is a condenser
microphone<00:02:00.830> this<00:02:01.580> is<00:02:01.640> already<00:02:01.880> in<00:02:02.240> t2<00:02:02.450> and

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
microphone this is already in t2 and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.260 
microphone this is already in t2 and
