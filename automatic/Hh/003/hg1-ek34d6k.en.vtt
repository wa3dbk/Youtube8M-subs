performance<00:01:51.580> review<00:01:54.100> all<00:01:55.100> right<00:01:55.250> let's<00:01:55.550> begin

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.119 

as<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.310> car<00:02:17.549> except<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:19.129> the

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
as you can see this car except in the

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.990 
as you can see this car except in the
game<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.760> running<00:02:21.560> less<00:02:22.560> than<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.129> TNT<00:02:23.610> Isis

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
game is running less than the TNT Isis

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.270 
game is running less than the TNT Isis
is<00:02:24.900> pretty<00:02:25.680> much<00:02:26.780> specialities<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:28.260> use<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
is pretty much specialities as use the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.869 
is pretty much specialities as use the
magnet<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.849> our<00:02:32.780> benchmark<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:34.379> what<00:02:34.920> we<00:02:35.159> we

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
magnet is our benchmark in what we we

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.399 
magnet is our benchmark in what we we
thought<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.329> sprayable<00:02:36.659> daily<00:02:39.109> let's<00:02:40.109> change

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
thought a sprayable daily let's change

00:02:40.409 --> 00:03:09.490 
thought a sprayable daily let's change
the<00:02:40.560> setting<00:02:40.950> then

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.710 

let<00:03:10.500> me<00:03:10.620> small<00:03:10.980> bearable<00:03:12.019> there<00:03:13.019> is<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:15.480> know

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
let me small bearable there is you know

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.600 
let me small bearable there is you know
still<00:03:16.709> not<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.310> FPS<00:03:19.010> came<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.280> be<00:03:20.370> honest

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
still not that the FPS came to be honest

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.339 
still not that the FPS came to be honest
this<00:03:20.849> Cataclysm<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.660> not<00:03:21.870> even<00:03:22.400> less<00:03:24.349> intense

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
this Cataclysm is not even less intense

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:34.790 
this Cataclysm is not even less intense
in<00:03:25.830> this<00:03:26.250> game

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:04:02.380 

it<00:03:35.800> was<00:03:35.980> again

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.740 

it's<00:04:03.390> just<00:04:03.629> like<00:04:03.840> every<00:04:04.140> day<00:04:04.170> but<00:04:04.590> still<00:04:05.750> love

2<00:04:07.019> tsps

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.440 

well<00:04:21.440> given<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:21.740> you<00:04:22.400> know<00:04:22.580> this<00:04:22.820> is<00:04:23.120> the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
well given that you know this is the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.200 
well given that you know this is the
integrated<00:04:24.200> of<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.470> car<00:04:24.740> this<00:04:24.980> is<00:04:26.740> not<00:04:27.740> bad

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
integrated of the car this is not bad

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.150 
integrated of the car this is not bad
but<00:04:29.210> nevertheless<00:04:29.480> it's<00:04:30.290> not<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.590> depth<00:04:30.860> and

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
but nevertheless it's not the depth and

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.180 
but nevertheless it's not the depth and
so<00:04:31.450> you<00:04:32.450> wouldn't<00:04:32.630> want<00:04:33.170> to<00:04:35.230> run<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:37.010> city

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
so you wouldn't want to run the city

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.670 
so you wouldn't want to run the city
came<00:04:37.460> this<00:04:38.230> happy

came this happy
okay<00:04:39.950> let's<00:04:40.190> try<00:04:40.520> our<00:04:40.850> last<00:04:41.570> graphics<00:04:42.410> we<00:04:42.710> said

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
okay let's try our last graphics we said

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.360 
okay let's try our last graphics we said
pretty<00:04:44.090> much<00:04:44.350> don't<00:04:45.350> always<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:45.800> think<00:04:45.860> that<00:04:46.190> we

pretty much don't always I think that we

00:04:46.370 --> 00:05:09.610 
pretty much don't always I think that we
go

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620
