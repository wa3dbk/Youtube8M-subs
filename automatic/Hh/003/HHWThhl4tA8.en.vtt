00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
carry on back here to some rubble that

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.240 
carry on back here to some rubble that
fell

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
fell

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.150 
fell
a<00:01:30.280> little<00:01:30.610> bit<00:01:31.030> of<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.240> bush<00:01:31.510> here<00:01:31.930> behind<00:01:32.680> this

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
a little bit of a bush here behind this

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.740 
a little bit of a bush here behind this
bush<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.640> see<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.940> blocks<00:01:34.180> we<00:01:34.330> get<00:01:34.480> to<00:01:34.540> get<00:01:34.690> up

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
bush you see the blocks we get to get up

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.920 
bush you see the blocks we get to get up
on<00:01:35.100> first<00:01:36.100> step<00:01:36.430> is<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.730> get<00:01:37.360> up<00:01:37.540> on<00:01:37.690> these

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
on first step is to get up on these

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.590 
on first step is to get up on these
rocks<00:01:38.230> and<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.670> think<00:01:39.850> it's<00:01:39.970> easier<00:01:40.270> if<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.479> go

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
rocks and I think it's easier if you go

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.780 
rocks and I think it's easier if you go
around<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:41.170> backside

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.230 

if<00:01:44.060> you'll<00:01:44.300> run<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.480> back<00:01:44.690> side<00:01:44.960> it's<00:01:45.080> easier

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
if you'll run the back side it's easier

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.770 
if you'll run the back side it's easier
so<00:01:46.840> get<00:01:47.049> here<00:01:47.409> which<00:01:47.650> I'm<00:01:47.829> Peter<00:01:48.100> here<00:01:48.579> and<00:01:49.299> our

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
actually the wrong way the right way is

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.800 
actually the wrong way the right way is
to<00:05:16.770> go<00:05:16.800> here<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.520> jump<00:05:17.760> on<00:05:17.970> that<00:05:18.150> platform

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
to go here and jump on that platform

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.210 
to go here and jump on that platform
right<00:05:19.230> there<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:20.070> it's<00:05:20.790> a<00:05:20.880> long<00:05:21.090> jump<00:05:21.390> so<00:05:22.380> just

right there and it's a long jump so just

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.960 
right there and it's a long jump so just
go<00:05:23.520> and<00:05:23.820> jump<00:05:24.720> there<00:05:25.110> we<00:05:25.230> go<00:05:25.380> I<00:05:25.590> did<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:25.980> that's
