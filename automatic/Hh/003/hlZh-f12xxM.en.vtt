thing I told you teeny smaller younger
the<00:00:24.869> better<00:00:24.900> quality<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.490> need<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.880> heat

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the better quality but we need the heat

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.259 
the better quality but we need the heat
so<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> heat<00:00:28.349> without<00:00:29.099> oil<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.670> destroy<00:00:30.090> the

so the heat without oil to destroy the
leaves<00:00:30.859> okay<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:31.920> now<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.219> show<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.579> how<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.030 

every<00:00:36.719> time<00:00:36.930> before<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.290> try<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.500> leaves<00:00:37.829> we

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
every time before we try the leaves we

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.740 
every time before we try the leaves we
put<00:00:38.250> some<00:00:38.430> okay<00:00:39.680> see<00:00:40.680> melted<00:00:44.750> melted

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
put some okay see melted melted

put some okay see melted melted
immediately<00:00:46.379> right<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.640> put<00:00:47.789> leaves<00:00:48.030> by

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
immediately right there we put leaves by

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.420 
immediately right there we put leaves by
the<00:00:49.020> way<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> very<00:00:49.649> loudly

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the way this is very loudly

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.029 
the way this is very loudly
whatever's<00:00:51.180> finishing<00:00:51.660> we're<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.829> put

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
whatever's finishing we're going to put

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.060 
whatever's finishing we're going to put
the<00:00:53.160> crash<00:00:54.379> okay<00:00:55.640> temperature<00:00:56.640> nigga<00:00:57.390> gets

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
the crash okay temperature nigga gets

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.240 
the crash okay temperature nigga gets
180<00:00:59.070> Fahrenheit<00:01:00.079> how<00:01:01.079> people<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:02.070> bear

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
180 Fahrenheit how people that can bear

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.530 
180 Fahrenheit how people that can bear
the<00:01:02.399> heat

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.360 

like<00:01:08.140> this<00:01:08.850> emitter<00:01:09.850> you<00:01:09.940> can<00:01:10.150> fire<00:01:11.370> food

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
like this emitter you can fire food

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.570 
like this emitter you can fire food
there<00:01:13.150> are<00:01:13.240> two<00:01:13.390> reasons<00:01:13.600> of<00:01:14.040> poor<00:01:15.040> form<00:01:15.250> and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
there are two reasons of poor form and

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.140 
there are two reasons of poor form and
driving<00:01:16.000> first<00:01:16.660> heating<00:01:17.470> is<00:01:17.680> very<00:01:17.710> young<00:01:18.460> so

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
driving first heating is very young so

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.300 
driving first heating is very young so
if<00:01:19.270> you<00:01:19.390> use<00:01:19.600> machine<00:01:20.050> to<00:01:20.170> try<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.680> cut<00:01:20.890> broken

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
if you use machine to try to cut broken

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.750 
if you use machine to try to cut broken
a<00:01:21.580> very<00:01:22.440> important<00:01:23.440> principle<00:01:23.620> to<00:01:23.980> judge<00:01:24.430> good

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
a very important principle to judge good

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.390 
a very important principle to judge good
quality<00:01:25.150> of<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.450> code<00:01:25.690> is<00:01:25.900> I<00:01:26.290> told<00:01:26.800> you<00:01:26.950> three

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
quality of that code is I told you three

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.020 
quality of that code is I told you three
sample<00:01:28.300> sizes<00:01:28.870> for<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.980> Science<00:01:30.550> Monitor

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
better future service smelled better and

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.630 
better future service smelled better and
Leiden<00:01:34.870> carbonate<00:01:35.320> right<00:01:35.560> but<00:01:36.010> another<00:01:36.460> one

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
the last but not least must be well

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.060 
the last but not least must be well
shaped<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:40.180> imagine<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:40.630> whether<00:01:41.620> T<00:01:41.860> wasn't

shaped so imagine that whether T wasn't
broken<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:43.630> not<00:01:43.840> good<00:01:44.050> shape<00:01:44.260> so<00:01:44.590> we<00:01:45.190> never

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
broken it's not good shape so we never

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.580 
broken it's not good shape so we never

secretly<00:01:50.800> you<00:01:51.280> know<00:01:51.430> where<00:01:51.610> we<00:01:57.990> see<00:01:58.990> one

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.070 

and<00:02:02.830> also<00:02:03.180> when<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.240> try<00:02:04.510> it<00:02:05.880> strikes<00:02:06.880> now<00:02:07.150> he

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
and also when you try it strikes now he

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.620 
and also when you try it strikes now he
was<00:02:08.350> put<00:02:08.560> in<00:02:08.740> between<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:09.820> it's<00:02:10.000> not<00:02:10.209> really

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
was put in between so it's not really

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.460 
was put in between so it's not really

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
touch this key so first second reason we

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.040 
touch this key so first second reason we
have<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.890> use<00:02:15.040> our<00:02:15.220> poll<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:16.390> feel<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.870> right

have to use our poll to feel the right
temperature<00:02:17.790> if<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.970> team<00:02:19.209> can<00:02:19.810> be<00:02:19.840> too<00:02:20.080> high

temperature if the team can be too high
or<00:02:20.320> too<00:02:20.470> low<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:21.280> bad<00:02:21.850> for<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> quality<00:02:22.810> of

probation the thermometer

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.819 
probation the thermometer
then<00:02:28.000> we<00:02:28.120> try<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.329> this<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.379> probably<00:02:29.739> a

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
then we try to this is probably a

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.589 
then we try to this is probably a
quarter<00:02:30.159> of<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.519> kill<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.849> quarter<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.359> a<00:02:31.420> kilo

quarter of a kill the quarter of a kilo

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.899 
quarter of a kill the quarter of a kilo
takes<00:02:32.349> one<00:02:32.650> two<00:02:32.829> and<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.040> half<00:02:33.219> hours<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.760> make
