00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:05.810
 hello here is a bio cook we 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.729
 make today stuffed pasta and that with 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.729
 a modified polonaise 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:28.840
 we need for one at the end, the need 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.580
 then to a kind of crisis 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.030
 we could do that a little bit now 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:38.020
 yes for the filling we have 100 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.850
 percent minced beef nyse onions munich 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.430
 bit of celery an astonished one 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.379
 tomato paste spices salt pepper 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.210
 of course, a bit poppy herbal 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.430
 provence I have a few grains of sand 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.019
 I always find it very much together with me 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.400
 just a very nice consistency in the 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:01:03.699
 principle like a polonaise we do 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:06.300
 the meat in the walter the vegetables 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.300
 really fight 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.490
 you want why 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.880
 to be something more 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.049
 the filling of krepl 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.360
 called tomato marrow 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.439
 and rhythmically 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.680
 should the whole with the 14 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:30.180
 friday shows the tomatenmark 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.720
 optimal 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.130
 we let the whole dry again 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.870
 put on the side of pink richeza the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.020
 meat we still need cola 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.710
 pesto so rucola and a little bit eight 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.840
 Asss to the scattering grant only what 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.580
 Of course that's why water is something 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.600
 vegetable broth exceeds sea salt 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:03.540
 Okay, we're just adding a model 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:09.470
 strip must be properly mail first 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:21.060
 I have to turn to mine for that 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:22.850
 roll out a bit thin of course 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.640
 also use the pasta machine 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:30.080
 It is worthwhile relatively fast thing 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.080
 I really do not want to unpack 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:42.710
 Relatively google wheels edges business 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.710
 do 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.620
 the meat mass we had one 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.760
 put tablespoons in the middle 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:06.450
 Of course you have to be cool because of that 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:10.680
 have you done a bit of rolling 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:15.349
 then cut off too much then like a point 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.349
 Make it look like this 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:27.139
 lay side 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.139
 press the same again 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:35.570
 she stands like a bonbon 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.570
 to press 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.410
 on the one hand , still a few if 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.410
 your work is done it goes on 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.720
 complete would be commentary now you cook 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:08.000
 do not make the buck, it can of course 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.680
 not so, for example, which originally only gets 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.620
 Of course out of the way because they are not on 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.090
 They constantly share a lot of talent 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.710
 I have to pull it for about two minutes now 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.840
 that she did everything has to be easy 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.310
 only get hot when the lid on it 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.820
 really be very careful 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.060
 said adjust ok you see I already 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.890
 Just do it on it that's enough 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.090
 but the pasta already has five minutes 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.090
 they now go very slowly in front of him 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.290
 drawn watching the course breaks 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.290
 relatively easy apart 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:52.880
 three possible ones in so small 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:06:05.440
 Pour bit off, each of the aso 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:05.440
 not too frugal with 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:27.790
 If ye have such an old cheese perfectly the 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.140
 is super relatively easy it fits 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.110
 I was not so dependent on that 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:35.760
 and super league has the bath for guests 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.760
 impression super delicious looks great 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.760
 profit greed
