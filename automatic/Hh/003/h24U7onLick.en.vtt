00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.420
 and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.490
 this is certainly one of the recipes that 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.600
 more bombed on the internet this year 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.000
 2014 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.280
 is that chocolate ball very way 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.970
 that when we throw hot syrup her 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.730
 melts and reveals an ice cream inside is 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.500

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.629
 Shoot when they become your friends 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.520
 because he is super easy to overcome 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.040
 pressed since Saturday is as follows 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.140
 We 'll get the chocolate powder for 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.070
 chocolate in the processor because what the 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.650
 people want him to be well 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.750
 Little one for us it was low 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.090
 temperature that will separate in two 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.680
 containers we will melt from 20 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.050
 21 seconds each time you pass twenty 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.909
 Seconds, we give a little stir. 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.800
 plus 20 seconds of media continue 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.080
 liquid remains effective we 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.120
 triggers the other part of the chocolate and 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.750
 the same procedure until it is 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.030
 liquid before starting and putting our 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.640
 chocolate in our ways we will go 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.710
 pick up this paper here that is used a lot 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.990
 not to vote 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.729
 superfinal to put our strength here in 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.820
 Up and we 'll get our chocolate. 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.620
 is detained and will place 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.630
 cups of us will push to 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.510
 own woman around so he can 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.010
 stay sharp the corners if you missed 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.170
 much over the hour it has spread 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.720
 chocolate is cool with the woman herself 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.110
 So you do it and take the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.270
 Because at the time you're not the chocolate 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.300
 melted it gets pretty cute stay 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.980
 well round we do it 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.900
 ne spread on the edges so come from 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.310
 I paid the whole price 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.200
 and you logically exchange the paper 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.030
 in my case there was not much access that I 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.489
 I will have little chocolate but I will stay 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.550
 much to you exchange the paper that later 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.390
 boot in the refrigerator that is to stiffen the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.530
 chocolate 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.019
 Now we're going to work on that. 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.120
 a very sweet tail of caramel that 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.250
 people will play on top of our 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.000
 chocolate our super easy guys 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.310

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.340
 We 'll get the head kring at 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.260
 butter and brown sugar and will put 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.689
 in the pot until everything 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.599

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.500
 a lot is just the chocolate has come out 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.569
 refrigerator 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.629
 so here is the shovel taking our shape 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.360
 we hold people at the ends and just push 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.220
 by the way, or if you made a 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.829

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.540

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.569
 peanut will get a good one from a spoon 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.819

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.440

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.790

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.470
 day just to move forward 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:14.760
 and then with the spoon you make a kind 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.709
 of x - ray and if it's going to stay I like this 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.810
 that when we put the ball 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.280
