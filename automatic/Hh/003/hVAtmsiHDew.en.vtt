00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
that doesn't really seem weird like it

that doesn't really seem weird like it
seems<00:03:36.000> different<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.479> me<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:38.549> does<00:03:38.760> have<00:03:39.000> the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
seems different to me it does have the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.420 
seems different to me it does have the
splitted<00:03:39.629> grips<00:03:39.900> may<00:03:40.680> fit<00:03:40.919> back<00:03:41.069> it<00:03:41.220> up<00:03:41.280> you

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430

can<00:03:41.519> see<00:03:41.699> that<00:03:41.849> as<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.120> split<00:03:42.509> for<00:03:43.079> extra<00:03:43.799> one

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
can see that as a split for extra one

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.879 
can see that as a split for extra one
casting<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.609> more<00:03:44.900> like<00:03:45.900> powerful<00:03:46.229> casts<00:03:46.769> and
