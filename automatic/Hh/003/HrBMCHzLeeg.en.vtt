00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.219
 or united people is this tutorial 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.809
 simple in which I'm going to show you 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.960
 how to grow mushrooms here in 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.429
 minecraft at 1.3 points and up 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.380
 previous conversions because as 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:24.140
 you will know there was a new function 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.910
 of minecraft and allows now I live a 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.249
 cruel disadvantage for many who now 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.380
 they are nothing more than they will be in the 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.460
 land called michelle yum that 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.129
 get in the language of mushrooms 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.360
 you can see what the attempts express here 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.160
 it presents them on the normal earth 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.930
 would like to let you plant 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.390
 these same eyes can be found in 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.390
 desert 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.270
 but even if I try to make them grow, 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.470
 can easily show sunrise here or to 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.120
 the sand of the soul falls on the skin 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.450
 and in the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.010
 and in the underworld 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.920
 not even plant them in the world 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.100
 normal in the month and I let them plant this 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.890
 is because they have a roof if the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.900
 mushrooms now in minecraft 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.150
 allows it to grow if they have a 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.910
 the ceiling 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.890
 for example let's see if he planted at least one 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.240
 tree where you look for a tree to see a 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.799
 jungle tree 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.200
 This I have done this a tree 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.920
 of the jungle that are the highest I know if I 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.920
 lets see it 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.229
 this tree has a roof in general that 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.360
 follow these sheets and now as you can 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.040
 watch 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.850
 this leaves planted so much in this 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.040
 as with this fungus 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.870
 now if you try to be express you do not know 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.840
 will leave a few mushrooms 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.820
 even if they grow 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.530
 although who to his crossed his stem of 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.420
 occupies only one block has this roof 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.920
 that occupy in total 1 2 3 4 5 blocks 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.350
 this as well as colom that this occupies 7 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.170
 blocks wide this almost everything 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.600
 They give me also how good these are all 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.130
 almost fungi are two mushrooms for this one and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.990
 two class donated for this one small one not 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:15.900
 high like this one way is this way 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.050
 although it is not aesthetic a ceiling with 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.020
 to do is a roof over first 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.710
 we have to count it, given that you have in mind 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.770
 this would be the earth we will find 1 2 3 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.620
 4 5 6 7 the apple tree all the fungi 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.660
 mi-17 block high meets a ceiling of 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.530
 more than 7 blocks high the same should 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.530
 to be here to show you 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.570
 3 4 5 6 7 in that we have the limit of 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.110
 that the limit of the highest mushroom is one 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.130
 more so that you have a space 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.020
 and wide 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.390
 he is in the river in the highest fungus 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:59.310
 this fungus for example that has 5 x 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.730
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 also high but 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:08.090
 difference of width from 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:10.630
 1 2 3 4 5 wide by 5 also years 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:16.240
 this difference has 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:19.590
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 wide as well as 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.330
 I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.709
 and high has 1 2 3 4 5 been mariah 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.140
 good no matter take away 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.890
 highest fungus of this east 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.990
 try to pass a high ceiling 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.700
 with about 81 that high already has a 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.800
 perfect roof to be mushrooms and 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.840
 spread it around how they saw the 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.210
 wider massage the fungus always 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.030
 I make brown he is the widest 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.960
 which is 77 wide if they can do it 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.790
 an 8 x 8 roof and with that perfect 2 3 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.790
 4 5 6 7 8 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.959
 400 67 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.959
 8 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.519
 we gather 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.700
 and also cost with filling it because if 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:13.730
 not yet it will not tell why have base 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.409
 does not imply anything in the filling 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.910
 in these classes in america is a lot 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.109
 same these sessions that have made 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.239
 many mics I did not like because 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.400
 they had more difficulties the fungi were 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.220
 cultivated is sold with those on the floor and 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.639
 with the bone powder or thousand as in 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.120
 English 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.530
 this contains this roof be more than 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.340
 enough even need you need 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.980
 bases 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.930
 this protest this fact and leave it here 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.310
 it is enough to be able to grow a 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.110
 fungus 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:47.830
 I put in the mushroom and 2000 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:51.110
 well I guess with 1000 or polbo that 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.680
 with a couple of a few thousand already 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.840
 the fungus grew 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.590
 and for those who do not believe me in these 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.220
 he tried without a roof teach me how to grow it 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.320
 I will try in this one in this one wants 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.870
 because what is spoken at home 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.560
 find a couple of a couple of cubes of 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.560
 far why 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.770
 it was not at home that noise is myers own 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.770
 I'm going to save you all this 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:25.249
 try to find about 88 cubes 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.860
 in the distance along already because although 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.139
 I tried to do it with 0 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.870
 he will not leave me because this cube is 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.699
 kings that intrude is like a tree 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.770
 the tree allows us not to grow next to 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.210
 a wall so close to the leaves in 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.320
 expand 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.110
 as well as this that we were shot 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.730
 the 44 processed 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.120
 even so I know when in the distance with the 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.380
 leaves 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.210
 after more simple doctors to 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.980
 that they can grow mushrooms because 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.570
 Minecraft forums does not explain very well 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.490
 How do you say nothing to 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.490
 find michelle yum 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.960
 plant the fungus and make it grow is what 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.820
 only we have and they say do not explain 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.010
 that now for being a roof nothing more 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.240
 know the roof of 8 x more stars 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.180
 what tourists to grow it 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.930
 immediately said this respect i 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.930
 what I want to check is 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.490
 can see I'm under the roof for a 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.039
 little shadow need in themselves 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.740
 and it's grown even if it's a little bar 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.720
 of light nothing happens while you are 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.790
 well put under the weather under this 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.520
 the ceiling 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.409
 or perfect and good is that's all 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.779
 people 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.429
 comment subscribe rate share 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:40.889
 people so they like to cultivate their 

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:40.889
 mushroom farm so I say goodbye 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.570
 good view of the mushrooms I'm giving it to me 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.570
 we see until the next video
