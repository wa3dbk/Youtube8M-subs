order to make it come to the background

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.230 
order to make it come to the background
you<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.740> go<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> layer<00:01:53.189> again<00:01:53.670> go<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you have to go to layer again go to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.080 
you have to go to layer again go to
stack<00:01:54.630> option<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> stack<00:01:56.460> option<00:01:56.880> go

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
stack option and in the stack option go

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.179 
stack option and in the stack option go
to<00:01:57.149> layer<00:01:57.390> at<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.509> bottom<00:01:57.799> once<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.159> that

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
to layer at the bottom once you do that

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.280 
to layer at the bottom once you do that
you<00:01:59.579> can<00:01:59.759> see<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> letter<00:02:00.390> S<00:02:00.630> now<00:02:00.930> has<00:02:01.259> a
