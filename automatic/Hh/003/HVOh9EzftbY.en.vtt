instance but overall we use a

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.630 
instance but overall we use a
tried-and-true<00:01:09.159> manufacturing<00:01:10.159> process

huh interesting in fact is aluminum

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.630 
huh interesting in fact is aluminum
material<00:01:23.929> costs<00:01:24.560> are<00:01:24.649> higher<00:01:24.829> than<00:01:25.070> steel<00:01:25.340> and

trucks<00:01:56.119> for<00:01:56.749> Silverados<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:57.679> four<00:01:57.979> f-150s

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
trucks for Silverados and four f-150s

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.120 
trucks for Silverados and four f-150s
and<00:01:59.030> they<00:01:59.539> inflicted<00:02:00.139> some<00:02:00.350> damage<00:02:00.740> on<00:02:00.920> them

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
using identical test procedures they

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.139 
using identical test procedures they
basically<00:02:04.039> recreated<00:02:04.579> what<00:02:04.759> would<00:02:04.880> happen

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149

of a vehicle like on a job site oh it

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.260 
of a vehicle like on a job site oh it
took<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.250> hit<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:10.610> like<00:02:10.880> that

you'd<00:02:49.370> be<00:02:49.460> taking<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.850> risk<00:02:50.030> at<00:02:50.630> Chevy<00:02:50.960> we<00:02:51.260> were

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
you'd be taking a risk at Chevy we were

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.080 
you'd be taking a risk at Chevy we were
aligned<00:02:51.620> what's<00:02:51.890> proven<00:02:52.130> like<00:02:52.610> high-strength

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
aligned what's proven like high-strength

well<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.700> guess<00:02:55.940> that's<00:02:56.150> why<00:02:56.300> they<00:02:56.480> don't<00:02:56.570> call

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
well I guess that's why they don't call

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.110 
well I guess that's why they don't call
that<00:02:56.870> superhero<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:57.950> man<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.370> aluminum<00:02:58.970> I

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120
