00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
gonna learn how to do the backside 360

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:14.629 
gonna learn how to do the backside 360
kickflip<00:00:03.840> on<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.110> fingerboard<00:00:13.190> okay<00:00:14.190> before<00:00:14.490> I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
kickflip on a fingerboard okay before I

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.880 
kickflip on a fingerboard okay before I
even<00:00:14.759> get<00:00:15.210> started<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.929> need<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.470> know<00:00:16.590> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
even get started you need to know to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.830 
even get started you need to know to
chicks<00:00:17.160> before<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.580> even<00:00:17.789> attempt<00:00:18.390> backside

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
chicks before you even attempt backside

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.990 
chicks before you even attempt backside
360<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.439> clips<00:00:19.710> that's<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.460> kickflip<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
360 can clips that's the kickflip and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.529 
360 can clips that's the kickflip and
the<00:00:21.510> backside<00:00:21.960> 180<00:00:22.529> kickflip<00:00:22.980> like<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.539> you

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the backside 180 kickflip like that you

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.849 
the backside 180 kickflip like that you
can't<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.930> those<00:00:25.050> two<00:00:25.230> chicks<00:00:25.410> don't<00:00:25.619> even

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
can't do those two chicks don't even

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.580 
can't do those two chicks don't even
think<00:00:25.949> about<00:00:26.070> trying<00:00:26.310> backside<00:00:26.730> 360<00:00:27.180> k<00:00:27.300> folks

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
think about trying backside 360 k folks

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.450 
think about trying backside 360 k folks
regardless<00:00:28.590> what<00:00:28.800> some<00:00:29.010> people<00:00:29.279> might<00:00:29.310> say

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
regardless what some people might say

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.209 
regardless what some people might say
this<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> very<00:00:30.240> hard<00:00:30.539> trick<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.289> reason<00:00:31.650> it

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
this is a very hard trick the reason it

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.250 
this is a very hard trick the reason it
is<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> hard<00:00:32.579> trick<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.930> requires

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
is a hard trick is because it requires

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.190 
is a hard trick is because it requires
you<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> kickflip<00:00:35.309> like<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.690> catch

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
you to do a kickflip like that and catch

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.799 
you to do a kickflip like that and catch
it<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.620> then<00:00:37.800> land<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.640> which<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.600> very

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
it and then land like this which is very

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350 
it and then land like this which is very
weird<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.410> some<00:00:40.530> people<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.100> faulty<00:00:42.000> 16

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
weird for some people it's a faulty 16

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.670 
weird for some people it's a faulty 16
vocation<00:00:42.840> which<00:00:42.960> means<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> start

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
vocation which means you have to start

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.880 
vocation which means you have to start
here<00:00:44.280> you're<00:00:45.030> gonna<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.390> 180<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.289> 360

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
here you're gonna do 180 and then 360

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
here you're gonna do 180 and then 360
that's<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.309> faulty<00:00:47.670> see<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.660> I'll<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.870> used<00:00:49.050> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that's a faulty see so I'll get used to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.700 
that's a faulty see so I'll get used to
that<00:00:49.320> that's<00:00:50.070> spinning<00:00:50.629> 360<00:00:51.629> motion<00:00:51.989> first

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that that's spinning 360 motion first

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.930 
that that's spinning 360 motion first
step<00:00:52.890> I'd<00:00:53.010> say<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.340> practice<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.760> kick

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
step I'd say is to practice your kick

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
step I'd say is to practice your kick
flips<00:00:54.180> normally<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.140> my<00:00:55.350> kickflips<00:00:55.680> about

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
flips normally I do my kickflips about

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.639 
flips normally I do my kickflips about
that<00:00:56.250> fast<00:00:56.520> pretty<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> pretty<00:00:58.379> fast

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that fast pretty I have a pretty fast

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.160 
that fast pretty I have a pretty fast
kickflip<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.699> when<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.210> backside<00:01:00.600> 360

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
kickflip but when I do backside 360

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.990 
kickflip but when I do backside 360
kickflip<00:01:01.530> still<00:01:01.770> gonna<00:01:01.920> flip<00:01:02.160> slower<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
kickflip still gonna flip slower the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
kickflip still gonna flip slower the
reason<00:01:03.329> why<00:01:03.480> I'll<00:01:03.840> explain<00:01:04.229> later<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:05.010> want<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
reason why I'll explain later we want to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
reason why I'll explain later we want to
try<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:05.549> kick<00:01:05.970> flips<00:01:06.210> higher<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
try to do your kick flips higher and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.410 
try to do your kick flips higher and
slower<00:01:07.650> than<00:01:07.860> usual<00:01:08.040> higher<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.000> slower<00:01:09.270> than

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
slower than usual higher and slower than

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
slower than usual higher and slower than
usual<00:01:12.049> you<00:01:13.049> want<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> try<00:01:13.409> catching<00:01:13.680> them<00:01:14.010> in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
usual you want to try catching them in

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.980 
usual you want to try catching them in
midair<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.610> very<00:01:14.790> crucial<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.600> next<00:01:15.869> step

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
midair it's very crucial the next step

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.289 
midair it's very crucial the next step
is<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.229> learn<00:01:16.470> backside<00:01:16.950> 270<00:01:17.430> kickflip<00:01:17.820> I'm

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
is to learn backside 270 kickflip I'm

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.280 
is to learn backside 270 kickflip I'm
not<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.659> demonstrate<00:01:18.780> right<00:01:19.140> now

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
not going to demonstrate right now

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.780 
not going to demonstrate right now
because<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.650> honestly<00:01:19.979> can't<00:01:20.189> do<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.400> first<00:01:20.580> try

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
because I honestly can't do it first try

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.050 
because I honestly can't do it first try
it's<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> very<00:01:21.270> difficult<00:01:21.990> move<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.520> backside

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it's a very difficult move but backside

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.730 
it's a very difficult move but backside
270<00:01:24.479> kick<00:01:24.689> flips<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:25.080> important<00:01:25.650> because

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
270 kick flips are important because

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.160 
270 kick flips are important because
generally<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.580> pivot<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.540> last<00:01:27.780> 90

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
generally you can pivot the last 90

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.429 
generally you can pivot the last 90
degrees<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.909> it'll<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.000> fine<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.570> know<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
degrees and it'll be fine I know you

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.800 
degrees and it'll be fine I know you
should<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.770> able<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.159> backside<00:01:32.579> flips<00:01:32.880> by

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
should be able to do backside flips by

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.260 
should be able to do backside flips by
now<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.579> rotate<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
now so all you have to do is rotate it a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.630 
now so all you have to do is rotate it a
little<00:01:36.479> more<00:01:36.799> now<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> reason<00:01:38.159> why<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> told

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
little more now the reason why I told

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420 
little more now the reason why I told
you<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> flip<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.329> slower<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.770> you're

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you to flip it slower is because you're

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.359 
you to flip it slower is because you're
going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:42.780> such<00:01:43.049> an<00:01:43.170> extreme<00:01:43.590> rotation

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
going to do such an extreme rotation

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.090 
going to do such an extreme rotation
that<00:01:45.049> backside<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.200> kick<00:01:46.409> flips<00:01:46.649> tend<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.979> go

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that backside and kick flips tend to go

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
that backside and kick flips tend to go
together<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:48.060> when<00:01:48.210> you're<00:01:48.329> doing<00:01:48.360> backside

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
together so when you're doing backside

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.440 
together so when you're doing backside
you<00:01:49.380> tend<00:01:49.619> over<00:01:49.950> flip<00:01:50.159> when<00:01:51.119> you're<00:01:51.270> doing

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
you tend over flip when you're doing

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.389 
you tend over flip when you're doing
backside<00:01:51.810> 270<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.500> flip<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> little<00:01:53.100> slower

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
backside 270 you flip a little slower

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.460 
backside 270 you flip a little slower
than<00:01:53.640> usual<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:54.689> you're<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.439> in

than usual because you're going to be in

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.160 
than usual because you're going to be in
the<00:01:55.619> air<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.250> much<00:01:56.369> time<00:01:56.670> rotating<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the air for so much time rotating that

your<00:01:58.380> board<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.890> end<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.070> over

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
your board is going to end up over

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.330 
your board is going to end up over
flipping<00:01:59.729> if<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.299> flip<00:02:00.570> slower<00:02:01.130> right<00:02:02.130> when

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
flipping if you flip slower right when

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.730 
flipping if you flip slower right when
you<00:02:02.460> catch<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.909> at<00:02:03.030> 270<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.320> board<00:02:04.590> should

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
you catch it at 270 the board should

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.190 
you catch it at 270 the board should
fall<00:02:04.979> right<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.189> your<00:02:05.399> fingers<00:02:05.990> now<00:02:06.990> you're

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
fall right on your fingers now you're

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.080 
fall right on your fingers now you're
ready<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.560> real<00:02:07.799> deal<00:02:08.099> backside<00:02:08.640> 360

kickflip you want to have your fingers
the<00:02:10.950> same<00:02:11.129> way<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.370> would<00:02:11.700> kick<00:02:11.970> flip

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
the same way you would kick flip

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.730 
the same way you would kick flip

your hand like this no you probably

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.200 
your hand like this no you probably
can't<00:02:14.980> see<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.130> but<00:02:15.430> my<00:02:15.580> finger<00:02:16.000> placement

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
can't see it but my finger placement

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.700 
can't see it but my finger placement
somewhere<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.840> everybody<00:02:17.380> has<00:02:17.530> their

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
somewhere like that everybody has their

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.800 
somewhere like that everybody has their
own<00:02:17.850> kickflip<00:02:18.850> strategy<00:02:19.300> if<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.600> kick

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
own kickflip strategy if you have kick

own kickflip strategy if you have kick
flips<00:02:20.020> down<00:02:20.230> really<00:02:20.500> well<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:21.400> probably

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
flips down really well you probably

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.150 
flips down really well you probably
experimented<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.260> little<00:02:23.350> bit<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:23.950> got

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
experimented a little bit and you got

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.290 
experimented a little bit and you got
your<00:02:24.370> own<00:02:24.400> comfortable<00:02:24.850> kick<00:02:25.150> foot

your own comfortable kick foot

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.410 
your own comfortable kick foot
positioning<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.410> mine<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:26.800> like<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:28.330> you

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
positioning so mine is like this and you

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.700 
positioning so mine is like this and you
see<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.690> cake<00:02:28.840> foot<00:02:29.050> with<00:02:29.260> my<00:02:29.380> hand<00:02:29.560> like<00:02:29.650> this

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
see the cake foot with my hand like this

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.550 
see the cake foot with my hand like this
same<00:02:30.640> one<00:02:30.820> up<00:02:30.940> backside<00:02:31.390> flips<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.900> back<00:02:32.410> 50

60<00:02:33.010> here<00:02:33.190> folks<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.520> have<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:34.020> just

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
60 here folks you have to just

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.990 
60 here folks you have to just
experiment<00:02:35.590> with<00:02:35.890> finger<00:02:36.220> positionings<00:02:36.760> and

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
experiment with finger positionings and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.510 
experiment with finger positionings and
find<00:02:37.720> what's<00:02:37.900> comfortable<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.620> then<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.370> get

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
find what's comfortable and then you get

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.060 
find what's comfortable and then you get
it<00:02:39.670> down<00:02:40.410> okay<00:02:41.410> we're<00:02:41.560> pretty<00:02:41.710> much<00:02:41.890> already

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
it down okay we're pretty much already

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.130 
it down okay we're pretty much already
done<00:02:42.370> with<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.610> tip<00:02:42.820> but<00:02:43.240> if<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.810> want<00:02:44.020> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
done with the tip but if you want the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.690 
done with the tip but if you want the
standard<00:02:44.470> stuff<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.860> use<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.070> standard<00:02:45.280> steps

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
standard stuff to use the standard steps

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.550 
standard stuff to use the standard steps
your<00:02:46.270> first<00:02:46.480> step<00:02:46.570> obviously<00:02:46.840> is<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.230> roll<00:02:47.410> up

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
your first step obviously is to roll up

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.070 
your first step obviously is to roll up
now<00:02:47.770> make<00:02:48.280> sure<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.430> pop<00:02:48.730> like<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.420> lot<00:02:49.810> of

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
now make sure you pop like this a lot of

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.670 
now make sure you pop like this a lot of
people<00:02:50.260> they<00:02:50.800> they<00:02:51.130> pop<00:02:51.940> here<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:53.350> ends<00:02:53.590> up

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
people they they pop here and it ends up

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.410 
people they they pop here and it ends up
really<00:02:53.920> becoming<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.550> backside<00:02:54.910> flip<00:02:55.210> with<00:02:55.390> a

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
really becoming a backside flip with a

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.870 
really becoming a backside flip with a
pivot<00:02:55.750> because<00:02:56.440> if<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.130> pop<00:02:57.340> on<00:02:57.520> you're<00:02:57.640> here

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
pivot because if you pop on you're here

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.840 
pivot because if you pop on you're here
all<00:02:58.240> you<00:02:58.480> have<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.660> do<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:58.930> do<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.610> backside<00:03:00.610> flip

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
all you have to do is do a backside flip

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.330 
all you have to do is do a backside flip
and<00:03:01.090> then<00:03:01.290> 90<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:02.620> kind<00:03:02.770> of<00:03:02.800> cheating<00:03:03.190> but

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
and then 90 so it's kind of cheating but

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.730 
and then 90 so it's kind of cheating but
generally<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.360> like<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.810> spin<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.110> little<00:03:05.230> before

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
generally I like to spin a little before

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.770 
generally I like to spin a little before
i<00:03:05.770> pop<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.580> as<00:03:06.700> soon<00:03:06.850> as<00:03:06.970> i<00:03:07.030> get<00:03:07.120> here<00:03:07.300> i<00:03:07.330> spin

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
i pop so as soon as i get here i spin

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.080 
i pop so as soon as i get here i spin
real<00:03:07.990> fast<00:03:08.200> hey<00:03:08.500> pop<00:03:08.740> so<00:03:09.430> i'm<00:03:09.670> going<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.880> slow

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
real fast hey pop so i'm going to slow

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.670 
real fast hey pop so i'm going to slow
mo<00:03:10.240> that<00:03:10.450> part<00:03:10.750> but<00:03:11.170> you're<00:03:11.320> going<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.530> find

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
mo that part but you're going to find

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.440 
mo that part but you're going to find
out<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:12.130> i<00:03:12.340> actually<00:03:12.580> popped<00:03:13.030> more<00:03:13.330> like

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
out that i actually popped more like

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.360 
out that i actually popped more like
here<00:03:13.780> because<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.410> spun<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:14.860> little<00:03:15.010> when<00:03:15.340> I

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
here because I spun a little when I

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.660 
here because I spun a little when I
popped<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:18.010> your<00:03:18.160> first<00:03:18.310> steps<00:03:18.580> to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
popped it that so your first steps to

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.450 
popped it that so your first steps to
roll<00:03:18.820> up<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.120> pop<00:03:19.410> now<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:21.010> want<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.250> slide

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
roll up and pop now you want to slide

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.040 
roll up and pop now you want to slide
but<00:03:21.790> remember<00:03:22.150> you're<00:03:22.240> flipping<00:03:22.570> slower<00:03:22.840> than

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
but remember you're flipping slower than

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.690 
but remember you're flipping slower than
usual<00:03:23.230> because<00:03:24.040> you're<00:03:24.370> going<00:03:24.490> to<00:03:24.580> be

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
usual because you're going to be

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.940 
usual because you're going to be
rotating<00:03:25.330> quite<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.570> bit<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:26.050> that<00:03:26.290> you're

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
rotating quite a bit like that you're

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.500 
rotating quite a bit like that you're
going<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.100> do<00:03:27.280> this<00:03:27.460> much<00:03:27.670> rotation<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.330> midair

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
going to do this much rotation in midair

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.150 
going to do this much rotation in midair
so<00:03:29.380> while<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.130> board<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.430> flipping<00:03:31.080> slowly

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
so while the board is flipping slowly

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.610 
so while the board is flipping slowly
you're<00:03:33.160> gonna<00:03:33.280> rotate<00:03:33.660> 270<00:03:34.660> degrees<00:03:37.620> 270

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
you're gonna rotate 270 degrees 270

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.100 
you're gonna rotate 270 degrees 270
moving<00:03:39.100> with<00:03:39.550> it<00:03:39.730> now<00:03:40.330> you<00:03:40.390> should<00:03:40.450> catch<00:03:40.900> it

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
moving with it now you should catch it

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.720 
moving with it now you should catch it
with<00:03:41.200> your<00:03:41.230> back<00:03:41.560> finger<00:03:41.950> right<00:03:42.100> here<00:03:42.130> around

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
with your back finger right here around

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.850 
with your back finger right here around
here<00:03:43.110> that's<00:03:44.110> why<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.320> want<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.620> do<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.740> keep

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
here that's why you want to do to keep

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.530 
here that's why you want to do to keep
up<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.130> little<00:03:45.310> higher<00:03:45.460> because<00:03:46.210> you're<00:03:46.390> going

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
up a little higher because you're going

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.450 
up a little higher because you're going
to<00:03:46.600> catch<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:46.990> like<00:03:47.110> that<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.590> once<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.310> went

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
to catch it like that and once you went

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.690 
to catch it like that and once you went
here<00:03:48.730> or<00:03:49.030> more<00:03:49.330> or<00:03:49.830> even<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:50.950> full<00:03:51.130> rotation

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
here or more or even the full rotation

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.480 
here or more or even the full rotation
you<00:03:52.210> can<00:03:52.390> finish<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.870> entire<00:03:53.140> thing<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:54.370> now

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
you can finish the entire thing so now

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.670 
you can finish the entire thing so now
that<00:03:54.520> your<00:03:54.850> nose<00:03:54.970> steps<00:03:55.290> really<00:03:56.290> all<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.650> have

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
that your nose steps really all I have

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.200 
that your nose steps really all I have
to<00:03:56.890> say<00:03:56.920> is<00:03:57.190> just<00:03:57.400> practice<00:03:57.640> practice

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
to say is just practice practice

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.660 
to say is just practice practice
practice<00:03:58.660> practice<00:03:59.020> this<00:03:59.620> trick<00:03:59.830> until<00:04:00.520> no

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
practice practice this trick until no

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
it but um you can take it well not

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.040 
it but um you can take it well not
really<00:04:07.890> over<00:04:08.280> things<00:04:08.490> but<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:09.360> take<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.750> down

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
really over things but you take it down

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.910 
really over things but you take it down
gaps<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:12.060> can<00:04:12.180> even<00:04:12.360> take<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.840> into<00:04:13.020> vines<00:04:13.620> and

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
gaps you can even take it into vines and

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.990 
gaps you can even take it into vines and
slides<00:04:18.350> you<00:04:19.350> can<00:04:19.380> even<00:04:19.590> try<00:04:19.860> backside<00:04:20.370> 360

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
slides you can even try backside 360

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.630 
slides you can even try backside 360
