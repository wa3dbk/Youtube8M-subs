00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
skinny apple imac so guys I did an

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.110 
skinny apple imac so guys I did an
unboxing<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.889> first<00:00:13.920> boot<00:00:14.400> go<00:00:14.910> ahead<00:00:15.089> and

which<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.480> non<00:00:45.899> upgradable<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.430> want

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
which is non upgradable so if you want

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.729 
which is non upgradable so if you want
16<00:00:48.030> gigs<00:00:48.210> make<00:00:48.600> sure<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.989> customize<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
16 gigs make sure you customize that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
16 gigs make sure you customize that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
when you order your imac it's got a one

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
terabyte 5400 RPM drive so that is quite

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680 
terabyte 5400 RPM drive so that is quite
a<00:00:55.680> slow<00:00:56.100> hard<00:00:56.370> drive<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.910> definitely<00:00:57.329> know

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
any other speed of an SSD so don't

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.750 
any other speed of an SSD so don't
expect<00:01:00.629> applications<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.800> open<00:01:02.070> particularly

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
expect applications to open particularly

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.270 
expect applications to open particularly

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and as they installed however once again

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700 
and as they installed however once again
when<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> buy<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.750> get<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> custom

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
when you buy this you can get a custom

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160 
when you buy this you can get a custom
order<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:12.270> Apple<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.630> calling<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
order with what Apple are calling the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.800 
order with what Apple are calling the
fusion<00:01:13.560> drive<00:01:13.799> which<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.640> basically<00:01:15.030> an<00:01:15.270> SSD

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
fusion drive which is basically an SSD

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.580 
fusion drive which is basically an SSD
and<00:01:15.990> hard<00:01:16.380> drive<00:01:17.270> hybrid<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:19.259> should<00:01:19.439> be

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and hard drive hybrid and that should be

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.910 
and hard drive hybrid and that should be
significantly<00:01:20.369> faster<00:01:20.729> than<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.840> stock<00:01:22.049> 5400

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
significantly faster than the stock 5400

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.219 
significantly faster than the stock 5400
RPM<00:01:23.310> drive<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.090> want<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.420> get<00:01:25.110> that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
RPM drive so if you want that get that

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.380 
RPM drive so if you want that get that
when<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.530> order<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.060> not

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
when you order it because it's not

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.960 
when you order it because it's not
upgradeable<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.619> although<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.520> might<00:01:29.820> be

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
upgradeable I think although I might be

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.719 
upgradeable I think although I might be
wrong<00:01:30.090> enough<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.890> it's<00:01:31.890> got<00:01:32.070> an<00:01:32.220> nvidia

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
wrong enough and it's got an nvidia

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.050 
wrong enough and it's got an nvidia
geforce<00:01:33.360> GT<00:01:33.930> 640m<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.610> mobile

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
geforce GT 640m so that's a mobile

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.399 
geforce GT 640m so that's a mobile

so that finished pretty quickly and as
you<00:02:40.489> can<00:02:40.610> see<00:02:40.640> we've<00:02:40.940> got<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.060> geekbench<00:02:41.480> score

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
and i won't read them out though because

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.800 
and i won't read them out though because
they<00:03:10.670> are<00:03:10.850> somewhat<00:03:11.269> less<00:03:11.959> important<00:03:12.769> but<00:03:13.810> you

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
they are somewhat less important but you

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.080 
they are somewhat less important but you
can<00:03:15.019> pause<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.590> video<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.100> read<00:03:16.519> them<00:03:16.730> if<00:03:16.910> you

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
can pause the video and read them if you

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:27.510 
can pause the video and read them if you
want<00:03:17.209> to
