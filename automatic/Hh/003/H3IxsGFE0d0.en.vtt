which<00:01:15.170> called<00:01:15.590> for<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:16.310> separation<00:01:16.970> of<00:01:17.360> the

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
which called for a separation of the

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.520 
which called for a separation of the
train<00:01:17.930> table<00:01:18.170> here

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.950

to<00:01:39.370> be<00:01:39.520> able<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.910> separate<00:01:40.330> it<00:01:40.390> at<00:01:40.690> that<00:01:40.870> point

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
to be able to separate it at that point

otherwise<00:02:01.770> once<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:02.760> cut<00:02:03.150> on<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.050> curve<00:02:04.490> these

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
otherwise once you cut on a curve these

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.930 
otherwise once you cut on a curve these
two<00:02:05.760> rails<00:02:06.000> are<00:02:06.210> gonna<00:02:06.300> pop<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:07.310> but<00:02:08.310> using

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.060 
dark you can always darken it later
but<00:04:01.970> if<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.150> go<00:04:02.270> too<00:04:02.330> dark<00:04:02.720> try<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.709> lighten<00:04:03.950> it

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
but if you go too dark try to lighten it

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.260 
but if you go too dark try to lighten it
up<00:04:04.130> it's<00:04:04.400> gonna<00:04:04.520> be<00:04:04.610> a<00:04:05.739> lot<00:04:06.739> more<00:04:06.770> difficult

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
up it's gonna be a lot more difficult

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.710 
up it's gonna be a lot more difficult
probably<00:04:08.270> impossible

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.250 

unless<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.440> start<00:04:13.710> over<00:04:13.890> again<00:04:14.930> this<00:04:15.930> is<00:04:16.080> just

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
unless you start over again this is just

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.340 
unless you start over again this is just
the<00:04:16.350> first<00:04:16.530> color<00:04:17.480> and<00:04:18.480> all<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.750> is<00:04:18.900> is<00:04:19.170> the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
the first color and all it is is the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.940 
the first color and all it is is the
pewter<00:04:19.709> gray<00:04:19.890> I<00:04:20.780> got<00:04:21.780> these<00:04:21.930> paints<00:04:22.410> at

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
pewter gray I got these paints at

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.690 
pewter gray I got these paints at
Walmart<00:04:24.080> they're<00:04:25.080> like<00:04:25.230> a<00:04:25.260> buck<00:04:26.100> something

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
Walmart they're like a buck something

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:39.860 
Walmart they're like a buck something
two<00:04:27.570> dollars<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.140> think<00:04:30.080> for<00:04:31.080> these<00:04:31.170> baubles

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.960 

okay<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:40.500> here's<00:04:40.949> the<00:04:41.190> first<00:04:41.780> code<00:04:42.780> of

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
okay so here's the first code of

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:54.710 
okay so here's the first code of
computer<00:04:44.970> gray<00:04:45.210> wash

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.930 

this<00:04:55.320> is<00:04:55.590> without<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:57.920> black<00:04:58.920> wash<00:04:59.250> which

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
this is without the black wash which

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.310 
this is without the black wash which
will<00:05:00.210> highlight<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:02.450> cracks<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:03.750> crows<00:05:03.990> and

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
will highlight the cracks and crows and

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.660 
will highlight the cracks and crows and
the<00:05:04.440> rock<00:05:04.680> now<00:05:05.810> in<00:05:06.810> this<00:05:06.930> area<00:05:07.200> here<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.800> started

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
the rock now in this area here I started

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.330 
the rock now in this area here I started
using<00:05:08.880> spackling<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:11.900> fill<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.020> gaps<00:05:13.260> and<00:05:14.190> as

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
using spackling to fill the gaps and as

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.870 
using spackling to fill the gaps and as
you<00:05:14.490> can<00:05:14.670> see<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:16.500> watch<00:05:16.740> does<00:05:17.100> not<00:05:17.370> adhere

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
you can see the watch does not adhere

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.360 
you can see the watch does not adhere
well<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.840> spackling<00:05:20.450> so<00:05:21.450> I<00:05:22.070> will<00:05:23.070> not<00:05:23.220> be

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
well to the spackling so I will not be

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.720 
well to the spackling so I will not be
using<00:05:23.520> spackling<00:05:24.150> anymore<00:05:25.670> using<00:05:26.670> a

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
using spackling anymore using a

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.230 
using spackling anymore using a
combination<00:05:27.120> of<00:05:28.490> sculpt<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.640> mold<00:05:29.850> which<00:05:30.060> I

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
combination of sculpt the mold which I

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.020 
combination of sculpt the mold which I
did<00:05:30.480> on<00:05:30.660> this<00:05:30.960> area<00:05:31.400> and<00:05:32.990> some<00:05:33.990> hydrocal

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
did on this area and some hydrocal

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.640 
did on this area and some hydrocal
thinned<00:05:36.030> out<00:05:36.270> where<00:05:36.900> I<00:05:36.930> need<00:05:37.230> to<00:05:37.260> get<00:05:37.470> into

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
thinned out where I need to get into

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.050 
thinned out where I need to get into
tight<00:05:38.130> places<00:05:39.290> as<00:05:40.290> you<00:05:40.590> can<00:05:40.710> see<00:05:40.920> it<00:05:41.760> looks<00:05:41.880> a

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
tight places as you can see it looks a

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:52.120 
tight places as you can see it looks a
lot<00:05:42.210> better<00:05:43.460> more<00:05:44.460> at<00:05:44.670> uniform<00:05:45.270> finish

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.440
