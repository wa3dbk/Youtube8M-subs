going to be a block of drag there are

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.380 
going to be a block of drag there are
times<00:00:47.129> where<00:00:47.460> type<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.940> Lee<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.270> make

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
times where type of Lee you can make

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.810 
times where type of Lee you can make
other<00:00:48.570> things<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.110> majority<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.399> time<00:00:50.550> dishes

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820

you go ahead and go for a brief dragon

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
you go ahead and go for a brief dragon
you<00:01:32.280> go<00:01:32.460> ahead<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.909> grab<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.360> battery<00:01:33.930> man<00:01:34.140> on

you go ahead and grab the battery man on

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.560 
you go ahead and grab the battery man on
double-a<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> black<00:01:36.060> rose<00:01:36.270> play

and you blow up the entire field and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.280 
and you blow up the entire field and
then<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> draco<00:01:39.540> sack<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.930> still<00:01:40.110> there

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
then the draco sack is still there

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.830 
then the draco sack is still there
obviously<00:01:41.159> now<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.970> won't<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.210> able<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.390> OG<00:01:42.630> k

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
obviously now you won't be able to OG k

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.260 
obviously now you won't be able to OG k
if<00:01:43.140> draco<00:01:43.680> sack<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.100> still<00:01:44.280> there<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> once

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
if draco sack is still there so and once

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.760 
if draco sack is still there so and once
you<00:01:45.479> clear<00:01:45.780> your<00:01:45.899> attack<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.649> your

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
you clear your attack with one of your

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.410 
you clear your attack with one of your
battery<00:01:47.070> man<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.520> drop<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> honest<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.299> can

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
battery man you drop the honest you can

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.179 
battery man you drop the honest you can
still<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.750> off<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> OT<00:01:49.229> k<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.409> honest<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> just

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
still get off the OT k so honest is just

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.859 
still get off the OT k so honest is just
a<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.430> important<00:01:50.790> card<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.210> any<00:01:51.600> light

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
a really important card and any light

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.359 
a really important card and any light
that<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> battery<00:01:53.040> man<00:01:53.220> it

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
that but then the battery man it

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.130 
that but then the battery man it
definitely<00:01:53.939> helps<00:01:54.299> out<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> lot<00:01:54.570> against<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
definitely helps out a lot against the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.749 
definitely helps out a lot against the
higher<00:01:55.350> tier<00:01:55.649> decks<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.159> make<00:01:56.280> draco

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
higher tier decks that can make draco

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.510 
higher tier decks that can make draco

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
sack next up to debris dragon this just

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.800 
sack next up to debris dragon this just
allows<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.939> clear<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> board<00:02:00.390> sometimes

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
face-up monster also so that's one down

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
in front of ruffle summon and the new

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.629 
in front of ruffle summon and the new
short<00:03:17.720> circuit<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.290> win<00:03:18.470> I'm<00:03:18.919> next<00:03:19.250> up<00:03:19.459> a

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
short circuit and you win I'm next up a

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.819 
short circuit and you win I'm next up a
short<00:03:20.090> circuit<00:03:20.389> so<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:20.989> have<00:03:21.349> to<00:03:21.470> have<00:03:21.560> three

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
short circuit so you have to have three

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.470 
short circuit so you have to have three
more<00:03:21.980> piece<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.220> battery<00:03:22.609> man<00:03:22.819> monsters<00:03:23.239> and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
more piece of battery man monsters and

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.000 
more piece of battery man monsters and
destroy<00:03:23.840> all<00:03:24.019> cards<00:03:24.380> your<00:03:24.530> opponent<00:03:24.560> controls

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
so pretty darn good effect next step

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.589 
so pretty darn good effect next step
triple<00:03:28.250> duality<00:03:28.760> because<00:03:29.000> basically<00:03:29.269> it's

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
triple duality because basically it's

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.949 
triple duality because basically it's
setup<00:03:29.900> deck<00:03:30.169> than<00:03:30.349> you<00:03:30.440> otk<00:03:31.269> next<00:03:32.269> up<00:03:32.389> triple

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
have three battery man on the field you

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.589 
have three battery man on the field you
activate<00:03:40.549> short-circuit<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.209> then<00:03:41.480> you

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
activate short-circuit and then you

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.089 
activate short-circuit and then you
simply<00:03:41.780> won<00:03:42.019> because<00:03:42.230> each<00:03:42.590> of<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.829> battery

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
simply won because each of the battery

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.650 
simply won because each of the battery
man<00:03:43.220> have<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:44.329> effect<00:03:44.569> where<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.980> boost<00:03:45.980> up

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
man have the effect where the boost up

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
synchro material can't be a little for

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.800 
synchro material can't be a little for
so<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.070> really<00:04:22.340> can't<00:04:22.490> really<00:04:22.669> make<00:04:23.330> anything

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
so you really can't really make anything

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.220 
so you really can't really make anything
but<00:04:24.080> on<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.229> off<00:04:24.380> chance<00:04:24.409> maybe

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
but on the off chance maybe

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.310 
but on the off chance maybe
e you<00:04:25.770> can<00:04:26.160> get<00:04:26.820> back<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.270> don't<00:04:27.570> know<00:04:27.690> Maxie

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
e you can get back I don't know Maxie

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.080 
e you can get back I don't know Maxie
and<00:04:28.680> then<00:04:28.950> you<00:04:29.100> can<00:04:29.250> maybe<00:04:29.430> make<00:04:29.640> hard<00:04:29.940> like

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
and then you can maybe make hard like

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.520 
and then you can maybe make hard like
Orient<00:04:30.480> dragon<00:04:30.810> if<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:30.930> really<00:04:31.140> want<00:04:31.290> to<00:04:31.380> you

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530
