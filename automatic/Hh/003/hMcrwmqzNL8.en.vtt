we're<00:00:11.620> here<00:00:11.769> today<00:00:11.950> at<00:00:12.280> the<00:00:12.309> Wimbledon

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
we're here today at the Wimbledon

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.060 
we're here today at the Wimbledon
qualifiers<00:00:13.630> and<00:00:14.340> we're<00:00:15.340> here<00:00:15.580> with<00:00:15.820> :<00:00:16.630> motion

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070

qualifiers and we're here with : motion
what<00:00:18.070> we're<00:00:18.190> doing<00:00:18.400> today<00:00:18.550> is<00:00:18.970> working<00:00:19.750> with

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
what we're doing today is working with

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.790 
what we're doing today is working with
the<00:00:19.930> LTA<00:00:20.230> to<00:00:20.970> really<00:00:21.970> get<00:00:22.210> an<00:00:22.539> in-depth<00:00:23.199> model

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
the LTA to really get an in-depth model

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.339 
the LTA to really get an in-depth model
of<00:00:24.039> a<00:00:24.580> spine<00:00:25.000> during<00:00:25.539> service<00:00:26.230> action<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.849> LTA

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
of a spine during service action the LTA

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.919 
of a spine during service action the LTA
identified<00:00:29.349> to<00:00:29.560> us<00:00:29.740> that<00:00:30.330> injuries<00:00:31.330> in<00:00:31.510> the

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929 
identified to us that injuries in the

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.990 
identified to us that injuries in the
lower<00:00:32.140> back<00:00:32.439> have<00:00:32.739> become<00:00:33.489> quite<00:00:33.699> prevalent

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
lower back have become quite prevalent

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.520 
lower back have become quite prevalent
in<00:00:34.450> the<00:00:35.020> junior<00:00:35.620> players<00:00:35.860> so<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:38.260> we<00:00:38.320> want<00:00:38.469> to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
in the junior players so what we want to

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.470 
in the junior players so what we want to
do<00:00:38.739> is<00:00:39.160> try<00:00:39.520> and<00:00:39.550> identify<00:00:39.730> whether<00:00:40.300> there<00:00:40.450> are

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
do is try and identify whether there are

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.440 
do is try and identify whether there are
any<00:00:40.540> aspects<00:00:41.200> of<00:00:41.940> technique<00:00:42.940> in<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.210> serve

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
any aspects of technique in the serve

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.690 
any aspects of technique in the serve
that<00:00:44.050> could<00:00:44.230> contribute<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.800> this<00:00:45.010> injury<00:00:47.700> so

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
that could contribute to this injury so

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.639 
that could contribute to this injury so
being<00:00:48.940> at<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.149> Wimbledon<00:00:49.690> qualifiers<00:00:50.379> we've

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
being at the Wimbledon qualifiers we've

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.279 
being at the Wimbledon qualifiers we've
got<00:00:50.770> this<00:00:50.860> great<00:00:51.219> opportunity<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:52.690> analyze

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
got this great opportunity to analyze

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.770 
got this great opportunity to analyze
the<00:00:53.620> some<00:00:54.489> of<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.640> top<00:00:54.820> players<00:00:55.030> in<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.570> world

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
the some of the top players in the world

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.979 
the some of the top players in the world
and<00:00:56.399> identify<00:00:57.399> a<00:00:57.430> kind<00:00:57.699> of<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.850> blueprint<00:00:58.660> of

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
and identify a kind of a blueprint of

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.220 
and identify a kind of a blueprint of
the<00:00:59.620> service<00:00:59.980> technique<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:00.460> them<00:01:00.670> later

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the service technique to them later

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.229 
the service technique to them later
compared<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.410> the<00:01:02.559> junior<00:01:03.489> guys<00:01:03.699> at<00:01:04.000> coming

compared to the junior guys at coming
through<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.539> setters<00:01:09.119> we've<00:01:10.119> got<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.299> model<00:01:10.659> of

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
through the setters we've got a model of

with this model we are able to travel

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.950 
with this model we are able to travel
complete<00:01:17.979> 3d<00:01:18.340> model<00:01:18.640> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.869> of<00:01:20.439> the<00:01:21.009> players

servant tennis is really key the reason

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
and the tennis serve is really important

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.040 
and the tennis serve is really important
trying<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.620> find<00:02:03.890> ways<00:02:04.220> of<00:02:04.520> identifying

injury and how we could correct some of
those<00:02:09.700> 40<00:02:10.700> biomechanics<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.840> big<00:02:12.110> objective

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
those 40 biomechanics is a big objective

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.160 
those 40 biomechanics is a big objective
for<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.610> work<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.030> do<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.510> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
for the work that we do and so the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.690 
for the work that we do and so the
information<00:02:15.350> will<00:02:15.770> be<00:02:15.890> really<00:02:16.160> useful<00:02:16.190> from

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
information will be really useful from

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.020 
information will be really useful from
this<00:02:16.820> study<00:02:18.010> it's<00:02:19.010> good<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.340> get<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.700> find<00:02:19.880> out

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
this study it's good to get to find out

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.790 
this study it's good to get to find out
really<00:02:20.720> what's<00:02:20.930> going<00:02:21.110> on<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> body<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.710> the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
really what's going on the body on the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.040 
really what's going on the body on the
serve<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:23.150> should<00:02:23.480> be<00:02:23.510> good<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.810> get<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
serve so it should be good to get the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.140 
serve so it should be good to get the
results<00:02:24.320> back<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.800> is<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.640> good<00:02:26.030> experience

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
results back and it is a good experience
