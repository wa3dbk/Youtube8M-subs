00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.130
 In eastern Ukraine partly cloudy 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.940
 precipitation engine specific to this 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.290
 car five and a half liters 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.700
 is it true paid for 5 44 5 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.700
 paragraph 205 of the Russian Federation 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.460
 since there is no 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.320
 besides 15 years 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.900
 finding flaws in it seems 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900
 almost impossible to create 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.050
 turned out interesting but try it 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.050
 to make 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.780
 but what shall we see inside his twitter network 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.640
 machine up to 8 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.030
 an additional 700 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.180
 but why 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.300
 everything is very concise and extremely 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.560
 just and it sure likes 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.320
 the only thing that makes me very simple 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.720
 Further 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.100
 V.Semashko 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.060
 in China 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.750
 all this is not all lost 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.600
 the dashboard is made very simple and 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.069
 conservatively just more 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:59.539
 issues of preparing such electronic 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.879
 scoreboard leading the world very 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.900
 want clear national 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.900
 at least how much is 1 thousand letters now 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.230
 he doesn't want the area to stop any 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.560
 case has become quite difficult although it seems to be 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.820
 in the form says what to do now 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.600
 let's see what she is 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.830
 movements 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.680
 action organizers 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 according to experts 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.670
 in 2008 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.560
 state employees and can not be 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.340
 however, income is family income 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.620
 in the competition what that wants 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.120
 you are very comfortable review you can see everything 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.110
 side mirrors each even something that 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.950
 yourself 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.370
 in support of this car is enough 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.230
 soft 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.090
 during the road police 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.080
 passes great speed 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.070
 but quite comfortable 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.070
 on this occasion 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.459
 but what a formal task 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.240
 coped 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.630
 I found two flaws important on 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.459
 my opinion 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.930
 but people are not enough but the inclusion of manual 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.729
 gearbox modes 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.389
 I think that in the coming years on 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:26.299
 west 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.060
 well i must confess that i 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.799
 although defeated i 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.749
 on new for myself in this car this 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.099
 of course not very small this is important 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.149
 save power acad 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:39.029
 or brothers gym bag second 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:40.359
 the disadvantage is that when 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.619
 will become cold 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:42.959
 he overlaps 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.269
 but this question 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.019
 one of the promising 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.120
 turn that is all that 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.909
 happened 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.159
 if you find fault bad 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.560
 But a little bit was not for Moscow and of course 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.079
 quote at a pace we won't go for it 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.399
 You are not registred 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.369
 perhaps this is the only car 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:59.609
 everything else do it 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.689
 really wish she could what is it 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.729
 too seriously there is no court in 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:05.359
 region every day
