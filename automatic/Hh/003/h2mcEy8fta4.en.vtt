 supernatural simone elis chatted with 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.990

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.719
 specialists in whiskey from brazil he 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.820
 He talked about tasting and gave tips of 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.830
 better passes this and more 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.100
 We'll watch and follow up now. 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.260
 just like in Scotland, Brazil 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.119
 has a great appreciation for skiing 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.750
 it is no wonder that sales of this drink 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.359
 have increased by 300% in the last 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.579
 friends at parties or even alone 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.010
 many do not need to take a dose of 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.290
 a good old left people know that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.870
 wine is a drink that she 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.719
 has to be conserved is in a way 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.050
 appropriate with that it is the same thing only 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.480
 that has a specific way is the risk 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.809
 and aged only in oak 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.940
 This is a characteristic of the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.050
 this happens in ireland that happens 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.000
 on the back 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.010
 This happens in Japan, it happens in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.410
 united states the main markets 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.860
 producers have this niche characteristic 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.960
 which is oak and oak has several 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.210
 types of oaks and has a horse 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.130
 American you have a European horse 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.600
 Japanese red and it provides 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.330
 drink provides aromas and flavors 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.330
 and also 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:28.010
 example, then you realize that this 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.000
 The reddest register is the color 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.990
 european horse 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.540
 the European horse is a horse more 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:39.470
 reddish impact in life this drink 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.060
 that's a bit more golden and bugs - 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.150
 reddish than the other 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.700
 whiskey is a distilled beer 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.160
 So you who did not know that, I already stayed 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.980
 knowing now curiosity in exactly 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.180
 there is already a process of 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.010
 fermentation 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.140
 if you take and it's a whiskey standing there 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.720
 in the fermentation process you take 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.280
 a beer a non-profit beer without 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.800
 that bitter characteristic that profit 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.420
 of the other and other things that are 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.760
 mixed with beer but other 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.890
 essences 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.130
 basically you can call a trash 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.500
 of a beer distilled as in wines 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.080
 cantatas was used is very 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.060
 important and at the time of tasting is 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.790
 good smell and taste 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.600
 calculated to differentiate the type of each 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.239
 beverage 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.040
 in this cup an interesting phase because 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.790
 it is closed in the mouth 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:39.350
 this concentrates scents of the drink around 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.120
 Peace is not if you want to feel the drink 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.000
 in its quality 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.489
 Ideally, you should have a cup with 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.590
 this characteristic blows the mouth 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.260
 closed to concentrate there those 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.989
 values ​​updated scents that I will 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.090
 give the drink feature on time 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.480
 then take bombs that can be with 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.549
 ice can be pure can mix also 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.560
 other drinks there goes from the palate of each 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.629
 one is legend you speak in Brazil 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.670
 You can not drink whiskey on ice. 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.629
 complicated because Brazil is a country of 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.250
 tropical weather 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.540
 now anything you mix the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.819
 rubbish and make no mistake 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.629
 You 're altering the taste. 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.660
 of that drink 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.280
 if you want to feel her in the essence 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.099
 even feel the aromas and flavors of 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.900
 drink in its complexity the ideal you 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.470
 take pure or mixed a little bit of 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.959
 Water 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.180
 When are you going to do the tasting like 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.750
 what you do you put that around 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.430
 25 ml more or less right then weighed 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.579
 It demonstrates that for us as it is 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.879
 you put a little 25ml is a way 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.849
 You have two- thirds of the glass there. 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.859
 and one- third of the full glass because it is 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.209
 that you will be concentrating the 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:54.620
 students of the drink and the first point 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.060
 important is to feel the aroma and then 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.879
 You go to the palate of the palate. 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.879
 usually it confirms what you 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:05.019
 He felt the fact and how you do you 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.019
 put a little 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.160
 I for a little while and try to do with 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.490
 that the waste passes through the mouth all that okay 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:19.390
 each area of ​​the tongue will give you a 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:23.190
 different feeling will give you a taste 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.190
 different for that garbage
