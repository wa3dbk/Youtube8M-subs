00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.610 
final another one or two coats of pledge
on<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.450> make<00:03:24.540> sure<00:03:24.810> those<00:03:24.989> decals<00:03:25.440> are

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.110 
on it just to make sure those decals are
completely<00:03:26.040> protected<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.580> I<00:03:29.700> said<00:03:29.910> use

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
completely protected and like I said use

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.140 
completely protected and like I said use
the<00:03:30.270> racing<00:03:30.690> blue<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:31.739> me<00:03:31.890> if<00:03:32.010> spray<00:03:32.250> can<00:03:32.580> me

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
the racing blue to me if spray can me

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.720 
the racing blue to me if spray can me
and<00:03:33.300> came<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.690> for<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> little<00:03:34.920> spray<00:03:35.190> can<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
and came in for a little spray can the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.040 
and came in for a little spray can the
only<00:03:35.880> reason<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.209> didn't<00:03:36.420> use<00:03:36.540> these<00:03:36.780> guys

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
only reason I didn't use these guys

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.930 
only reason I didn't use these guys
because<00:03:37.410> they're<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.130> expensive<00:03:38.280> here<00:03:38.880> in

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
because they're so expensive here in

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.650 
because they're so expensive here in
Australia<00:03:39.450> they<00:03:39.570> like<00:03:39.690> $15<00:03:40.560> for<00:03:40.770> one<00:03:40.830> can<00:03:41.660> but

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
Australia they like $15 for one can but

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.900 
Australia they like $15 for one can but
they<00:03:42.900> do<00:03:42.959> really<00:03:43.380> lay<00:03:43.650> down<00:03:43.860> nice<00:03:44.190> it's<00:03:44.850> just

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
they do really lay down nice it's just

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.680 
they do really lay down nice it's just
unfortunate<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.810> cost<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.230> much<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.690> and

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
unfortunate that cost so much so and

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.830 
unfortunate that cost so much so and
today<00:03:49.110> guys<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.890> managed<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.910> get<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.510> spare

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
and I was gonna use the drivers but I

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.979 
and I was gonna use the drivers but I
really<00:04:05.820> don't<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.209> these<00:04:06.480> guys<00:04:08.630> yeah<00:04:09.630> they

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
really don't like these guys yeah they

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.840 
really don't like these guys yeah they
know<00:04:10.110> why<00:04:10.350> they<00:04:10.980> were<00:04:11.040> painted<00:04:11.519> glue<00:04:11.670> together

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
know why they were painted glue together

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.330 
know why they were painted glue together
because<00:04:12.329> they<00:04:12.480> weren't<00:04:12.709> actual<00:04:13.709> styrene

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
because they weren't actual styrene

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.270 
because they weren't actual styrene
though<00:04:14.549> sort<00:04:15.120> of<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.269> rubber<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.859> use<00:04:17.100> some

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
though sort of a rubber so to use some

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.250 
though sort of a rubber so to use some
Loctite<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.940> get<00:04:18.090> them<00:04:18.239> together<00:04:18.419> gather<00:04:18.959> and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
Loctite to get them together gather and

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.050 
Loctite to get them together gather and
rather<00:04:20.040> now<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.310> just<00:04:20.579> think<00:04:20.729> it's<00:04:20.850> going<00:04:20.970> to

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
rather now I just think it's going to

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.090 
rather now I just think it's going to
look<00:04:21.180> better<00:04:21.419> without<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.840> drivers<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.979> the

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
look better without the drivers and the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.680 
look better without the drivers and the
seats<00:04:23.370> look<00:04:23.550> nice<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:23.970> clean<00:04:24.030> there<00:04:24.510> the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
seats look nice and clean there the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.520 
seats look nice and clean there the

then put the deck hole in the dash but

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.650
