00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
mean I can't even imagine what the first

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.550 
mean I can't even imagine what the first
short<00:02:00.030> person<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.479> gonna<00:02:00.630> think<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.020> they<00:02:01.140> get

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
short person is gonna think is they get

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.650 
short person is gonna think is they get
to<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.860> trunk<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:02.369> try<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.729> open<00:02:02.819> it<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.539> you

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
to the trunk and try and open it but you

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.690 
to the trunk and try and open it but you
know<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.740> almost<00:02:04.950> an<00:02:05.220> optical

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
know it really is almost an optical

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.779 
know it really is almost an optical
illusion<00:02:05.819> because<00:02:06.810> while<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.619> does<00:02:08.069> appear<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
illusion because while it does appear a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.730 
illusion because while it does appear a
little<00:02:08.970> bit<00:02:09.119> top-heavy<00:02:09.509> actually<00:02:10.440> when<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
little bit top-heavy actually when you

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.320 
little bit top-heavy actually when you
look<00:02:11.190> at<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.430> from<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.700> distance

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
look at it from a distance

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.090 
look at it from a distance
but<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> may<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.200> because<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.680> under<00:02:13.980> tray

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
but I may be because of the under tray

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.680 
but I may be because of the under tray
maybe<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.850> gain<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> bumper<00:02:15.600> on

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
maybe because the gain of the bumper on

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.990 
maybe because the gain of the bumper on
bumper<00:02:16.050> may<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.620> because<00:02:17.130> these<00:02:17.550> exhaust

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
bumper may be because these exhaust

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.740 
bumper may be because these exhaust
pipes<00:02:18.240> are<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.260> prominent<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.459> drags<00:02:21.270> the

pipes are just so prominent it drags the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.449 
pipes are just so prominent it drags the

aluminum paddle shifters although they

functionality on the wheel to reduce

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.990 
functionality on the wheel to reduce

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
that while this is a luxurious vehicle I

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.460 
that while this is a luxurious vehicle I
could<00:03:48.120> still<00:03:48.270> imagine<00:03:48.600> having<00:03:48.900> my<00:03:49.080> bicycles

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470

you know you know I love steering wheels
I'm<00:04:38.760> always<00:04:38.940> talking<00:04:39.240> about<00:04:39.480> the<00:04:39.930> ergonomics

I'm always talking about the ergonomics

I'm always talking about the ergonomics
of<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.860> steering<00:04:41.190> wheel<00:04:41.220> well<00:04:42.120> in<00:04:42.420> this<00:04:42.690> case

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
of a steering wheel well in this case

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.110 
of a steering wheel well in this case
it's<00:04:43.170> not<00:04:43.320> just<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:44.100> way<00:04:44.220> it<00:04:44.370> feels<00:04:44.610> it's<00:04:45.030> the

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
it's not just the way it feels it's the

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.960 
it's not just the way it feels it's the
way<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.420> functions<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:47.400> way<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:47.610> don't

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
way it functions and the way I don't

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.220 
way it functions and the way I don't
know<00:04:48.180> quite<00:04:48.360> how<00:04:48.420> they've<00:04:48.720> done<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.960> but

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
know quite how they've done it but

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.150 
know quite how they've done it but
they've<00:04:49.440> managed<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.370> instill<00:04:51.270> in<00:04:51.390> the<00:04:51.540> car<00:04:51.780> a

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
they've managed to instill in the car a

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.250 
they've managed to instill in the car a
preciseness<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.690> positiveness<00:04:54.690> in<00:04:55.050> the

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
preciseness a positiveness in the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.860 
preciseness a positiveness in the
steering<00:04:55.710> feedback<00:04:56.100> sort<00:04:56.880> of<00:04:56.970> low<00:04:57.210> speed<00:04:57.600> and

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
steering feedback sort of low speed and

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.660 
steering feedback sort of low speed and
still<00:04:58.110> make<00:04:58.320> it<00:04:58.350> very<00:04:58.590> light<00:04:58.920> to<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.430> touch

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
still make it very light to the touch

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.790 
still make it very light to the touch
and<00:04:59.940> yet<00:05:00.240> when<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.360> get<00:05:00.510> a<00:05:00.540> bit<00:05:00.690> faster<00:05:01.200> it

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
and yet when you get a bit faster it

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.440 
and yet when you get a bit faster it
actually<00:05:02.190> doesn't<00:05:02.610> get<00:05:02.820> wandering<00:05:03.210> at<00:05:03.270> all

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
actually doesn't get wandering at all

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.900 
actually doesn't get wandering at all
it's<00:05:03.690> it's<00:05:03.900> pretty<00:05:04.140> clever<00:05:04.440> stuff

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
it's it's pretty clever stuff

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.540 
it's it's pretty clever stuff
now<00:05:07.510> talking<00:05:08.020> about<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.350> steering<00:05:08.560> wheel<00:05:08.830> it

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
now talking about the steering wheel it

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.800 
now talking about the steering wheel it
takes<00:05:09.790> a<00:05:09.850> bit<00:05:09.970> of<00:05:10.000> getting<00:05:10.090> used<00:05:10.330> to

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
takes a bit of getting used to

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.150 
takes a bit of getting used to
with<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:11.640> gearboxes<00:05:12.700> on<00:05:13.540> these<00:05:13.840> BMWs<00:05:14.680> but

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
with the gearboxes on these BMWs but

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.860 
with the gearboxes on these BMWs but
once<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.460> do<00:05:15.670> they're<00:05:16.090> actually<00:05:16.390> bloody

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870

you<00:05:29.770> just<00:05:30.190> don't<00:05:30.430> bother<00:05:30.610> but<00:05:31.240> I<00:05:31.270> think<00:05:31.480> what

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
you just don't bother but I think what

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.990 
you just don't bother but I think what
BMW<00:05:31.780> have<00:05:32.350> really<00:05:32.950> put<00:05:33.190> together<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:33.820> maybe

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
BMW have really put together and maybe

BMW have really put together and maybe
that<00:05:34.210> it's<00:05:34.570> come<00:05:34.780> from<00:05:34.990> some<00:05:35.170> of<00:05:35.200> their

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
immediately notice about the x6 is that

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.320 
immediately notice about the x6 is that
it<00:05:56.470> leaps<00:05:56.920> to<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:57.250> touch<00:05:57.460> of<00:05:57.700> your<00:05:57.850> foot<00:05:58.120> which

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
it leaps to the touch of your foot which

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.780 
it leaps to the touch of your foot which
is<00:05:58.710> definitely<00:05:59.710> rewarding<00:06:00.160> now<00:06:00.520> I'm<00:06:00.610> not<00:06:00.760> sure

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
is definitely rewarding now I'm not sure

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.860 
is definitely rewarding now I'm not sure
if<00:06:01.270> part<00:06:02.110> of<00:06:02.320> the<00:06:03.030> reinforcement<00:06:04.030> of<00:06:05.130> this

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
if part of the reinforcement of this

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.050 
if part of the reinforcement of this
completely<00:06:07.870> new<00:06:08.020> car<00:06:08.440> is<00:06:08.680> the<00:06:09.250> amazingly

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
completely new car is the amazingly

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.550 
completely new car is the amazingly
guttural<00:06:10.510> sound<00:06:10.780> from<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.020> exhaust<00:06:11.260> plane

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
guttural sound from the exhaust plane

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.370 
guttural sound from the exhaust plane
and<00:06:12.100> I<00:06:12.820> just<00:06:13.060> think<00:06:13.300> it's<00:06:13.480> the<00:06:13.540> balance<00:06:14.230> the

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
and I just think it's the balance the

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.800 
and I just think it's the balance the
two<00:06:14.560> together<00:06:14.740> in<00:06:15.100> tandem<00:06:15.520> really<00:06:15.880> really

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
two together in tandem really really

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.360 
two together in tandem really really
make<00:06:16.960> you<00:06:17.080> feel<00:06:17.110> so<00:06:18.040> you're<00:06:18.190> getting

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
make you feel so you're getting

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.340 
make you feel so you're getting

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
somewhere you can't judge a book by its

somewhere you can't judge a book by its
