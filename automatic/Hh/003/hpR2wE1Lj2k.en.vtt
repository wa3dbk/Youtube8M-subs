00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.990
 of magician piano to learn to play a 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.960
 new piano song this time we're going to 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.769
 play a romantic song 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.130
 of the group hash of your leaves 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.539
 the issue is that he released is a 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.000
 song that has happened to much the 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.670
 radio 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.580
 this the introductory part or 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.050
 instrumental of the acoustic 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.050
 let's play first and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.050
 you 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.680
 they are two colors 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.289
 one 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.289
 two 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.010
 well then let's explain 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.100
 this first part of the introduction of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.990
 the song that he released 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.080
 let's start here we have the note the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.080
 better a bathroom of E flat 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.870
 Sun 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.470
 Eb 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.630
 then let's look only at the bass 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.410
 downward 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.250
 Sun 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 and see 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.540
 accompanied by the flat on the bass 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.219
 come down just under alone without love three 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.720
 times 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.670
 2. 3 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.960
 let's play close to listen 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.960
 the rhythm of the song 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.360
 I think we have two just 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.620
 for three seconds we leave pressed 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.920
 I'm 23 and we continue with the other part 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.580
 introduction 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.580
 let's see 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.010
 Sun 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.800
 but the delay with the delay 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.250
 sun goes down 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.700
 single 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.800
 let say 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.290
 Y 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.140
 and here if flat on the bass twice if 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.140
 flat 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.140
 28 hot from here until here so that 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.140
 listen to the rhythm then 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.060
 Y 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.040
 Y 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.810
 the huaca these are the final notes 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.800
 to find the sung part that 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.580
 it would be one of these and all 30 notes 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.580
 happy 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.580

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.540

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:48.200
 and comes as part and sung the 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.200
 sung match that is 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.090
 we will explain in the next part 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.730
 of the song 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.420
 I leave you free to learn the 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.420
 knowledge 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.970
