more than 5,000 feet wide at its widest
your<00:02:57.730> measure<00:02:57.910> bats<00:02:58.420> measuring<00:02:58.959> with<00:02:59.080> his

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
your measure bats measuring with his

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.190 
your measure bats measuring with his
arms<00:02:59.500> here<00:02:59.680> pretty<00:03:00.010> funny<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:01.330> then<00:03:01.840> at<00:03:02.049> its

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
arms here pretty funny and then at its

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.970 
arms here pretty funny and then at its
deepest<00:03:02.680> it's<00:03:02.980> about<00:03:03.340> 2,500<00:03:04.239> feet

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
a little like the river flows very

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.449 
a little like the river flows very
quickly<00:04:05.629> but<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.349> lakes<00:04:06.530> are<00:04:06.769> you<00:04:06.980> know<00:04:07.129> more

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459
