00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.840
 each time there are two possibilities 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.609

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.380

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.239
 question and if we pile up we have a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.680

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.880
 for a long time that I leave that does not even 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.229
 in me or I do not know if he will dry 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.580
 very quickly but for the moment I am 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.740
