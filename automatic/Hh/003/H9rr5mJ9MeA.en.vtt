00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
about Cades Cove so I know it's a

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.069 
about Cades Cove so I know it's a
popular<00:02:37.519> destination<00:02:37.700> can<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.569> tell<00:02:38.780> me<00:02:38.930> why

in<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.409> fall<00:02:39.680> especially<00:02:40.390> what<00:02:41.390> makes<00:02:41.599> this

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
in the fall especially what makes this

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.729 
in the fall especially what makes this
so<00:02:42.079> special

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
so special

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.190 
so special
I<00:02:42.769> think<00:02:43.159> the<00:02:43.250> fall<00:02:43.519> time<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:44.120> probably<00:02:44.930> the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
I think the fall time is probably the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.410 
I think the fall time is probably the
colors<00:02:45.560> more<00:02:45.980> than<00:02:46.190> anything<00:02:46.400> else<00:02:46.700> we<00:02:47.299> got

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
colors more than anything else we got

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.880 
colors more than anything else we got
over<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.569> hundred<00:02:47.599> species<00:02:48.049> of<00:02:48.230> native<00:02:48.470> trees

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
over a hundred species of native trees

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.550 
over a hundred species of native trees
in<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.129> park<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:50.030> with<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.170> we<00:02:51.349> get<00:02:51.530> a

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
in the park and with that we get a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.160 
in the park and with that we get a
rainbow<00:02:51.890> of<00:02:52.220> colors<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.879> think<00:02:53.150> what<00:02:53.390> makes

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
rainbow of colors I think what makes

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.110 
rainbow of colors I think what makes
this<00:02:54.379> our<00:02:54.560> second<00:02:54.980> most<00:02:55.160> visited<00:02:55.549> month<00:02:55.879> of

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
this our second most visited month of

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.690 
this our second most visited month of
the<00:02:56.390> year<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.769> fall<00:02:57.950> color<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.370> was<00:02:58.489> just

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
the year is is the fall color I was just

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.160 
the year is is the fall color I was just
speaking<00:02:58.849> with<00:02:59.030> Brent<00:02:59.420> over<00:02:59.690> at<00:02:59.750> Clingmans

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
speaking with Brent over at Clingmans

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.990 
speaking with Brent over at Clingmans
Dome<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.769> because<00:03:01.280> it's<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.549> higher<00:03:01.730> elevation

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
Dome and because it's a higher elevation

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.910 
Dome and because it's a higher elevation
he<00:03:02.540> was<00:03:02.690> saying<00:03:02.959> back<00:03:03.260> towards<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.769> beginning

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
he was saying back towards the beginning

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.039 
he was saying back towards the beginning
of<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.430> month<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.450> guess<00:03:05.659> in<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.840> higher

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
of the month I guess in the higher

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.839 
of the month I guess in the higher
elevations<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.769> see<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.040> fall<00:03:07.220> colors<00:03:07.609> and

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
elevations you see the fall colors and

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.240 
elevations you see the fall colors and
then<00:03:08.299> as<00:03:08.629> it<00:03:08.810> gets<00:03:08.930> later<00:03:09.200> in<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.560> month<00:03:09.709> it

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
then as it gets later in the month it

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.640 
then as it gets later in the month it
trickles<00:03:10.670> down<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.299> really<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:12.319> can't<00:03:12.530> go

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
trickles down so really you can't go

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.080 
trickles down so really you can't go
wrong<00:03:12.829> any<00:03:13.069> time<00:03:13.340> it's<00:03:13.579> just<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.790> matter<00:03:13.970> of

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
wrong any time it's just a matter of

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.759 
wrong any time it's just a matter of
where<00:03:14.359> you're<00:03:14.540> kidding<00:03:14.900> yeah<00:03:15.079> it's<00:03:15.680> this

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
where you're kidding yeah it's this

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.410 
where you're kidding yeah it's this
temperature<00:03:16.190> related<00:03:16.579> I<00:03:16.700> mean<00:03:16.849> it's<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.000> lot<00:03:17.120> as
