00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.150
 electronics is characteristically large 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.340
 the number of transformations 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.479
 one type of energy others 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:13.099
 There are 10 most common 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.099
 types of energy conversion in electronics 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.479
 mechanical energy conversion 

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:21.509
 into electrical occurs by 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.939
 at the microphone Yatsenyuk with his mother 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.739
 second kind of transformation 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.699
 electrical energy mechanical 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.519
 happens with the help speaks loudly Sergey 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.530
 electric motor 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.590
 third kind of conversion 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.140
 light energy into electric 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 happens with photo ap elements 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.530
 fourth kind of transformation 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.460
 electrical energy into light 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.430
 occurs by electron beam 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.540
 tube and optical indicators 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.740
 fifth view 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.930
 this is the conversion of chemical energy into 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.010
 electric happens by 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.090
 galvanic from elements 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.270
 battery size at time 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.450
 sixth 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.370
 this is electrical conversion 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.900
 chemical energy occurs by 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.440
 in the Kabul, and then again, but higher but 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.870
 moment times per row 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.280
 seventh round of thermal formation 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.980
 energy into electric 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.980
 occurs with thermoelement 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.370
 at the heart of the transformations 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.660
 electric energy to heat 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.610
 occurs using electric heaters 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.700
 ninth electric teaching 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.220
 energy in the magnetic happens by 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.040
 magnetic and recording heads 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.360
 59 magnetic energy conversion 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.710
 back to electric 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.950
 it happens magnetically 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.400
 playback heads 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.710
 records 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.200
 transition of one type of energy to another 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.650
 always accompanied 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.799
 quantity reduction 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.780
 primary guys prime
