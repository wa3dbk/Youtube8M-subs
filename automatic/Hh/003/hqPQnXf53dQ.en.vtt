00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
stoppage if there was to be a stoppage

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.250 
stoppage if there was to be a stoppage
oh<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.850> that's<00:03:07.030> my<00:03:07.150> prediction<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.780> just<00:03:08.050> I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
oh and that's my prediction I just I

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.190 
oh and that's my prediction I just I
think<00:03:08.620> pakia<00:03:09.489> has<00:03:09.670> way<00:03:09.970> too<00:03:10.030> much<00:03:10.390> speed<00:03:10.750> and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
think pakia has way too much speed and

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.800 
think pakia has way too much speed and
movement<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:12.370> know<00:03:12.549> if<00:03:13.030> he's<00:03:13.239> in<00:03:13.450> tip-top

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
movement you know if he's in tip-top

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.020 
movement you know if he's in tip-top
shape<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.980> know<00:03:15.070> after<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.760> know<00:03:15.790> his

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
shape you know after that you know his

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.670 
shape you know after that you know his
devastated<00:03:16.600> knockout<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.110> everything<00:03:17.470> I

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
devastated knockout and everything I

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.900 
devastated knockout and everything I
think<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.489> should<00:03:18.670> be<00:03:18.760> fine<00:03:19.110> Brandon<00:03:20.110> Rios<00:03:20.440> I

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
think you should be fine Brandon Rios I

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.100 
think you should be fine Brandon Rios I
really<00:03:21.910> don't<00:03:22.060> see<00:03:22.239> he<00:03:22.540> might<00:03:22.720> surprise<00:03:22.870> us

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
really don't see he might surprise us

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.600 
really don't see he might surprise us
but<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.500> really<00:03:23.769> don't<00:03:23.920> see<00:03:23.980> him<00:03:24.220> coming<00:03:24.430> up

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
but I really don't see him coming up

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.500 
but I really don't see him coming up
with<00:03:25.829> another<00:03:26.829> game<00:03:27.160> plan<00:03:27.459> if<00:03:27.760> his<00:03:28.030> normal

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
with another game plan if his normal

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.990 
with another game plan if his normal
style<00:03:28.720> just<00:03:29.350> coming<00:03:29.739> forward<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.579> know

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
style just coming forward you know

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.630 
style just coming forward you know
throwing<00:03:31.360> punches<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:32.110> really<00:03:32.500> don't<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:33.040> know

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
throwing punches I really don't you know

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.690 
throwing punches I really don't you know
see<00:03:33.940> that<00:03:34.150> working<00:03:34.420> against<00:03:35.079> pacquiao

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
see that working against pacquiao

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.979 
see that working against pacquiao
because<00:03:36.700> Pat<00:03:36.880> feels<00:03:37.150> going<00:03:37.329> to<00:03:37.420> hit<00:03:37.540> them<00:03:37.690> and

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
because Pat feels going to hit them and

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.990 
because Pat feels going to hit them and
then<00:03:38.500> not<00:03:38.709> be<00:03:38.890> there<00:03:39.160> if<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:39.730> fight<00:03:40.000> smart<00:03:40.780> oh

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
then not be there if you fight smart oh

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.140 
then not be there if you fight smart oh
so<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.390> just<00:03:43.810> think<00:03:43.980> Pacquiao<00:03:44.980> has<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.700> the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
so I just think Pacquiao has the the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.940 
so I just think Pacquiao has the the
fifth<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.750> know<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.079> physical<00:03:47.500> advantages

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
fifth you know the physical advantages

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.069 
fifth you know the physical advantages
with<00:03:48.310> speed<00:03:49.060> it's<00:03:49.329> going<00:03:49.570> to<00:03:49.630> be<00:03:49.690> way<00:03:49.840> too<00:03:49.900> much

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
with speed it's going to be way too much

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.280 
with speed it's going to be way too much
for<00:03:50.850> Brandon<00:03:51.850> Rios<00:03:52.209> so<00:03:52.510> that's<00:03:53.049> what<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.230> think

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
for Brandon Rios so that's what I think

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.949 
for Brandon Rios so that's what I think
oh<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:54.790> know<00:03:54.910> more<00:03:55.180> more<00:03:55.540> fight<00:03:55.750> predictions

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959
