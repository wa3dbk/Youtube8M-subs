00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Last week, the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.810
 news that the executive producer 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.910
 the simpsons or one of them to gindi a 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.650
 know that in season number 27 of 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.019
 this successful series 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.839
 the couple consolidated by marge and homero 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.640
 they would separate this because homero 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.789
 I would have some kind of dependency 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.369
 with drugs and would fall in love with women 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.990
 who would send them to you hello friends 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.760
 welcome to the channel many thanks 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.710
 for being here I am abrupt and I 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.630
 I commented that when I heard this news 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.399
 it really was the breaking point about 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.230
 this series I want to say with this that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.390
 for me, the simpsons must have already 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.219
 finished as well as ten seasons and not 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.010
 is that more since the jokes have been 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.260
 become repetitive and even they are no longer 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.200
 good memories the glorious chapters 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.719
 where in each chapter 4 or 5 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.910
 jokes that you could only count that 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.940
 fragment you put the video and it was 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.219
 really funny unfortunately in 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 Sometime everything must end and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.760
 I currently feel that the series already 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.379
 only they know the fans who have 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.409
 the hope that one day it will be so 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.240
 good or custom however they have 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.880
 tried to give it some twists 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.490
 and cause controversy because what I thought 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.750
 when I heard this news 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.790
 fortunately, it is false, since 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.369
 in the official account of the series have 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.259
 uploaded an image where it says that bart 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.079
 really is writing it in a 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.659
 blackboard and says that homero and marge do not 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.240
 on the other hand they will separate the message that 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.789
 came up in this image was from a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.159
 retweet and stop the rumors more 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.259
 forward an image was also uploaded and 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.479
 a text in Spanish saying marge and 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.759
 homer forever with this we can 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.090
 confirm that the rumor of separation 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.330
 it is false let's hope that this series already 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.479
 have a point where you already go of your life 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.060
 and do not require these rumors from everyone 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.009
 these conflicts and these gossip for 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.380
 that people see her again has already 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.330
 a lot that I do not see them I prefer to see 10 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.340
 Sometimes the same chapter of the old people 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.229
 to be seeing one of the new ones of 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.479
 do you really think what are you saying? 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.130

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.679
