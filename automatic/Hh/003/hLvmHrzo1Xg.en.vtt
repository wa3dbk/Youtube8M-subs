00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.309 

I'm<00:00:05.490> going<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.819> show<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.029> now<00:00:06.299> how<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.690> prepare

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
I'm going to show you now how to prepare

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.530 
I'm going to show you now how to prepare
the<00:00:07.500> fabric<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.189> how<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.580> dye<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:08.880> using<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
the fabric and how to dye it using the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.480 
the fabric and how to dye it using the
squeeze<00:00:09.809> bottles<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.800> first<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.250> want<00:00:11.400> to

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
squeeze bottles so first you want to

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.190 
squeeze bottles so first you want to
prepare<00:00:11.820> what<00:00:12.030> we<00:00:12.179> call<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.630> activator

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
prepare what we call the activator

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.629 
prepare what we call the activator
solution<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.219> will<00:00:14.309> just<00:00:14.429> be<00:00:14.549> a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
solution and that will just be a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.980 
solution and that will just be a
solution<00:00:15.030> with<00:00:15.450> washing<00:00:16.379> soda<00:00:16.619> or<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.730> -

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
solution with washing soda or so -

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.019 
solution with washing soda or so -
normally<00:00:18.990> you'll<00:00:19.199> mix<00:00:19.500> nine<00:00:19.980> teaspoons<00:00:20.460> per

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
normally you'll mix nine teaspoons per

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.120 
normally you'll mix nine teaspoons per
gallon<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.570> water<00:00:21.630> since<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> little

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
gallon of water since I have a little

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.620 
gallon of water since I have a little
bit<00:00:23.250> less<00:00:23.460> than<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.789> gallon<00:00:23.939> I'm<00:00:24.240> going<00:00:24.480> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
bit less than a gallon I'm going to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.990 
bit less than a gallon I'm going to
adapt<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.619> recipe<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.279> that's<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:26.910> you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
adapt my recipe and that's like what you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.689 
adapt my recipe and that's like what you
should<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.480> again<00:00:28.410> I'm<00:00:28.650> going<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> dissolve<00:00:29.310> my

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
should do again I'm going to dissolve my

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.920 
should do again I'm going to dissolve my
washing<00:00:29.939> soda<00:00:30.650> into<00:00:31.650> hot<00:00:32.399> water<00:00:32.790> because<00:00:33.660> it

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
washing soda into hot water because it

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.450 
washing soda into hot water because it
doesn't<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.649> dissolved<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.219> cold

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
doesn't like to be dissolved in cold

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.380 
doesn't like to be dissolved in cold
water<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:37.860> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.190> add<00:00:38.399> three

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
water so I'm going to add three

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.720 
water so I'm going to add three
teaspoons<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> think<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.520> third

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
teaspoons because I think I have a third

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.990 
teaspoons because I think I have a third
of<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> gallon<00:00:45.950> I'm<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.550> sure<00:00:47.789> it's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
of a gallon I'm going to make sure it's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.869 
of a gallon I'm going to make sure it's
fully<00:00:48.210> dissolved<00:00:48.930> before<00:00:49.469> adding<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.430> fabric

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
fully dissolved before adding my fabric

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.660 
fully dissolved before adding my fabric
to<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.230> I'm<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.649> whisking<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.489> make

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
to it I'm just like whisking it to make

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.700 
to it I'm just like whisking it to make
sure<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:54.030> fully<00:00:54.239> dissolved<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.140> -<00:00:55.350> or

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
sure it's fully dissolved so - or

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.470 
sure it's fully dissolved so - or
washing<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.250> there<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.789> little<00:00:57.090> tricky

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
washing so there can be a little tricky

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.270 
washing so there can be a little tricky
and<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.960> don't<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.500> enter<00:00:58.739> your<00:00:58.859> fabric

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and you don't want to enter your fabric

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
and you don't want to enter your fabric
before<00:00:59.460> he's<00:00:59.760> fully<00:01:00.260> dissolved<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:01.620> now

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
before he's fully dissolved I think now

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.869 
before he's fully dissolved I think now
it's<00:01:01.980> good<00:01:02.219> actually

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it's good actually

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.260 
it's good actually
so<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.690> pre<00:01:04.019> wet<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.409> my<00:01:04.830> fabric<00:01:05.369> which<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.880> also

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
so I pre wet it my fabric which is also

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.020 
so I pre wet it my fabric which is also
like<00:01:06.479> bundles<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.049> tie<00:01:07.229> dyeing<00:01:07.560> already<00:01:08.430> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
like bundles for tie dyeing already so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120 
like bundles for tie dyeing already so
make<00:01:09.630> sure<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.140> wet<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:10.979> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
make sure that you wet it and then you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
make sure that you wet it and then you
want<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.490> put<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.330> dye<00:01:13.320> activator

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
want to put it in the dye activator

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.550 
want to put it in the dye activator
solution<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.760> let<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.270> sit<00:01:15.509> from<00:01:15.840> 5<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.380> 10

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
solution and let it sit from 5 to 10

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.499 
solution and let it sit from 5 to 10
minutes<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.610> I'm<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> make<00:01:18.450> sure

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
minutes so I'm just going to make sure

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.359 
minutes so I'm just going to make sure
it's<00:01:18.810> fully<00:01:19.020> immersed<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:20.040> I'm<00:01:20.159> going

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
it's fully immersed and then I'm going

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.240 
it's fully immersed and then I'm going
to<00:01:20.430> wait<00:01:20.700> five<00:01:21.540> minutes<00:01:21.750> before<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.680> take<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
to wait five minutes before I take it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.719 
to wait five minutes before I take it
out<00:01:24.350> after<00:01:25.350> five<00:01:25.560> minutes<00:01:25.740> your<00:01:26.220> fabric

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
out after five minutes your fabric

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.060 
out after five minutes your fabric
soaked<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.360> activator<00:01:28.320> solution<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
soaked all the activator solution that I

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.890 
soaked all the activator solution that I
needed<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:30.030> remove<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.479> from<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
needed so you can remove it from the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.830 
needed so you can remove it from the
activator<00:01:31.350> solution<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.460> wring<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
activator solution and just wring the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.249 
activator solution and just wring the
excess<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:35.060> wringing<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:36.990> going

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
excess out wringing it out and I'm going

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.380 
excess out wringing it out and I'm going
to<00:01:37.320> move<00:01:37.590> my<00:01:37.799> dye<00:01:37.860> activator<00:01:38.549> solution<00:01:38.820> aside

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
to move my dye activator solution aside

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.580 
to move my dye activator solution aside
so<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.470> nice<00:01:40.740> clean<00:01:41.520> surface<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.270> die<00:01:42.630> so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
so I have a nice clean surface to die so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380 
so I have a nice clean surface to die so
then<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.860> prepared<00:01:44.220> three<00:01:44.549> colors<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
then I prepared three colors in the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.969 
then I prepared three colors in the
squeeze<00:01:45.659> bottles<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.290> I'm<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.829> show

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
squeeze bottles and I'm going to show

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.850 
squeeze bottles and I'm going to show
you<00:01:47.009> how<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:47.490> look<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.659> yellow

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
you how they look so I have the yellow

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.010 
you how they look so I have the yellow
that<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.979> pretty<00:01:50.220> light<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:54.020> berry

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
that is pretty light and I have a berry

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.840 
that is pretty light and I have a berry
color<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.310> actually<00:01:56.670> pretty

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
color that is actually pretty

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.780 
color that is actually pretty
concentrated<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:58.049> will<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.350> well

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
concentrated so I think will go well

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.980 
concentrated so I think will go well
with<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> yellow

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.260 

and<00:02:03.080> there's<00:02:03.560> also<00:02:03.770> some<00:02:04.130> green<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.610> really

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
and there's also some green I really

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.240 
and there's also some green I really
like<00:02:05.450> using<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:06.049> paper<00:02:06.260> towels<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.890> test<00:02:07.100> the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
like using the paper towels to test the

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.210 
like using the paper towels to test the
colors<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:09.289> actually<00:02:09.860> really

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
colors and this is actually really

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.280 
colors and this is actually really
useful<00:02:10.399> too<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.180> see<00:02:11.360> how<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.569> two<00:02:11.870> colors

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
useful too to see how the two colors

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.320 
useful too to see how the two colors
will<00:02:12.560> blend<00:02:12.740> because<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.730> because<00:02:13.880> two

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
will blend because just because two

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.110 
will blend because just because two
colors<00:02:14.660> look<00:02:14.870> pretty<00:02:15.430> next<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.459> each<00:02:16.580> other<00:02:16.850> it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
colors look pretty next to each other it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.080 
colors look pretty next to each other it
doesn't<00:02:17.180> mean<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.959> mix<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.860> both<00:02:19.400> when<00:02:19.910> you're

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
doesn't mean the mix of both when you're

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.030 
doesn't mean the mix of both when you're
putting<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.630> fiber<00:02:20.870> will<00:02:21.170> look<00:02:21.350> pretty<00:02:21.650> so

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
putting in the fiber will look pretty so

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.070 
putting in the fiber will look pretty so
make<00:02:22.400> sure<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.730> test<00:02:22.970> your<00:02:23.209> colors<00:02:23.660> before

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
make sure you test your colors before

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.140 
make sure you test your colors before
like<00:02:24.319> putting<00:02:24.739> them<00:02:24.950> in<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.340> fabric<00:02:25.730> side<00:02:25.910> by

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
like putting them in the fabric side by

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.760 
like putting them in the fabric side by
side<00:02:26.390> or<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:26.720> might<00:02:26.930> end<00:02:27.140> up<00:02:27.230> with<00:02:27.440> really

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
side or you might end up with really

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.970 
side or you might end up with really
ugly<00:02:27.890> results<00:02:28.520> that<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.390> don't<00:02:29.630> want<00:02:29.980> this

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
ugly results that you don't want this

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.280 
ugly results that you don't want this
technique<00:02:31.459> is<00:02:31.640> really<00:02:31.970> cool<00:02:32.209> because<00:02:32.540> allows

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
technique is really cool because allows

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.100 
technique is really cool because allows
you<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.739> apply<00:02:34.250> as<00:02:34.670> many<00:02:35.209> colors<00:02:35.480> as<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:35.870> want

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
you to apply as many colors as you want

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.500 
you to apply as many colors as you want
at<00:02:36.620> one<00:02:37.010> scene<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.459> fibers<00:02:37.850> so<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:38.120> can<00:02:38.300> get

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
at one scene the fibers so you can get

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.800 
at one scene the fibers so you can get
really<00:02:38.720> beautiful<00:02:39.680> results<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.820> tied<00:02:41.510> my

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
really beautiful results so I tied my

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.490 
really beautiful results so I tied my
fabric<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.440> two<00:02:42.590> sections<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.430> my<00:02:43.730> plan<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.330> to

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
fabric in two sections and my plan is to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.460 
fabric in two sections and my plan is to
die<00:02:45.500> each<00:02:46.040> section<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:46.910> one<00:02:47.120> color<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.780> have

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
die each section in one color and have

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.150 
die each section in one color and have
them<00:02:48.769> in<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.370> middle<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:50.890> mix<00:02:51.890> with<00:02:52.130> each

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
them in the middle just mix with each

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.780 
them in the middle just mix with each
other<00:02:52.519> maybe<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:53.120> middle<00:02:53.480> section<00:02:53.660> I'll<00:02:54.019> just

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
other maybe a middle section I'll just

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.430 
other maybe a middle section I'll just
also<00:02:55.790> mix<00:02:56.060> readings<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.840> with<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.200> squeeze

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
also mix readings so with the squeeze

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.650 
also mix readings so with the squeeze
bottles<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:57.950> pretty<00:02:58.220> much<00:02:58.400> just<00:02:58.459> apply<00:02:59.030> the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
bottles you pretty much just apply the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.620 
bottles you pretty much just apply the
dye<00:02:59.900> directly<00:03:00.709> into<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.220> v<00:03:01.459> work<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.330> can

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
dye directly into the v work and you can

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.930 
dye directly into the v work and you can
have<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.230> control<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.680> how<00:03:03.980> much<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.580> want<00:03:04.610> to

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
have the control of how much you want to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.960 
have the control of how much you want to
add<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.989> for<00:03:06.260> instance<00:03:06.680> if<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.280> like<00:03:07.519> some<00:03:07.820> of

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
add so for instance if you like some of

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.780 
add so for instance if you like some of
the<00:03:08.120> whites<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.660> appear<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:09.860> could<00:03:10.070> also<00:03:10.340> do

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
the whites to appear you could also do

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.240 
the whites to appear you could also do
that<00:03:11.000> otherwise<00:03:11.720> if<00:03:12.110> you<00:03:12.230> want<00:03:12.440> all<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.980> parts

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
that otherwise if you want all the parts

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.770 
that otherwise if you want all the parts
that<00:03:13.310> you're<00:03:13.519> dying<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:14.060> be<00:03:14.209> pretty<00:03:14.510> saturated

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
that you're dying to be pretty saturated

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.699 
that you're dying to be pretty saturated
make<00:03:15.410> sure<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:17.180> add<00:03:17.390> a<00:03:17.810> lot<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:18.170> dye<00:03:18.440> but

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
make sure that you add a lot of dye but

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.310 
make sure that you add a lot of dye but
also<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.130> can<00:03:19.519> work<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.600> dye<00:03:20.750> into<00:03:21.049> the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
also you can work the dye into the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.770 
also you can work the dye into the
fabric<00:03:21.769> with<00:03:21.950> your<00:03:22.100> hands<00:03:22.610> so<00:03:23.060> my<00:03:23.510> first

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
fabric with your hands so my first

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.800 
fabric with your hands so my first
yellow<00:03:24.079> section<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:25.220> dyed<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:26.510> think

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
yellow section is dyed and I think

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.960 
yellow section is dyed and I think
connects<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.650> yellow<00:03:27.890> I'm<00:03:28.220> going<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.760> put

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
connects to the yellow I'm going to put

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.050 
connects to the yellow I'm going to put
the<00:03:29.299> green<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:30.110> maybe<00:03:31.040> in<00:03:31.340> this<00:03:31.489> section<00:03:31.760> I'm

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
the green and maybe in this section I'm

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.940 
the green and maybe in this section I'm
actually<00:03:32.239> going<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.810> mix<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.230> green<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.739> the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
actually going to mix the green and the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.860 
actually going to mix the green and the
yellow<00:03:33.980> at<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.549> same<00:03:34.760> time<00:03:35.060> so<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.450> can<00:03:35.630> see

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
yellow at the same time so you can see

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.870 
yellow at the same time so you can see
that<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:36.170> can<00:03:36.320> apply<00:03:36.650> them<00:03:36.920> both<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.519> kind<00:03:37.730> of

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
that you can apply them both and kind of

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.870 
that you can apply them both and kind of
get<00:03:38.060> these<00:03:38.390> marbled<00:03:38.930> effect<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:40.489> I'm<00:03:40.670> going

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
get these marbled effect and I'm going

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.740 
get these marbled effect and I'm going
to<00:03:40.970> flip<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.510> do<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.079> same<00:03:42.320> thing<00:03:42.650> on<00:03:43.750> the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
to flip it and do the same thing on the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.860 
to flip it and do the same thing on the
other<00:03:44.780> side<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:47.120> this<00:03:47.269> is<00:03:47.329> my<00:03:47.570> green<00:03:47.840> and

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
other side so this is my green and

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.370 
other side so this is my green and
yellow<00:03:48.290> marbled<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:49.609> then<00:03:50.390> maybe<00:03:50.720> next<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.260> it

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
yellow marbled and then maybe next to it

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.630 
yellow marbled and then maybe next to it
I'm<00:03:51.560> just<00:03:51.709> going<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.070> do<00:03:52.310> just<00:03:52.640> green<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:54.640> I

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
I'm just going to do just green and I

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:09.440 
I'm just going to do just green and I
think<00:03:55.940> I'll<00:03:56.090> end<00:03:56.239> up<00:03:56.920> with<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:57.950> berry<00:03:58.600> color

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.390 

again<00:04:10.450> working<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.140> dye<00:04:11.319> into<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.890> fabric<00:04:12.250> to

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
again working the dye into the fabric to

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.420 
again working the dye into the fabric to
make<00:04:12.519> sure<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:13.060> all<00:04:13.299> of<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.780> layers<00:04:13.959> got

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
make sure that all of the layers got

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.819 
make sure that all of the layers got
dyed<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.819> I<00:04:16.359> guess<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.989> last<00:04:17.019> one<00:04:17.380> I'll<00:04:17.650> do<00:04:17.799> a

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
dyed and I guess the last one I'll do a

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.629 
dyed and I guess the last one I'll do a
yellow<00:04:18.039> tube<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:23.590> at<00:04:23.740> this<00:04:23.889> point<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:24.340> applied

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
yellow tube so at this point you applied

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.499 
yellow tube so at this point you applied
all<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:24.970> dye<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:26.699> your<00:04:27.699> fiber<00:04:27.970> will<00:04:28.180> need<00:04:28.360> to

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
all the dye and your fiber will need to

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:29.189 
all the dye and your fiber will need to
rest

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
rest

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.830 
rest
to<00:04:29.350> fix<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:30.009> dye<00:04:30.160> into<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.759> fabric<00:04:31.300> this

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
to fix the dye into the fabric this

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.900 
to fix the dye into the fabric this
process<00:04:32.289> we<00:04:32.410> call<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.770> curing<00:04:33.160> process<00:04:33.190> and

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
process we call the curing process and

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.890 
process we call the curing process and
we<00:04:34.900> normally<00:04:35.020> recommend<00:04:35.440> from<00:04:36.130> 4<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.759> 24<00:04:37.360> hours

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
we normally recommend from 4 to 24 hours

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.320 
we normally recommend from 4 to 24 hours
just<00:04:38.410> resting<00:04:38.949> curing<00:04:39.490> for<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.090> curing

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
just resting curing for the curing

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.170 
just resting curing for the curing
process<00:04:40.389> you<00:04:41.229> want<00:04:42.010> your<00:04:42.250> fabric<00:04:42.699> to<00:04:42.820> remain

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
process you want your fabric to remain

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.080 
process you want your fabric to remain
wet<00:04:43.539> so<00:04:44.229> it's<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.650> good<00:04:44.770> idea<00:04:44.979> to<00:04:45.250> just<00:04:45.580> wrap<00:04:45.880> it

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
wet so it's a good idea to just wrap it

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.409 
wet so it's a good idea to just wrap it
in<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.780> plastic<00:04:47.380> bag<00:04:47.889> or<00:04:48.280> saran<00:04:48.729> wrap<00:04:48.970> and<00:04:49.210> just

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
in a plastic bag or saran wrap and just

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.070 
in a plastic bag or saran wrap and just
let<00:04:49.630> it<00:04:49.660> sit<00:04:50.020> after<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:51.220> curing<00:04:51.400> process<00:04:52.080> for

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
let it sit after the curing process for

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.439 
let it sit after the curing process for
hours<00:04:53.410> you<00:04:54.039> can<00:04:54.220> just<00:04:54.460> rinse<00:04:54.639> your<00:04:54.820> fabric<00:04:55.330> and

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
hours you can just rinse your fabric and

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.450 
hours you can just rinse your fabric and
that<00:04:55.930> I<00:04:56.080> should<00:04:56.289> be<00:04:56.410> fixed<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.889> it's<00:04:57.370> all

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
that I should be fixed and it's all

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.580 
that I should be fixed and it's all
ready<00:04:57.699> to<00:04:57.789> go<00:04:58.030> so<00:04:58.270> this<00:04:58.810> is<00:04:58.960> how<00:04:59.110> you<00:04:59.169> tie<00:04:59.530> dye

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
ready to go so this is how you tie dye

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.849 
ready to go so this is how you tie dye
using<00:05:00.010> squeeze<00:05:00.430> bottles
