00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.840
 One more video lesson 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.960
 This time we will learn how to color and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.120
 today or any other part there that you 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.000
 want to color 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.810
 come on, you first opened your image 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.830
 The case I'm going to open from a look that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:32.579
 anyone can do with your 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.930
 photography and that's what you're going to do 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.149
 You'll have to work with 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.489
 selection tools as I explained in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.790
 video-lesson passed the option tool 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.420
 selection you choose one of them I go 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:51.149
 To use rain, I will not use it here. 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:56.039
 lacie tycoon that makes it easy for 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:01.109
 selection do not forgive me there I will give 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.120
 here the polygon I know is not the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.540
 best tool to do this because 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.939
 It is square but it does not have to be 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.939
 perfect your selection 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.150
 Here we finished what you're going to do. 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.300
 now you will press control j to 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.730
 duplicate a layer with only one area 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.060
 selected to lose control jacks 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:33.310
 with here the eye not so perfect but 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.920
 So that's what you do, you build. 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.210
 the call of the selected ones you 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.180
 come image 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.220
 a jus to even here steal there you 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.369
 you can also use several other options 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.900
 here I am not remembered now but 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.950
 Let's try putting the wheel 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.880
 hence you select the color of the eye that 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.140
 You want in case you can by pulling 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.810
 particiaram make an RV in the historic 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.940
 or pull bag here what do you notice 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.910
 that was not so cool because it was 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.700
 exceeded some parts because the 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.610
 people did not make the perfect selection but 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.130
 problems feel it's just you get the the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.800
 rubber tool 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.550
 I'm going to squeeze the head stick her and 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.570
 erase the unwanted parts not 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.570
 it's so cool 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.629
 I'll make it fast, it will not stay. 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.629
 so pretty 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.650
 but that's it 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.530
 can do with any other in May 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.400

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.080

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.080
 if you find it easier 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.739

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.019
 I got to sell his picture before 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.459
 floor told us to use the question since we are going 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.409

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.730
 You can be a door using the 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.090

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.790

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.790
 shift to and hold hit another selection 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:57.310
 the shift allows allows this for you 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:59.260
 galley between high selection and I will give 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.720
 against oj 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.840
 is to separate my selection from the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:10.930
 layers and then mail me the email. 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.260
 I can not go wrong, you can use the one you 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.709
 can use the bad saturation saturation 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.390

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.920
 then with the desired shares you 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.740
 remove my support as a radio 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:37.890

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.890
