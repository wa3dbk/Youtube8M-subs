00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.389
 Hi there, this is a new video review from 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.300
 online store Ace on whom I am today 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.150
 we want to introduce you to running 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.750
 nike free sneakers 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:22.189
 ruler nike free 30 and 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:26.329
 the nike free 50 line in two colors 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.590
 gray crimson and mint color immediately 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.169
 I want to say that this model was 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.480
 designed for lovers of freedom 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:36.530
 high speeds and maximum 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.960
 comfort feet when running and walking means 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.730
 nike free helps to strengthen the foot 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.489
 man at any regular 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.269
 using these sneakers strengthen 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:52.249
 your feet making them stronger 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:54.530
 developed and stretched when running in 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.449
 nike free sneakers for any type 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.870

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.879
 you can feel full freedom bega 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.070
 especially freedom bega you can 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.409
 feel in sneakers nike free 30 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:13.270
 since they are the thinnest and run in these 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.270
 running shoes comparable to running barefoot 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.159
 mean by special porous 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:23.329
 The soles are made of lightweight, non-washable 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.899
 foam get excellent balance and 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:31.579
 active stop amortization can 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.439
 see how they bend here are the sole of these 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.630
 running shoes 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:41.020
 all in cuts that allows your foot 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.579
 bend not only in this position but 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.130
 can arch in various on the right 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.390
 directions that is a cut made 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.630
 in all these types of sneakers along 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.210
 far and wide demonstrate 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.799
 Crouched these sneakers are very flexible 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.799
 very soft and light 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:05.829
 here in 2014 the company nike 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.200
 introduced this model nike free in 3 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.980
 variations that differ from each other 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:18.450
 friend fineness elasticity sole 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:25.989
 the thinnest is nike free 30 you can 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:30.360
 see the thickness of the sole compare exactly 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:33.040
 in night 330 sneakers as they say 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.239
 athletes they pass on the sharpest 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.060
 feeling when running 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.940
 since running can be compared to running 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.579
 barefoot and with very very thin soles 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.860
 especially wearing a sneaker 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:48.840
 but as for nike sneakers 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.379
 free 50 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.069
 here is a higher degree of spring nasty 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:03:01.109
 and depreciation but less flexibility 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.109
 sneaker flexibility a little less 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:13.989
 demonstrate the flexibility of these sneakers 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:15.549
 even the most avid athlete is less flexible 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.849
 with these sneakers can pick up 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.880
 exactly what he likes 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:24.730
 I want to say more about technology on 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.739
 on fly applicable in these sneakers it 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:33.010
 technology without seam seamless technology 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:36.010
 in which temperate is applied 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:41.260
 temperature resistant materials spores 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.590
 here they are here applicable here and 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.269
 here ahead 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.410
 These sneakers are very strong and very 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:54.819

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.720

 present, which is also important 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:14.340
 for running sneakers other materials 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.220
 this mesh is breathable mesh 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:23.060
 leg breathes well through it even tongue 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.060
 made entirely of mesh 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:32.730
 here they are such sneakers on and 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:44.850

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:48.570

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:56.340
