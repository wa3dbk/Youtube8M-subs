00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.179 

okay<00:00:03.659> again<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.580> nice<00:00:05.580> horse<00:00:05.910> really<00:00:07.189> natural

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
okay again a nice horse really natural

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.299 
okay again a nice horse really natural
rhythm<00:00:09.530> so<00:00:11.480> we<00:00:12.480> actually<00:00:12.630> follow<00:00:13.099> scales<00:00:14.099> our

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
rhythm so we actually follow scales our

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.189 
rhythm so we actually follow scales our
training<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.000> think<00:00:15.240> about<00:00:15.420> at<00:00:15.660> least<00:00:15.960> a

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
training and you think about at least a

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.980 
training and you think about at least a
rhythm<00:00:16.529> must<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> first<00:00:17.190> thing<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:18.090> this

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
rhythm must be the first thing and this

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.529 
rhythm must be the first thing and this
is<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.350> thing<00:00:19.970> certainly<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.270> horse

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
is one thing certainly with this horse

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.359 
is one thing certainly with this horse
in<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> truck<00:00:22.340> he<00:00:23.340> has<00:00:23.550> natural<00:00:24.180> rhythm<00:00:25.369> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
in the truck he has natural rhythm and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.140 
in the truck he has natural rhythm and
have<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.640> make<00:00:26.820> retinal<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:28.080> also<00:00:29.029> what<00:00:30.029> you

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
have to make retinal and also what you

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.850 
have to make retinal and also what you
can<00:00:31.219> see<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.700> fact<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.210> horse<00:00:33.860> does

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
can see is the fact that this horse does

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.900 
can see is the fact that this horse does
not<00:00:34.890> need<00:00:35.280> speed<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:36.000> move<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:38.100> if<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.730> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
not need speed to move so if you have to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.130 
not need speed to move so if you have to
ride<00:00:39.590> really<00:00:40.590> forward<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> horse<00:00:43.050> to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
ride really forward to get the horse to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.940 
ride really forward to get the horse to
move<00:00:43.550> then<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.960> shows<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> natural

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
move then it just shows that the natural

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.979 
move then it just shows that the natural
swings<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:47.789> there<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:50.449> this<00:00:51.449> source<00:00:51.750> even

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
swings not there and this source even

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.099 
swings not there and this source even
when<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.710> slowly<00:00:55.190> you<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.370> still<00:00:56.610> teal

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
when I just go slowly you can still teal

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.770 
when I just go slowly you can still teal
as<00:00:58.109> swinging<00:00:58.559> good<00:00:59.270> and<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.600> go

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
as swinging good and then if I go

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.380 
as swinging good and then if I go
forward<00:01:01.649> again<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.210> good

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
forward again and the really good

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.190 
forward again and the really good
reaction<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:05.309> rhythm<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.820> gets<00:01:06.000> bigger<00:01:06.200> not

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
reaction the rhythm just gets bigger not

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.899 
reaction the rhythm just gets bigger not
running<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.860> then<00:01:11.010> slow<00:01:11.280> again<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.909> when

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
running and then slow again and when

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.270 
running and then slow again and when
someone's<00:01:15.330> there<00:01:15.509> see<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.130> when<00:01:17.130> you're

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
someone's there see you when you're

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.969 
someone's there see you when you're
riding<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.759> always<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.390> think<00:01:19.320> about<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
riding you always have to think about a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.510 
riding you always have to think about a
lot<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.490> transit

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
lot of transit

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.709 
lot of transit
then<00:01:22.520> even<00:01:22.939> just<00:01:23.119> doing<00:01:23.299> it<00:01:23.979> slow<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:26.060> then

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
then even just doing it slow and then

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.730 
then even just doing it slow and then
forward<00:01:27.200> again<00:01:27.609> there's<00:01:28.609> a<00:01:28.729> transition<00:01:29.740> and

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
forward again there's a transition and

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:42.390 
forward again there's a transition and
you<00:01:30.860> can<00:01:31.039> see<00:01:31.219> how<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.460> horse<00:01:31.729> moves<00:01:32.659> uphill

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.250 

and<00:01:42.880> again<00:01:43.150> really<00:01:43.420> nice<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.920> his<00:01:45.130> back<00:01:46.230> when<00:01:47.230> I

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
and again really nice in his back when I

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.360 
and again really nice in his back when I
sit<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:47.860> sitting<00:01:48.850> shouldn't<00:01:49.270> be<00:01:49.950> making<00:01:50.950> you

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
sit so sitting shouldn't be making you

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.800 
sit so sitting shouldn't be making you
go<00:01:52.980> and<00:01:53.980> he's<00:01:54.160> sitting<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:55.270> hole<00:01:55.480> should<00:01:55.750> be

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
go and he's sitting the hole should be

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.050 
go and he's sitting the hole should be
comfortable<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:57.310> hole<00:01:57.490> should<00:01:57.640> be<00:01:57.700> swinging

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
comfortable the hole should be swinging

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.300 
comfortable the hole should be swinging
in<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.330> back<00:01:58.570> and<00:02:00.360> should<00:02:01.360> be<00:02:01.480> easy<00:02:01.720> to<00:02:01.900> do<00:02:05.310> so

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
in the back and should be easy to do so

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.910 
in the back and should be easy to do so
a<00:02:06.660> very<00:02:07.660> big<00:02:07.780> Cantor<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.670> can<00:02:09.850> see<00:02:11.910> not<00:02:12.910> so

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
a very big Cantor as you can see not so

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.460 
a very big Cantor as you can see not so
you<00:02:14.920> going<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.190> need<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.930> little<00:02:16.930> bit<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.230> time

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
you going to need a little bit of time

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.110 
you going to need a little bit of time
just<00:02:17.950> for<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.940> connection<00:02:20.790> which<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.910> big

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
just for the connection which is big

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.470 
just for the connection which is big
places<00:02:23.700> take<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> little<00:02:25.000> bit<00:02:25.090> more<00:02:25.270> time<00:02:25.450> to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
places take a little bit more time to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.100 
places take a little bit more time to
connect<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:29.470> again<00:02:29.860> very<00:02:30.700> obvious<00:02:31.270> what<00:02:32.080> a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
connect but again very obvious what a

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.620 
connect but again very obvious what a
really<00:02:32.620> good<00:02:33.420> strong<00:02:34.709> three<00:02:35.709> be<00:02:35.890> Cantor<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
really good strong three be Cantor the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.320 
really good strong three be Cantor the
lighter<00:02:37.870> he<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.230> on<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.530> hand<00:02:39.090> does<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.209> if

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
lighter he is on the hand does that if

00:02:40.330 --> 00:03:01.540 
lighter he is on the hand does that if
you're<00:02:40.480> dealing<00:02:40.660> with<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.900> city

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.760 

but<00:03:02.090> he's<00:03:02.240> a<00:03:02.270> horse<00:03:02.540> with

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
but he's a horse with

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.820 
but he's a horse with
what<00:03:04.370> I'm<00:03:04.520> feeling<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.180> good<00:03:05.690> work<00:03:05.930> ethic<00:03:06.170> so

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
what I'm feeling is a good work ethic so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.590 
what I'm feeling is a good work ethic so
that's<00:03:07.040> also<00:03:07.280> important<00:03:07.820> a<00:03:07.880> horse<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.330> I

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
that's also important a horse that I

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.020 
that's also important a horse that I
don't<00:03:09.350> have<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.650> motivate<00:03:10.030> he's

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
don't have to motivate he's

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.070 
don't have to motivate he's
self-motivated<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:12.610> he<00:03:13.610> wants<00:03:13.940> there<00:03:14.150> to

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
self-motivated and he wants there to

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.850 
self-motivated and he wants there to
move<00:03:15.460> he's<00:03:16.460> not<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:17.350> easy<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:19.180> keep<00:03:20.180> straight

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
move he's not so easy to keep straight

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.640 
move he's not so easy to keep straight
but<00:03:21.860> that<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.100> because<00:03:22.430> again<00:03:23.110> it's<00:03:24.110> a<00:03:24.350> big

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
but that is because again it's a big

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.970 
but that is because again it's a big
striding<00:03:25.100> officer<00:03:29.560> but<00:03:30.560> if<00:03:30.650> you're<00:03:30.800> just

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
striding officer but if you're just

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.700 
striding officer but if you're just
talking<00:03:31.190> about<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.970> pace<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:32.960> the<00:03:33.260> canter

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
talking about the pace of the canter

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:45.589 
talking about the pace of the canter

an 8 just so that he has that time to

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.740 
an 8 just so that he has that time to
develop<00:05:36.990> more<00:05:37.319> which<00:05:37.560> I'm<00:05:37.740> sure<00:05:38.539> let's<00:05:39.539> just
