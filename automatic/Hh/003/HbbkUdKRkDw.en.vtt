to have you with us today as you can see

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.000 
to have you with us today as you can see
we're<00:00:15.750> starting<00:00:15.900> into<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> new<00:00:16.529> unit<00:00:16.859> today

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
we're starting into a new unit today

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.950 
we're starting into a new unit today
it's<00:00:17.190> gonna<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.460> all<00:00:17.640> about<00:00:17.789> cells<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.690> today's

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
it's gonna be all about cells so today's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.599 
it's gonna be all about cells so today's
lecture<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.830> going<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.010> be<00:00:20.070> compare<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
lecture is going to be compare and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.790 
lecture is going to be compare and
contrast<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.240> then<00:00:21.420> there's<00:00:21.600> probably<00:00:21.930> five

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
contrast and then there's probably five

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.349 
contrast and then there's probably five
more<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.279> are<00:00:23.369> going<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.550> follow<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:24.000> so

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
more that are going to follow this so

more that are going to follow this so
stick<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:25.140> us<00:00:25.410> as<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:26.070> move<00:00:26.400> our<00:00:26.609> way<00:00:26.730> through

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
stick with us as we move our way through

stick with us as we move our way through
this<00:00:27.060> series<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.599> learn<00:00:27.689> about<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.019> cell<00:00:28.289> as

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
this series and learn about the cell as

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.140 
this series and learn about the cell as
always<00:00:29.369> we're<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.730> start<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.060> with

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
always we're going to start out with

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.179 
always we're going to start out with
some<00:00:30.330> objectives<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> day<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.099> you

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
some objectives for the day so here you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.639 
some objectives for the day so here you
go<00:00:32.340> falling<00:00:32.759> from<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> top<00:00:33.440> describe<00:00:34.440> the

go falling from the top describe the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.650 
go falling from the top describe the
difference<00:00:35.010> between<00:00:35.100> prokaryotic<00:00:35.969> cells<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
difference between prokaryotic cells and

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.650 
difference between prokaryotic cells and
new<00:00:36.870> carry<00:00:37.140> otic<00:00:37.410> cells<00:00:38.120> and<00:00:39.120> compare<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
new carry otic cells and compare and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.750 
new carry otic cells and compare and

should<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> review<00:00:42.600> from<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.290> basic

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
should be a review from your basic

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.470 
should be a review from your basic
biology<00:00:43.800> course<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.760> took<00:00:44.910> once<00:00:45.180> upon<00:00:45.450> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
biology course that you took once upon a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.700 
biology course that you took once upon a
time<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.170> let's<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.039> ahead<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.340> get<00:00:47.460> going

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
time so let's go ahead and get going

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.110 
time so let's go ahead and get going
starting<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:51.090> common

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
starting with what they have in common

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.619 
starting with what they have in common
so<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.440> cells<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.219> got<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> few<00:00:54.030> things<00:00:54.360> in

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
so all cells have got a few things in

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.170 
so all cells have got a few things in
common<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:55.170> are<00:00:55.289> as<00:00:55.530> follows<00:00:55.910> every<00:00:56.910> single

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
common they are as follows every single

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.729 
common they are as follows every single
cell<00:00:57.360> has<00:00:57.390> got<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.719> plasma<00:00:57.960> membrane<00:00:58.590> that

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
cell has got a plasma membrane that

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.010 
cell has got a plasma membrane that
would<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.250> flexible<00:01:00.020> phospholipid

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
would be the flexible phospholipid

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.200 
would be the flexible phospholipid
bilayer<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.469> surrounds<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.699> outside<00:01:03.120> of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
bilayer that surrounds the outside of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.579 
bilayer that surrounds the outside of
the<00:01:03.300> cell<00:01:03.480> even<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:03.870> they<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> cell<00:01:04.379> wall

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the cell even if they have a cell wall

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.410 
the cell even if they have a cell wall
as<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> case<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> plant<00:01:05.850> they<00:01:06.210> still

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
as in the case for the plant they still

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.600 
as in the case for the plant they still
have<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> plasma<00:01:07.049> membrane<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.920> inside<00:01:08.369> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
have a plasma membrane on the inside of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.100 
have a plasma membrane on the inside of
that<00:01:08.700> cell<00:01:09.240> wall<00:01:09.450> every<00:01:10.320> cell<00:01:10.530> also<00:01:10.799> has<00:01:12.110> Sat

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that cell wall every cell also has Sat

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.200 
that cell wall every cell also has Sat
assault<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.920> probably<00:01:14.369> know<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:15.000> Satta

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
assault you probably know this as Satta

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.510 
assault you probably know this as Satta
plasm<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> jelly-like<00:01:16.560> substance<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
plasm it's the jelly-like substance that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.149 
plasm it's the jelly-like substance that
is<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> middle<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> cell<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.920> third

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
is in the middle of the cell the third

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.980 
is in the middle of the cell the third
thing<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.729> them<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.390> chromosomes

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
thing all of them have are chromosomes

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.960 
thing all of them have are chromosomes
which<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.710> genetic<00:01:23.369> material<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
which would be genetic material and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.690 
which would be genetic material and
finally<00:01:24.299> every<00:01:24.840> cell<00:01:25.110> has<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.590> ribosomes<00:01:26.549> so

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
finally every cell has got ribosomes so

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.640 
finally every cell has got ribosomes so
it<00:01:27.030> doesn't<00:01:27.330> matter<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> cell<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.320> it's

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
it doesn't matter what the cell is it's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.590 
it doesn't matter what the cell is it's
got<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.009> basic<00:01:29.159> machinery<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> needs

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
got the basic machinery in that it needs

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
got the basic machinery in that it needs
to<00:01:30.900> make<00:01:31.110> proteins<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.280> some<00:01:32.460> work<00:01:32.579> done

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
to make proteins and get some work done

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.590 
to make proteins and get some work done
that<00:01:33.509> allows<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.020> live<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.759> let<00:01:35.759> me<00:01:35.880> talk<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
that allows it to live so let me talk a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.210 
that allows it to live so let me talk a
little<00:01:36.840> bit<00:01:36.960> about<00:01:36.990> prokaryotes<00:01:37.619> versus

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
little bit about prokaryotes versus

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
little bit about prokaryotes versus
eukaryotes<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.509> always<00:01:39.750> comes<00:01:40.110> down<00:01:40.229> to

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
eukaryotes and it always comes down to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.100 
eukaryotes and it always comes down to
words<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.430> science<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.030> first<00:01:42.420> word<00:01:42.780> is

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
words in a science so first word is

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.280 
words in a science so first word is
prokaryote<00:01:43.950> Pro<00:01:44.399> means<00:01:44.939> before<00:01:45.149> carry<00:01:46.110> out

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
prokaryote Pro means before carry out

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.560 
prokaryote Pro means before carry out
comes<00:01:46.950> from<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.159> Greek<00:01:47.399> carrion<00:01:48.030> which<00:01:48.329> means

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
comes from the Greek carrion which means

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.020 
comes from the Greek carrion which means
seed<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.770> case<00:01:50.130> they<00:01:50.369> take<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.880> mean

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
seed in this case they take it to mean

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.600 
seed in this case they take it to mean
nucleus<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.079> prokaryote<00:01:52.920> literally<00:01:53.399> means

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
nucleus so prokaryote literally means

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.410 
nucleus so prokaryote literally means
before<00:01:54.140> nucleus<00:01:55.430> eukaryote<00:01:56.430> means<00:01:56.969> true

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
before nucleus eukaryote means true

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.539 
before nucleus eukaryote means true
nucleus<00:01:57.659> EU<00:01:58.439> anytime<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.100> see<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.430> in

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
nucleus EU anytime you see that in

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.330 
nucleus EU anytime you see that in
science<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.149> means<00:02:00.450> true<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.259> then<00:02:01.500> carry<00:02:02.250> out

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
science it means true and then carry out

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.249 
science it means true and then carry out
from<00:02:02.610> carrion<00:02:03.000> which<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.420> seed<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.869> we've<00:02:04.049> got

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
from carrion which is seed so we've got

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.950 
from carrion which is seed so we've got
true<00:02:04.850> nucleus<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.450> let<00:02:06.570> me<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.750> out<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
true nucleus so let me get out of the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.059 
true nucleus so let me get out of the
way<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.530> we'll<00:02:07.619> talk<00:02:07.829> about<00:02:07.950> some

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
way and we'll talk about some

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.160 
way and we'll talk about some
differences<00:02:08.670> between<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.090> two<00:02:09.209> starting

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
differences between the two starting

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.720 
differences between the two starting
with<00:02:10.289> our<00:02:10.440> prokaryotes<00:02:11.069> versus<00:02:11.610> our

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
eukaryotes let me call it Mike

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.350 
eukaryotes let me call it Mike
real<00:02:13.250> quick<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.640> can<00:02:13.700> point<00:02:13.939> some<00:02:14.180> things

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
real quick so I can point some things

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.360 
real quick so I can point some things
out<00:02:14.540> major<00:02:15.349> things<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.920> note<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.280> are

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
out major things to note that are

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.069 
out major things to note that are
different<00:02:16.580> between<00:02:16.879> these<00:02:17.299> two<00:02:17.569> types<00:02:17.930> of

cells make sure that you understand that

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.110 
cells make sure that you understand that
these<00:02:21.110> two<00:02:21.409> cells<00:02:21.680> form<00:02:22.280> all<00:02:22.549> of<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.849> living

these two cells form all of the living

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.380 
these two cells form all of the living
world<00:02:23.269> are<00:02:23.659> prokaryotes<00:02:24.650> right<00:02:24.950> here<00:02:25.390> these

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
world are prokaryotes right here these

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.890 
world are prokaryotes right here these
guys<00:02:26.629> are<00:02:26.989> only<00:02:27.379> found<00:02:27.860> in<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.849> bacteria<00:02:29.659> and

guys are only found in the bacteria and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.130 
guys are only found in the bacteria and
the<00:02:30.110> Archaea<00:02:31.269> eukaryotic<00:02:32.269> cells<00:02:32.480> make<00:02:32.870> up<00:02:32.989> the

so<00:02:34.610> major<00:02:35.000> differences<00:02:35.629> between<00:02:35.840> them<00:02:36.290> first

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
so major differences between them first

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.500 
so major differences between them first
one<00:02:36.829> comes<00:02:37.519> down<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.790> their<00:02:37.940> genetic<00:02:38.360> material

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
one comes down to their genetic material

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.080 
one comes down to their genetic material
if<00:02:39.019> you'll<00:02:39.170> note<00:02:39.470> our<00:02:39.819> prokaryotic<00:02:40.819> cell

if you look at our eukaryotic cell over

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.500 
if you look at our eukaryotic cell over
here<00:02:54.440> you've<00:02:54.889> got<00:02:55.129> a<00:02:55.159> nice<00:02:55.519> membrane-bound

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
way to that's one of the big things that

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.300 
way to that's one of the big things that

bound up and defined prokaryotes not so
much<00:03:11.780> other<00:03:12.379> things<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.889> note<00:03:13.040> between

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
true nucleus those are the major

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.720 
true nucleus those are the major
divisions<00:03:42.709> between<00:03:42.889> prokaryotes<00:03:43.639> and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
divisions between prokaryotes and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.869 
divisions between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes<00:03:43.819> oh<00:03:44.449> let's<00:03:45.109> talk<00:03:45.319> about

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
eukaryotes oh let's talk about

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.970 
eukaryotes oh let's talk about
eukaryotic<00:03:46.879> cells<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.739> divide<00:03:48.739> them<00:03:48.829> into

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
eukaryotic cells and divide them into

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.500 
eukaryotic cells and divide them into
two<00:03:49.190> categories<00:03:49.430> you've<00:03:49.849> got<00:03:49.970> your<00:03:50.150> plants

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
two categories you've got your plants

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.839 
two categories you've got your plants
versus<00:03:51.079> your<00:03:51.230> animals<00:03:51.709> now<00:03:51.859> I<00:03:52.099> have<00:03:52.489> students

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
versus your animals now I have students

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.599 
versus your animals now I have students
all<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.090> time<00:03:53.590> get<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.769> fact<00:03:55.040> that<00:03:55.220> there<00:03:55.519> are

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
all the time get the fact that there are

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.069 
all the time get the fact that there are
differences<00:03:55.970> between<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.449> two<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:56.870> let's

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
differences between the two so let's

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.750 
differences between the two so let's
talk<00:03:57.319> about<00:03:57.470> some<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.099> these<00:03:58.190> specific

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
talk about some of these specific

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.849 
talk about some of these specific
differences<00:03:59.269> between<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.780> two<00:03:59.930> if<00:04:00.260> you'll

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
differences between the two if you'll

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.920 
differences between the two if you'll
note<00:04:01.069> both<00:04:01.519> of<00:04:01.730> these<00:04:01.819> are<00:04:02.120> eukaryotic<00:04:02.569> cells

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
note both of these are eukaryotic cells

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.869 
note both of these are eukaryotic cells
you<00:04:03.349> see<00:04:03.590> all<00:04:03.889> of<00:04:03.919> those<00:04:04.220> membrane<00:04:04.699> bound

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
you see all of those membrane bound

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.909 
you see all of those membrane bound
organelles<00:04:05.150> hanging<00:04:06.019> out<00:04:06.139> in<00:04:06.349> there<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.739> see

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
organelles hanging out in there you see

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.819 
organelles hanging out in there you see
a<00:04:06.949> true<00:04:07.280> nucleus<00:04:07.599> you<00:04:08.599> can<00:04:08.780> see<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.199> plasma

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
a true nucleus you can see a plasma

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.149 
a true nucleus you can see a plasma
membrane<00:04:10.220> around<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:11.120> inside<00:04:11.620> there<00:04:12.620> and

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
membrane around the inside there and

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.520 
membrane around the inside there and
around<00:04:13.669> here<00:04:14.209> now<00:04:14.780> let's<00:04:14.989> talk<00:04:15.109> about<00:04:15.379> the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
around here now let's talk about the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.680 
around here now let's talk about the
differences<00:04:16.099> between<00:04:16.159> the<00:04:16.760> two<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.299> first

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
differences between the two the first

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.719 
differences between the two the first
major<00:04:18.289> difference<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.070> if<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.340> look<00:04:19.549> at<00:04:19.609> our

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
major difference is if you look at our

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.849 
major difference is if you look at our
plant<00:04:20.000> cell<00:04:20.239> right<00:04:20.419> here<00:04:20.780> it's<00:04:21.380> got<00:04:21.530> a<00:04:21.560> cell

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
plant cell right here it's got a cell

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.700 
plant cell right here it's got a cell
wall<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.280> is<00:04:22.340> this<00:04:22.760> wall<00:04:23.599> that<00:04:23.990> surrounds

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
wall this is this wall that surrounds

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.410 
wall this is this wall that surrounds
the<00:04:24.830> outside<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:25.550> our<00:04:25.849> plants

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
the outside of our plants

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.360 
the outside of our plants
now<00:04:26.570> as<00:04:26.780> we<00:04:26.930> talked<00:04:27.200> about<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.500> while<00:04:27.830> back<00:04:27.860> the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
now as we talked about a while back the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.460 
now as we talked about a while back the
cell<00:04:29.090> wall<00:04:29.300> is<00:04:29.330> made<00:04:29.720> up<00:04:29.900> of<00:04:30.020> a<00:04:30.140> carbohydrate

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
cell wall is made up of a carbohydrate

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.650 
cell wall is made up of a carbohydrate
called<00:04:31.070> cellulose<00:04:31.790> it's<00:04:32.090> a<00:04:32.210> structural

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
called cellulose it's a structural

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.930 
called cellulose it's a structural
carbohydrate<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.680> we<00:04:34.220> do<00:04:34.340> not<00:04:34.460> find<00:04:34.730> that<00:04:34.820> in

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
carbohydrate and we do not find that in

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.670 
carbohydrate and we do not find that in
animal<00:04:35.330> cells<00:04:35.510> animal<00:04:35.870> cells<00:04:36.110> that<00:04:36.320> need<00:04:36.560> to

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
animal cells animal cells that need to

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.380 
animal cells animal cells that need to
be<00:04:36.710> flexible<00:04:37.280> they<00:04:37.640> need<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:37.910> be<00:04:38.000> able<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.210> move

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
be flexible they need to be able to move

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.940 
be flexible they need to be able to move
they<00:04:38.660> need<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.960> be<00:04:39.050> able<00:04:39.110> to<00:04:39.230> change<00:04:39.440> shape

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
they need to be able to change shape

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.310 
they need to be able to change shape
plant<00:04:40.850> cells<00:04:41.090> don't<00:04:41.480> so<00:04:41.690> much<00:04:41.720> need<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.140> do

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
plant cells don't so much need to do

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.860 
plant cells don't so much need to do
that<00:04:42.470> our<00:04:42.920> next<00:04:43.610> big<00:04:44.030> difference<00:04:44.420> between<00:04:44.570> the

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
that our next big difference between the

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.830 
that our next big difference between the
two<00:04:44.900> is<00:04:45.380> plant<00:04:45.770> cells<00:04:46.040> have<00:04:46.910> got<00:04:47.180> this<00:04:47.360> central

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
two is plant cells have got this central

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.230 
two is plant cells have got this central
vacuole<00:04:48.710> right<00:04:48.950> here<00:04:49.160> now<00:04:49.280> that<00:04:49.460> is<00:04:49.670> a<00:04:49.700> big

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
vacuole right here now that is a big

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.600 
vacuole right here now that is a big
storage<00:04:50.660> chamber<00:04:51.230> that<00:04:51.410> holds<00:04:51.740> on<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:52.070> water

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
storage chamber that holds on to water

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.460 
storage chamber that holds on to water
to<00:04:52.970> keep<00:04:53.120> our<00:04:53.270> plant<00:04:53.540> cell<00:04:53.750> alive<00:04:54.080> and

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
to keep our plant cell alive and

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.500 
to keep our plant cell alive and
standing<00:04:54.980> upright<00:04:55.190> if<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:56.030> notice<00:04:56.270> over<00:04:56.390> here

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
standing upright if you notice over here

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.570 
standing upright if you notice over here
in<00:04:56.660> our<00:04:56.840> animal<00:04:57.170> cells<00:04:57.380> our<00:04:57.680> animal<00:04:58.070> cells<00:04:58.280> do

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
in our animal cells our animal cells do

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.310 
in our animal cells our animal cells do
have<00:04:58.820> small<00:04:59.030> vacuums<00:04:59.630> but<00:04:59.810> they<00:04:59.960> don't<00:05:00.140> have

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
have small vacuums but they don't have

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.250 
have small vacuums but they don't have
that<00:05:00.560> giant<00:05:00.950> central<00:05:01.670> water<00:05:01.940> tank<00:05:02.330> vacuole<00:05:03.080> in

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
that giant central water tank vacuole in

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.400 
that giant central water tank vacuole in
them<00:05:04.010> like<00:05:04.370> a<00:05:04.400> plant<00:05:04.700> cell<00:05:04.880> has<00:05:05.090> mixed<00:05:05.810> major

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
them like a plant cell has mixed major

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.090 
them like a plant cell has mixed major
difference<00:05:06.920> between<00:05:07.040> the<00:05:07.400> two<00:05:07.430> is<00:05:07.880> our<00:05:08.510> plants

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
difference between the two is our plants

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.710 
difference between the two is our plants
have<00:05:10.100> got<00:05:10.400> chloroplasts<00:05:11.120> which<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:11.600> can

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
have got chloroplasts which you can

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.570 
have got chloroplasts which you can
think<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:12.020> as<00:05:12.170> like<00:05:12.200> solar<00:05:12.830> panels<00:05:13.070> they<00:05:13.400> take

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
think of as like solar panels they take

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.120 
think of as like solar panels they take
in<00:05:13.730> sunlight<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.330> they<00:05:14.750> turn<00:05:15.050> out

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
in sunlight and they turn out

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.250 
in sunlight and they turn out
carbohydrates<00:05:16.130> our<00:05:16.280> animal<00:05:17.270> cells<00:05:17.480> know

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
carbohydrates our animal cells know

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.690 
carbohydrates our animal cells know
chloroplasts<00:05:18.890> in<00:05:18.950> there<00:05:19.100> we<00:05:19.220> don't<00:05:19.340> have<00:05:19.520> the

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
chloroplasts in there we don't have the

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.630 
chloroplasts in there we don't have the
ability<00:05:19.790> to<00:05:20.300> photosynthesize<00:05:21.340> anything<00:05:22.340> now

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
ability to photosynthesize anything now

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.180 
ability to photosynthesize anything now
one<00:05:23.090> misconception<00:05:23.510> that<00:05:24.170> I<00:05:24.500> often<00:05:24.800> get<00:05:25.130> is

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
one misconception that I often get is

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.600 
one misconception that I often get is
that<00:05:25.550> plant<00:05:25.850> cells<00:05:26.120> don't<00:05:26.660> have<00:05:26.930> mitochondria

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
that plant cells don't have mitochondria

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.320 
that plant cells don't have mitochondria
you<00:05:28.610> need<00:05:28.760> to<00:05:28.880> make<00:05:29.000> sure<00:05:29.030> that<00:05:29.210> you

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
you need to make sure that you

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.660 
you need to make sure that you
understand<00:05:29.660> look<00:05:29.990> up<00:05:30.140> here<00:05:30.380> plant<00:05:31.160> cells<00:05:31.400> do

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
understand look up here plant cells do

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.930 
understand look up here plant cells do
have<00:05:31.940> mitochondria<00:05:32.450> just<00:05:33.260> like<00:05:33.470> an<00:05:34.370> animal

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
have mitochondria just like an animal

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.670 
have mitochondria just like an animal
cell<00:05:35.120> now<00:05:35.420> why<00:05:36.020> do<00:05:36.080> plant<00:05:36.380> cells<00:05:36.590> have

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
cell now why do plant cells have

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.770 
cell now why do plant cells have
mitochondria<00:05:36.980> well<00:05:37.580> sun's<00:05:38.120> not<00:05:38.300> shining<00:05:38.360> all

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
mitochondria well sun's not shining all

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.120 
mitochondria well sun's not shining all
the<00:05:38.900> time<00:05:39.080> they<00:05:39.290> still<00:05:39.530> need<00:05:39.710> to<00:05:39.740> be<00:05:39.920> able<00:05:40.010> to

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
the time they still need to be able to

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.370 
the time they still need to be able to
manufacture<00:05:40.340> energy<00:05:41.240> in<00:05:41.480> the<00:05:41.780> absence<00:05:42.260> of

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
manufacture energy in the absence of

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.530 
manufacture energy in the absence of
sunlight<00:05:42.590> you<00:05:43.010> know<00:05:43.400> at<00:05:43.850> night<00:05:44.030> so<00:05:44.270> make<00:05:44.420> sure

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
sunlight you know at night so make sure

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.330 
sunlight you know at night so make sure
that<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:44.750> understand<00:05:45.110> that<00:05:45.260> plant<00:05:46.100> cells

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
that you understand that plant cells

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.240 
that you understand that plant cells
have<00:05:46.610> got<00:05:46.820> you<00:05:47.450> mitochondria<00:05:48.260> in<00:05:48.410> it<00:05:48.560> and<00:05:48.770> with

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
have got you mitochondria in it and with

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.310 
have got you mitochondria in it and with
that<00:05:49.460> we<00:05:50.270> have<00:05:50.390> gone<00:05:50.540> over<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:50.900> differences

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
that we have gone over the differences

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.020 
that we have gone over the differences
between<00:05:51.440> our<00:05:51.650> plant<00:05:51.980> cells<00:05:52.250> and<00:05:52.550> our<00:05:52.700> animal

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
between our plant cells and our animal

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.720 
between our plant cells and our animal
cells<00:05:53.240> so<00:05:53.450> recapping<00:05:54.250> similarities<00:05:55.250> they

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
cells so recapping similarities they

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.330 
cells so recapping similarities they
have<00:05:55.880> got<00:05:56.120> membrane<00:05:56.780> bound<00:05:56.960> organelles

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
have got membrane bound organelles

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.160 
have got membrane bound organelles
they're<00:05:58.340> about<00:05:58.760> the<00:05:59.000> same<00:05:59.210> size<00:05:59.270> and<00:05:59.990> they're

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
they're about the same size and they're

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.200 
they're about the same size and they're
eukaryotic<00:06:01.070> cells<00:06:01.340> they<00:06:01.700> have<00:06:01.730> a<00:06:01.880> true

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
eukaryotic cells they have a true
