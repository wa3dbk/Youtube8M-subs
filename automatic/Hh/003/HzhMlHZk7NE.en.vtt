00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.710

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.779
 hey and welcome last resort 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.160
 hurghada with the regulate or list 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.040
 it has stopped right here 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.960
 Exciting stopped at the stairs 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.699
 I'm really curious what we go out 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.449
 does not turn yellow so quickly so there is 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:53.559
 Apparently several doors say 5345 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:56.110
 We take the first people I have 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.000
 somehow the feeling that values 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.790
 relive memorable 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.500
 that means for example here such a 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.379
 I would be interrogated by the police 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.790
 Let's say that we are going through now 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:15.240
 these hallways go through this door 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:15.240
 do which the second door 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:39.940
 age that's the tune right now 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.320
 I happened to have the feeling again 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.550
 the doors to that is not so yes 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.780
 of course I want to get back in there 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.090
 with money, what's going on here 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.050
 I was stuck 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.890
 So I think we should first 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.890
 do not die from it 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.720
 the thing grows dignified 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.210
 old and now in the cabinet away 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:09.840
 push huge back to your money 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.840
 fallen under it 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.310
 I think we have notes 4 1 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.750
 miguel wait where has times are 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.260
 We all all might jump here 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:35.099
 clean in the water 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:36.510
 So we almost damned here 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.389

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:45.060
 I do not have a house normally 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:46.170
 had to leave here somewhere 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.980
 We have to search and drop 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.480

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.030

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.120

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:08.209

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.209

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.190

 we have a playground with a pistol 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.629
 Maybe a kid will decide 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.470
 shot or whined I can slowly 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.289
 I understand that 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:58.870
 So first from history miguel look 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:05:03.699
 behind you the darkness is the 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:06.039
 the whole thing is not yours 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:10.750

00:05:48.930 --> 00:06:02.340

 I'm really curious how that 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.110
 collapse of the worlds wants to represent 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.710

 shepherd that two people at the same time 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.990
 because then they have to love each other and 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:07:00.750

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.060

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.110

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.850
 who would play before then 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.380
 We do not know more than before 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.420
 never mean and that's why we become 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.270
