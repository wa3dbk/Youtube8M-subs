00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
with the Moto e from Motorola we're

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.780 
with the Moto e from Motorola we're
going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.560> take<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.770> look<00:00:04.980> at<00:00:05.100> gaming<00:00:05.370> in<00:00:05.670> this

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
going to take a look at gaming in this

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.430 
going to take a look at gaming in this
video<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:06.210> see<00:00:06.359> how<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.690> budget<00:00:07.109> device

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
video and see how this budget device

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.040 
video and see how this budget device
copes<00:00:08.160> with<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:08.550> arcade<00:00:09.030> racer<00:00:09.360> being

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
copes with this arcade racer being

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.870 
copes with this arcade racer being
asphalt<00:00:10.530> 8<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:11.130> I've<00:00:11.250> turned<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.580> motion

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
asphalt 8 so I've turned the motion

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.370 
asphalt 8 so I've turned the motion
controls<00:00:12.240> off<00:00:12.420> because<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.719> can't<00:00:12.929> stand<00:00:12.990> them

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
controls off because I can't stand them

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.720 
controls off because I can't stand them
so<00:00:13.920> we're<00:00:14.009> going<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.190> be<00:00:14.280> using<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.580> on-screen

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
so we're going to be using the on-screen

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.010 
so we're going to be using the on-screen
controls<00:00:15.179> here<00:00:16.010> so<00:00:17.330> let's<00:00:18.330> see<00:00:18.480> how<00:00:18.510> good<00:00:18.660> this

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
controls here so let's see how good this

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.370 
controls here so let's see how good this
looks<00:00:20.449> you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.600> already<00:00:21.720> tell<00:00:21.960> if<00:00:22.260> you're

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
looks you can already tell if you're

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.019 
looks you can already tell if you're
looking<00:00:22.619> towards<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.010> back<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> iod<00:00:23.789> here

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
looking towards the back of the iod here

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.509 
looking towards the back of the iod here
that<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.960> anti-aliasing<00:00:25.560> isn't<00:00:26.130> doing<00:00:26.490> so

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
that the anti-aliasing isn't doing so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.769 
that the anti-aliasing isn't doing so
good<00:00:28.460> but<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> fact<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.090> even<00:00:30.420> running

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
good but the fact that it's even running

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.690 
good but the fact that it's even running
this<00:00:30.990> game<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.470> pretty<00:00:31.830> impressive<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.579> be

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
this game is pretty impressive to be

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.400 
this game is pretty impressive to be
fair<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.210> price<00:00:33.420> point<00:00:35.719> as<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.989> say<00:00:37.170> here

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
fair for the price point as I say here

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.610 
fair for the price point as I say here
in<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.590> UK<00:00:38.239> it's<00:00:39.239> about<00:00:39.329> 89<00:00:39.870> pounds<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
in the UK it's about 89 pounds in the

dollars tomorrow and I need to find some

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.920 
dollars tomorrow and I need to find some
more<00:00:49.050> loss<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:51.000> sensitivity<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.750> these

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
more loss the sensitivity of these

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.319 
more loss the sensitivity of these
on-screen<00:00:52.199> controls<00:00:52.620> isn't<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.579> best<00:00:53.820> I've

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
on-screen controls isn't the best I've

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.850 
on-screen controls isn't the best I've
done<00:00:54.660> if<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:54.870> because<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> steering<00:00:55.649> wheels

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
done if it's because the steering wheels

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.520 
done if it's because the steering wheels
too<00:00:56.100> close<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> edge<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> screen<00:00:57.989> here

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
too close to the edge of the screen here

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.500 
too close to the edge of the screen here
or<00:00:59.149> if<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.600> need<00:01:01.250> to<00:01:02.250> turn<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> sensitivity<00:01:03.149> up

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
or if I need to turn a sensitivity up

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
or if I need to turn a sensitivity up
within<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> controls<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:05.159> currently<00:01:05.339> got

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
within the controls I have currently got

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550 
within the controls I have currently got
it<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.020> about<00:01:07.080> seventy

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
it about I think it's about seventy

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.480 
it about I think it's about seventy
percent<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> let's<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
percent so let's see if we can do a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:21.649 
percent so let's see if we can do a
little<00:01:13.610> drift<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.820> their<00:01:16.369> turn<00:01:17.369> turn<00:01:17.759> ah<00:01:20.659> let's

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
little drift in their turn turn ah let's

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:31.600 
little drift in their turn turn ah let's
keep<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.020> let's<00:01:22.290> keep<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> going

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.750 

you

how did you miss how did you miss the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.530 
how did you miss how did you miss the
on-screen<00:01:47.130> controls<00:01:47.430> here<00:01:47.880> aren't<00:01:48.270> doing<00:01:48.450> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
on-screen controls here aren't doing so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:57.620 
on-screen controls here aren't doing so
good<00:01:48.870> at<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.290> I'll<00:01:49.860> guard<00:01:50.100> met<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:56.540> think<00:01:57.540> you
