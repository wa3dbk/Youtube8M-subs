smokey logo tutorial where we just went

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.470 
smokey logo tutorial where we just went
over<00:00:07.900> how<00:00:08.320> to<00:00:08.380> make<00:00:08.680> your<00:00:08.830> background<00:00:09.400> in<00:00:09.730> part

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
over how to make your background in part

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.950 
over how to make your background in part
one<00:00:10.690> and<00:00:10.960> this<00:00:11.470> is<00:00:11.530> part<00:00:11.950> two<00:00:12.220> so<00:00:12.700> we<00:00:13.090> are<00:00:13.540> going

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
one and this is part two so we are going

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.460 
one and this is part two so we are going
to<00:00:14.200> learn<00:00:15.160> how<00:00:15.340> to<00:00:15.420> create<00:00:16.420> like<00:00:16.900> your<00:00:17.080> text

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
to learn how to create like your text

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.760 
to learn how to create like your text
and<00:00:17.619> your<00:00:17.770> smoke<00:00:18.160> so<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:20.230> already<00:00:20.350> have<00:00:20.619> the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
and your smoke so we already have the

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.370 
and your smoke so we already have the
background<00:00:20.980> and<00:00:21.400> our<00:00:21.580> vignette<00:00:21.970> we<00:00:22.930> can<00:00:23.140> lock

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
background and our vignette we can lock

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.800 
background and our vignette we can lock
those<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.760> they<00:00:25.090> don't<00:00:25.300> get<00:00:25.390> messed<00:00:25.720> with

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
those so they don't get messed with

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.519 
those so they don't get messed with
anymore

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
anymore

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.210 
anymore
let's<00:00:27.369> create<00:00:27.910> our<00:00:28.619> text<00:00:29.619> here<00:00:30.010> so<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:31.630> can

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
let's create our text here so we can

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:40.620 
let's create our text here so we can
make<00:00:33.220> it<00:00:33.399> called<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:34.600> new<00:00:34.750> Boston<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.630> pull

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
make it called the new Boston and pull

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.610 
make it called the new Boston and pull
that<00:00:40.780> into<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.079> center<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.809> I'll<00:00:44.260> pull<00:00:44.500> my

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
that into the center and I'll pull my

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.350 
that into the center and I'll pull my
character<00:00:45.010> panel<00:00:45.309> down<00:00:45.460> here<00:00:45.520> so<00:00:45.879> you<00:00:45.969> can<00:00:46.090> see

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
character panel down here so you can see

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.060 
character panel down here so you can see
what<00:00:46.870> we<00:00:46.960> got<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:48.370> text<00:00:49.000> is<00:00:49.559> TW<00:00:50.559> cen<00:00:51.430> mt

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
what we got the text is TW cen mt

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:33.649 
what we got the text is TW cen mt
condensed<00:00:54.070> extra<00:01:10.560> bold333<00:01:11.560> marshal

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.359 

now<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.409> would<00:01:34.469> have<00:01:34.619> scaled<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> was

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
now if I would have scaled when I was

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.859 
now if I would have scaled when I was
down<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.909> anchor<00:01:36.119> point<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.420> down<00:01:36.600> here

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
down the anchor point was down here

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.510 
down the anchor point was down here
would<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.079> scaled<00:01:37.409> from<00:01:37.649> here<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.219> probably

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
would have scaled from here and probably

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.289 
would have scaled from here and probably
went<00:01:38.850> off<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.180> screen<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:42.060> have

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
went off the screen so now that we have

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.999 
went off the screen so now that we have
our<00:01:44.600> our<00:01:45.600> title<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.409> we're<00:01:46.619> going<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.799> want

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
our our title here we're going to want

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.029 
our our title here we're going to want
to<00:01:47.280> add<00:01:47.549> some<00:01:48.360> smoke<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.860> can

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
to add some smoke in it so if you can

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.980 
to add some smoke in it so if you can
look<00:01:50.429> here<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.929> see<00:01:52.170> within<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.829> letters

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
look here you can see within the letters

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.169 
look here you can see within the letters
there<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> smoke<00:01:56.130> trail<00:01:56.429> going<00:01:56.789> in<00:01:56.970> between

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
there is a smoke trail going in between

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.300 
there is a smoke trail going in between
you<00:01:57.569> can<00:01:57.720> see<00:01:57.899> how<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.079> letters<00:01:58.470> darken<00:01:59.039> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you can see how the letters darken and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.460 
you can see how the letters darken and
lighten<00:01:59.610> that's<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.810> because<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.319> the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
lighten that's actually because of the

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:12.890 
lighten that's actually because of the
smoke<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:04.159> now<00:02:05.159> we're<00:02:05.939> going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:10.700> create<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:12.120> new

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
smoke so now we're going to create a new

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.979 
smoke so now we're going to create a new
layer<00:02:14.690> it's<00:02:15.690> gonna<00:02:15.780> be<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> solid<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.840> I'm

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
layer it's gonna be a solid and I'm

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.550 
layer it's gonna be a solid and I'm
gonna<00:02:19.170> name<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:20.030> fractal<00:02:21.030> noise<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:25.349> color

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
gonna name this fractal noise the color

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.569 
gonna name this fractal noise the color
doesn't<00:02:26.160> matter<00:02:27.110> okay<00:02:28.160> actually<00:02:29.160> I'm<00:02:29.459> gonna

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
doesn't matter okay actually I'm gonna

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.250 
doesn't matter okay actually I'm gonna
make<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:30.060> yeah<00:02:30.720> I'm<00:02:30.840> gonna<00:02:31.019> hit<00:02:31.230> okay<00:02:33.260> I'm

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
make it yeah I'm gonna hit okay I'm

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.729 
make it yeah I'm gonna hit okay I'm
going<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:35.090> add<00:02:36.090> an<00:02:36.420> effect<00:02:36.750> called<00:02:36.870> fractal

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
going to add an effect called fractal

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.949 
going to add an effect called fractal
noise<00:02:37.950> by<00:02:38.940> typing<00:02:39.299> it<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.660> over<00:02:39.959> here<00:02:41.810> drag<00:02:42.810> it

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
noise by typing it in over here drag it

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.630 
noise by typing it in over here drag it
on<00:02:43.049> top<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.319> my<00:02:44.010> solid<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.569> get<00:02:45.720> this

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.200 

the<00:02:50.120> first<00:02:50.720> thing<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:51.050> want<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.530> do<00:02:51.710> here<00:02:52.100> is

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
the first thing I want to do here is

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.130 
the first thing I want to do here is
darken<00:02:53.210> my<00:02:54.490> fractal<00:02:55.490> noise<00:02:55.610> so<00:02:56.030> I'll<00:02:56.270> move

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
darken my fractal noise so I'll move

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.340 
darken my fractal noise so I'll move
this<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.400> think<00:02:58.460> around<00:02:59.420> negative<00:02:59.600> 40<00:03:00.200> is

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
this and I think around negative 40 is

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.260 
this and I think around negative 40 is
what<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.620> liked<00:03:00.950> everything<00:03:01.400> 40<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:02.060> what<00:03:02.240> I

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
what I liked everything 40 is what I

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.300 
what I liked everything 40 is what I
liked

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
liked

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.470 
liked
well<00:03:04.310> that's<00:03:04.460> contrast<00:03:04.940> I<00:03:05.060> don't<00:03:05.210> want<00:03:05.330> that

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
well that's contrast I don't want that

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.050 
well that's contrast I don't want that
brightness<00:03:06.410> back<00:03:06.680> at<00:03:07.120> negative<00:03:08.120> 40<00:03:09.550> so<00:03:10.550> now<00:03:11.000> we

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
brightness back at negative 40 so now we

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.700 
brightness back at negative 40 so now we
got<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:12.140> nice<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.620> dark<00:03:12.830> I<00:03:14.140> do<00:03:15.140> want<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.650> change

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
got it nice and dark I do want to change

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.440 
got it nice and dark I do want to change
the<00:03:16.010> contrast<00:03:16.520> and<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:16.910> want<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.150> bring<00:03:17.270> it<00:03:17.420> down

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
the contrast and I want to bring it down

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.180 
the contrast and I want to bring it down
a<00:03:17.630> little<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:19.430> about<00:03:19.910> 75<00:03:20.870> I'm<00:03:21.770> just<00:03:22.010> going<00:03:22.130> to

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
a little to about 75 I'm just going to

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.660 
a little to about 75 I'm just going to
type<00:03:22.340> in<00:03:22.490> 75<00:03:25.870> now<00:03:26.870> I<00:03:26.900> already<00:03:27.530> created<00:03:28.310> the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
type in 75 now I already created the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.800 
type in 75 now I already created the
logo<00:03:28.820> obviously<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:29.720> I'm<00:03:29.840> using<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:31.810> property

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
logo obviously so I'm using the property

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.130 
logo obviously so I'm using the property
amounts<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:33.800> I<00:03:33.830> already<00:03:34.160> know<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.610> work<00:03:35.140> so

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
amounts that I already know that work so

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.050 
amounts that I already know that work so
the<00:03:36.440> next<00:03:36.620> thing<00:03:36.800> we<00:03:36.950> want<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.130> do<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.430> scale

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
the next thing we want to do is scale

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.270 
the next thing we want to do is scale
this<00:03:38.120> up<00:03:38.450> so<00:03:39.350> we'll<00:03:39.680> turtle<00:03:39.980> down<00:03:40.100> this

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
this up so we'll turtle down this

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.690 
this up so we'll turtle down this
transform<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.540> we<00:03:41.630> have<00:03:41.750> this<00:03:41.870> scale<00:03:42.140> and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
transform and we have this scale and

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.990 
transform and we have this scale and
we'll<00:03:43.700> transform<00:03:44.270> that<00:03:44.480> up<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.810> 375<00:03:45.730> or<00:03:46.730> scale

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
we'll transform that up to 375 or scale

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.440 
we'll transform that up to 375 or scale
that<00:03:47.150> up<00:03:48.820> now<00:03:49.820> this<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.180> going<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.690> be<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:51.320> little

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
that up now this is going to be a little

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.810 
that up now this is going to be a little
better-looking<00:03:53.450> smoke<00:03:54.440> here<00:03:54.739> we're<00:03:55.550> getting

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
better-looking smoke here we're getting

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.420 
better-looking smoke here we're getting
close

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.509 

we're<00:04:00.329> gonna<00:04:00.480> set<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.140> blending<00:04:02.010> mode<00:04:02.220> to

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
we're gonna set this blending mode to

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.089 
we're gonna set this blending mode to
none<00:04:03.590> here<00:04:04.939> and<00:04:05.939> we're<00:04:06.269> gonna<00:04:06.360> animate<00:04:07.099> this

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
none here and we're gonna animate this

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.940 
none here and we're gonna animate this
moving<00:04:09.060> across<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.349> screen<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:11.640> come<00:04:12.150> down<00:04:12.329> to

your current timeline make sure it's at

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.439 
your current timeline make sure it's at
zero<00:04:16.039> we're<00:04:17.039> gonna<00:04:17.220> animate<00:04:17.699> this<00:04:17.970> offset

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449

your timeline and then move the
crosshair<00:04:35.160> button<00:04:35.550> over<00:04:36.030> here<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:37.370> we'll<00:04:38.370> see

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
crosshair button over here and we'll see

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.550 
crosshair button over here and we'll see
what<00:04:38.699> that<00:04:38.850> looks<00:04:39.090> like<00:04:41.990> as<00:04:42.990> you<00:04:43.110> can<00:04:43.260> see<00:04:43.380> it's

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
what that looks like as you can see it's

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.219 
what that looks like as you can see it's
just<00:04:43.620> moving<00:04:43.949> across<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:45.120> screen<00:04:48.199> so<00:04:49.199> the

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
just moving across the screen so the

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.830 
just moving across the screen so the
next<00:04:49.710> thing<00:04:49.919> we<00:04:50.070> want<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:50.580> edit<00:04:50.970> is<00:04:51.389> the

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
next thing we want to edit is the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.350 
next thing we want to edit is the
evolution<00:04:53.150> so<00:04:54.150> what<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:54.960> like<00:04:55.229> to<00:04:55.349> do<00:04:55.530> is<00:04:56.330> go<00:04:57.330> to

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
evolution so what I like to do is go to

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.820 
evolution so what I like to do is go to
the<00:04:57.539> beginning<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.259> make<00:04:58.889> a<00:04:58.919> stopwatch<00:05:00.710> so<00:05:01.710> we

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
the beginning and make a stopwatch so we

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.100 
the beginning and make a stopwatch so we
start<00:05:02.130> keyframing<00:05:02.550> come<00:05:03.510> down<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:03.960> end

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
start keyframing come down to the end

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.760 
start keyframing come down to the end
and<00:05:04.669> I'm<00:05:05.669> gonna<00:05:05.880> set<00:05:06.449> the<00:05:06.570> evolution<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.410> do

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
and I'm gonna set the evolution to do

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.839 
and I'm gonna set the evolution to do
one<00:05:08.039> revolution<00:05:08.220> there<00:05:09.530> now<00:05:10.530> as<00:05:11.220> I<00:05:11.490> can<00:05:11.669> I'll

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
one revolution there now as I can I'll

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.339 
one revolution there now as I can I'll
show<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.090> what<00:05:12.270> happens<00:05:12.570> here<00:05:14.930> you<00:05:15.930> can<00:05:16.080> see

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
show you what happens here you can see

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.290 
show you what happens here you can see
that<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.770> like<00:05:16.949> kind<00:05:17.220> of<00:05:17.280> like<00:05:17.430> grows<00:05:18.000> and

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
that it like kind of like grows and

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.409 
that it like kind of like grows and
moves<00:05:18.419> around<00:05:18.599> and<00:05:18.930> stuff<00:05:19.110> like<00:05:19.229> that<00:05:20.419> so

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
moves around and stuff like that so

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.240 
moves around and stuff like that so
we're<00:05:21.840> pretty<00:05:22.020> close<00:05:22.320> but<00:05:22.740> this<00:05:23.039> doesn't

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
we're pretty close but this doesn't

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.330 
we're pretty close but this doesn't
exactly<00:05:23.669> look<00:05:24.120> like<00:05:24.180> smoke<00:05:24.720> so<00:05:25.710> we<00:05:26.099> need<00:05:26.250> to

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
exactly look like smoke so we need to

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.270 
exactly look like smoke so we need to
add<00:05:26.460> another<00:05:26.760> effect<00:05:26.970> and<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:28.620> effect<00:05:28.650> we're

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
add another effect and the effect we're

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.409 
add another effect and the effect we're
going<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:29.610> add<00:05:29.760> is<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.240> a<00:05:30.449> blur<00:05:30.870> so<00:05:32.120> we'll<00:05:33.120> come

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
going to add is is a blur so we'll come

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.629 
going to add is is a blur so we'll come
down<00:05:33.449> to<00:05:33.840> blur<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.620> sharpen<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:35.280> then<00:05:35.490> we're

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
down to blur and sharpen and then we're

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.129 
down to blur and sharpen and then we're
going<00:05:35.729> to<00:05:35.820> come<00:05:36.030> to<00:05:36.180> cc-vector<00:05:36.750> blur<00:05:37.699> and<00:05:39.139> this

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
going to come to cc-vector blur and this

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.159 
going to come to cc-vector blur and this
is<00:05:40.500> a<00:05:41.010> common<00:05:41.460> way<00:05:41.639> to<00:05:41.699> make<00:05:42.270> smoke<00:05:42.570> in<00:05:42.870> After

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
is a common way to make smoke in After

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.050 
is a common way to make smoke in After
Effects<00:05:43.550> so<00:05:44.550> we're<00:05:45.419> going<00:05:45.720> to<00:05:45.960> use<00:05:46.940> kind<00:05:47.940> of

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
Effects so we're going to use kind of

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.370 
Effects so we're going to use kind of
specific<00:05:49.820> settings<00:05:50.820> here<00:05:51.090> so<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.810> type<00:05:52.050> here

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
specific settings here so the type here

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.890 
specific settings here so the type here
is<00:05:52.590> going<00:05:52.889> to<00:05:53.039> be<00:05:53.220> Direction<00:05:53.909> fading<00:05:56.900> we're

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
is going to be Direction fading we're

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.020 
is going to be Direction fading we're
going<00:05:58.050> to<00:05:58.110> change<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:59.010> amount<00:05:59.099> here<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.880> 113

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
going to change the amount here to 113

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.210 
going to change the amount here to 113
and<00:06:03.030> then<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.330> angle<00:06:03.750> here<00:06:04.080> to<00:06:04.349> 1

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
and then the angle here to 1

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:14.590 
and then the angle here to 1
and<00:06:05.400> 32<00:06:10.490> and<00:06:11.490> you<00:06:12.120> can<00:06:12.270> see<00:06:12.450> how<00:06:12.630> it<00:06:12.750> looks

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
and 32 and you can see how it looks

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.490 
and 32 and you can see how it looks
looks<00:06:15.600> like<00:06:15.690> some<00:06:15.930> smoke<00:06:16.230> and<00:06:18.170> we<00:06:19.170> don't<00:06:19.350> need

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
looks like some smoke and we don't need

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.500 
looks like some smoke and we don't need
to<00:06:19.620> worry<00:06:19.860> about<00:06:19.980> these<00:06:20.400> edges<00:06:20.820> here<00:06:20.850> because

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
to worry about these edges here because

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.270 
to worry about these edges here because
we're<00:06:21.810> not<00:06:21.840> going<00:06:22.260> to<00:06:22.350> be<00:06:22.470> using<00:06:22.890> the<00:06:22.980> edges

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
we're not going to be using the edges

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.460 
we're not going to be using the edges
you<00:06:23.400> can<00:06:23.430> see<00:06:23.670> that<00:06:23.850> they're<00:06:24.000> a<00:06:24.030> little

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
you can see that they're a little

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.800 
you can see that they're a little
weird-looking<00:06:25.910> with<00:06:26.910> like<00:06:27.120> grainy<00:06:27.720> or

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
weird-looking with like grainy or

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.270 
weird-looking with like grainy or
whatever<00:06:28.170> but<00:06:28.380> we're<00:06:28.500> not<00:06:28.620> going<00:06:28.800> to<00:06:28.890> be<00:06:28.950> using

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
whatever but we're not going to be using

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.290 
whatever but we're not going to be using
those<00:06:29.370> so<00:06:29.520> we<00:06:29.610> don't<00:06:29.760> need<00:06:29.880> to<00:06:29.970> worry<00:06:30.120> about

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
those so we don't need to worry about

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.740 
those so we don't need to worry about
that

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
that

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.280 
that
so<00:06:31.500> we<00:06:31.620> have<00:06:31.830> our<00:06:32.040> smoke<00:06:32.400> that<00:06:32.550> we<00:06:32.700> made<00:06:32.910> and

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
so we have our smoke that we made and

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.670 
so we have our smoke that we made and
now<00:06:34.290> we<00:06:34.350> need<00:06:34.620> to<00:06:34.740> put<00:06:34.920> it<00:06:35.040> on<00:06:35.220> to<00:06:36.150> our<00:06:36.680> New

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
now we need to put it on to our New

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.720 
now we need to put it on to our New
Boston<00:06:38.030> letters<00:06:39.030> here<00:06:39.950> so<00:06:40.950> what<00:06:41.220> I'm<00:06:41.310> gonna<00:06:41.430> do

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
Boston letters here so what I'm gonna do

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.700 
Boston letters here so what I'm gonna do
is<00:06:42.710> click<00:06:43.710> on<00:06:44.010> our<00:06:44.610> fractal<00:06:45.090> noise<00:06:45.210> and<00:06:45.710> also

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
is click on our fractal noise and also

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.050 
is click on our fractal noise and also
click<00:06:47.040> on<00:06:47.250> our<00:06:47.760> text<00:06:48.690> here<00:06:48.900> and<00:06:49.800> I'm<00:06:50.220> gonna<00:06:50.340> put

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
click on our text here and I'm gonna put

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.220 
click on our text here and I'm gonna put
those<00:06:51.240> into<00:06:51.690> a<00:06:51.720> new<00:06:51.990> layer<00:06:52.260> by<00:06:53.010> going<00:06:53.040> to<00:06:53.520> layer

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.230 
those into a new layer by going to layer

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.730 
those into a new layer by going to layer
pre<00:06:55.230> compose<00:06:55.730> and<00:06:56.730> it's<00:06:57.660> pretty<00:06:58.110> much<00:06:58.200> putting

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
pre compose and it's pretty much putting

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.400 
pre compose and it's pretty much putting
it<00:06:58.920> into<00:06:59.070> a<00:06:59.220> new<00:06:59.460> composition<00:06:59.910> actually<00:07:00.660> and<00:07:01.200> I

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
it into a new composition actually and I

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:07.370 
it into a new composition actually and I
want<00:07:01.590> to<00:07:01.680> name<00:07:01.890> this<00:07:03.800> smoky<00:07:06.140> title<00:07:07.140> or

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
want to name this smoky title or

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.530 
want to name this smoky title or
something<00:07:07.650> like<00:07:07.740> that

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:08.540 
something like that

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.090 
something like that
move<00:07:09.540> all<00:07:09.810> attributes<00:07:10.470> into<00:07:10.680> the<00:07:10.980> new

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
move all attributes into the new

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.659 
move all attributes into the new
composition<00:07:11.730> and<00:07:12.330> hit<00:07:12.900> OK

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669 
composition and hit OK

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:19.250 
composition and hit OK
and<00:07:15.230> that<00:07:16.230> created<00:07:16.710> a<00:07:16.980> new<00:07:17.580> comp<00:07:18.270> in<00:07:18.780> here

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
and that created a new comp in here

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.990 
and that created a new comp in here
where<00:07:19.500> we<00:07:19.710> can<00:07:19.950> animate<00:07:20.400> the<00:07:20.520> properties<00:07:20.970> of

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 
where we can animate the properties of

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.780 
where we can animate the properties of
both<00:07:21.300> of<00:07:21.480> the<00:07:21.570> of<00:07:22.560> both<00:07:23.130> the<00:07:23.460> title<00:07:24.210> and<00:07:24.630> the

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:25.790 
both of the of both the title and the

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.500 
both of the of both the title and the
text<00:07:26.790> so<00:07:27.780> that<00:07:28.050> we<00:07:28.260> can<00:07:29.000> don't<00:07:30.000> have<00:07:30.150> to<00:07:30.330> keep

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:30.510 
text so that we can don't have to keep

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.240 
text so that we can don't have to keep
animating<00:07:31.110> both<00:07:31.410> of<00:07:31.590> them<00:07:31.740> and<00:07:31.919> everything

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.250 
animating both of them and everything

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.950 
animating both of them and everything
like<00:07:32.370> that<00:07:32.430> and<00:07:32.610> adding<00:07:33.150> effects<00:07:33.480> to<00:07:33.630> both<00:07:33.780> of

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 
like that and adding effects to both of

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.830 
like that and adding effects to both of
them<00:07:34.220> so<00:07:35.220> I'll<00:07:35.610> conclude<00:07:36.030> this<00:07:36.390> part<00:07:36.660> of<00:07:36.750> the

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 
them so I'll conclude this part of the

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.890 
them so I'll conclude this part of the
tutorial<00:07:37.230> we<00:07:37.770> learned<00:07:38.040> how<00:07:38.190> to<00:07:38.220> make<00:07:38.520> our

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:38.900 
tutorial we learned how to make our

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.620 
tutorial we learned how to make our
smoke<00:07:40.010> basically<00:07:41.010> in<00:07:41.190> this<00:07:41.400> part<00:07:41.700> so<00:07:42.150> in<00:07:42.450> the

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:42.630 
smoke basically in this part so in the

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.210 
smoke basically in this part so in the
next<00:07:42.900> part<00:07:43.110> we'll<00:07:43.290> be<00:07:43.470> putting<00:07:43.860> the<00:07:43.980> smoke

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 
next part we'll be putting the smoke

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.490 
next part we'll be putting the smoke
into<00:07:44.810> the<00:07:45.810> text<00:07:46.350> and<00:07:46.560> we'll<00:07:47.100> be<00:07:48.350> pretty<00:07:49.350> much

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 
into the text and we'll be pretty much

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.400 
into the text and we'll be pretty much
doing<00:07:49.740> that<00:07:49.950> we'll<00:07:50.100> see<00:07:50.250> how<00:07:50.400> far<00:07:50.640> we<00:07:50.700> get<00:07:51.060> and

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:51.410 
doing that we'll see how far we get and

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:56.540 
doing that we'll see how far we get and
about<00:07:53.240> 6<00:07:54.240> to<00:07:54.660> 10<00:07:55.050> minutes<00:07:55.440> in<00:07:55.680> I'll<00:07:56.010> I<00:07:56.130> want<00:07:56.460> to

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:56.550 
about 6 to 10 minutes in I'll I want to

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.540 
about 6 to 10 minutes in I'll I want to
switch<00:07:56.760> in<00:07:56.910> between<00:07:57.350> into<00:07:58.350> the<00:07:58.590> next<00:07:58.800> part<00:07:59.010> so

00:07:59.540 --> 00:07:59.550 
switch in between into the next part so

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.530 
switch in between into the next part so
I'll<00:07:59.910> see<00:08:00.150> you<00:08:00.180> guys<00:08:00.810> in<00:08:00.990> the<00:08:01.080> next<00:08:01.230> part
