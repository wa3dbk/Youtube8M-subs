 1 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.190
 welcome to this guitar class so 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:40.370
 there we will discover a rich rock'n'roll 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:42.239
 really basic so this rich and 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.510
 to interpret on an agreement the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.510
 most 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.770
 you have 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:56.870
 3rd and 22nd must therefore 3rd must in 4th box 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.219
 strings of re and second must in 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.219
 third box strings of 6 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.070
 then shifted a third must in 5th 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.690
 box rebel camp or postures and 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.870
 your 4 in this fifth box strings of 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.870
 6 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.970
 it gives us 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.920
 and you come back so 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.480
 you sandwiched between the two a rope 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.480
 from there and everything done 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.190
 on the last two 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.620
 so that gives us 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.380
 but 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.380
 White 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.520
 okay 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.340
 end on the 3rd kastler half gram 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.340
 half a tone 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.890
 we have you position your second 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.890
 turn a third case that gives back the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.030
 but our third gastronomy 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.659
 it gives us the full 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.680
 Oh 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.660
 and now it's up to you to play 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.540
