00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.270 
extraction or the draining of the water
they<00:01:36.780> come<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.140> much<00:01:37.439> much<00:01:37.680> drier<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.040> these

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
they come out much much drier and these

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.550 
they come out much much drier and these
higher<00:01:38.549> spin<00:01:38.909> speeds<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.750> advantage<00:01:40.470> of

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
higher spin speeds have an advantage of

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.219 
higher spin speeds have an advantage of
that<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> go<00:01:41.909> into<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.240> dryer<00:01:42.689> itself

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that is when I go into my dryer itself

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.719 
that is when I go into my dryer itself
it's<00:01:43.409> gonna<00:01:43.560> spend<00:01:43.770> half<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.189> time<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.520> dry

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it's gonna spend half the time to dry

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.060 
it's gonna spend half the time to dry
those<00:01:44.970> less<00:01:45.240> water<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.689> less<00:01:45.869> energy<00:01:46.530> higher

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
those less water and less energy higher

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.639 
those less water and less energy higher
spin<00:01:47.430> speeds<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.090> shorter<00:01:48.540> drying<00:01:48.869> times<00:01:49.229> they

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
spin speeds so shorter drying times they

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.560 
spin speeds so shorter drying times they
really<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.310> efficient<00:01:51.090> most<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.450> these

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
really are efficient most of these

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.270 
really are efficient most of these
machines<00:01:52.020> are<00:01:52.200> front-load<00:01:52.649> machines<00:01:53.070> which

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
machines are front-load machines which

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.830 
machines are front-load machines which
is<00:01:53.399> very<00:01:53.640> convenient<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.210> loading<00:01:54.570> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
is very convenient for loading and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.139 
is very convenient for loading and
unloading<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.710> they're<00:01:56.250> beautiful<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:56.969> if

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
unloading and they're beautiful so if

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.490 
unloading and they're beautiful so if
you're<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.450> market<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> new<00:01:58.140> washing

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you're in a market for a new washing

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.990 
you're in a market for a new washing
machine<00:01:58.530> you'll<00:01:59.070> want<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.280> check<00:01:59.579> these<00:01:59.759> out
