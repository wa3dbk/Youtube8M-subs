need<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> make<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.190> two-liter<00:00:38.190> bottle

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.819 
need to make it is a two-liter bottle
and<00:00:39.149> some<00:00:39.840> water<00:00:40.050> balloons<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.530> got<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
and some water balloons so I got the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.819 
and some water balloons so I got the
nine<00:00:41.070> inch<00:00:41.660> water<00:00:42.660> balloons<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.590> they

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
nine inch water balloons because they

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.290 
nine inch water balloons because they
seemed<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.340> thicker<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.940> little

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
seemed to be a little thicker a little

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.880 
seemed to be a little thicker a little
more<00:00:45.600> durable<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:46.440> want<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.680> break

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
more durable you don't want it to break

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.920 
more durable you don't want it to break
too<00:00:47.219> easy<00:00:47.399> because<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> move

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
too easy because it is going to move

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.920 
too easy because it is going to move
around<00:00:48.989> oh<00:00:49.910> yeah<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.149> some<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.719> actually

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
around oh yeah and then some I actually

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.590 
around oh yeah and then some I actually
put<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.320> some<00:00:52.440> table<00:00:52.739> salt<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.070> there<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
put like some table salt in there and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.240 
put like some table salt in there and
all<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.840> does<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.379> lower<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.980> freezing

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
all that does is just lower the freezing

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.490 
all that does is just lower the freezing
point<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> water<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> make<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
point in the water and just to make it a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.729 
point in the water and just to make it a
little<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.829> little<00:00:59.370> colder<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.590> keep<00:01:01.590> your

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
little a little colder and keep your

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.130 
little a little colder and keep your
keep<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:02.129> food<00:01:02.399> cold<00:01:02.430> longer<00:01:03.180> all<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.049> is

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
keep your food cold longer all you do is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.600 
keep your food cold longer all you do is
just<00:01:04.260> put<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.500> water<00:01:04.890> blending<00:01:05.250> over<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
just put the water blending over the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.399 
just put the water blending over the
two-liter<00:01:06.240> bottle<00:01:06.600> turning<00:01:07.470> upside<00:01:07.860> down

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
two-liter bottle turning upside down

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.820 
two-liter bottle turning upside down
pop<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.590> off<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.200> tie<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.619> like

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
pop it off and then just tie it up like

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.560 
pop it off and then just tie it up like
a<00:01:13.860> normal<00:01:14.310> water<00:01:14.640> balloon<00:01:16.520> there<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.610> go<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
a normal water balloon there we go and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.990 
a normal water balloon there we go and
cool<00:01:18.930> thing<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:20.189> make<00:01:20.460> them<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.970> big

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
cool thing is you can make them as big

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.820 
cool thing is you can make them as big
as<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.299> want<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.110> small<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.680> bigger

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
as you want you know small and bigger

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.190 
as you want you know small and bigger
for<00:01:23.820> whatever<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.240> need<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.780> wanted<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
for whatever your need is I wanted it a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.870 
for whatever your need is I wanted it a
little<00:01:25.229> bit<00:01:25.530> smaller<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
little bit smaller so that you know the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.690 
little bit smaller so that you know the
drinks<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.299> kind<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.570> shove<00:01:27.990> around<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.700> it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
drinks can kind of shove around and it

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
drinks can kind of shove around and it
doesn't<00:01:30.030> take<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.450> too<00:01:30.479> much<00:01:30.600> space<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.200> more

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
doesn't take up too much space it's more

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.340 
doesn't take up too much space it's more
like<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> real<00:01:31.770> ice<00:01:31.890> cube<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.540> I<00:01:33.540> actually<00:01:34.020> have

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
like a real ice cube and I actually have

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.749 
like a real ice cube and I actually have
some<00:01:34.619> frozen<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.400> here<00:01:37.130> see<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.490> good

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
some frozen right here see that's good

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.819 
some frozen right here see that's good
and<00:01:38.909> solid<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:40.200> takes<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> little<00:01:40.530> longer<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
and solid it takes a little longer to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.870 
and solid it takes a little longer to
freeze<00:01:41.070> because<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.549> salt<00:01:41.820> in

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
freeze because it's got the salt in

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.310 
freeze because it's got the salt in
there<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.329> take<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.020> or<00:01:43.170> leave<00:01:43.200> it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
there but you can take that or leave it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.480 
there but you can take that or leave it
