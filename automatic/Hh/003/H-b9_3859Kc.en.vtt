okay<00:00:01.370> now<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:03.210> in<00:00:03.510> order<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.959> see<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.380> trachea

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
okay now the in order to see the trachea

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.430 
okay now the in order to see the trachea
all<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.339> way<00:00:05.460> down<00:00:05.730> we<00:00:06.720> would<00:00:06.870> have<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.259> cut

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
all the way down we would have to cut

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.839 
all the way down we would have to cut
away<00:00:07.560> some<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.980> these<00:00:08.099> vessels<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.760> I'd

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
away some of these vessels and I'd

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:09.799 
away some of these vessels and I'd
rather<00:00:09.000> not<00:00:09.300> do<00:00:09.510> it

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
rather not do it

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.709 
rather not do it
the<00:00:10.559> primary<00:00:11.160> bronchus<00:00:11.759> would<00:00:12.030> be<00:00:12.179> way<00:00:12.450> back

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
the primary bronchus would be way back

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.289 
the primary bronchus would be way back
here<00:00:13.049> under<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> heart<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.400> only<00:00:14.610> way<00:00:15.059> I'm

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
here under the heart so the only way I'm

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.150 
here under the heart so the only way I'm
going<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.599> show<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.260> primary<00:00:16.710> bronchus

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
going to show you the primary bronchus

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.130 
going to show you the primary bronchus
on<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.430> test<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.119> remove<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.690> heart<00:00:18.900> and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
on the test is if I remove the heart and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.080 
on the test is if I remove the heart and
then<00:00:19.680> you'll<00:00:19.800> see<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> trachea<00:00:20.609> coming<00:00:20.939> down

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
then you'll see the trachea coming down

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.929 
then you'll see the trachea coming down
and<00:00:21.330> you'll<00:00:21.420> see<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.689> branch<00:00:22.430> it<00:00:23.430> would<00:00:23.550> be<00:00:23.670> if

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and you'll see it branch it would be if

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.450 
and you'll see it branch it would be if
I<00:00:24.359> decide<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.960> do<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.529> could<00:00:25.710> pin<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:26.340> you

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
I decide to do it I could pin it but you

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.099 
I decide to do it I could pin it but you
should<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.820> able<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> recognize<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.869> because

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
should be able to recognize it because

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.109 
should be able to recognize it because
you'll<00:00:28.320> see<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> single<00:00:28.980> tube<00:00:29.400> coming<00:00:29.789> down<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
you'll see a single tube coming down and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.460 
you'll see a single tube coming down and
then<00:00:30.240> you'll<00:00:30.359> see<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.599> branch<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.140> right

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
then you'll see it branch to the right

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.930 
then you'll see it branch to the right
and<00:00:31.710> branch<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.279> left<00:00:32.899> okay<00:00:34.820> are<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and branch to the left okay are you

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.540 
and branch to the left okay are you
ready<00:00:35.969> yeah

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
ready yeah

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.220 
ready yeah
okay<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:38.730> let's<00:00:39.000> concentrate<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.930> on

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
okay now let's concentrate on this on

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.080 
okay now let's concentrate on this on
the<00:00:40.350> tongue<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.829> let's<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.489> lungs<00:00:41.790> too

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the tongue do let's do the lungs too

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.799 
the tongue do let's do the lungs too
while<00:00:42.300> we're<00:00:42.480> at<00:00:42.629> it

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
while we're at it

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.020 
while we're at it
so<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:44.340> notice<00:00:44.640> three<00:00:45.210> lobes<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.410> right

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
so you notice three lobes on the right

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.690 
so you notice three lobes on the right
three<00:00:48.030> lobes<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> left<00:00:49.430> let's<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
three lobes on the left let's do the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.850 
three lobes on the left let's do the
right<00:00:50.820> side<00:00:51.559> do<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> know<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> name<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.039> this

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
right side do you know the name of this

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.660 
right side do you know the name of this
crane<00:00:55.879> crane<00:00:56.879> cranial<00:00:57.949> that's<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.070> crane<00:00:59.340> right

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
crane crane cranial that's a crane right

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.450 
crane crane cranial that's a crane right
cranial<00:01:00.329> lobe<00:01:00.620> because<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.770> close<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
cranial lobe because it's close to the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.210 
cranial lobe because it's close to the
head<00:01:02.640> cranium<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.960> case<00:01:04.530> that's<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
head cranium is the case that's that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:15.020 
head cranium is the case that's that
folds<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> brain<00:01:12.439> this<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> caudal<00:01:14.159> lobe

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
folds the brain this is the caudal lobe

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.890 
folds the brain this is the caudal lobe
the<00:01:15.780> right<00:01:16.020> coddle<00:01:16.790> coddle<00:01:17.790> means<00:01:18.210> tail<00:01:18.540> so

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the right coddle coddle means tail so

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.999 
the right coddle coddle means tail so
this<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> lobe<00:01:19.590> closest<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> tail

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
this is the lobe closest to the tail

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.910 
this is the lobe closest to the tail
caudate<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> liver<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> you've<00:01:25.890> got

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
caudate on the liver right so you've got

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.160 
caudate on the liver right so you've got
three<00:01:26.340> lobes<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:27.000> three<00:01:27.390> lobes<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
three lobes here three lobes here and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.310 
three lobes here three lobes here and
then<00:01:28.320> there's<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.799> lobe<00:01:30.079> posterior<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
then there's one lobe posterior to the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620 
then there's one lobe posterior to the
heart<00:01:32.060> right<00:01:33.060> here

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
heart right here

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.560 
heart right here
that's<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.680> accessory<00:01:35.369> lobe<00:01:38.119> now<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.270> can't

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that's the accessory lobe now you can't

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.660 
that's the accessory lobe now you can't
say<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.990> any<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:41.299> good<00:01:42.299> there<00:01:42.710> okay<00:01:43.740> Claude

okay so veins you're gonna recognize

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.470 
okay so veins you're gonna recognize

we've<00:03:47.940> already<00:03:48.180> have<00:03:48.600> we<00:03:48.720> looked<00:03:48.900> at<00:03:49.019> this

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
we've already have we looked at this

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.240 
we've already have we looked at this
already<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.560> maybe<00:03:49.680> not<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:51.000> here<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:52.250> the

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
already and maybe not so here is the

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.440 
already and maybe not so here is the
pulmonary<00:03:53.550> trunk<00:03:54.000> or<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.600> pulmonary<00:03:55.140> artery

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
pulmonary trunk or the pulmonary artery

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.870 
pulmonary trunk or the pulmonary artery
it's<00:03:57.450> coming<00:03:57.870> from<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.380> right<00:03:58.590> ventricle<00:03:58.880> it

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
it's coming from the right ventricle it

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.930 
it's coming from the right ventricle it
crosses<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:00.870> front<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.380> aorta<00:04:01.920> it's<00:04:02.610> in

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
crosses in front of the aorta it's in

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.570 
crosses in front of the aorta it's in
between<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.569> atria<00:04:04.080> right<00:04:04.470> in<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.620> front<00:04:04.830> so

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
between the atria right in the front so

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.250 
between the atria right in the front so
if<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.730> put<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:05.940> pin<00:04:06.150> right<00:04:06.180> there<00:04:06.390> I'm<00:04:06.930> looking

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
if I put a pin right there I'm looking

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.990 
if I put a pin right there I'm looking
for<00:04:07.440> pulmonary<00:04:07.670> trunk<00:04:08.670> or<00:04:09.060> pulmonary<00:04:09.269> artery

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
for pulmonary trunk or pulmonary artery

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.240 
for pulmonary trunk or pulmonary artery
behind<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:12.720> can<00:04:12.750> see<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.290> aorta<00:04:13.890> coming

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
behind it you can see the aorta coming

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.129 
behind it you can see the aorta coming
from<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.700> opposite<00:04:15.150> side<00:04:15.390> so<00:04:15.780> they<00:04:15.930> actually

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
from the opposite side so they actually

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:23.570 
from the opposite side so they actually
cross<00:04:16.680> like<00:04:17.100> this<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:22.530> piece<00:04:22.770> behind

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
cross like this and the piece behind

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.350 
cross like this and the piece behind
that's<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.389> ascending<00:04:25.050> aorta<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:26.210> then<00:04:27.210> you

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
that's the ascending aorta and then you

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.360 
that's the ascending aorta and then you
can't<00:04:27.600> really<00:04:27.810> see<00:04:28.140> it<00:04:28.260> but<00:04:28.440> it<00:04:28.590> curves<00:04:28.979> right

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
can't really see it but it curves right

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.090 
can't really see it but it curves right
here<00:04:29.640> there's<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.150> trunk<00:04:30.479> or<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.900> arch<00:04:31.770> a

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
here there's the trunk or the arch a

artery<00:04:45.530> from<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.710> arch<00:04:46.950> all<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.610> way<00:04:47.729> up<00:04:47.850> to

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
artery from the arch all the way up to

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.450 
artery from the arch all the way up to
these<00:04:48.270> branches<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.890> got<00:04:50.039> beautiful

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
these branches and you got beautiful

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.840 
these branches and you got beautiful
branches<00:04:50.880> on<00:04:51.240> your<00:04:51.419> cat<00:04:52.310> you<00:04:53.310> can<00:04:53.460> see<00:04:53.669> all

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
branches on your cat you can see all

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.230 
branches on your cat you can see all
three<00:04:54.180> of<00:04:54.210> them

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.980 

this<00:04:58.840> branch<00:04:59.199> is<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.889> right<00:05:00.819> I'm<00:05:01.300> sorry<00:05:01.569> the

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
this branch is the right I'm sorry the

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.189 
this branch is the right I'm sorry the
left<00:05:02.349> carotid<00:05:02.860> artery<00:05:03.849> it<00:05:04.270> runs<00:05:04.509> all<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.110> way

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
left carotid artery it runs all the way

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.909 
left carotid artery it runs all the way
up<00:05:05.319> into<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.740> neck<00:05:05.949> I<00:05:08.430> can<00:05:09.430> see<00:05:09.639> it<00:05:09.729> right<00:05:09.759> here

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
up into the neck I can see it right here

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.719 
up into the neck I can see it right here
so<00:05:11.919> this<00:05:12.580> should<00:05:12.729> pull<00:05:14.280> should<00:05:15.280> pull<00:05:15.490> on<00:05:15.610> this

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
so this should pull should pull on this

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.309 
so this should pull should pull on this
carotid<00:05:16.180> artery<00:05:16.509> when<00:05:16.630> I<00:05:16.660> pull<00:05:16.900> on<00:05:16.930> it<00:05:17.139> seeing

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
carotid artery when I pull on it seeing

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.159 
carotid artery when I pull on it seeing
that<00:05:17.610> that's<00:05:18.610> the<00:05:18.789> left<00:05:19.000> carotid<00:05:19.240> artery<00:05:19.780> the

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
that that's the left carotid artery the

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.540 
that that's the left carotid artery the
middle<00:05:20.530> branch<00:05:22.620> is<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.680> right<00:05:24.069> carotid

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
middle branch is the right carotid

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.760 
middle branch is the right carotid
artery<00:05:25.240> it<00:05:25.569> should<00:05:25.780> also<00:05:25.930> go<00:05:26.259> up<00:05:26.410> into<00:05:26.590> the

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
artery it should also go up into the

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.480 
artery it should also go up into the
neck<00:05:26.949> to<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.639> cat's<00:05:27.880> right<00:05:28.180> side<00:05:28.479> and<00:05:29.490> the

neck to the cat's right side and the

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.490 
neck to the cat's right side and the
third<00:05:30.729> branch<00:05:31.090> is<00:05:31.479> the<00:05:32.169> right<00:05:32.500> subclavian

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
third branch is the right subclavian

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.360 
third branch is the right subclavian
that<00:05:35.500> supplies<00:05:36.009> the<00:05:36.039> right<00:05:36.430> leg<00:05:37.919> all<00:05:38.919> three<00:05:39.250> of

that supplies the right leg all three of

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.680 
that supplies the right leg all three of
those<00:05:39.550> come<00:05:39.789> off<00:05:39.819> of<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.210> brachiocephalic

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
those come off of the brachiocephalic

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.990 
those come off of the brachiocephalic
which<00:05:41.440> is<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.710> first<00:05:41.979> branch<00:05:42.400> off<00:05:42.669> of<00:05:42.849> the

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
is the left subclavian artery and it

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:57.719 
is the left subclavian artery and it
supplies<00:05:50.770> the<00:05:50.800> left<00:05:51.250> leg<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:56.310> jugular<00:05:57.310> vein

might actually be linked with the

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.390 
might actually be linked with the
carotid<00:06:09.759> artery<00:06:10.090> up<00:06:10.300> here<00:06:10.570> I<00:06:10.919> can't<00:06:11.919> even<00:06:12.070> tell

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
carotid artery up here I can't even tell

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.170 
carotid artery up here I can't even tell
for<00:06:12.669> sure<00:06:12.699> there<00:06:13.389> see<00:06:14.110> that<00:06:14.289> dark<00:06:14.500> vessel

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
for sure there see that dark vessel

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.600 
for sure there see that dark vessel
that's<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.449> jugular<00:06:16.780> vein<00:06:17.340> right<00:06:18.340> on<00:06:18.490> the

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
that's the jugular vein right on the

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.810 
that's the jugular vein right on the
backside<00:06:19.060> of<00:06:19.090> the<00:06:19.300> carotid<00:06:19.570> artery<00:06:20.340> yeah<00:06:21.400> they

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
backside of the carotid artery yeah they

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.920 
backside of the carotid artery yeah they
are<00:06:22.000> here<00:06:22.500> if<00:06:23.500> I<00:06:23.740> if<00:06:24.550> I<00:06:24.789> want<00:06:25.090> to<00:06:25.180> pin<00:06:25.389> that<00:06:25.599> it's

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
are here if I if I want to pin that it's

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.939 
are here if I if I want to pin that it's
got<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.259> be<00:06:26.380> a<00:06:26.560> much<00:06:26.919> better<00:06:28.229> vein<00:06:29.229> than<00:06:29.500> this

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
got to be a much better vein than this

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.879 
got to be a much better vein than this
that's<00:06:30.280> pretty<00:06:31.240> wimpy<00:06:31.509> I<00:06:31.840> want<00:06:32.500> to<00:06:32.560> be<00:06:32.650> able<00:06:32.830> to

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
that's pretty wimpy I want to be able to

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.129 
that's pretty wimpy I want to be able to
see<00:06:33.039> the<00:06:33.190> difference<00:06:33.520> between<00:06:33.699> them<00:06:34.060> but<00:06:34.990> they

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
see the difference between them but they

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.899 
see the difference between them but they
were<00:06:35.199> attached<00:06:35.650> to<00:06:35.830> each<00:06:35.919> other<00:06:38.610> behind<00:06:39.610> the

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:39.909 
were attached to each other behind the

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:42.290 
were attached to each other behind the
trachea

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
trachea

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.940 
trachea
the<00:06:42.870> esophagus<00:06:43.500> and<00:06:45.230> if<00:06:46.230> I<00:06:46.320> want<00:06:46.530> to<00:06:46.620> pin<00:06:46.800> the

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
the esophagus and if I want to pin the

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.010 
the esophagus and if I want to pin the
esophagus<00:06:47.580> I'll<00:06:47.700> do<00:06:47.850> it<00:06:47.970> up<00:06:48.120> here<00:06:48.360> not<00:06:48.990> down

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
esophagus I'll do it up here not down

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.700 
esophagus I'll do it up here not down
lower<00:06:49.470> because<00:06:49.890> it's<00:06:50.040> easiest<00:06:50.340> to<00:06:50.520> see<00:06:50.760> here

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
lower because it's easiest to see here

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.040 
lower because it's easiest to see here
normally<00:06:52.710> it's<00:06:52.860> it's<00:06:53.300> either<00:06:54.300> behind<00:06:54.660> the

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
normally it's it's either behind the

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.230 
normally it's it's either behind the
trachea<00:06:55.530> or<00:06:55.740> slightly<00:06:56.400> to<00:06:56.580> the<00:06:56.610> left<00:06:56.880> of<00:06:57.150> the

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
trachea or slightly to the left of the

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.750 
trachea or slightly to the left of the
trachea<00:06:57.690> I<00:07:00.470> think<00:07:01.470> that's<00:07:01.680> everything<00:07:02.190> the

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
trachea I think that's everything the

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.510 
trachea I think that's everything the
only<00:07:03.060> thing<00:07:03.300> that<00:07:03.480> we<00:07:03.600> don't<00:07:03.780> see<00:07:04.020> here<00:07:04.320> is<00:07:04.520> the

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
only thing that we don't see here is the

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.040 
only thing that we don't see here is the
the<00:07:06.120> thymus<00:07:06.570> gland<00:07:06.930> which<00:07:07.290> I<00:07:07.620> already<00:07:08.010> filmed

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
the thymus gland which I already filmed

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.600 
the thymus gland which I already filmed
and<00:07:10.460> you<00:07:11.460> see<00:07:11.640> the<00:07:11.730> pericardium<00:07:12.390> here
