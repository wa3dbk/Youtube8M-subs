 h-60 in this new version there the version 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.429
 Previous or if the base here in it a 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.470
 little more square and 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.290
 apparently plastic is plastic 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.940
 well neither sensitive this one is fine 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.040
 Otherwise we'll be opening there. 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.519
 to show you touch the flash 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.440
 player 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.180
 taking advantage of h-60 here some had 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.190
 prevented to make a boxing a video 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.570
 tutorial also teaching how to install 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.070
 So this is going to be a boxing video. 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.260
 in the next video I'll make a video 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.609
 how to install it 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.960
 image only one that socrates snow on m3 in 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:01.000
 socket 2011 not only had a 50 11 556 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.460
 which is the same size and beauty 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.990
 good here in the back is we got there 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:12.520
 right comparison showing the club 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.399
 stock and showing there the hc 64.6 or 3770 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.490
 kaká had a temperature of 62 degrees né 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:21.670
 and to compete standard he did not even 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.560
 test that was performed and the noise 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.800
 also is rich have a time to see the snow 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.130
 are the 30.85 decibels of the goalkeeper 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.869
 boxing 35 or 5 of biya minus the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.429
 boxing team or doing less 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:44.530
 noise is compatible with the socket 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:50.739
 Inco 6 LGA1366 LGA2011 66 and 13 in the MD 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:53.860
 amd am2 plus the m3 fm and fm 2 and the rm 3 more 

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:55.060
 it is also that the same size and also 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.020
 with intel celeron processors 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.080
 pentium and core i3 core i5 and core i7 and 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.830
 family and gave me up to 64 opteron without the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.649
 prof did not do 12 act two get a 13th 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.580
 and there are serious appeals to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.510
 beauty here in the back without some 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.520
 information of dimensions there dodô cooler 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.010
 and the radiator such a club has a 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.959
 size of 120 mm and 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.090
 20 by 25 millimeters 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.980
 is with the speed of 2,000 rpm 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.790
 with a 54 cfm air flow which is the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.220
 water flow and air pressure in the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.760
 fan pressure actually from 2036 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.700
 mm certain noise is the dna no 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.879
 30,85 was missing as he had already said that 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.180
 radiator that the dimension of 120% and 52 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:54.980
 millimeters for 27 minutes 71 comes from 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.720
 talk let's show her here she's there 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.120
 had and has this transparent plastic 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.959
 on the outside of the box is a 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.959
 box 6 that of grayish color metallica 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:15.980
 ac it opens here right ahead 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:20.239
 right here some information some 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.489
 about your manual c is the manual then here 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.530
 is explaining why what the 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.530
 type screw where you will use 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.010
 chambi schrils that kind of screw 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.500
 here o 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.870
 This is what's on top and to the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.430
 that you have an example of how 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:48.639
 stay in the right office has a kind 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.639
 of a styrofoam from within the bases 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:58.609
 who has this part here she goes in the 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.799
 from the top of the h 60 is for amd socket give me 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:05.510
 this part that goes at the top 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:07.489
 It is also for the Sinttel he has 11,555,000 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.669
 50 and etc. 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.709
 and that base is what goes under the plate 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:16.310
 Right mother in the tutorial I'll show you 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.359
 how do you install it there? 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.359
 base here beauty 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.330
 jakson all the screws there that will be 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.700
 required to do the installation 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.200
 Of course you will not all use it there. 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:36.800
 have to mt also and to the intel 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.750
 Good, this is a fan who comes there a lot. 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:47.180
 similar to the wave of hc and also certain 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:55.070
 and now here the hcc you see here as 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:58.520
 He comes with plastic, he does not have anything else. 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:05.000
 on the inside leave box here in the 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:07.040
 I seat here oh 60 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.650
 this is the bottom part of it already comes with 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.169
 pre-applied earth peace 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.520
 this folder is not of such quality 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.830
 so you may be exchanging have to 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.350
 clean the excess and put the paste 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.180
 in the past to be able to hit 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.990
 the pipe then you use that same one that does not 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.700
 have a problem 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:29.870
 Right, and this is the radiator, it's very thin. 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:32.810
 Only 27 mm in that thickness and 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.669
 fell two fans of 120 so you can he 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.660
 Come with you can buy another is 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.760
 using ne 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.229
 usually if you are going to use a fan 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.630
 have to get the athletic called 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.850
 tooth to play out and another to stay 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.130
 here you 'll catch the air inside and play 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.320
 it out also will not be the push point 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.870
 which in case he will pick up and play for 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.970
 outside the two pulling air in one direction 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.190
 and playing in the same direction so he 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.270
 can remove the heat more 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.940
 quickly good beauty to connect to 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.880
 pump you can connect directly to the 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.490
 motherboard in cp1 underline fan sound is the 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.380
 three-prong connector only and one 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.510
 Buccaneer connector 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.240
 the course was an excuse for the fan of the right color 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.950
 it is four pin this one if you 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.510
 do not have an adapter that does not 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.510
 give you will have committed on the plate 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:23.630
 also because it uses four pins 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.910
 here is the pwn he gets 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.320
 control the speed too 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.910
 good guys then that's it hope 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.320
