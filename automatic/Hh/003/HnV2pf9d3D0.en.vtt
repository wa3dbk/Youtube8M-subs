00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.629
 Hello friends, I really have not 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.230
 filmed the video but finally decided with 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.750
 thoughts decided to finish writing this 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.809
 video would like to tell as much as possible 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.330
 do without special programs 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:22.039
 to set the sleep timer 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.560
 we only need a computer 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.510
 Here is such a notepad text document 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.079
 and the console itself 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.780
 that's how you see here I painted here 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.980
 by the minute 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.710
 this is all listed commands here 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:49.020
 in a team in a team for the most 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.239
 computer time is indicated in seconds for 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.160
 minutes I just pointed for convenience here 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.340
 I will copy this document below the video 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.680
 so that you all have access to it and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.170
 everyone can afford on your composition 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.170
 steel save and just elementary 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.299
 use such simple documents 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.970
 there were such simple commands to 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.909
 turn off computers without downloading 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.799
 additional programs any well 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:21.810
 shorter guys you don't need them 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:23.790
 here look we take just well for 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.500
 start i'll take for example the first number 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.799
 that's 45 minutes set the timer for 45 minutes 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.360
 I just copy the selection highlighting copy 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.729
 Here is the text 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.189
 I press the end, do it ok and that's how 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.130
 see a window pops up that computer 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.420
 turns off after so much 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.939
 also if you change your mind 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.680
 turn off turn off 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.370
 also if of course you change your mind 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.620
 turn off i did 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.370
 you are not for for on a special team too 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.370
 this mini on completion of work in any 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.750
 moment you can cancel the same shutdown 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.200
 enable timer 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.979
 here would also like to clarify that such 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.140
 if you have already set 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.080
 some time off then swap 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.590
 it will be possible only if than through 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.350
 cancel if you give another command 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.060
 with other time currents strap nothing 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.910
 not accept the system will not accept anything 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.910
 and just nothing will happen therefore 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.900
 change time only through 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.560
 cancel completion and set the same 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.760
 new time here so here is a video 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.350
 guys i think it was helpful to everyone 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.350
 thank you all bye bye
