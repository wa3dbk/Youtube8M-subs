on<00:00:17.520> silverfish<00:00:18.270> longboarding<00:00:19.020> calm<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:20.250> just

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
on silverfish longboarding calm but just

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.400 
on silverfish longboarding calm but just
like<00:00:20.850> what<00:00:21.300> people<00:00:21.570> were<00:00:21.630> doing<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.199> stuff

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
like what people were doing and stuff

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.590 
like what people were doing and stuff
they're<00:00:23.160> using<00:00:23.460> broomsticks<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.180> everything

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
they're using broomsticks and everything

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.290 
they're using broomsticks and everything
so<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.170> decided<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.130> make<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.279> out<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.609> PVC<00:00:26.820> pipe

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
so I decided to make one out of PVC pipe

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.620 
so I decided to make one out of PVC pipe
and<00:00:28.670> make<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> video<00:00:29.939> about<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.480> so

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and make a video about it just so

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.319 
and make a video about it just so
everybody<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:31.199> make<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.949> lot<00:00:32.189> easier

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
everybody can make it a lot easier

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.459 
everybody can make it a lot easier
you'll<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.750> searching<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.200> inner

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
you'll have to be searching on inner

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.939 
you'll have to be searching on inner
forever<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.340> yeah<00:00:35.820> there<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.510> go

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.990 

okay<00:00:40.949> so<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.280> didn't<00:00:41.489> really<00:00:41.520> want<00:00:41.789> to<00:00:41.850> take<00:00:41.969> a

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
okay so I didn't really want to take a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.240 
okay so I didn't really want to take a
bunch<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.360> pictures<00:00:42.539> but<00:00:42.930> pretty<00:00:43.800> much<00:00:43.860> i<00:00:44.070> took

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
bunch of pictures but pretty much i took

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.590 
bunch of pictures but pretty much i took
this<00:00:44.430> drill<00:00:44.760> 36<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.440> 3<00:00:46.649> 16<00:00:47.160> inch

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
this drill 36 I think it's a 3 16 inch

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.250 
this drill 36 I think it's a 3 16 inch
bolt<00:00:48.949> drilled<00:00:49.949> it<00:00:50.100> through<00:00:51.199> right<00:00:52.199> through

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
bolt drilled it through right through

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.200 
bolt drilled it through right through
there<00:00:53.510> after<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.829> measured<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.640> hole<00:00:57.030> in

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
there after I measured it with a hole in

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.780 
there after I measured it with a hole in
the<00:00:57.269> bottom<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.629> camera<00:00:58.309> we<00:00:59.309> matched<00:00:59.519> up

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
the bottom of the camera we matched up

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.249 
the bottom of the camera we matched up
right<00:00:59.969> there<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:01.879> then<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.940> took<00:01:03.589> this<00:01:04.589> thing

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
right there and then I took this thing

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.630 
right there and then I took this thing
which<00:01:07.259> is<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.619> screw<00:01:07.979> that's<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> go

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
which is the screw that's going to go

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.520 
which is the screw that's going to go
through<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.940> mount<00:01:09.149> and<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.869> had<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> sand<00:01:10.409> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
through the mount and I had to sand it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.419 
through the mount and I had to sand it
down<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:11.119> lot<00:01:12.119> because<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.869> didn't<00:01:13.110> think<00:01:13.229> ahead

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
down a lot because I didn't think ahead

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:21.649 
down a lot because I didn't think ahead
and<00:01:16.550> when<00:01:17.550> it<00:01:17.640> would<00:01:17.729> go<00:01:17.850> down<00:01:19.280> hold<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.659> when

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and when it would go down hold on when

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.330 
and when it would go down hold on when
we<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.960> down<00:01:22.250> it<00:01:23.250> doesn't<00:01:23.429> fit<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.179> the<00:01:24.899> way<00:01:25.020> in

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
we go down it doesn't fit all the way in

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
we go down it doesn't fit all the way in
so<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.550> sand<00:01:26.819> it<00:01:26.909> down<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.119> little<00:01:27.420> bit

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
so I have to sand it down a little bit

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.559 
so I have to sand it down a little bit
more<00:01:28.069> so<00:01:29.069> I<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.340> slide<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:29.819> to<00:01:30.060> pull<00:01:30.270> into

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
more so I can slide it down to pull into

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:36.469 
more so I can slide it down to pull into
that<00:01:31.080> hole<00:01:31.640> um<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.220> piece<00:01:35.759> down

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
that hole um so I got the piece down

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.040 
that hole um so I got the piece down
there<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.560> screw<00:01:38.039> part<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.750> it's<00:01:39.750> really

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
there the screw part and it's really

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.020 
there the screw part and it's really
tricky<00:01:40.350> i<00:01:40.500> had<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.979> end<00:01:41.399> up<00:01:42.360> sanding<00:01:43.110> down<00:01:44.030> this

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
tricky i had to end up sanding down this

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.100 
tricky i had to end up sanding down this
part<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:45.600> here<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:46.079> screws<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.680> apt<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
part right here with screws in apt and

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.810 
part right here with screws in apt and
just<00:01:49.110> shave<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.439> down<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.770> lot<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.250> PVC<00:01:50.640> pipe

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
just shave it down a lot the PVC pipe

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.510 
just shave it down a lot the PVC pipe
not<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.390> screw<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.649> shave<00:01:52.860> down<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> pipe<00:01:53.399> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
not the screw but shave down the pipe a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.980 
not the screw but shave down the pipe a
lot<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.969> the<00:01:54.090> screw<00:01:54.329> would<00:01:54.479> fit<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.810> more

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
lot so the screw would fit in more

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.749 
lot so the screw would fit in more
because<00:01:55.320> only<00:01:55.469> one<00:01:55.770> thread<00:01:56.159> was<00:01:56.369> hanging<00:01:56.670> out

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
because only one thread was hanging out

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.789 
because only one thread was hanging out
of<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> pipe<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.570> my<00:01:57.990> camera<00:01:58.170> wants<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.649> end

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
of the pipe and my camera wants to end

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.160 
of the pipe and my camera wants to end
with<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.130> thread<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.450> i<00:02:00.509> had<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.780> sand<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
with one thread in so i had to sand that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.819 
with one thread in so i had to sand that
down<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.409> lot<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.270> pretty<00:02:03.270> much<00:02:03.329> jam<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.110> screw

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
down a lot and pretty much jam the screw

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.210 
down a lot and pretty much jam the screw
part<00:02:05.100> down<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.899> using<00:02:06.899> well<00:02:08.060> screw<00:02:10.220> shoving

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
part down there using well screw shoving

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.949
