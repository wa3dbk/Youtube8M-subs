basic<00:00:20.060> Imperial<00:00:21.060> pilots<00:00:21.860> now<00:00:22.860> they're<00:00:23.099> using

basic Imperial pilots now they're using

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.790 
basic Imperial pilots now they're using
plaque<00:00:24.029> heads<00:00:25.250> so<00:00:26.250> there's<00:00:26.610> no<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.410> here<00:00:28.410> so

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
plaque heads so there's no one here so

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.269 
plaque heads so there's no one here so
therefore<00:00:29.309> you<00:00:30.180> have<00:00:30.300> two<00:00:31.230> stormtroopers<00:00:31.680> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
can look into where's the little system

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.730 
can look into where's the little system
you<00:01:05.189> press<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.990> attached<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.560> this

add a little lever thing and just press
it<00:01:24.390> down<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:27.690> work<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.200> well

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
it down it just really work that well

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.130 
it down it just really work that well
these<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.890> there<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.549> pulse<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.909> up

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
these are there we go you pulse it up

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.149 
these are there we go you pulse it up
and<00:01:34.140> two<00:01:34.710> bombs<00:01:35.070> come<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:36.920> there's<00:01:37.920> two<00:01:38.130> of

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
and two bombs come out there's two of

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.530 
and two bombs come out there's two of
these<00:01:38.400> working<00:01:38.850> systems<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.729> that's<00:01:41.729> cool<00:01:44.540> so

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
these working systems and that's cool so

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.410 
these working systems and that's cool so
you<00:01:45.840> wrote<00:01:46.590> them<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.860> there<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.240> have

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
you wrote them in there and you have

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.920 
you wrote them in there and you have
these<00:01:48.630> two<00:01:49.110> red<00:01:49.409> things<00:01:49.799> down<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:50.939> right

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
these two red things down here right

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.500 
these two red things down here right
here<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.460> lift<00:01:53.760> them<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:56.510> that

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
here you just lift them up and that

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.960 
here you just lift them up and that
comes<00:01:57.810> off<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.830> that's<00:01:59.040> why<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.280> call<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.670> I

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
comes off so that's why we call it I

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.679 
comes off so that's why we call it I
guess<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:00.630> call<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> landing<00:02:01.500> craft<00:02:02.689> so

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
guess they call it a landing craft so

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.809 
guess they call it a landing craft so
there's<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.259> inside<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.549> have<00:02:08.700> this

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
there's the inside and you have this

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.440 
there's the inside and you have this
little<00:02:09.060> gear<00:02:09.420> right<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:09.799> return<00:02:10.799> it<00:02:11.450> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
little gear right here return it and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.099 
little gear right here return it and
going<00:02:13.230> slow<00:02:13.469> down<00:02:14.269> but<00:02:17.359> I'm<00:02:18.359> just<00:02:18.599> gonna<00:02:18.930> put

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
going slow down but I'm just gonna put

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.670 
going slow down but I'm just gonna put
it<00:02:19.169> back<00:02:19.379> up<00:02:19.519> I'll<00:02:20.519> give<00:02:20.849> this<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.389> 9<00:02:21.779> out<00:02:22.169> of<00:02:22.230> 10

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
it back up I'll give this a 9 out of 10

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.280 
it back up I'll give this a 9 out of 10
because<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.579> wasn't<00:02:23.909> in<00:02:23.969> the<00:02:23.999> move<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.450> end<00:02:24.629> so

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
because it wasn't in the move the end so

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.759 
because it wasn't in the move the end so
that<00:02:25.919> system<00:02:26.459> doesn't<00:02:26.790> work<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:27.120> well<00:02:27.769> and

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
that system doesn't work that well and

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.050 
that system doesn't work that well and
this<00:02:29.549> is<00:02:29.879> my<00:02:30.090> technical<00:02:30.659> producer<00:02:31.430> Ryan<00:02:32.430> hi
