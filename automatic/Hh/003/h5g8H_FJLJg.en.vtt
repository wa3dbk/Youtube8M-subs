00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.289
 Why 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.000
 as in fact I mostly realized nothing of a problem 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.739
 to say that the defeat recorded probably a microphone 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.950
 mood 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.080
 and as I said at the beginning it's a good compromise for me because the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.120
 moment I think the the beast the sound of the drums and the character of the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.770
 drums 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.270
 it goes through the currents no it's not by the pickups yet the pack that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.540
 take the microphone in your hand 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.160
 alas and there I do not have a microphone 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.470
 then on a music that lends itself we do not see enough present 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.670
 so in fact I had to recreate a 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.490
 a room artificially 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.550
 so when the first battery premix 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.760
 % 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.240
 rather than seeing that after settlers 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.500
 compared to my idea of ​​the time 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
 from this battery 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.900
 so I returned this 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.870
 this first few drums on a pair of speakers that was placed in a 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.450
 year 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.240
 in a handkerchief 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.680
 places where will be your listening and go so that's what I had 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.410
 micro agpc microphones m 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.119
 percent to 102 of rosin should record its moods 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.920
 as I repeat it is better can really the boat 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.590
 it's really the couple woerth a couple 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.010
 thériault 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.160
 only by a dressed couple who have no for nothing at all I even want two 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.500
 microphones nominee replace roughly 1 3% near 300 hectares he has done well 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.300
 difficult 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.270
 for instance the cff 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.670
 it really serves very much asked the French did she understand her mistakes 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.570
 not content to have remained without effect for 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.220
 the sitting mayor 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.029
 uncompressed stars to simplify its offer in my list the press 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:14.029
 it was for about 100 euros crash 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.039
 so he moved to an exciting year 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.809
 polanski 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.809
 6 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:32.979
 it is 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.239
 purpose extend the character of the girl who had killed five 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.029
 p 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.259
 the treat the elements the 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.179
 for 100 e ie on the 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:11.839
 those who were doing it 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.189
 to blame 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.729
 the microphone of each of these instruments 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.469
 and the treaty 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.249
 treated them differently and yet many times that's saying 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:24.719
 the kikuyu connecticut j decreed a this tropism the console 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.389
 % a track 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.729
 none of these rights 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.789
 in e1 his rights to the game edited for a 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:36.149
 for to cut a pau resonance that was not very genis 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.799
 e and very slightly compressed 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.099
 per 100 children from 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.679
 in e hassan of just nor antico level constant children so far 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.469
 to see at this moment a feeling of compression 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.289
 after so in fact he 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:55.289
 that's it 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.279
 after i have% gbl so week his teammate 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.649
 I have on my second track 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:07.709
 and percent I just have been back again but there in a very way 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.329
 very sexy not natural at all 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.449
 and sent in a microphone preamp 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.769
 percent in order to lift 2 7 on the east 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.390
 e 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.859
 a meeting 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.859
 relatively favorable so it's good to do 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:28.349
 and% finally light% and I nobel price third time to compress 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:32.229
 for this return to cut off the attacked to see 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.229
 really a skin and compression side 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.219
 to mark 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.009
 here and so after that allows me to take these three elements 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.870
 and the network dosed for a 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.870
 to be able to contract from 1 8% 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.650
 how how france 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.449
 to order how how full recognition one 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.919
 can really help us the poor and what interests me in his opinion 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.159
 and really 2 0% accurately and a bar 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.089
 one for which it's exactly the same thing to do 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:10.759
 to know a summer fair slightly and abroad 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.150
 you dispute 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.699
 m% rose in a year by 10% in a ratio between micro for stability 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.610
 turkish pressed I'm invited he's getting closer to the top 8 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:26.249
 rubber compounds 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.639
 eugenics is used percent 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.949
 of reserve therefore the right of custody 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.009
 a very short reverb that a romanian probe for me one for a little 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.259
 round the angles we will say 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:42.889
 and percent on the road 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.389
 m on the 1 he is mayor 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.809
 I used the summer linen 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:50.510
 undefeated this summer with them 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.719
 tents of reserve aid 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.469
 for the layman a little bit of depth 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:57.619
 to better integrate with the big mix 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:00.939
 and after all that so I made percent that I made a first mixed of 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:03.219
 this set of batteries with him 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.219
 the fault in point with the flight in a whisper that I create 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.800
 and lengthened end of second line this battery half of these 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.800
 elements that I have the right compressed again again on compressed 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.819
 and to center injected to the art to the battery problem 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.219
 the goal being to be able to compress the matrix necessarily hike 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:24.529
 the impression that is compressed while turning to the level of football
