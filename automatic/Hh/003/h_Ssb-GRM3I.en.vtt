welcome back everybody today we are
going<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.250> be<00:00:02.340> learning<00:00:02.520> how<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.939> build<00:00:03.240> a

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
going to be learning how to build a

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.349 
going to be learning how to build a
automatic<00:00:04.200> flint<00:00:04.770> farm<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.700> reasoning<00:00:06.180> for

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
automatic flint farm the reasoning for

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.980 
automatic flint farm the reasoning for
this<00:00:06.569> farm<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.649> watched<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.189> live<00:00:08.400> stream<00:00:08.990> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
this farm is I watched a live stream the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.870 
this farm is I watched a live stream the
livestreamer<00:00:10.650> asked<00:00:11.070> can<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.580> make<00:00:11.759> an

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
livestreamer asked can you make an

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.570 
livestreamer asked can you make an
automatic<00:00:12.000> flint<00:00:12.750> farm<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.950> went<00:00:14.400> into

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
automatic flint farm and I went into

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.369 
automatic flint farm and I went into
some<00:00:14.820> research<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.480> found<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.839> definite

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
some research and found the definite

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.599 
some research and found the definite
answer<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.859> yes<00:00:17.130> now<00:00:18.140> being<00:00:19.140> tested<00:00:19.740> just

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
answer of yes now being tested just

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.120 
answer of yes now being tested just
stacking<00:00:21.060> gravel<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.750> work<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> became<00:00:22.710> at

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
stacking gravel can work so I became at

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.839 
stacking gravel can work so I became at

ring all the way around until you run

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
ring all the way around until you run
out<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> building<00:00:57.480> blocks<00:00:57.719> once<00:00:58.620> you've<00:00:58.829> run

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
out of building blocks once you've run

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.830 
out of building blocks once you've run
out<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.190> building<00:00:59.550> blocks<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.940> will<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.510> 10

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
out of building blocks you will be up 10

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.070 
out of building blocks you will be up 10
high<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> gonna<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:03.090> your<00:01:03.570> destination

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
high that is gonna be your destination

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.469 
high that is gonna be your destination
height<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:05.369> soon<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.150> height

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
height as soon as you have your height

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.350 
height as soon as you have your height
down<00:01:06.720> your<00:01:07.229> farm<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> ready<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.159> use<00:01:08.360> but

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
down your farm is ready to use but

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.500 
down your farm is ready to use but
recommended<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.830> make<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.220> higher<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.729> am

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
recommended you can make it higher I am

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
recommended you can make it higher I am
doing<00:01:12.840> 10<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> sake<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:14.010> video<00:01:14.159> this

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
doing 10 for the sake of this video this

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.300 
doing 10 for the sake of this video this
is<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> most<00:01:15.509> basic<00:01:15.720> design<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.680> you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
is the most basic design you can do you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.480 
is the most basic design you can do you
can<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.820> 200<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.720> needed<00:01:19.170> all<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.040> need<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
can go up 200 if needed all you need to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.219 
can go up 200 if needed all you need to
do<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.790> climb<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> ladder<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.630> get<00:01:21.840> back<00:01:22.020> up

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
do is climb up the ladder to get back up

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.440 
do is climb up the ladder to get back up
so<00:01:23.130> keep<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.670> mind<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.119> you're<00:01:24.240> using

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
so keep that in mind when you're using

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.260 
so keep that in mind when you're using
your<00:01:24.600> farm<00:01:25.020> now<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.130> must<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.759> jump

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
your farm now what you must do is jump

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.840 
your farm now what you must do is jump
down<00:01:27.570> place<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.530> ladders<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> will<00:01:29.670> not

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
down place your ladders and you will not

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.480 
down place your ladders and you will not
die<00:01:30.150> from<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.689> fall

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
die from the fall

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.429 
die from the fall
only<00:01:32.509> don't<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.659> how<00:01:33.780> many<00:01:33.840> hearts<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.290> was

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
only don't know how many hearts that was

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.469 
only don't know how many hearts that was
that<00:01:34.710> was<00:01:34.829> very<00:01:34.890> smart<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.060> will<00:01:36.299> go

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
that was very smart but now we will go

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.499 
that was very smart but now we will go
up<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> very<00:01:37.409> top<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.770> art<00:01:38.159> nice<00:01:39.090> Flint

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
up to the very top of art nice Flint

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.230 
up to the very top of art nice Flint
farm<00:01:39.810> place<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.130> our<00:01:41.280> gravel<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.000> falls

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
farm place all of our gravel so it falls

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.960 
farm place all of our gravel so it falls
down<00:01:45.140> just<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.380> climb<00:01:47.220> back<00:01:47.520> down<00:01:48.110> and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
down just like that climb back down and

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.319 
down just like that climb back down and
harvest<00:01:50.970> our<00:01:51.390> gravel<00:01:52.430> now<00:01:53.430> keep<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.850> mind<00:01:53.880> we

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
harvest our gravel now keep in mind we

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
harvest our gravel now keep in mind we
did<00:01:54.540> add<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> hopper<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.040> all<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
did add a hopper there so all of the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.969 
did add a hopper there so all of the
gravel<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.060> are<00:01:57.360> harvesting<00:01:57.960> will<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.710> put

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
gravel you are harvesting will be put

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.520 
gravel you are harvesting will be put
into<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.520> hopper<00:01:59.880> when<00:02:00.630> done<00:02:00.930> digging<00:02:01.259> the
