00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
us personally so let's go ahead and look

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.430 
us personally so let's go ahead and look
at<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.940> few<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.509> these<00:00:15.660> different<00:00:16.080> strumming

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
at a few of these different strumming

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.470 
at a few of these different strumming
techniques<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.460> first<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.880> going<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.150> to

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
techniques the first is going to be to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.970 
techniques the first is going to be to
just<00:00:18.510> use<00:00:18.750> your<00:00:18.869> thumb<00:00:19.050> which<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.650> going<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.859> be

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
just use your thumb which is going to be

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.480 
just use your thumb which is going to be
kind<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:21.680> subtler<00:00:22.680> sound<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> be

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
kind of a subtler sound it's going to be

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.040 
kind of a subtler sound it's going to be
lighter<00:00:23.789> sound<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.300> let's<00:00:24.449> take<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> look<00:00:24.930> at

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
lighter sound but let's take a look at

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.779 
lighter sound but let's take a look at
that<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.830> play<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> thumb<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.670> to

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
that to play with the thumb is going to

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:35.880 
that to play with the thumb is going to
look<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> lot<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.390> this

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.040 

it's<00:00:36.890> gonna<00:00:37.040> give<00:00:37.220> us<00:00:37.340> some<00:00:37.489> nice<00:00:38.050> quiet

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
it's gonna give us some nice quiet

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.190 
it's gonna give us some nice quiet
telling<00:00:39.559> a<00:00:39.710> subtler<00:00:40.130> tone<00:00:40.930> let's<00:00:41.930> go<00:00:42.079> ahead

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
telling a subtler tone let's go ahead

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.660 
telling a subtler tone let's go ahead
and<00:00:42.379> change<00:00:42.559> it<00:00:42.620> up<00:00:42.770> and<00:00:42.920> try<00:00:43.040> to<00:00:43.100> do<00:00:43.280> something

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
and change it up and try to do something

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.640 
and change it up and try to do something
where<00:00:44.180> we're<00:00:44.329> still<00:00:44.629> just<00:00:44.900> using<00:00:45.199> our<00:00:45.260> fingers

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
where we're still just using our fingers

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.130 
where we're still just using our fingers
and<00:00:46.489> we're<00:00:46.850> strumming<00:00:47.329> but<00:00:47.660> what<00:00:47.840> we're<00:00:47.960> doing

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
and we're strumming but what we're doing

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.180 
and we're strumming but what we're doing
is<00:00:48.230> we're<00:00:48.350> going<00:00:48.470> to<00:00:48.530> put<00:00:48.680> these<00:00:48.800> fingers

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
is we're going to put these fingers

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.070 
is we're going to put these fingers
together<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:49.760> we<00:00:49.850> can<00:00:50.030> not<00:00:50.540> have<00:00:50.720> to<00:00:50.839> rotate

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
together so we can not have to rotate

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.720 
together so we can not have to rotate
our<00:00:51.559> thumb<00:00:51.830> as<00:00:51.980> much<00:00:52.190> it's<00:00:52.430> going<00:00:52.519> to<00:00:52.580> sound

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
our thumb as much it's going to sound

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:07.080 
our thumb as much it's going to sound
like<00:00:52.850> this

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.350 

and<00:01:08.560> lastly<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.830> most<00:01:09.860> common<00:01:10.490> technique<00:01:11.150> is

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
and lastly the most common technique is

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.210 
and lastly the most common technique is
to<00:01:11.540> use<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:11.750> guitar<00:01:12.230> pick<00:01:12.440> which<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:12.800> can<00:01:12.980> find

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
to use a guitar pick which you can find

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.640 
to use a guitar pick which you can find
at<00:01:13.370> your<00:01:13.400> local<00:01:13.760> store<00:01:14.000> any<00:01:14.840> different<00:01:15.470> kind

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
at your local store any different kind

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.590 
at your local store any different kind
of<00:01:15.770> pick<00:01:15.920> will<00:01:16.130> work<00:01:16.310> but<00:01:16.760> it's<00:01:17.300> going<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.480> give

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
of pick will work but it's going to give

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.510 
of pick will work but it's going to give
you<00:01:17.690> a<00:01:17.750> harsher<00:01:18.140> tone<00:01:18.320> but<00:01:19.040> this<00:01:19.160> probably<00:01:19.370> the

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
you a harsher tone but this probably the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.280 
you a harsher tone but this probably the
most<00:01:19.640> popular<00:01:20.150> way<00:01:20.360> of<00:01:20.390> playing<00:01:20.900> them<00:01:21.110> I

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
most popular way of playing them I

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.140 
most popular way of playing them I
prefer<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:21.740> play<00:01:21.860> with<00:01:22.010> my<00:01:22.160> fingers<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:22.910> lot

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
prefer to play with my fingers a lot

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.300 
prefer to play with my fingers a lot
because<00:01:23.960> you<00:01:24.170> can<00:01:24.350> switch<00:01:24.560> from<00:01:24.590> finger<00:01:25.070> style

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
which we're going to talk about in a few

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.630 
which we're going to talk about in a few
minutes<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.590> strumming<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.370> can<00:01:28.490> also

easily<00:01:30.980> with<00:01:31.430> guitar<00:01:31.730> pick<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.120> have<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.420> tuck

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
easily with guitar pick you have to tuck

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.850 
easily with guitar pick you have to tuck
them<00:01:32.690> between<00:01:32.870> your<00:01:33.050> fingers<00:01:33.350> or<00:01:33.560> set<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:33.830> down

and pick it up and fork or work it works

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.920 
and pick it up and fork or work it works
as<00:01:37.430> just<00:01:37.670> as<00:01:37.820> effective<00:01:38.270> but<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.480> also<00:01:38.660> is

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
as just as effective but it also is

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.200 
as just as effective but it also is
better<00:01:39.140> for<00:01:39.350> single<00:01:39.680> mountain<00:01:39.920> lines<00:01:40.210> let's

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
better for single mountain lines let's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:56.120 
better for single mountain lines let's
go<00:01:41.330> ahead<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.630> hear<00:01:42.020> what<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.200> sounds<00:01:42.350> like

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.770 

you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.880> hear<00:01:57.060> how<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.210> sounds<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> little

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
you can hear how that sounds a little

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.139 
you can hear how that sounds a little
bit<00:01:58.049> brighter<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.579> thickness<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.090> your

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
bit brighter and the thickness of your

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.910 
bit brighter and the thickness of your
pick<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.719> what<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> material<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.770> your

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
pick and what the material that your

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.950 
pick and what the material that your
pick<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.219> made<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.490> will<00:02:02.729> determine<00:02:03.030> how

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
pick is made of will determine how

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.800 
pick is made of will determine how
