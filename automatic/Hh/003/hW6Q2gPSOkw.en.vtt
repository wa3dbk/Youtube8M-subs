a boarding school so that's kind of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.480 
a boarding school so that's kind of
where<00:00:53.990> I<00:00:54.230> realized<00:00:54.920> that<00:00:55.070> maybe<00:00:55.220> we<00:00:55.340> had<00:00:55.460> a

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
where I realized that maybe we had a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.400 
where I realized that maybe we had a
future<00:00:55.790> in<00:00:55.940> it<00:00:56.150> and<00:00:56.360> it<00:00:56.840> could<00:00:56.990> bring<00:00:57.140> me<00:00:57.290> to

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
future in it and it could bring me to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.440 
future in it and it could bring me to
college<00:00:57.620> start<00:00:58.430> talking<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.940> Academy

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
college start talking to the Academy

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.990 
college start talking to the Academy
last<00:00:59.480> year<00:01:00.020> I<00:01:00.050> was<00:01:00.260> playing<00:01:00.470> juniors<00:01:01.010> which<00:01:01.850> is

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
last year I was playing juniors which is

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.970 
last year I was playing juniors which is
a<00:01:02.030> level<00:01:02.270> between<00:01:02.570> high<00:01:03.260> school<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:03.650> college

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
a level between high school and college

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.120 
a level between high school and college
so<00:01:04.909> when<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.119> Academy<00:01:05.570> came<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.900> me<00:01:06.049> first<00:01:07.009> of

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
so when the Academy came to me first of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.649 
so when the Academy came to me first of
all<00:01:07.189> I<00:01:07.219> didn't<00:01:07.549> really<00:01:07.819> realize<00:01:08.060> if<00:01:08.479> it

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
all I didn't really realize if it

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.139 
all I didn't really realize if it
there'd<00:01:08.929> be<00:01:09.079> any<00:01:09.200> other<00:01:09.380> options<00:01:09.890> for<00:01:10.039> me<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.090> I

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
there'd be any other options for me so I

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.730 
there'd be any other options for me so I
was<00:01:11.299> definitely<00:01:11.450> taking<00:01:11.929> a<00:01:12.049> look<00:01:12.259> at<00:01:12.380> it<00:01:12.530> and

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
was definitely taking a look at it and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.889 
was definitely taking a look at it and
that<00:01:12.890> respect<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.299> more<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.509> looked<00:01:14.780> at

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
that respect and the more I looked at

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.319 
that respect and the more I looked at
kind<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.439> more<00:01:15.649> I<00:01:15.950> realized<00:01:16.429> that<00:01:16.549> suited<00:01:17.179> me

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
kind of more I realized that suited me

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.840 
kind of more I realized that suited me

was<00:01:37.639> a<00:01:37.670> lot<00:01:37.939> going<00:01:37.969> on<00:01:38.509> this<00:01:38.749> year<00:01:39.049> I<00:01:39.469> was<00:01:39.920> kind

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
was a lot going on this year I was kind

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.489 
was a lot going on this year I was kind
of<00:01:40.420> mind-boggling<00:01:41.420> um<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.079> think<00:01:42.289> that's

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
of mind-boggling um but I think that's

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.559 
of mind-boggling um but I think that's
one<00:01:42.889> of<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.069> reasons<00:01:43.399> that<00:01:43.639> one<00:01:44.359> of<00:01:44.420> the

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
one of the reasons that one of the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.029 
one of the reasons that one of the
things<00:01:44.719> that<00:01:44.869> helped<00:01:45.049> me<00:01:45.170> succeed<00:01:45.439> on<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.920> ice

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
things that helped me succeed on the ice

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.399 
things that helped me succeed on the ice

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
is when I was down there kind of let me

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.989 
is when I was down there kind of let me
get<00:01:48.590> away<00:01:48.709> from<00:01:48.799> all<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:49.279> stuff<00:01:49.399> up<00:01:49.700> here
