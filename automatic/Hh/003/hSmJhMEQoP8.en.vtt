00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
multiple color of looking at different

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.160 
multiple color of looking at different
angles<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.340> that's<00:01:18.090> somehow<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.720> come<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
angles and that's somehow not come to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.760 
angles and that's somehow not come to
the<00:01:19.340> fore<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.689> third<00:01:21.689> important<00:01:22.049> thing<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the fore and third important thing is I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.330 
the fore and third important thing is I
think<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.110> megatrend<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:25.350> overall<00:01:25.830> society

overall and that is something which is a
thing<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.009> future<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.579> people<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.119> started

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
thing of future and people have started

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.450 
thing of future and people have started
connecting<00:01:57.930> other<00:01:58.530> product<00:01:58.979> categories<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
connecting other product categories to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.249 
connecting other product categories to
that<00:01:59.640> automobile<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.600> yet<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.899> catch<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.170> on

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that automobile is yet to catch up on

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.780 
that automobile is yet to catch up on
that<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.310> something<00:02:02.399> which<00:02:02.640> is

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
that so that is something which is

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.859 
that so that is something which is
missing<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.210> which<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.540> much<00:02:03.659> possible

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
missing and which is very much possible

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.690 
missing and which is very much possible
in<00:02:04.170> terms<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.380> widening<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.890> overall<00:02:05.460> choice

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
in terms of widening the overall choice

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.499 
in terms of widening the overall choice
of<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> consumer<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:08.310> one<00:02:08.970> last<00:02:09.179> bit<00:02:09.360> would

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
of the consumer and one last bit would

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.050 
of the consumer and one last bit would
be<00:02:09.629> maybe<00:02:09.869> tea<00:02:10.489> this<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.580> another<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.970> new

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
be maybe tea this is another the new

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.550 
be maybe tea this is another the new
trend<00:02:12.300> which<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.660> just

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
trend which is just

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.699 
trend which is just
nning<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> entire<00:02:14.190> palette<00:02:14.520> which<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:15.709> the

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
nning the entire palette which is a the

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.790 
nning the entire palette which is a the
graphite<00:02:17.599> writing<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.720> one<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.470> scooters

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
graphite writing the one of the scooters

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.250 
graphite writing the one of the scooters
have<00:02:19.950> come<00:02:20.130> up<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.690> graphite<00:02:21.690> grays<00:02:21.959> and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
have come up with the graphite grays and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.820 
have come up with the graphite grays and
more<00:02:22.560> matte<00:02:22.830> color<00:02:23.190> schemes<00:02:23.489> with<00:02:23.970> Hayek<00:02:24.360> sent

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
more matte color schemes with Hayek sent

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.640 
more matte color schemes with Hayek sent
me<00:02:25.830> high<00:02:26.130> chroma<00:02:26.370> accent<00:02:26.819> on<00:02:26.940> top<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.650> so

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
me high chroma accent on top of that so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.559 
me high chroma accent on top of that so
that<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.950> something<00:02:29.250> which<00:02:29.489> is<00:02:29.670> also<00:02:30.090> missing

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
that is something which is also missing

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.979 
that is something which is also missing
in<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> entire<00:02:31.110> segment<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.849> I<00:02:32.900> think<00:02:33.900> this

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
in the entire segment and I think this

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.580 
in the entire segment and I think this
is<00:02:34.140> time<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:35.120> get<00:02:36.120> still<00:02:36.690> much<00:02:36.959> more<00:02:36.989> wider

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
is time to get still much more wider

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.850 
is time to get still much more wider
slightly<00:02:38.310> more<00:02:38.489> wider<00:02:38.900> more<00:02:39.900> richer<00:02:40.260> pilot

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
slightly more wider more richer pilot

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.970 
slightly more wider more richer pilot
onto<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.810> cars<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.140> scooters<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
onto the cars and the scooters and the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.920 
onto the cars and the scooters and the
overall<00:02:44.280> auto<00:02:44.459> mobile<00:02:44.670> category<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.750> time

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
overall auto mobile category it is time

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.450 
overall auto mobile category it is time
to<00:02:46.049> say<00:02:46.230> no<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.310> subserve<00:02:48.269> that
