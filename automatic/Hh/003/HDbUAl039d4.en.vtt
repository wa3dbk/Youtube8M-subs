scoping and 1b ones now I know a lot of
you<00:00:30.210> probably<00:00:30.390> use<00:00:31.080> ballista<00:00:31.710> CPU<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.790> laser

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
you probably use ballista CPU and laser

you probably use ballista CPU and laser
now<00:00:34.530> I'm<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> say<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.850> laser

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
ballista CPU does not help with quick

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.940 
ballista CPU does not help with quick
scoping<00:01:10.460> all<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.960> okay<00:01:12.960> good<00:01:13.409> you

understand it actually only helps with

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.149 
understand it actually only helps with
hardscoping<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.580> had<00:01:17.759> no<00:01:18.000> idea<00:01:18.659> until

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
hardscoping and I had no idea until

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.440 
hardscoping and I had no idea until
someone<00:01:20.159> brought<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.670> my<00:01:20.820> attention<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
someone brought it to my attention that

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.749 
someone brought it to my attention that
ballista<00:01:22.140> CPU<00:01:22.590> does<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:23.009> help<00:01:23.220> at<00:01:23.340> all<00:01:23.520> with

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
ballista CPU does not help at all with

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.310 
ballista CPU does not help at all with
quick<00:01:23.939> scoping<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.630> was<00:01:24.720> basically<00:01:24.869> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
quick scoping so it was basically a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.760 
quick scoping so it was basically a
waste<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.979> an<00:01:26.100> attachment<00:01:26.430> i<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:26.939> using

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
waste of an attachment i was using

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.520 
waste of an attachment i was using
instead<00:01:29.329> i'll<00:01:30.329> wait<00:01:30.630> let<00:01:30.840> me<00:01:30.869> talk<00:01:31.140> about<00:01:31.170> what

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
instead i'll wait let me talk about what

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.280 
instead i'll wait let me talk about what
ballista<00:01:31.920> cpu<00:01:32.280> does<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.390> ballista<00:01:33.780> CPU<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
ballista cpu does so ballista CPU is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.429 
ballista cpu does so ballista CPU is
basically<00:01:34.829> steady<00:01:35.130> aim<00:01:35.400> um<00:01:35.930> but<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.290> only

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
basically steady aim um but it only

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.920 
basically steady aim um but it only
works<00:01:37.590> when<00:01:37.950> you're<00:01:38.009> aiming<00:01:38.430> down<00:01:38.579> gun<00:01:38.930> aiming

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
works when you're aiming down gun aiming

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.620 
works when you're aiming down gun aiming
down<00:01:40.110> sights<00:01:40.250> cheese<00:01:41.250> man<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.450> with

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
down sights cheese man what is up with

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.760 
down sights cheese man what is up with
me<00:01:42.810> today<00:01:43.310> anyways<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.049> you're<00:01:46.470> aiming

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
me today anyways so if you're aiming

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.660 
me today anyways so if you're aiming
down<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> sights<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.369> you're<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:47.610> to

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
down the sights and you're going to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.850 
down the sights and you're going to
quickscope<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.600> obviously<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:49.680> going

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
quickscope you obviously it's not going

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.319 
quickscope you obviously it's not going
to<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.100> enough<00:01:50.130> time<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.700> really<00:01:50.850> affect

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
to have enough time to really affect

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.410 
to have enough time to really affect
where<00:01:51.600> scopes<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:53.820> Center<00:01:54.329> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
where scopes going to be it my Center it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.709 
where scopes going to be it my Center it
just<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.780> little<00:01:54.810> bit<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.590> not<00:01:55.860> enough<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
just a little bit but not enough to be a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.700 
just a little bit but not enough to be a
significant<00:01:57.719> difference<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.290> I've<00:01:58.380> started

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
significant difference and I've started

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.910 
significant difference and I've started
playing<00:01:59.100> without<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.610> for<00:01:59.820> probably<00:02:00.600> about

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
playing without it for probably about

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.100 
playing without it for probably about
the<00:02:01.920> last<00:02:01.950> 30<00:02:02.700> matches<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.540> don't<00:02:03.719> really<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the last 30 matches I don't really see a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.319 
the last 30 matches I don't really see a

without FMJ own it never makes it

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.010 
without FMJ own it never makes it
through<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> second<00:03:01.950> wall<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.720> don't<00:03:03.720> know<00:03:03.840> why

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
through the second wall I don't know why

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.220 
through the second wall I don't know why
but<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.920> just<00:03:04.950> doesn't<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.880> even<00:03:06.840> if<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.020> does

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
but it just doesn't and even if it does

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.290 
but it just doesn't and even if it does
by<00:03:07.680> any<00:03:07.860> chance<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.489> going<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.700> hardly

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
by any chance it's going to hardly
