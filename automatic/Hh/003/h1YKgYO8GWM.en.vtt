00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.470
 hello how are football friends for the 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.780
 band is already monday football Monday 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.820
 confederations today play and against 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.650
 Tahiti a must-see game 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.660
 I say for the relatives of the 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.460
 Nigerians and Haitians but also 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.320
 it's football Monday for the band 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.150
 unmissable today we are going to 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.280
 learn to correctly center the 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.710
 ball I say in the subject came out that already 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:31.990
 that we are talking about confederations 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:34.090
 nigeria mexico 00 plus the centers 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:40.900
 so let's give everything to the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:43.300
 centers for this type of center is the 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.280
 what more players do 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.670
 you have done it and the truth is the most 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.670
 easy 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.670
 what I do not understand is how there are players 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.670
 professionals who do this 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.830
 let's still say that the ball was in 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.200
 movement came three players 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.770
 Now I do not pass it to you, but to the ball 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.770
 stopped 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.260
 you can give some effect to 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.240
 center the ball in this way this with 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.720
 the purpose of the auctioneer having 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.720
 advantage 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.690
 because the effect of the ball helps you 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.690
 finish stronger 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.259
 two 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.620
 this type of centers are very effective 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.330
 because they are stronger and you do not have 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.430
 to worry if he's going to grab the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.350
 ball or not the force that leads to the center 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.650
 is directly proportional to the auction 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.650
 of the player 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.470
 these centers are used many times 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.690
 by the players who do not use the other 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.940
 leg look good when they come out and 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.330
 everything but nothing like focusing well with the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.330
 two feet 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.879
 the bad of not knowing how to center with the two 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.890
 feet is that sometimes you take bad 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.629
 decisions what I'm going to do is that when 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.730
 you reach the final line and you must enter what 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.349
 as fast as possible there are times when you 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.810
 stop the ball and you settle your foot 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.620
 good and then centras which takes away the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.620
 surprise factor 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.769
 better when you reach the final line and 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.959
 must center with the Swedish leg 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.859
 try it and you'll see that it's much easier 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.859
 of what you thought 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.720
 these centers are mainly for 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.870
 cheat the opponent if you reach the final line 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.030
 and you raise your face, eye, you raise your face 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.650
 seeing your front in tip is not you 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.470
 it happens to flip back because if not 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.090
 the cloth defense will guess then yes 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.310
 you raise your face pretending that you will do 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.319
 pass to the most advanced player point 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.489
 center the ball backwards so that 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.489
 someone arrives and the auction 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.910
 this type of center has several 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.650
 advantages is the famous search engine because 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.480
 may the goal your front star 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.200
 or maybe the goal in its own arc the 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.200
 same defense 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.680
 all you do is send a 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.390
 center and with enough force to 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.350
 that the foot that gets in the way is 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.350
 who converts it into a goal 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.370
 here comes the real difficulty for 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.110
 send a good center there are different 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.360
 factors that can prevent you from sending a 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.910
 good center in motion for example 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.620
 that you're a trunk and just hit him 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.990
 hitting the ball without trying to give 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.900
 advantage to your front you just hit him and 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.910
 already 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.500
 other factors that I do not like your 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.500
 steps and you end up doing this 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.600
 and the factor they are most afraid of 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.710
 players that you bounce the ball just 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.710
 when you are going to center 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.330
 but on the other hand if you manage to send a 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.130
 center with the ball in motion speaks 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.099
 very good about you and your technique 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.900
 individual do not despair concentrate 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.880
 and measure your steps well so that when 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.830
 put your support foot what do you put 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.150
 exactly on the side of the ball and you 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.150
 you can paste in a good way 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.669
 you just have to let the ball between 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.210
 just your profile and that's when you 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.210
 you must paste 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.040
 Well, you saw all the types of 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.870
 centers that there are and the right way to 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.700
 do them here the important thing is that your 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.650
 centers reach where we really 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.480
 you want to put many players just 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.070
 they enter by focusing center on the ball 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.500
 to see who plays it and by chance 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.450
 the true objective of a good center 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.550
 is that you put it where you want and what 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.230
 give all the benefits to your header I 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.940
 I say goodbye my name is israel and 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.740

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.120
