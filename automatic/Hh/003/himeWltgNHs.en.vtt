became a microbiologist and then she did
a<00:02:15.270> study<00:02:15.570> where<00:02:15.870> she<00:02:16.020> took<00:02:16.200> she<00:02:16.680> did<00:02:16.860> her<00:02:17.100> old

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
a study where she took she did her old

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.370 
a study where she took she did her old
raw<00:02:17.910> cheese<00:02:18.270> with<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.540> wooden<00:02:18.900> bucket<00:02:19.110> and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
raw cheese with the wooden bucket and

Ocoee coli in the sterile container
after<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.680> cheese<00:02:31.890> was<00:02:32.040> made<00:02:32.220> was<00:02:32.670> completely

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
after the cheese was made was completely

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.900 
after the cheese was made was completely
toxic<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.960> unedible<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:35.310> was<00:02:35.460> loaded<00:02:35.850> with

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
toxic and unedible it was loaded with

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.860 
toxic and unedible it was loaded with
e.coli<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.260> e.coli<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:39.150> raw<00:02:39.510> cheese

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.350 
e.coli but the e.coli in the raw cheese
that<00:02:40.530> she<00:02:40.740> made<00:02:40.980> there<00:02:41.580> were<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:41.850> many<00:02:41.970> good

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
that she made there were so many good

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.720 
that she made there were so many good
microbes<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.020> there<00:02:43.140> they<00:02:43.320> rallied<00:02:44.100> to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
microbes in there they rallied to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.970 
microbes in there they rallied to
support<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.480> health<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.470> cheese<00:02:46.710> and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
support the health of the cheese and

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.840 
support the health of the cheese and
there<00:02:47.550> was<00:02:47.670> relatively<00:02:48.120> no<00:02:49.020> e<00:02:49.380> coli<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
there was relatively no e coli in the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.990 
there was relatively no e coli in the
cheese<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.420> was<00:02:51.510> edible<00:02:51.990> very<00:02:52.680> edible<00:02:53.000> my

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
cheese and it was edible very edible my

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.240 
cheese and it was edible very edible my
point<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:54.630> that's<00:02:55.230> called<00:02:55.650> microbial

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
point is is that that's called microbial

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.910 
point is is that that's called microbial
diversity<00:02:56.840> that's<00:02:57.840> what<00:02:58.020> we've<00:02:58.170> lost<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.800> the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
diversity that's what we've lost in the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.620 
diversity that's what we've lost in the
West<00:02:59.130> because<00:02:59.820> we've<00:03:00.030> lost<00:03:00.270> our<00:03:00.570> connection

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
West because we've lost our connection

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.110 
West because we've lost our connection
to<00:03:01.320> eating<00:03:01.890> foods<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.310> are<00:03:02.460> connected<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
to eating foods that are connected to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.970 
to eating foods that are connected to
nature<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.600> heard<00:03:04.050> an<00:03:04.170> article<00:03:04.500> once<00:03:04.620> they<00:03:04.770> cut

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
nature I heard an article once they cut

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.310 
nature I heard an article once they cut
they<00:03:05.490> said<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:06.000> your<00:03:06.210> bugs<00:03:06.570> don't<00:03:06.900> eat<00:03:07.140> the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
they said if your bugs don't eat the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.500 
they said if your bugs don't eat the
food<00:03:07.620> then<00:03:07.920> should<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:09.000> put<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.210> loaf<00:03:09.420> of

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
food then should you we put a loaf of

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.730 
food then should you we put a loaf of
bread<00:03:09.660> on<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.930> counter<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.470> can<00:03:10.590> last

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
bread on the counter and it can last

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.070 
bread on the counter and it can last
there<00:03:11.010> for<00:03:11.250> two<00:03:11.400> or<00:03:11.430> three<00:03:11.730> weeks<00:03:11.780> maybe<00:03:12.780> more

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
there for two or three weeks maybe more

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.630 
there for two or three weeks maybe more
but<00:03:13.230> before<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.650> goes<00:03:13.770> back<00:03:14.010> open<00:03:14.610> your

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
but before it goes back open your

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.910 
but before it goes back open your
refrigerator<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:16.260> look<00:03:16.410> at<00:03:16.560> all<00:03:16.770> the

refrigerator and look at all the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.020 
refrigerator and look at all the
refrigerator<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.490> all<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.700> stuff<00:03:17.880> that's

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
refrigerator for all the stuff that's

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.710 
refrigerator for all the stuff that's
basically<00:03:19.820> not<00:03:20.820> going<00:03:20.850> bad

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
basically not going bad

don't bugs eat food I mean Mike don't
things<00:03:27.510> go<00:03:27.720> bad<00:03:27.990> if<00:03:28.290> they're<00:03:28.470> all<00:03:28.710> fresh<00:03:29.070> and

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
things go bad if they're all fresh and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.550 
things go bad if they're all fresh and
they're<00:03:29.460> live<00:03:30.020> when<00:03:31.020> you<00:03:31.110> start<00:03:31.350> thinking

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
they're live when you start thinking

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.560 
they're live when you start thinking
about<00:03:31.830> if<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.220> bugs<00:03:32.490> don't<00:03:32.820> eat<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.480> we're

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
about if the bugs don't eat it and we're

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.170 
about if the bugs don't eat it and we're
90%<00:03:33.960> bug<00:03:34.530> or<00:03:34.740> microbe<00:03:35.130> then<00:03:35.550> why<00:03:35.730> should<00:03:35.970> we<00:03:36.060> be

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
90% bug or microbe then why should we be

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.670 
90% bug or microbe then why should we be
eating<00:03:36.450> these<00:03:36.540> foods<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.960> have<00:03:37.140> no<00:03:37.320> microbes

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
eating these foods that have no microbes

on<00:03:37.860> them<00:03:38.040> or<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.700> microbes<00:03:39.030> won't<00:03:39.210> even<00:03:39.420> eat

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830
