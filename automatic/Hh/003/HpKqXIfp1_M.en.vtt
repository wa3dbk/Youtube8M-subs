00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
I thought I was always gonna be the best

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.730 
I thought I was always gonna be the best
example<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.579> can<00:01:55.610> give<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.360> when<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:57.200> hear<00:01:57.320> Boaz

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
example I can give so when you hear Boaz

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.279 
example I can give so when you hear Boaz
you<00:01:57.979> just<00:01:58.189> notice<00:01:58.520> all<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.539> way<00:01:59.689> authentic

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
you just notice all the way authentic

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.160 
you just notice all the way authentic
all<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.590> way<00:02:00.710> 100<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.939> we<00:02:02.390> all<00:02:02.539> know<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.990> you

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
all the way 100 so we all know that you

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.039 
all the way 100 so we all know that you
are<00:02:03.320> with<00:02:03.560> rostrum<00:02:04.070> records<00:02:04.100> but<00:02:04.759> I<00:02:05.090> mean<00:02:05.869> that

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
are with rostrum records but I mean that

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.719 
are with rostrum records but I mean that
I<00:02:06.259> feel<00:02:06.679> like<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:06.860> push<00:02:07.130> didn't<00:02:07.429> start<00:02:07.640> until

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
I feel like a push didn't start until

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.339 
I feel like a push didn't start until
recently<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:08.509> what<00:02:08.660> was<00:02:08.810> going<00:02:09.019> on<00:02:09.110> with<00:02:09.170> that

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
recently so what was going on with that

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.710 
recently so what was going on with that
why<00:02:09.530> didn't<00:02:09.830> start<00:02:10.039> until<00:02:10.330> nothing<00:02:11.330> for<00:02:11.599> them

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
why didn't start until nothing for them

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.470 
why didn't start until nothing for them
I<00:02:11.959> think<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.550> really<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:14.030> go<00:02:14.180> through

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
I think that you really just go through

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.309 
I think that you really just go through
a<00:02:14.950> preparation<00:02:15.950> stage<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.910> know<00:02:17.060> seeing

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
a preparation stage and you know seeing

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.380 
a preparation stage and you know seeing
where<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.349> are<00:02:18.739> as<00:02:19.310> an<00:02:19.549> artist<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:20.030> remember

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
where you are as an artist you remember

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.089 
where you are as an artist you remember
your<00:02:20.540> fans<00:02:20.840> stand<00:02:21.200> with<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.010> know

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
your fans stand with you and you know

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.220 
your fans stand with you and you know
what<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.459> need<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.760> do<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.080> elevate<00:02:24.080> your

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
what you need to do to elevate your

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.620 
what you need to do to elevate your
career<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:24.980> just<00:02:25.730> pretty<00:02:25.910> much<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.150> sense<00:02:26.480> of

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
career so just pretty much a sense of

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.930 
career so just pretty much a sense of
you<00:02:26.780> know<00:02:27.040> development<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.190> would<00:02:28.489> like<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.670> say

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
you know development I would like to say

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.589 
you know development I would like to say
but<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.480> know<00:02:29.569> not<00:02:29.810> necessarily<00:02:29.959> any

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
but you know not necessarily any

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.610 
but you know not necessarily any
complications<00:02:32.599> there<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:33.079> seeing<00:02:33.410> what<00:02:33.530> we

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
complications there just seeing what we

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.069 
complications there just seeing what we
wanted<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.950> do<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.280> finessed<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:35.780> get<00:02:35.930> there

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
wanted to do this finessed to get there

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.630 
wanted to do this finessed to get there
a<00:02:36.110> little<00:02:36.260> easier<00:02:36.709> so<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:36.950> think<00:02:37.069> right<00:02:37.400> now<00:02:37.579> we

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
a little easier so I think right now we

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.750 
a little easier so I think right now we
just<00:02:37.940> found<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.360> groove<00:02:38.720> or<00:02:38.989> having<00:02:39.349> a<00:02:39.760> solid

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
just found that groove or having a solid

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.530 
just found that groove or having a solid
amount<00:02:40.849> of<00:02:41.150> music<00:02:41.599> in<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:43.000> good<00:02:44.000> sense<00:02:44.269> of<00:02:44.390> what

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
amount of music in a good sense of what

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.259 
amount of music in a good sense of what
we<00:02:44.630> wanted<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.930> go<00:02:45.140> marketing<00:02:45.709> wise<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.400> now

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
we wanted to go marketing wise and now

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.970 
we wanted to go marketing wise and now
we<00:02:47.329> just<00:02:47.599> got<00:02:47.690> our<00:02:47.780> foot<00:02:47.989> on<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.170> gas<00:02:48.380> just<00:02:48.709> you

development<00:02:53.209> how<00:02:53.420> have<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.870> developed<00:02:54.140> as<00:02:54.440> an

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
development how have you developed as an

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.319 
development how have you developed as an
artist<00:02:54.920> or<00:02:55.069> maybe<00:02:55.250> even<00:02:55.340> as<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.730> person<00:02:56.120> since

artist or maybe even as a person since
signing<00:02:56.569> montage<00:02:57.049> I<00:02:57.590> think<00:02:58.459> in<00:02:58.700> many<00:02:59.420> ways<00:02:59.569> I

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
signing montage I think in many ways I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.660 
signing montage I think in many ways I
mean<00:03:00.380> because<00:03:00.470> you're<00:03:00.889> signing<00:03:01.400> with<00:03:01.639> the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
mean because you're signing with the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.539 
mean because you're signing with the
label<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.180> really<00:03:02.920> took<00:03:03.920> me<00:03:04.100> to<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.280> whole

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
label it really took me to a whole

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.550 
label it really took me to a whole
nother<00:03:04.760> level<00:03:04.880> of<00:03:05.329> professionalism<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:06.350> mean

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
nother level of professionalism you mean

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.699 
nother level of professionalism you mean
so<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.980> things<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.310> was<00:03:07.340> used<00:03:07.639> to<00:03:07.700> doing<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.269> a

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
so the things I was used to doing is a

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.400 
so the things I was used to doing is a
my<00:03:09.709> own<00:03:09.920> artist<00:03:10.720> was<00:03:11.720> quite<00:03:11.989> different<00:03:12.200> than

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
my own artist was quite different than

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.110 
my own artist was quite different than
what<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.680> do<00:03:12.799> as<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:12.980> sign<00:03:13.280> artist<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:13.880> just

professional and be more productive in a
sense<00:03:18.889> of<00:03:19.989> not<00:03:20.989> just<00:03:21.230> music<00:03:21.440> you're<00:03:21.859> making
