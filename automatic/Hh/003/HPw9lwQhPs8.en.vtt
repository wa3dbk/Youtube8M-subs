00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.129
 realization will really be needed 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.920
 very few ingredients to prepare it 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.430
 let's see how it is done by 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.530
 I will need 125 g of the dough 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:53.769

 ml of already sweetened vegetable cream I go 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:16.180
 use this because once 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.720

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.320

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.180
 as soon as the egg whites are well assembled there 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.490

 egg whites should be blended into the eggs I insert 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:00.869
