here the the fish quite like to be in
the<00:02:45.120> dark<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.599> tilapia<00:02:45.900> there's<00:02:47.629> 105<00:02:48.629> of<00:02:48.690> them

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
the dark the tilapia there's 105 of them

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.009 
the dark the tilapia there's 105 of them
in<00:02:49.170> there<00:02:49.379> in<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:51.390> constantly<00:02:52.019> cycling<00:02:53.000> system

of<00:04:20.320> toying<00:04:20.590> with<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.860> idea<00:04:20.920> of<00:04:21.310> taking<00:04:21.940> these

of toying with the idea of taking these

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.790 
of toying with the idea of taking these
out<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.510> putting<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:22.780> chicken<00:04:23.140> coop<00:04:23.320> in<00:04:23.530> here

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
out and putting a chicken coop in here

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.960 
out and putting a chicken coop in here
because<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.670> chickens<00:04:25.650> produce<00:04:26.730> about<00:04:27.730> eight

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
because the chickens produce about eight

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.090 
because the chickens produce about eight
BTUs<00:04:28.660> per<00:04:28.690> chicken<00:04:29.470> it's<00:04:29.770> kind<00:04:29.920> of<00:04:29.980> like<00:04:30.070> a

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
BTUs per chicken it's kind of like a

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.020 
BTUs per chicken it's kind of like a
small<00:04:30.370> radiator<00:04:31.980> plus<00:04:32.980> also<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.930> chicken<00:04:34.930> the

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
the the excrement from the chicken can

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.940 
the the excrement from the chicken can
provide<00:04:40.330> quite<00:04:40.660> a<00:04:40.720> nice<00:04:40.930> compost<00:04:41.740> for<00:04:41.860> the
