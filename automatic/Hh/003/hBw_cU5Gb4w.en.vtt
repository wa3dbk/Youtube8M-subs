it's<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.500> repetitive<00:02:11.060> most<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.300> missions

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
it's so repetitive most of the missions

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.150 
it's so repetitive most of the missions
are

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
are

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.280 
are
always<00:02:13.490> doing<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.790> same<00:02:14.000> thing<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:14.510> understand

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
always doing the same thing I understand

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.650 
always doing the same thing I understand
that<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.680> game<00:02:15.740> was<00:02:16.070> based<00:02:16.400> on<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:17.240> type<00:02:17.450> of

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
that this game was based on this type of

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.650 
that this game was based on this type of
gameplay<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:19.340> really<00:02:20.000> feel<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.210> they

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
gameplay but I really feel that they

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.010 
gameplay but I really feel that they
could<00:02:20.720> have<00:02:20.900> done<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.050> little<00:02:21.260> better<00:02:23.020> it's

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
could have done a little better it's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.540 
could have done a little better it's
just<00:02:24.230> too<00:02:24.440> repetitive<00:02:24.740> you<00:02:25.250> know<00:02:25.370> always

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
just too repetitive you know always

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.280 
just too repetitive you know always
doing<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.910> same<00:02:26.150> thing<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.720> kind<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.050> guess

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
doing the same thing you kind of guess

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.050 
doing the same thing you kind of guess
all<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.680> time<00:02:27.860> what<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.430> all<00:02:28.700> right<00:02:28.790> what<00:02:29.030> I

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
gameplay let's actually talk about the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.180 
gameplay let's actually talk about the
gameplay<00:02:47.150> alright<00:02:47.870> well<00:02:48.290> what<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.740> think<00:02:48.830> about

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
gameplay alright well what I think about

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.890 
gameplay alright well what I think about
the<00:02:49.280> gameplay<00:02:49.460> is<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.510> game<00:02:50.690> plays

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
the gameplay is that the game plays

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.120 
the gameplay is that the game plays
awesome<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:52.720> I'm<00:02:53.720> not<00:02:54.050> counting<00:02:54.230> storyline

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
awesome and I'm not counting storyline

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.130 
awesome and I'm not counting storyline
or<00:02:55.160> anything<00:02:55.430> I'm<00:02:55.640> just<00:02:55.790> counting<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:56.300> the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
or anything I'm just counting on the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.740 
or anything I'm just counting on the
killing<00:02:57.560> system<00:02:58.070> how<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.730> feels<00:02:59.360> when<00:02:59.630> you

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
killing system how it feels when you

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.060 
killing system how it feels when you
kill<00:02:59.960> somebody<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:01.130> weapons<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.790> cars

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
kill somebody the weapons the cars

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.140 
kill somebody the weapons the cars
overall<00:03:04.070> it's<00:03:05.030> great<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:05.510> mean<00:03:06.550> every<00:03:07.550> car<00:03:07.820> has

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
overall it's great I mean every car has

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.450 
overall it's great I mean every car has
its<00:03:08.420> different<00:03:08.810> handling<00:03:09.380> so<00:03:09.770> for<00:03:09.950> example<00:03:10.370> at

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
its different handling so for example at

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.640 
its different handling so for example at
the<00:03:10.490> beginning<00:03:10.670> with<00:03:11.510> no<00:03:11.630> spoilers<00:03:12.080> at<00:03:12.560> the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
the beginning with no spoilers at the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.820 
the beginning with no spoilers at the
beginning<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:14.600> will<00:03:14.690> be<00:03:14.810> getting<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.320> taxi

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
beginning you will be getting the taxi

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.090 
beginning you will be getting the taxi
which<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.460> car<00:03:16.670> start<00:03:17.030> off<00:03:17.209> with<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.720> then

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
which is the car start off with and then

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.830 
which is the car start off with and then
I<00:03:19.100> believe<00:03:19.520> whether<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.360> car<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.600> unlock

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
I believe whether the car you unlock

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.290 
I believe whether the car you unlock
next<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.470> like<00:03:22.160> this<00:03:22.340> old<00:03:22.550> muscle<00:03:22.940> car<00:03:23.090> and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
next is like this old muscle car and

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.540 
next is like this old muscle car and
when<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:23.990> get<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:24.770> drive<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.520> car

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
when you get it and you drive the car

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.330 
when you get it and you drive the car
you<00:03:26.540> notice<00:03:26.990> that<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.440> muscle<00:03:27.740> car<00:03:27.890> has<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.040> lot

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
you notice that the muscle car has a lot

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.490 
you notice that the muscle car has a lot
more<00:03:28.370> horsepower<00:03:28.820> so<00:03:29.510> for<00:03:29.870> example<00:03:30.260> when<00:03:30.380> you

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
more horsepower so for example when you

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.070 
more horsepower so for example when you
turn<00:03:30.770> you<00:03:31.130> might<00:03:31.370> do<00:03:31.550> a<00:03:31.580> little<00:03:31.850> drift<00:03:32.270> because

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
turn you might do a little drift because

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.220 
turn you might do a little drift because
the<00:03:33.200> car<00:03:33.380> has<00:03:33.560> more<00:03:33.770> horsepower<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:34.820> I

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
the car has more horsepower and so I

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.500 
the car has more horsepower and so I
really<00:03:36.230> like<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.920> really<00:03:37.610> like<00:03:37.790> cars<00:03:38.120> and

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
really like that I really like cars and

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.260 
really like that I really like cars and
you<00:03:39.020> know<00:03:39.050> for<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.470> game<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:40.160> actually<00:03:40.640> make<00:03:41.090> you

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
you know for a game to actually make you

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.500 
you know for a game to actually make you
feel<00:03:41.720> different<00:03:42.440> in<00:03:42.770> each<00:03:42.890> car<00:03:43.220> it's<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:44.150> really

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
feel different in each car it's a really

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.920 
feel different in each car it's a really
good<00:03:44.660> thing

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
good thing

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.830 
good thing
also<00:03:45.350> weapons<00:03:46.570> there<00:03:47.570> is<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.489> Gatling<00:03:49.489> gun

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
also weapons there is the Gatling gun

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.070 
also weapons there is the Gatling gun
there's<00:03:51.200> missiles<00:03:52.420> like<00:03:53.420> an<00:03:53.570> electricity

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
there's missiles like an electricity

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.930 
there's missiles like an electricity
beam<00:03:54.470> type<00:03:55.130> weapon<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:58.040> believe<00:03:58.400> that's<00:03:58.700> it

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
beam type weapon and I believe that's it

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.729 
beam type weapon and I believe that's it
oh<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.300> also<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.600> flamethrower<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.590> can

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
oh and also a flamethrower you can

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.280 
oh and also a flamethrower you can
upgrade<00:04:00.920> these<00:04:01.310> once<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.090> do<00:04:02.239> upgrade<00:04:02.720> they

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
upgrade these once you do upgrade they

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.140 
upgrade these once you do upgrade they
do<00:04:03.440> get<00:04:03.590> stronger<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.810> also<00:04:06.820> for<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:07.910> laser

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
do get stronger and also for the laser

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.350 
do get stronger and also for the laser
if<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.690> upgrade<00:04:08.840> them<00:04:09.590> all<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:09.860> way<00:04:09.980> up<00:04:10.360> you

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
if you upgrade them all the way up you

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.180 
if you upgrade them all the way up you
end<00:04:11.540> up<00:04:11.690> having<00:04:11.870> two<00:04:12.200> lasers<00:04:12.590> on<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.800> side<00:04:12.980> so

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
end up having two lasers on the side so

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.610 
end up having two lasers on the side so

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.979 
you can shoot two to beam set of one
it's<00:04:16.040> pretty<00:04:16.250> cool

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
it's pretty cool

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.880 
it's pretty cool
other<00:04:18.980> than<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:19.310> like<00:04:19.700> I<00:04:19.820> said<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:20.890> really

this game

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.320 
this game
one<00:04:26.780> thing<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.080> must<00:04:27.230> say<00:04:27.500> though<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:28.460> camera<00:04:29.180> of

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
one thing I must say though a camera of

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.940

this<00:04:29.480> game<00:04:29.690> is<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:29.990> little<00:04:30.350> bit<00:04:30.590> uncomfortable

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
this game is a little bit uncomfortable

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.310 
this game is a little bit uncomfortable
just<00:04:31.850> for<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.060> fact<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.420> the<00:04:32.900> camera<00:04:33.110> is

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
just for the fact that the camera is

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.430 
just for the fact that the camera is
like<00:04:33.560> if<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.460> guys<00:04:34.640> ever<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.510> don't<00:04:35.990> think<00:04:36.170> any

like they're so small and you do have a
map

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
on the bottom right but the thing is

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.850 
on the bottom right but the thing is

that if you look at the map you're

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.410 
that if you look at the map you're
always<00:05:04.070> hitting<00:05:04.340> something<00:05:04.850> or<00:05:05.030> you<00:05:05.210> might

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
find it frustrating a little bit I

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.520 
find it frustrating a little bit I
couldn't<00:05:17.480> really<00:05:17.570> see<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.140> every<00:05:18.290> time<00:05:18.440> I

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
look at the map I'll hit something and

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.650 
look at the map I'll hit something and
you<00:05:20.570> know<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:21.800> you<00:05:22.490> could<00:05:22.970> change<00:05:23.150> a<00:05:23.270> camera

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
you know the you could change a camera

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.980 
you know the you could change a camera
but<00:05:23.990> it's<00:05:24.140> really<00:05:24.380> no<00:05:24.800> difference<00:05:25.690> it<00:05:26.690> has<00:05:26.840> the

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
but it's really no difference it has the

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.250 
but it's really no difference it has the
little<00:05:27.340> things<00:05:28.340> are<00:05:28.700> kind<00:05:29.570> of<00:05:29.630> different<00:05:29.840> but

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
little things are kind of different but

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.770 
little things are kind of different but
yeah<00:05:30.770> it's<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.070> same<00:05:31.250> thing<00:05:31.490> so<00:05:31.520> that's<00:05:32.510> one

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
yeah it's the same thing so that's one

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.180 
yeah it's the same thing so that's one
of<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:32.960> things<00:05:33.140> I<00:05:33.260> dislike<00:05:33.470> about<00:05:33.920> the<00:05:34.040> game

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
of the things I dislike about the game

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.100 
of the things I dislike about the game
with<00:05:34.670> the<00:05:34.760> gameplay<00:05:35.060> out<00:05:35.330> of<00:05:35.510> the<00:05:35.630> way<00:05:35.840> now

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
with the gameplay out of the way now

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.590 
with the gameplay out of the way now
let's<00:05:36.140> talk<00:05:36.470> about<00:05:36.530> graphics<00:05:37.370> um<00:05:38.030> I<00:05:38.420> think

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
let's talk about graphics um I think

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.420 
let's talk about graphics um I think
graphics<00:05:39.350> is<00:05:39.500> one<00:05:39.680> of<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.860> best<00:05:40.040> features<00:05:40.220> of

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
graphics is one of the best features of

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.620 
graphics is one of the best features of
this<00:05:40.820> game<00:05:41.410> the<00:05:42.410> weather<00:05:42.650> effects<00:05:43.070> and

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
this game the weather effects and

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.210 
this game the weather effects and
nighttime<00:05:45.610> explosions<00:05:46.610> damage<00:05:48.220> destruction

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
nighttime explosions damage destruction

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.870 
nighttime explosions damage destruction
and<00:05:49.730> just<00:05:50.510> a<00:05:50.600> visual<00:05:50.720> overall<00:05:51.380> it<00:05:52.160> looks<00:05:52.220> great

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
and just a visual overall it looks great

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.190 
and just a visual overall it looks great
I<00:05:53.620> can't<00:05:54.620> complain<00:05:55.330> about<00:05:56.330> anything<00:05:56.780> it's

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
I can't complain about anything it's

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.880 
I can't complain about anything it's
almost<00:05:57.530> like<00:05:57.860> if<00:05:58.160> you<00:05:58.370> took<00:05:59.350> frostbite<00:06:00.350> to

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
almost like if you took frostbite to

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.540 
almost like if you took frostbite to
engine<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.990> you<00:06:02.990> made<00:06:03.200> it<00:06:03.230> into<00:06:03.950> like<00:06:04.220> a

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
engine and you made it into like a

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.940 
engine and you made it into like a
command<00:06:05.420> &amp;<00:06:05.570> Conquer<00:06:05.930> game<00:06:06.170> which<00:06:06.470> there<00:06:06.830> is

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
the trailer it's kind of like that

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.270 
the trailer it's kind of like that
actually<00:06:11.690> looks<00:06:11.930> a<00:06:12.050> lot<00:06:12.230> like<00:06:12.410> that<00:06:12.470> maybe<00:06:12.950> not

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280
