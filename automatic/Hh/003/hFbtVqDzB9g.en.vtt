00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.190
 another flair or something like that 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.129
 little different feeling than if you 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.940
 Now comes to a five star hotel 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.280
 or here everything is really heard 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.200
 seriously and you realize that here so offer 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.850
 monastery still a few trains and s 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.300
 Wanted a lot on materials details 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.280
 respected 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.280
 it is still very nice 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.439
 even a monastery or at least 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.469
 I believe monks in these 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.860
 hallen also endured and I think 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.450
 you can feel that 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.890
 Spaces are still rare 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.960
 have been waiting in modern and 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.580
 finish that is really a 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.910
 Highlight to arrive here and all that 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.250
 to see and yes it is quite something 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.080
 Something else because it is not yours now 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.020
 style therefore a lot of taste that 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.390
 what originally is it is he but 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.640
 the modern in a very own way and 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.270
 wise and I find it very much 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.740
 succeeded and I can only do that 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.740
 congratulate homeowners 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.740
 if ever was a guest always wants 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.580
 welcome and always something 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.580
 to discover something new 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.030
 I think that will be the guests 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.770
 Book here have a lot of fun 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.720
 I was just wondering if I'm here 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.330
 in the morning in time for breakfast 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.590
 would come because you travel so much 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.350
 to look has probably that 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.030
 It takes hours until you land there 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.030
 is where you want to go that's great 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.390
 My sons managed please 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:11.019
 Farmers Museum said that was too much 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.989
 but then his stuff in 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:18.269
 hotels and I have say establish 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:21.910
 Everything is distributed in the other hotels 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.459
 this is very much on print because that 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.349
 theme was so right that we around the 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.980
 milk thoughts from her time in the casting 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.980
