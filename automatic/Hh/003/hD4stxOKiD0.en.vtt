a long story lighters 10 you can see I
have<00:00:39.350> three<00:00:40.350> pieces<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.309> datagram<00:00:42.059> which<00:00:42.450> is

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
have three pieces of a datagram which is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.180 
have three pieces of a datagram which is
I<00:00:42.960> believe<00:00:44.780> 1600<00:00:45.780> megahertz<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.590> then<00:00:46.980> two

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
I believe 1600 megahertz and then two

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.470 
I believe 1600 megahertz and then two
pieces<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> Coursera<00:00:48.180> memory<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.530> only

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
pieces of Coursera memory which is only

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.340 
pieces of Coursera memory which is only
13<00:00:51.480> 33mm<00:00:52.170> right<00:00:52.640> each<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.910> two<00:00:54.350> gigabytes

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
13 33mm right each one is two gigabytes

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.790 
13 33mm right each one is two gigabytes
I<00:00:56.420> don't<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> slot<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> have

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
I don't have a slot here because I have

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.760 
I don't have a slot here because I have
two<00:00:59.129> sets<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.120> RAM<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.199> comes<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.590> three

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
two sets of RAM that comes in three

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.210 
two sets of RAM that comes in three
pieces<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.850> two<00:01:03.170> channels

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
pieces and I have to have two channels

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.010 
pieces and I have to have two channels
come<00:01:05.220> together<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> last<00:01:06.540> chapels

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
come together and then the last chapels

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.480 
come together and then the last chapels
log<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.950> can't<00:01:08.189> have<00:01:08.310> two

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
log and out because you can't have two

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.570 
log and out because you can't have two
different<00:01:08.729> brands<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.330> join<00:01:09.510> speeds<00:01:10.580> doesn't

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
different brands to join speeds doesn't

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.640 
different brands to join speeds doesn't
work<00:01:11.729> too<00:01:11.939> well<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.510> then<00:01:12.630> i<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> nvidia

hurts out of this processor and cooling
setup<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:35.960> honestly<00:04:36.960> don't<00:04:37.740> have<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.190> best

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
setup I honestly don't have the best

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.640 
setup I honestly don't have the best
overclock<00:04:38.789> settings<00:04:39.180> in<00:04:39.270> there<00:04:39.419> they<00:04:40.080> but

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
overclock settings in there they but

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.070 
overclock settings in there they but
it's<00:04:40.800> stable<00:04:41.370> like<00:04:41.669> this<00:04:41.880> so<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.720> fan<00:04:42.930> that

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
it's stable like this so the fan that

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.340 
it's stable like this so the fan that
actually<00:04:43.620> came<00:04:43.830> originally<00:04:44.870> in<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.050> back<00:04:46.199> of

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
actually came originally in the back of

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.379 
actually came originally in the back of
the<00:04:46.440> case<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:46.860> now<00:04:47.010> in<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.370> side<00:04:47.639> because<00:04:48.120> the

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
the case is now in the side because the

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.529 
the case is now in the side because the
fan<00:04:48.690> from<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.020> corsair<00:04:49.669> h50<00:04:50.669> is<00:04:51.090> in<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.389> back

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
fan from the corsair h50 is in the back

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:58.480 
fan from the corsair h50 is in the back
now<00:04:51.810> with<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.080> radiator<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.740> do<00:04:55.800> like<00:04:56.280> the
