00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello girls we find ourselves 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.859
 today for a new video in 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 a very very short tutorial that I was 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.730
 asked by email to learn well 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.139
 love her nails then it was fine 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.550
 I had to shorten house 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.870
 the one that was really becoming very very 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.670
 long I'm going to show you how I 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.139
 first seen I have a lot of 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.730
 lengths normally it should be better 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.010
 start at the line directly but 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.590
 I took a nail cutter to cut 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 to the maximum because the power supply his death has 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.560
 really really took a lot of time 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.689
 so as you see I go there 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.279
 gently I cut no big part 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.679
 suddenly already because I could too much 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.210
 shorten and after regretting it and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.250
 blow I cut in small pieces for 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.250
 not too traumatized world 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.440
 I believe that when I did the web 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.729
 once I really have big ones so 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.649
 the biggest job I'm going to take 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.270
 a very fine grain nail file 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.670
 I do not advise you to take a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.710
 coarse grain because a big grain already 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.600
 if more done for false nails for 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.229
 file resin nails to this kind 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.850
 of stuff 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.649
 and then when you how are you 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.780
 really attack him so I show you 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.460
 the movement is not limited at all 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.680
 back and forth if you like it invaded and 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.869
 well you're actually going to crack the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.220
 plate of your fingernail in the middle or 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.320
 on the edges and that's how we 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.390
 gets have already split so he 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.030
 really need bed but in a sense I 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.209
 Lime raises the game relies I read even 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.679
 is always like that then in a sense 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.759
 or in the other it does not really 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.679
 really important 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.049
 what it really takes to rise 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.409
 it's up to salim every time and we're going 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.409
 make waves 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.550
 so that's really really nothing 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.930
 complicated every time you me 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.550
 asked a lot of questions about 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.590
 that but at least here you see well the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.330
 the movement I still hope that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.950
 this video will have taught you some 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.480
 some little things even though obviously 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.460
 ball and not very very long without more 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.110
 I spent in accelerated we do not forget 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.310
 obviously after going to wash the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.900
 hands to really remove the whole 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.570
 dust with a small brushard 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.070
 well rub nails etc and finish 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.170
 by nail care and then 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.850
 to lay a base at least and never 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.900
 fights on the nails I make you 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.110
 big kisses and I tell you to very 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.110
 soon
