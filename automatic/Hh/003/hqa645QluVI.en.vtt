00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
muscle is going to be hindered so you

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.850 
muscle is going to be hindered so you

need to have nutrients coming in so
that's<00:03:02.920> why<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.220> can<00:03:03.430> get<00:03:03.580> away<00:03:03.670> with<00:03:03.850> eating

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
that's why you can get away with eating

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
sitting I'm not saying that nonsense but

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.990 
sitting I'm not saying that nonsense but
when<00:03:26.410> you're<00:03:26.560> putting<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:27.160> much<00:03:27.400> protein<00:03:27.640> to

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
when you're putting that much protein to

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.150 
when you're putting that much protein to
your<00:03:28.030> digestive<00:03:28.540> tract<00:03:28.750> initially<00:03:29.530> your<00:03:30.010> body

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
your digestive tract initially your body

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.040 
your digestive tract initially your body
will<00:03:30.310> use<00:03:30.490> a<00:03:30.520> lot<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.820> it<00:03:31.030> but<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.540> also<00:03:31.660> waste

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
will use a lot of it but you also waste

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.380 
will use a lot of it but you also waste
some<00:03:32.800> per<00:03:33.130> small<00:03:33.430> percentage<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.090> as<00:03:34.180> well

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
some per small percentage of it as well

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.850 
some per small percentage of it as well
because<00:03:34.540> now<00:03:34.750> you're<00:03:34.930> taking<00:03:34.990> a<00:03:35.290> mass<00:03:35.620> amount

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
because now you're taking a mass amount

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.770 
because now you're taking a mass amount
and<00:03:36.100> put<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.220> mass<00:03:36.520> amount<00:03:36.700> into<00:03:37.180> your<00:03:37.330> body<00:03:37.510> you

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
and put a mass amount into your body you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.380 
and put a mass amount into your body you
can<00:03:38.230> get<00:03:38.380> away<00:03:38.500> with<00:03:38.860> eating<00:03:39.010> fifty<00:03:39.970> sixty

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
can get away with eating fifty sixty

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.449 
can get away with eating fifty sixty
anyway<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.320> good<00:03:41.440> Mount<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.770> protein<00:03:42.100> per

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
anyway the good Mount of protein per

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.300 
anyway the good Mount of protein per
sitting<00:03:42.990> but<00:03:43.990> then<00:03:44.140> over<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.470> course<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.860> a

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.860 
sitting but then over the course of a
day<00:03:45.459> when<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:45.700> have<00:03:45.970> smaller<00:03:46.390> amounts<00:03:46.720> coming

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
day when you have smaller amounts coming

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.170 
day when you have smaller amounts coming
in<00:03:47.200> your<00:03:48.130> body<00:03:48.250> really<00:03:48.550> use<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.790> majority<00:03:49.150> of

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
in your body really use the majority of

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.610 
in your body really use the majority of
the<00:03:49.270> protein<00:03:49.600> but<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:49.990> much<00:03:50.260> mean<00:03:50.500> you're

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
the protein but that much mean you're

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.550 
the protein but that much mean you're
putting<00:03:50.740> a<00:03:50.860> lot<00:03:51.459> in<00:03:51.700> a<00:03:51.790> meal<00:03:52.050> that's<00:03:53.050> just<00:03:53.350> not

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
putting a lot in a meal that's just not

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.380 
putting a lot in a meal that's just not
optimal<00:03:54.040> for<00:03:54.070> performance<00:03:54.700> it's<00:03:54.790> not<00:03:54.970> awful

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
optimal for performance it's not awful

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.449 
optimal for performance it's not awful
for<00:03:55.600> health<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.320> you<00:03:56.650> can<00:03:56.800> do<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:56.980> one<00:03:57.280> day<00:03:57.430> a

for health so you can do it one day a
week<00:03:57.670> eat<00:03:57.880> one<00:03:58.090> meal<00:03:58.209> a<00:03:58.270> day<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:58.660> you'll<00:03:59.170> see

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
week eat one meal a day and you'll see

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.570 
week eat one meal a day and you'll see
results<00:03:59.740> you'll<00:03:59.860> see<00:03:59.890> improving<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.459> growth

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580
