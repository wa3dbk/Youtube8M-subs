00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
I'm like back in the day I used to do

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.350 
I'm like back in the day I used to do
this<00:05:24.979> so<00:05:25.160> hardcore<00:05:25.460> when<00:05:25.820> like<00:05:25.970> I<00:05:26.060> didn't<00:05:26.270> have

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360
