our new AOS suspension system in front
of<00:00:51.059> me<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.269> particular<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.839> the<00:00:51.929> new<00:00:52.049> forest

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:52.439 
of me in particular is the new forest

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:55.310 
of me in particular is the new forest
pro<00:00:52.680> model<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.939> sensor<00:00:54.329> models<00:00:54.689> all<00:00:54.930> use<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
pro model the sensor models all use the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
pro model the sensor models all use the
same<00:00:55.350> exact<00:00:55.920> suspension<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.549> well<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.210> will

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
same exact suspension as well so we will

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.049 
same exact suspension as well so we will
be<00:00:58.019> reviewing<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.589> and<00:00:58.859> then<00:00:59.159> you<00:00:59.339> can<00:00:59.519> take

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
be reviewing that and then you can take

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.139 
be reviewing that and then you can take
a<00:01:00.089> look<00:01:00.299> at<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.479> rest<00:01:00.659> of<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.839> bike<00:01:01.019> to<00:01:02.149> start

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.710 
deflection but the biggest thing you're
going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.190> notice<00:01:20.399> is<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.000> changed<00:01:21.479> is

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
going to notice is what we changed is

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.680 
going to notice is what we changed is
the<00:01:21.899> new<00:01:22.049> suspension<00:01:22.319> system<00:01:22.909> we've<00:01:23.909> got<00:01:24.299> away

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
the new suspension system we've got away

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.690 
the new suspension system we've got away
from<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.319> traditional<00:01:26.039> independent

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700

from the traditional independent
drivetrain<00:01:27.179> system<00:01:27.690> system<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.979> going

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
drivetrain system system and have going

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.340 
drivetrain system system and have going
towards<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.819> new<00:01:30.000> system<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.690> call<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.049> OS

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
towards a new system that we call a OS

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.940 
towards a new system that we call a OS

or angle optimized suspension big
difference<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.880> there's<00:01:36.450> two

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
difference here is that there's two

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.580 
difference here is that there's two
things<00:01:37.080> it<00:01:38.039> doesn't<00:01:38.220> rely<00:01:38.580> on<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:39.840> bottom

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
things it doesn't rely on a bottom

things it doesn't rely on a bottom
bracket<00:01:40.970> pivot<00:01:41.970> anymore<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:43.140> use<00:01:43.410> something

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
bracket pivot anymore we use something

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.919 
bracket pivot anymore we use something
called<00:01:43.739> the<00:01:43.979> path<00:01:44.280> link<00:01:44.550> which<00:01:45.539> is<00:01:45.660> a<00:01:45.690> piece

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
called the path link which is a piece

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.900 
called the path link which is a piece
that<00:01:45.959> runs<00:01:46.319> up<00:01:46.530> behind<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.610> holds<00:01:47.879> the

the<00:01:53.819> bike<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.989> well<00:01:55.019> as<00:01:55.379> it<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.739> the<00:01:56.610> main<00:01:56.819> pivot

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the bike as well as it is the main pivot

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.440 
the bike as well as it is the main pivot
for<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.599> frame<00:01:58.369> major<00:01:59.369> differences<00:01:59.940> here<00:02:00.239> is

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
for the frame major differences here is

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.449 
for the frame major differences here is
that<00:02:00.629> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.319> see<00:02:01.470> it<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.679> high<00:02:01.950> single

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
that you can see it as a high single

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:03.859 
that you can see it as a high single
pivot<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:03.239> gives<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.539> bike<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.840> really

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
pivot which gives the bike a really

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.469 
pivot which gives the bike a really
great<00:02:04.560> rearward<00:02:05.099> arcing<00:02:05.519> wheel<00:02:05.700> path<00:02:05.970> really

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
great rearward arcing wheel path really

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.440 
great rearward arcing wheel path really
similar<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.200> downhill<00:02:07.800> bike<00:02:08.209> which<00:02:09.209> allows

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
similar to a downhill bike which allows

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.300 
similar to a downhill bike which allows
you<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.780> very<00:02:10.080> great<00:02:10.619> small<00:02:11.039> bump

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
you to have very great small bump

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.580 
you to have very great small bump
compliance<00:02:11.849> as<00:02:12.480> well<00:02:12.750> as<00:02:12.930> when<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.409> hit<00:02:13.560> a

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
compliance as well as when you hit a

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.259 
compliance as well as when you hit a
larger<00:02:13.950> object<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.610> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> move<00:02:14.909> up<00:02:15.150> in

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
larger object it's going to move up in

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.210 
larger object it's going to move up in
the<00:02:15.300> way<00:02:15.540> out<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> object<00:02:16.349> allowing<00:02:17.159> you

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the way out of the object allowing you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.320 
the way out of the object allowing you
to<00:02:17.310> maintain<00:02:17.640> more<00:02:17.879> forward<00:02:18.300> momentum

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
to maintain more forward momentum

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.910 
to maintain more forward momentum
typically<00:02:20.330> though<00:02:20.599> with<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> high<00:02:21.560> single

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
typically though with a high single

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.500 
typically though with a high single
pivot<00:02:22.099> you<00:02:22.370> would<00:02:22.489> have<00:02:22.640> some<00:02:22.879> issues<00:02:23.209> as<00:02:23.480> far

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
pivot you would have some issues as far

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.080 
pivot you would have some issues as far
as<00:02:23.690> teen<00:02:24.650> growth<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.250> things<00:02:25.430> like<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.640> so

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
as teen growth and things like that so

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.300 
as teen growth and things like that so
what<00:02:26.269> we<00:02:26.360> do<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.510> mitigate<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.500> we<00:02:28.099> use

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
what we do to mitigate that is we use

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.759 
what we do to mitigate that is we use
the<00:02:28.849> path<00:02:29.090> link<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:30.110> as<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.440> bike<00:02:30.590> goes

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
the path link so as the bike goes

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.309 
the path link so as the bike goes
through<00:02:30.980> its<00:02:31.099> travel<00:02:31.569> they<00:02:32.569> say<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.989> linkage

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
through its travel they say the linkage

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.030 
through its travel they say the linkage
