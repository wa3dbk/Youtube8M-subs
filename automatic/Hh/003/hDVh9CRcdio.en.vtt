00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:09.467
 Please take a look at the latest eight-stage value-added medium-sized tank - Panther 8.8 

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:12.867
 It has a fast rate of fire, a precise gun and a lot of blood. 

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:15.167
 The closest chariot is the Panther II. 

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:22.633
 Compared to the Panther II, the Panther 8.8 armor is slightly weaker and the top speed is slightly slower, but it is more maneuverable and the main gun is better. 

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:27.967
 Panther 8.8 is equipped with an 8.8 cm L/71 main gun 

00:00:28.067 --> 00:00:33.900
 This main gun is superior to Panther II in terms of rate of fire, accuracy and aiming time. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.867
 An average penetration of 203 mm can damage almost all eighth and ninth enemy vehicles 

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:46.467
 The rate of fire is 8.7 shots per minute, and the average damage is 240 points. 

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:53.067
 Without any other equipment, the damage per minute is 2088 points, all of which is enough for the enemy to sweat! 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.700
 Its turret is faster than the Panther II Schmalturm turret in terms of rotational speed, and almost identical in other respects. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.967
 Both turrets have the same relatively small size and the same armor, with a front face of 120 mm and a side and back of 60 mm. 

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.167
 But don't expect people to aim at the turret 

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:11.500
 The enemy usually concentrates the fire on the body. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.967
 For this chariot, the body armor is a weakness. 

00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:20.233
 For the eighth-order tank, its armor is very weak, only 80 mm on the front, 50 mm on the side and 40 mm on the back. 

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.833
 Inclined 55 degrees on the front slope 

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:27.700
 When frontal crossfire, deploy Panther at a certain angle 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.033
 Remember: its 50 mm side armor has no slope 

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:41.367
 Hide the side behind walls, rocks, garbage dumps and other objects, presenting the front armor at a certain angle to cause a jump 

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:46.667
 Panther 8.8 speed is not very fast compared to other medium tanks 

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:53.300
 It turns faster than the Panther II, but the top speed is only 46 kilometers per hour. 

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:56.400
 So, stay away from those agile enemy tanks. 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.167
 Remember: Panther 8.8 is not suitable for commanding assault, smuggling or fast flank attacks 

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:08.467
 This chariot is ideal for second- or third-line offenses. 

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:12.500
 The German gun's German precision allows players to shoot enemies from a safe distance 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.900
 This gives players a good chance to lead in the number of damage points and the number of enemies destroyed. 

00:02:20.967 --> 00:02:26.067
 This is a support tank with a combat style similar to a fast squad chariot with a turret. 

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:32.167
 This Panther can choose its direction and position, which makes it more suitable for melee advancement. 

00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:36.167
 Once you find the enemy, you can start fighting. 

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:39.400
 Don't let the enemy see your chariot 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.267
 If the situation requires it, the chariot is fast enough to move to other flanks and provide support for the team there. 

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:51.200
 If Panther is discovered by the enemy during the move, it is not a disaster. 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.533
 Its blood volume is comparable to that of a tank, enough to make one or two shots when changing positions. 

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:00.233
 This chariot will not receive preferential treatment when dividing the team. 

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:04.067
 In other words, sometimes you may encounter tenth-order enemies. 

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:06.567
 However, this does not have much impact on the fighting style. 

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:11.767
 In this case, it is useful to bring a dozen APCR shells 

00:03:11.867 --> 00:03:16.933
 Just keep calm and keep shooting, try to find the enemy's weaknesses 

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:22.133
 When you have to, you can blow up the enemy's crawler and let your allies close it. 

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:25.167
 This also gives you points and experience points. 

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:28.200
 No need to equip Panther 8.8 with a separate crew member 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.567
 It is a value-added chariot, and it is most suitable for upgrading the crew members of the German medium-sized tanks without retraining. 

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:42.433
 However, if you decide to come to a Panther 8.8, remember that it can benefit from some common skills of squad chariots and heavy tank crew members. 

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:44.933
 First, the commander’s "sixth sense" 

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:51.167
 For this chariot, once it is discovered, it is extremely important to have the ability to evacuate before being hit by enemy shells. 

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:54.400
 The rest of the team’s crew members need “repair” skills to quickly fix the track. 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.367
 Then you can improve the field of vision: through the commander's "reconnaissance" skills and the radio reporter's "war perception" skills. 

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:05.033
 For the gunner, the "shooter" skill is a good choice and can provide extra power when hitting an enemy. 

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:06.767
 You can choose other skills according to your preferences. 

00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:10.100
 "Brothers" may be useful as a third bonus 

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:13.167
 In terms of equipment, this chariot can be equipped as a sharpshooter! 

00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:21.133
 Vertical stabilizers make it easier to aim, and the bomber and ventilation system can increase the damage per minute to 2400. 

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:29.433
 If you prefer to improve the field of view compared to improving reload time and aiming time, then you need a coated optical sight or binoculars instead of a ventilation system. 

00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:34.633
 For consumables, bring a standard repair kit, first aid kit and fire extinguisher 

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:41.433
 Panther 8.8 is the perfect choice for those who like to keep distance as a sniper and don't like melee. 

00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:46.867
 High precision, high rate of fire and strong armor penetration allow players to resolve enemies from a distance 

00:04:46.967 --> 00:04:52.533
 It can also affect the battle process and gain a lot of experience, points and medals! 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.700
