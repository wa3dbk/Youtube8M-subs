rigged the animation mentor hatch
character<00:00:14.540> when<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.570> first<00:00:15.929> looked<00:00:16.199> at<00:00:16.349> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
character when I first looked at the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.349 
character when I first looked at the
character<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.159> knew<00:00:17.429> was<00:00:17.640> going<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.089> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
character I knew was going to be a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.659 
character I knew was going to be a
difficult<00:00:18.989> challenge<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.489> was

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
difficult challenge and for that I was

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:21.679 
difficult challenge and for that I was
very<00:00:20.909> excited

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
very excited

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.889 
very excited
I<00:00:22.519> approached<00:00:23.519> trickiness<00:00:23.999> character<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:24.899 
I approached trickiness character the

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.359 
I approached trickiness character the
same<00:00:25.079> way<00:00:25.259> I<00:00:25.289> approached<00:00:25.859> any<00:00:26.159> other

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
same way I approached any other

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.210 
same way I approached any other
characters<00:00:26.970> which<00:00:27.659> is<00:00:27.929> not<00:00:28.619> looking<00:00:28.829> at<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
characters which is not looking at the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.909 
characters which is not looking at the
details<00:00:29.609> right<00:00:29.909> away<00:00:30.149> but<00:00:30.419> instead<00:00:30.919> looking

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
details right away but instead looking

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.369 
details right away but instead looking
at<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> main<00:00:32.460> shapes<00:00:32.820> or<00:00:33.149> body<00:00:33.390> parts<00:00:33.809> to

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
at the main shapes or body parts to

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.200 
at the main shapes or body parts to
figure<00:00:34.769> out<00:00:34.920> how<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.340> character<00:00:35.969> would

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
figure out how the character would

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.619 
figure out how the character would
behave<00:00:36.629> and<00:00:36.929> move<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:38.969> case<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
behave and move so in this case I

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.000 
behave and move so in this case I
identified<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.370> back<00:00:41.550> legs<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.780> body<00:00:43.019> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
identified the back legs the body the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.439 
identified the back legs the body the
head<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:45.120> middle<00:00:45.420> legs<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.289> arms<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:47.449> find

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
head the middle legs and the arms I find

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:49.970 
head the middle legs and the arms I find
that<00:00:48.570> when<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.839> break<00:00:49.079> down<00:00:49.109> the<00:00:49.379> character

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that when you break down the character

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.560 
that when you break down the character
like<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.429> it<00:00:50.730> becomes<00:00:51.030> much<00:00:51.359> less

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
like this it becomes much less

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.899 
like this it becomes much less
intimidating<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:53.159> sometimes<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.789> even

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
intimidating and I sometimes I even

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.060 
intimidating and I sometimes I even
schedule<00:00:54.449> my<00:00:54.600> time<00:00:54.629> based<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.499> these<00:00:55.649> main

schedule my time based on these main

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.110 
schedule my time based on these main
shapes<00:00:56.429> that<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> find<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:58.190> also<00:00:59.190> searched<00:00:59.670> for

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
shapes that I find I also searched for

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.720 
shapes that I find I also searched for
breaking<00:01:00.690> points<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> mesh<00:01:01.730> these

breaking points in the mesh these
breaking<00:01:03.149> points<00:01:03.690> are<00:01:03.929> areas<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> mesh

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
when you find him they tell you a lot

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.480 
when you find him they tell you a lot
about<00:01:18.270> flexibility<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.920> type<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> motion

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
about flexibility and the type of motion

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.240 
about flexibility and the type of motion
a<00:01:21.829> perfect<00:01:22.829> example<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.670> hatch<00:01:23.969> is<00:01:24.329> the<00:01:24.570> head<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
a perfect example on hatch is the head I

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.280 
a perfect example on hatch is the head I
noticed<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.579> roll<00:01:26.969> hinge<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.960> told<00:01:28.229> me

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
noticed this roll hinge and that told me

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.350 
noticed this roll hinge and that told me
right<00:01:28.530> away<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> head<00:01:29.610> might<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
right away that the head might have a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.319 
right away that the head might have a
pretty<00:01:31.110> limited<00:01:31.320> range<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.860> motion<00:01:32.070> unless<00:01:32.969> I

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
pretty limited range of motion unless I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.179 
pretty limited range of motion unless I
found<00:01:33.539> some<00:01:33.840> other<00:01:33.960> breaking<00:01:34.530> points<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
found some other breaking points on the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.429 
found some other breaking points on the
neck<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> could<00:01:36.479> use<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.170> add<00:01:37.289> flexibility

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
neck that I could use to add flexibility

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.139 
neck that I could use to add flexibility
since<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.619> was<00:01:40.770> given<00:01:41.070> no<00:01:41.219> design<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.759> tell<00:01:42.000> me

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
since I was given no design to tell me

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.520 
since I was given no design to tell me
how<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.450> character<00:01:42.869> would<00:01:43.020> move<00:01:43.320> or

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
how this character would move or

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.279 
how this character would move or
function<00:01:44.039> I<00:01:44.219> examined<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> body<00:01:45.479> parts<00:01:45.930> one

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
function I examined the body parts one

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.709 
function I examined the body parts one
by<00:01:46.469> one<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.340> see<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> geometry<00:01:48.060> told<00:01:48.600> me

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
by one to see if the geometry told me

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.300 
by one to see if the geometry told me
something<00:01:49.609> for<00:01:50.609> example<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.570> back<00:01:51.780> legs

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
something for example the back legs

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.219 
something for example the back legs
resemble<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.460> quadruple<00:01:54.030> leg<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> knew<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
resemble a quadruple leg so I knew the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.069 
resemble a quadruple leg so I knew the
approach<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.740> use<00:01:55.770> there<00:01:56.189> all<00:01:57.179> the<00:01:57.630> Pistons

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
approach to use there all the Pistons

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
approach to use there all the Pistons
inside<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.950> rear<00:01:59.130> leg<00:01:59.429> were<00:01:59.670> pretty

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
inside the rear leg were pretty

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.880 
inside the rear leg were pretty
straightforward<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.859> how

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
straightforward to know we know how

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.490 
straightforward to know we know how
would<00:02:02.159> aim<00:02:02.399> how<00:02:02.640> they<00:02:02.880> moved<00:02:03.200> how<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.380> would

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
would aim how they moved how they would

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.279 
would aim how they moved how they would
move<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> final<00:02:06.869> rig<00:02:07.140> they

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
move and and in the final rig they

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.350 
move and and in the final rig they
behave<00:02:07.590> completely<00:02:08.220> automatically<00:02:08.759> except

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
behave completely automatically except

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.800 
behave completely automatically except
for<00:02:09.540> a<00:02:09.570> couple<00:02:09.870> of<00:02:09.930> areas<00:02:11.570> breaking<00:02:12.570> down<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
for a couple of areas breaking down a

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.630 
for a couple of areas breaking down a
carrot<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.530> mechanical<00:02:14.040> character

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
carrot and mechanical character

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.820 
carrot and mechanical character
is<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.210> general<00:02:15.420> easier<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.260> figure<00:02:16.470> out<00:02:16.650> than

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
is in general easier to figure out than

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.580 
is in general easier to figure out than
an<00:02:17.280> organic<00:02:17.730> character<00:02:18.180> an<00:02:18.590> organic

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
an organic character an organic

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.120 
an organic character an organic
character<00:02:20.040> has<00:02:20.370> usually<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.880> soul<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:22.130> this

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
character has usually a soul so this

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.270 
character has usually a soul so this
character<00:02:23.610> could<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.770> wide<00:02:25.770> variety<00:02:26.250> of

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
character could have a wide variety of

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.660 
character could have a wide variety of
expressions<00:02:26.940> motions<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.170> flexibility<00:02:28.920> so

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
expressions motions and flexibility so

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.730 
expressions motions and flexibility so
in<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.970> case<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.420> really<00:02:30.870> helps<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.380> know<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
in this case it really helps to know the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.820 
in this case it really helps to know the
personality<00:02:32.580> or<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.690> use<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.320> character

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
personality or the use of the character

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.130 
personality or the use of the character
so<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.640> make<00:02:35.790> sure<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.720> know<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:37.110> a

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
so you can make sure you know to be a

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.199 
so you can make sure you know to be a
little<00:02:37.350> bit<00:02:37.530> biased<00:02:37.770> towards<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.060> just

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
little bit biased towards that but just

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.390 
little bit biased towards that but just
a<00:02:39.390> little<00:02:39.690> bit<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.560> still<00:02:41.040> want<00:02:41.070> to

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
a little bit because you still want to

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.040 
a little bit because you still want to
account<00:02:41.670> for<00:02:41.940> as<00:02:42.090> many<00:02:42.300> situations<00:02:42.540> as

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
account for as many situations as

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.140 
account for as many situations as
possible
