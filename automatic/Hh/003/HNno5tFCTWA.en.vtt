[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:26.026
We've lived here for seven years,
but we've never been to the festival.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.150
So this was our first time.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.990
We have just been having so much
fun with the crafting options

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.470
for duct tape, and think it's a
phenomenal, accessible opportunity.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.530
And the parade and the festival
just brings it all together,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.074
and a lot of inspiration
for a lot of kids.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:45.502

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.787
What's your favorite
part about the festival?

00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:55.787
Probably seeing all the flouts out
of duct tape-- like all the duct tape

00:00:55.787 --> 00:00:57.030
floats and everything.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.842
They were really cool.

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:03.702
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:04.674 --> 00:01:08.240
You can do pretty much anything
with it, whether that's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.810
augmenting an original structure or
making sculpture, which I have done.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.810
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.024
You can do so much with it nowadays
because they have them in colors.

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:26.021
I like the purple.

00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:27.430
Yeah, the blue.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.533
I really like the digital camo.

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.011
I like the tie-dye.

00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:32.993
Yeah, the new one.

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.466
It's fun.

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:39.376
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:54.106
Well, when it comes to duct tape,
I think this is year number five.

00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:57.670
The crowd's outstanding, and
just the statues and the parade

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.470
are just phenomenal.
