the<00:00:27.980> biggest<00:00:28.190> challenge<00:00:28.700> was<00:00:28.820> studying<00:00:29.120> at

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
the biggest challenge was studying at

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.300 
the biggest challenge was studying at
the<00:00:29.270> hub<00:00:29.510> was<00:00:29.930> detectable<00:00:30.530> without<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.100> clear

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
the hub was detectable without the clear

obviously<00:00:40.070> you<00:00:40.160> can't<00:00:40.370> study<00:00:40.520> 15<00:00:40.910> 1/2<00:00:41.150> hours

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
obviously you can't study 15 1/2 hours

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.119 
obviously you can't study 15 1/2 hours
straight<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:41.900> if<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.290> brakes<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:42.830> have<00:00:42.980> to

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
straight so if the brakes you have to

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.950 
straight so if the brakes you have to
have<00:00:43.309> you'd<00:00:43.910> end<00:00:44.210> up<00:00:44.330> will<00:00:44.510> get<00:00:44.720> their<00:00:44.840> own

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
have you'd end up will get their own

have you'd end up will get their own
four<00:00:45.200> and<00:00:45.290> a<00:00:45.320> half<00:00:45.350> hours<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:45.830> teaching<00:00:46.160> time

four and a half hours of teaching time

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.160 
four and a half hours of teaching time
which<00:00:47.059> is<00:00:47.180> a<00:00:47.270> lot<00:00:47.450> less<00:00:47.629> than<00:00:47.660> what<00:00:47.989> you<00:00:48.140> would

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
which is a lot less than what you would

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.860 
which is a lot less than what you would
at<00:00:48.440> school<00:00:48.710> or<00:00:48.980> if<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:49.309> were<00:00:49.400> at<00:00:49.520> college<00:00:49.879> the

clear and I think again just amplifies

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.330 
clear and I think again just amplifies
the<00:03:16.440> fact<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.920> help<00:03:17.099> are<00:03:17.220> not
