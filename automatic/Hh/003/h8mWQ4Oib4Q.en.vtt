00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 hello to all these guys 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.140
 acquired in are today for a 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.910
 little true video show flank that will 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.950
 opportunity and many of the three years of 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.780
 this one so the opportunity also you have 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.670
 already since yesterday pull and well boosted 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.830
 you reserved for intellectuals are going 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.839
 finally your dishes an exile to the gold mines 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.480
 and you extract tournament for a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.760
 only I like for seven days 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.830
 it was not beautiful me I think 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.449
 this beautiful but there is not everything 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.359
 the question beats birthday that geof 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.050
 clan in passing but this is not the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.730
 the whole question 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.009
 as you could see in the title and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.020
 well there is a reshuffle as to the bx 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.550
 team since indeed we are 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.460
 currently in a period 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.120
 inactivity of some members 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.469
 so we're there fourteen people who 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.690
 are green in the clan to make a 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.640
 war on 49 members 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.200
 so that's not a lot of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 wish I decided to make a 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.680
 household their inactive or 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.940
 inactive seedlings so people who 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.710
 just come to make their attack 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.000
 reap their resources and either do not 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.160
 to speak in the clan is not to invest 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.949
 and well in the exp of the clan and so for 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.359
 do it well you're going to have to 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.559
 to make up your seats but how do we 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.090
 makes room for active people 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.810
 and quite simply by removing the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.670
 people who are not necessarily then of 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.200
 this fact is good for precisely doing 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.700
 places there is a clan war that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.759
 is starting 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.590
 so at the time I tell you that it is 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.909
 22h28 the clan war or even 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.409
 take a moment to get started 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.909
 but what will change once 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.470
 that will be completed well the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.210
 people who will not attack or 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.939
 pretended to attack to say but 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.549
 I had attacked and well will be everything 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.720
 simply excluded from the clan and after that the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.400
 clan will change ie that the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.200
 prerequisites already will change ie 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.390
 that well there will be no more need 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.700
 just look at cabbage shows 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.150
 of the stolen 100 million euros this is 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.800
 to remove it will still be necessary 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.420
 to be level 80 to keep everything 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.650
 simply a balancing ie 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.360
 than at the level of clan wars if we 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.950
 has levels a little too disparate 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.140
 so they really have gone too far 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.430
 it's going to fuck the brothel when we tried 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.050
 to find a war while 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.270
 keep level 80 that's fine 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.680
 try to keep something 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.540
 homogeneous is much simpler 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.630
 just found wars of clans 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.880
 next to that the 1800 trophy go down 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.860
 also we go down on 1600 trophy that 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.360
 allow a lot more people and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.040
 good to have access to the clans and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.160
 maybe motivated what was still 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.080
 a nearly thousand cases it was 1600 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.670
 trophy is close to level 80 but who 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.709
 was not 100 million and well everything 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.959
 just xp a little bit for 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.640
 just be able to go back so that's it 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.200
 it's at the level of finally has 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.670
 pre-requisites there are also the changes 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.989
 at the level of the Regulation since the 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.760
 clan wars are in quotation marks 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.320
 mandatory that is to say that you 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.370
 can still be vetoed if you 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.650
 do not want to make clan cases 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.640
 there is no problem that it is normal 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.300
 there are times even you can not be 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.709
 there etc 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.780
 but since clan wars are a 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.790
 little more systematic and well you will have 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.110
 the right to three veto in a row that is to 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.610
 say that from three pits had 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.870
 been red in a row 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.250
 I say in a row you could 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.040
 to be once red all do it and 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.600
 red twice all do it then 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.769
 once red it's 4 but you 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.150
 can still do it since you 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.250
 have passed three red in a row 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.299
 so from that moment on and you 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.130
 can do one out of two for example 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.700
 and well from that moment you 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.790
 have the right to do 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.220
 3 finally at the end of the third 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.630
 you will be ruled out just everything 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.340
 simply of life esteem for them and 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.900
 the place and well to someone else 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.760
 since I have a lot of requests in 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.120
 the comments and in the mp especially 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.950
 the mp 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.269
 to join the clan and so that's the 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.980
 way and well the simplest to do 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.420
 turn the limbs that are not there 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.680
 so I say not a deserving members 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.599
 who is there who does these wars etc 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.340
 there is no reason they leave it 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.090
 there's no reason it's from a 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.489
 any way 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.810
 and well excluded to make room there 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.010
 on because also members who are 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.690
 there who make their wars etc 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.950
 there are not these, they are members of aby 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.090
 if they are members of the victim I am 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.430
 not someone who voluntarily leaves 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.510
 all too often except when I get annoyed 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.790
 a lot too much but it's pretty much 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.590
 never happened in the victim so I 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.450
 see why this would happen and well 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.700
 now 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.519
 So that was good and at the 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.709
 regulation at the level of the prerequisites which 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.030
 have changed so well so you 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.920
 okay be able once the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.540
 war will be over and come well 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.340
 take advantage of the places that have become liberated 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.299
 so their noses 47,50 because an agreement 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.519
 were scared they went away thoroughly they 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.319
 saw the they saw my messages they have 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.030
 fucked it's good I'm firing 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.280
 I like to do good anyway I 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.229
 do not wars I'm grilled but 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.570
 it does not matter so you'll be able to 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.760
 come and enjoy the places that have 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.470
 released and precisely the prerequisites that 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.720
 will have refined 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.160
 then the prerequisites will change from 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.840
 well from the moment the war would have 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.810
 will have been found I do not think they 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.550
 have still been found name has not 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.710
 still been found then me if I can 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.330
 give you some advice it was waiting 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.069
 23 hours if you are motivated 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.539
 and you look in the clan this is the 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.479
 description also changed the members 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.439
 have moved and 6 to 23 hours and well you 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.810
 are tired of caregivers video 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:52.340
 better or do something else 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.530

 so open to more people 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.560
 I hope I have not forgotten anything 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.879
