send well over this we scanned them in
and<00:01:19.800> then<00:01:20.510> print<00:01:21.510> them<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.350> be

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and then print them out so that can be

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
inked by Andrew my job is to go over the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.640 
inked by Andrew my job is to go over the
top<00:01:27.690> of<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:29.700> lines<00:01:29.910> and<00:01:30.530> tighten<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.620> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
top of the lines and tighten all the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.150 
top of the lines and tighten all the
ships<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.370> and<00:01:33.350> second<00:01:34.350> thin<00:01:34.590> lines<00:01:34.890> out

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.290 
ships in and second thin lines out
depending<00:01:35.730> on<00:01:36.140> high<00:01:37.460> defined<00:01:38.460> each<00:01:38.820> part<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
depending on high defined each part is

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.550 
depending on high defined each part is
metal<00:01:39.600> look<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.540> when<00:01:43.320> we've<00:01:43.470> got<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
metal look so when we've got then the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.620 
metal look so when we've got then the
ink<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.010> under<00:01:47.520> layer<00:01:47.640> pencils<00:01:48.300> that's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
ink and the under layer pencils that's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.420 
ink and the under layer pencils that's
when<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.110> start<00:01:49.170> coloring<00:01:50.040> underneath

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
when you can start coloring underneath

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.080 
when you can start coloring underneath
and<00:01:51.300> I<00:01:52.140> would<00:01:52.470> start<00:01:52.830> by<00:01:53.160> underlay<00:01:53.940> on

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and I would start by underlay on

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.430 
and I would start by underlay on
different<00:01:54.450> textures<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.640> would<00:01:56.850> underlay

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
different textures so I would underlay

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.780 
different textures so I would underlay
all<00:01:58.440> these<00:01:58.770> different<00:01:59.010> sections<00:01:59.580> and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
all these different sections and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.850 
all these different sections and
obviously<00:02:00.150> from<00:02:00.510> my<00:02:00.780> highlight<00:02:01.500> different

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
obviously from my highlight different

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.720 
obviously from my highlight different
areas<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.310> darkened<00:02:02.700> down<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.480> then

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
areas and darkened down and then

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.600 
areas and darkened down and then
the<00:02:05.450> final<00:02:05.810> part<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.200> process<00:02:06.410> is<00:02:06.920> the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
the final part of the process is the

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.470 
the final part of the process is the
latter<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:10.340> do<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.610> latter<00:02:10.790> and<00:02:11.000> basically

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
latter so to do the latter and basically

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.570 
latter so to do the latter and basically
what<00:02:11.750> we<00:02:11.930> do<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.590> would<00:02:12.800> get<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.220> finished

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
what we do is I would get the finished

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.710 
what we do is I would get the finished
colored<00:02:13.940> piece<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:15.860> would<00:02:16.460> put<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.330> text

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
colored piece and I would put the text

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.770 
colored piece and I would put the text
on<00:02:17.960> and<00:02:18.760> try<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.820> put<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.120> text<00:02:20.420> in<00:02:20.540> such<00:02:20.750> a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
on and try and put the text in such a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.420 
on and try and put the text in such a
way<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.320> would<00:02:21.470> flow<00:02:21.740> through<00:02:21.770> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
way that it would flow through the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.290 
way that it would flow through the
artwork<00:02:23.000> once<00:02:23.930> we<00:02:24.110> finish<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.500> ladder<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:24.830> we

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
artwork once we finish the ladder and we

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.060 
artwork once we finish the ladder and we
get<00:02:26.300> all<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.630> files<00:02:26.900> ready<00:02:27.230> for<00:02:27.590> print<00:02:27.860> and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
get all the files ready for print and

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.340 
get all the files ready for print and
send<00:02:28.760> them<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.420> printers<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.110> it's
