00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
playful and the idea that the artist may

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.780 
playful and the idea that the artist may
or<00:01:42.760> may<00:01:42.940> not<00:01:42.970> have<00:01:43.299> known<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:44.430> history<00:01:45.430> behind

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
these particular mass but at the same

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.219 
these particular mass but at the same
time<00:01:48.040> they're<00:01:48.280> inspired<00:01:48.729> by<00:01:49.090> these<00:01:49.330> objects

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
time they're inspired by these objects

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.440

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.179 
appropriation in the art world but that
talk<00:01:56.049> really<00:01:56.320> seems<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.740> be<00:01:56.860> coming<00:01:57.159> from

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
talk really seems to be coming from

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.420 
talk really seems to be coming from
curators<00:01:57.970> art<00:01:58.630> historians<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.710> writers<00:01:59.920> I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
curators art historians and writers I

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.370 
curators art historians and writers I
think<00:02:00.880> artists<00:02:01.210> don't<00:02:01.390> get<00:02:01.570> so<00:02:01.780> hung<00:02:01.810> up<00:02:02.200> on

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
think artists don't get so hung up on

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.109 
think artists don't get so hung up on
the<00:02:02.530> idea<00:02:02.650> of<00:02:02.890> appropriating<00:02:03.580> what<00:02:03.700> we<00:02:03.820> do<00:02:04.000> is

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
the idea of appropriating what we do is

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.969 
the idea of appropriating what we do is
we<00:02:04.240> see<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.780> world<00:02:04.990> we<00:02:05.260> see<00:02:05.470> forms<00:02:05.860> that

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
we see the world we see forms that

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.339 
we see the world we see forms that
inspire<00:02:06.430> us<00:02:06.670> even<00:02:07.240> if<00:02:07.299> they<00:02:07.420> may<00:02:07.630> or<00:02:07.900> may<00:02:08.229> not

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
inspire us even if they may or may not

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.990 
inspire us even if they may or may not
be<00:02:08.500> from<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.679> culture<00:02:09.099> that<00:02:09.250> we're<00:02:09.399> from<00:02:09.670> and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
be from the culture that we're from and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.690 
be from the culture that we're from and
this<00:02:10.689> whole<00:02:10.869> idea<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.409> we<00:02:12.220> should<00:02:12.430> have<00:02:12.610> to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
this whole idea that we should have to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.000 
this whole idea that we should have to
ask<00:02:12.879> permission<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.989> be<00:02:14.230> inspired<00:02:14.620> by<00:02:14.769> their

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
ask permission to be inspired by their

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.220 
ask permission to be inspired by their
cultures<00:02:15.489> where<00:02:16.299> are<00:02:16.569> we<00:02:16.659> supposed<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:17.080> ask

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
cultures where are we supposed to ask

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.100 
cultures where are we supposed to ask
this<00:02:17.500> permission<00:02:17.830> who<00:02:18.069> gives<00:02:18.310> us<00:02:18.459> permission

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
this permission who gives us permission

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.630 
this permission who gives us permission
and<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.500> think<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.860> artists<00:02:20.160> should<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.400> free

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
and I think that artists should be free

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.430 
and I think that artists should be free
to<00:02:20.820> look<00:02:20.940> around<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.540> see<00:02:21.810> things<00:02:22.200> in<00:02:22.350> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
to look around and see things in the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.320 
to look around and see things in the
world<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.830> be<00:02:22.950> inspired<00:02:23.370> by<00:02:23.580> them<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.970> that's

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
world and be inspired by them and that's

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.850 
world and be inspired by them and that's
why<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> love<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.810> photograph<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.560> I've<00:02:25.830> just

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
why I love this photograph is I've just

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.370 
why I love this photograph is I've just
loved<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.430> playfulness<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.380> childlike

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
loved the playfulness the childlike

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.260 
loved the playfulness the childlike
quality<00:02:28.560> where<00:02:29.340> two<00:02:29.550> artists<00:02:29.970> are<00:02:30.060> just

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
quality where two artists are just

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.390 
quality where two artists are just
sitting<00:02:30.480> there<00:02:30.660> talking<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.740> reacting<00:02:32.370> to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
sitting there talking and reacting to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.800 
sitting there talking and reacting to
the<00:02:32.640> forms<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.420> it's<00:02:34.140> one<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.320> my<00:02:34.410> favorites

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
the forms and it's one of my favorites

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.660 
the forms and it's one of my favorites
as<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.930> grew<00:02:37.140> up<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:38.070> started<00:02:38.340> looking<00:02:38.460> at

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
as I grew up and I started looking at

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.430 
as I grew up and I started looking at
African<00:02:39.060> art<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.270> noticed<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.840> some<00:02:40.080> pieces

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
African art I noticed that some pieces

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.910 
African art I noticed that some pieces
had<00:02:40.800> hair<00:02:41.660> incorporated<00:02:42.660> into<00:02:42.870> them<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
had hair incorporated into them and the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.680 
had hair incorporated into them and the
texture<00:02:44.400> was<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.820> way<00:02:44.940> my<00:02:45.150> natural<00:02:45.540> hair

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
texture was the way my natural hair

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.540 
texture was the way my natural hair
actually<00:02:46.110> looked<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.650> all<00:02:47.040> those<00:02:47.220> years<00:02:47.400> I

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
actually looked and all those years I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.770 
actually looked and all those years I
had<00:02:47.580> been<00:02:47.700> getting<00:02:47.940> my<00:02:48.120> hair<00:02:48.360> straightened

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
had been getting my hair straightened

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.140 
had been getting my hair straightened
and<00:02:49.080> permed<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.490> when<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.700> started

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
and permed and so when I started

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.580 
and permed and so when I started
creating<00:02:51.300> these<00:02:51.600> pieces<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.110> were<00:02:52.200> inspired

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
creating these pieces that were inspired

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.680 
creating these pieces that were inspired
by<00:02:52.680> African<00:02:53.220> art<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.640> noticed<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.390> would<00:02:54.540> go

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
by African art I noticed that I would go

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.240 
by African art I noticed that I would go
to<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.959> brush<00:02:55.170> or<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.440> comb<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.890> pull<00:02:56.070> my<00:02:56.220> own

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
to the brush or the comb and pull my own

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.430 
to the brush or the comb and pull my own
hair<00:02:56.670> out<00:02:56.820> which<00:02:57.390> had<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> straight<00:02:57.989> texture

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
hair out which had a straight texture

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.410 
hair out which had a straight texture
because<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:58.980> perm<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.520> I<00:02:59.850> would<00:03:00.000> wet<00:03:00.239> it

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
because of the perm and I would wet it

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.720 
because of the perm and I would wet it
and<00:03:00.570> then<00:03:01.140> roll<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.620> my<00:03:01.770> palms<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.489> get<00:03:02.610> it

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
and then roll it in my palms to get it

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.190 
and then roll it in my palms to get it
back<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.000> its<00:03:03.150> natural<00:03:03.300> state<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.080> then

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
back to its natural state and then

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.620 
back to its natural state and then
actually<00:03:04.680> attach<00:03:05.010> these<00:03:05.580> balls<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.090> hair<00:03:06.360> and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
actually attach these balls of hair and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.570 
actually attach these balls of hair and
to<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.900> art<00:03:07.230> pieces<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.739> I<00:03:07.770> was<00:03:07.950> making<00:03:08.190> and

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
to the art pieces that I was making and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.420 
to the art pieces that I was making and
then<00:03:09.030> one<00:03:09.209> day<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.870> kind<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.200> hit<00:03:10.380> me<00:03:10.410> if<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:11.160> find

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
then one day it kind of hit me if I find

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.340 
then one day it kind of hit me if I find
my<00:03:11.610> own<00:03:11.760> hair<00:03:12.090> texture<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:12.780> beautiful<00:03:13.200> and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
my own hair texture so beautiful and

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.440 
my own hair texture so beautiful and
natural<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:14.040> I'm<00:03:14.430> using<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.910> in<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.090> piece<00:03:15.270> in

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
natural and I'm using it in the piece in

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.300 
natural and I'm using it in the piece in
this<00:03:15.570> way<00:03:15.750> why<00:03:16.290> don't<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.560> just<00:03:16.739> let<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:16.980> be<00:03:17.160> that

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
this way why don't I just let it be that

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.070 
this way why don't I just let it be that
way<00:03:17.489> on<00:03:17.640> my<00:03:17.790> head<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.270> at<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.570> point<00:03:18.900> I

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
way on my head and at that point I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.650 
way on my head and at that point I
stopped<00:03:19.590> perming<00:03:20.070> my<00:03:20.190> hair<00:03:20.430> for<00:03:20.610> good<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.090> I

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
stopped perming my hair for good and I

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:31.040 
stopped perming my hair for good and I
let<00:03:21.900> my<00:03:22.080> hair<00:03:22.380> lock

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050
