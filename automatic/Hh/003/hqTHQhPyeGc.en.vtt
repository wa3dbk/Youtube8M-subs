00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
the other set by the way a forklift okay

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.850 
the other set by the way a forklift okay
it's<00:03:42.330> not<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.960> forklift<00:03:43.320> that<00:03:43.470> would<00:03:43.740> be

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
it's not just a forklift that would be

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.560 
it's not just a forklift that would be
really<00:03:44.220> boring<00:03:44.400> especially<00:03:45.060> for<00:03:45.240> a<00:03:45.270> military

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
really boring especially for a military

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.840 
really boring especially for a military
said<00:03:47.300> there's<00:03:48.300> also<00:03:48.510> cake<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.670> now<00:03:50.820> have

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
seen the flaw of this tag the gun will

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.900 
seen the flaw of this tag the gun will
always<00:03:55.380> fall<00:03:55.620> off<00:03:55.800> I<00:03:56.010> have<00:03:56.220> not<00:03:56.490> figured<00:03:56.730> out

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
always fall off I have not figured out

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.120 
always fall off I have not figured out
how<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.030> make<00:03:57.240> it<00:03:57.390> not<00:03:57.660> fall<00:03:57.960> off<00:03:57.990> well<00:03:58.980> then

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
how to make it not fall off well then

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.530 
how to make it not fall off well then
that<00:03:59.280> it's<00:03:59.430> actually<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.760> really<00:03:59.940> nice<00:04:00.180> tank

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
that it's actually a really nice tank

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.090 
that it's actually a really nice tank
it's<00:04:00.750> supposed<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.140> be<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.320> Sherman<00:04:01.680> tank<00:04:01.740> and

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100

virtually identical which means it's not

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
very good although many parts of it are

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.660 
very good although many parts of it are
pretty<00:04:25.440> sturdy<00:04:25.800> it's<00:04:26.040> just<00:04:26.280> whenever<00:04:26.490> they

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
pretty sturdy it's just whenever they

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.600 
pretty sturdy it's just whenever they
try<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:26.940> do<00:04:27.120> something<00:04:27.390> like<00:04:27.420> this<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.960> hang

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
try and do something like this and hang

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.270 
try and do something like this and hang
stuff<00:04:29.610> off<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.970> sides<00:04:30.210> or<00:04:30.600> whatever<00:04:31.280> they

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
stuff off the sides or whatever they

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.370 
stuff off the sides or whatever they
just<00:04:32.670> just<00:04:33.210> falls<00:04:33.420> off<00:04:33.570> it's<00:04:33.840> not<00:04:34.020> very<00:04:34.230> good

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
just just falls off it's not very good

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.500 
just just falls off it's not very good
although<00:04:35.310> it<00:04:35.670> is<00:04:35.790> acceptable<00:04:36.270> it's

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
although it is acceptable it's

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.970 
although it is acceptable it's
completely<00:04:36.840> passively<00:04:37.260> put<00:04:37.530> some<00:04:37.650> sticky

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
completely passively put some sticky

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.500 
completely passively put some sticky
tack<00:04:38.190> on<00:04:38.370> there<00:04:38.550> stays<00:04:38.850> right<00:04:39.030> apart<00:04:39.360> or<00:04:39.480> you

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
tack on there stays right apart or you

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.970 
tack on there stays right apart or you
can<00:04:39.660> build<00:04:39.930> something<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.350> isn't<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.740> tank

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
can build something that isn't the tank

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.040 
can build something that isn't the tank
with<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.280> or<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.550> guess<00:04:41.790> or<00:04:41.940> something<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.450> don't

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
with it or I guess or something I don't

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.260 
with it or I guess or something I don't
know<00:04:43.170> why<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.440> wouldn't<00:04:43.740> know<00:04:44.460> one<00:04:44.670> tank<00:04:45.000> but

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
know why you wouldn't know one tank but

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.160 
know why you wouldn't know one tank but
and<00:04:45.980> yeah<00:04:47.420> so<00:04:48.420> I'm<00:04:48.540> not<00:04:48.630> even<00:04:48.870> gonna<00:04:48.960> bother

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
and yeah so I'm not even gonna bother

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.150 
and yeah so I'm not even gonna bother
reviewing<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.830> other<00:04:49.980> one<00:04:50.100> it's<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.300> same

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
reviewing the other one it's the same

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.190 
reviewing the other one it's the same
this<00:04:53.160> is<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.430> same<00:04:53.850> except<00:04:54.360> in<00:04:54.480> tank<00:04:54.750> form<00:04:55.080> it

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
this is the same except in tank form it

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.980 
this is the same except in tank form it
doesn't<00:04:55.470> even<00:04:55.560> roll<00:04:55.920> very<00:04:56.220> well<00:04:56.780> although<00:04:57.780> it

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
doesn't even roll very well although it

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.409 
doesn't even roll very well although it
does<00:04:58.170> roll<00:04:58.470> which<00:04:58.680> is<00:04:58.710> better<00:04:58.979> than<00:04:59.419> some

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
does roll which is better than some

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.900 
does roll which is better than some
other<00:05:00.540> tanks<00:05:00.990> it's<00:05:01.560> but<00:05:01.770> it's<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.100> same

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
other tanks it's but it's the same

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.670 
other tanks it's but it's the same
