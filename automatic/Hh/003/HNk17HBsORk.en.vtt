00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.840 
or whatnot so they started over there
they<00:01:59.730> left<00:01:59.940> ending<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:02.010> left<00:02:02.280> side<00:02:02.490> then

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
they left ending on the left side then

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.490 
they left ending on the left side then
on<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.120> right<00:02:03.270> side<00:02:03.540> which<00:02:03.720> was<00:02:03.870> my<00:02:04.050> side<00:02:04.320> the
