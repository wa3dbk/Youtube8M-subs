this<00:01:53.030> game<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.390> great<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:53.899> I<00:01:53.990> believe<00:01:54.350> it

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
this game is great and I believe it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.989 
this game is great and I believe it
still<00:01:54.829> would<00:01:55.070> have<00:01:55.100> been<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.310> great<00:01:55.609> game<00:01:55.850> if

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
still would have been a great game if

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.270 
still would have been a great game if

Mario wasn't copy pasted onto it by the
way<00:01:58.520> doesn't<00:01:58.789> look<00:01:59.030> like<00:01:59.179> Mario's<00:01:59.600> giving<00:01:59.899> a

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
way doesn't look like Mario's giving a

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.989 
way doesn't look like Mario's giving a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.740 

in<00:02:19.470> my<00:02:19.770> opinion<00:02:20.130> dr.<00:02:20.670> Mario<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.180> itself<00:02:21.510> can

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
in my opinion dr. Mario in itself can

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.690 
in my opinion dr. Mario in itself can
also<00:02:21.900> be<00:02:22.230> very<00:02:22.470> addicting<00:02:23.130> but<00:02:23.340> not<00:02:23.520> as

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
also be very addicting but not as
