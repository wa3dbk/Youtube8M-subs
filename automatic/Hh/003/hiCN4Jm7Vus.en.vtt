Hello boys and girls, this is Aunt Frenita

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.645
and I have a wonderful story for you called 'A Child Like Me' 

00:00:12.034 --> 00:00:17.097
Today's memory verse is from Luke 2:51 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.468
It says 'Then He went down to Nazareth...and was obedient'

00:00:22.868 --> 00:00:28.960
 The message for today's story is 'we are like Jesus when we obey and help' 

00:00:29.748 --> 00:00:31.794
How do you show someone you love them?

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.537
Do you give them lots of hugs?

00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:36.731
Are you kind to them?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.360
Do you give them presents?

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.148
Do you do what they ask of you?

00:00:43.017 --> 00:00:45.291
Jesus was little just like you 

00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:50.251
He didn't go to nursery school. He stayed home with his mother, Mary 

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:53.942
Everyday, she taught him about God

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.965
She told him stories about Adam and Eve

00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:02.114
Noah and the Ark, David and Goliath 

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:04.571
She taught Him how to pray 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.300
'Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for loving me! Amen' 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.502
Mary, His mother, taught Jesus songs about God, like the ones you learn in Sabbath School
'Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for loving me! Amen' 

00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:17.348
Mary, His mother, taught Jesus songs about God, like the ones you learn in Sabbath School

00:01:18.354 --> 00:01:21.634
Jesus and Mary often went for nature walks

00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:23.862
They listened to the birds sing

00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:27.371
They watched beetles climb over logs 

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:29.760
And spiders spin their webs 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.731
They studied the dew on the grass

00:01:33.234 --> 00:01:35.314
They watched the animals play 

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:39.988
They looked at the change in colors of the sky as the sun set

00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:47.714
As they watched this, Mary told Jesus that God had made the world and everything in it 

00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:51.622
Jesus' family lived in a small house 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.108
but it was clean

00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:56.388
Jesus helped his mother around the house 

00:01:56.605 --> 00:01:58.651
He helped set the table for dinner 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.120
He helped dry the dishes 

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:05.988
He made his bed, He helped Mary make bread 

00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:11.771
Whatever His mother asked Him to do, Jesus did it cheerfully

00:02:12.948 --> 00:02:16.057
Jesus helped his father take care of the animals 

00:02:16.777 --> 00:02:19.382
He fed them and he gave them water 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.491
He helped Joseph fix things too 

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:27.782
When Jesus was older, he helped Joseph in his carpenter shop 

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.851
Jesus was kind to neighbors and their children 

00:02:32.274 --> 00:02:35.714
He was helpful when he saw that someone had a need

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.554
such as helping the grandmother carry her heavy, heavy load of firewood 

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:44.617
or making a sad child laugh 

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:47.771
Jesus had time to play too

00:02:48.662 --> 00:02:52.205
The other boys in his neighborhood liked to play with Him

00:02:52.914 --> 00:02:57.965
When it was time to come in and his mother called Him, Jesus came quickly 

00:02:59.371 --> 00:03:05.188
Every Friday evening, Jesus' family ate a special meal to welcome the Sabbath 

00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:09.325
Jesus helped light the Sabbath candles for their meal 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.222
Then, he listened carefully as Joseph prayed and talked about God 

00:03:15.942 --> 00:03:19.805
On Sabbath, Mary and Joseph took Jesus to church 

00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:24.274
There, He heard the priest read from the books of the Bible 

00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:28.822
In those days, the Bible was written on scrolls 

00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:33.622
A scroll is a rolled up piece of paper with words written on it 

00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:38.480
Jesus listened carefully to the words from the scroll 

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:42.388
He learned the words and could recite them from memory 

00:03:43.337 --> 00:03:45.508
Jesus song sangs while he worked 

00:03:46.217 --> 00:03:50.811
And people were glad to pass by His house because He was always singing 

00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:53.280
He made them feel happy 

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:57.542
but most of all, Jesus made His family happy 

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.182
by obeying and being helpful 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.354
