00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.799
 farmers here from our 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.870
 region exchanged the normal activities of the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.309
 day to day to learn more about 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.929
 green manure 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.420
 this event we follow in 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.160
 reporting from now on 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 cooperative of beekeepers and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 fruit trees from the south to the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.119
 held in early October the first 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.350
 field in the use of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.150
 green adubation 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.460
 the practice is an alternative to using the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.170
 herbicide and contribute to the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.869
 soil improvement 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.520
 this alternative is basically done 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.350
 making oats oats black oats is 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:42.059
 at the end of March 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.920
 decomposition of oats and vetches is the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.110
 ship were together they provide 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.600
 a large amount of fertilizers and knots 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.170
 we did a study we did to determine 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.280
 dry matter and with these studies 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.340
 demonstrated that it is possible to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.920
 recycle around 98 kilos of 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.960
 nitrogen per year if we did this 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.780
 practice normally then a producer 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.540
 it really is an advantageous practice 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.869
 the increase of organic matter or soil 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.189
 more refreshed the recycling of nutrients 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.189
 are some of the advantages of fertilization 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.420
 in addition to contributing to the 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.890
 existence of micro organisms in soil 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.450
 to implement the green stick 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.270
 just chose a property where 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.189
 showed to student farmers 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 how is this type of 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.780
 fertilization and the property chosen was 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.759
 from your sea 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.640
 he is hopeful with this new stage 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.710
 their production of peaches and we will 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.280
 be able to eliminate the emicide and there 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.170
 is improving soil by increasing production 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.329
 reducing costs for us to be able to 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 has a better return on this chain of ps 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.689
 in the end 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.490
 in addition to the rural producers, 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.979
 technical school agriculture course 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.990
 of canguÃ§u could also meet 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.469
 better the reality lived by the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.210
 producers and we were willing to bring 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.189
 the students not only as spectators 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.840
 but also as partners in the organization 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.190
 field day 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.590
 so now the students are 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.260
 experiencing not only the visit in 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.860
 itself as a part of the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.840
 responsible 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.120
 organization is that they will assist with 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.070
 coordinating the schedules will move the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.870
 between the piraja stations 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.250
 practicing a practice they will have in the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.180
 day to day when they graduate with 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.910
 technical right 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.130
 you know what monitoring is, too. 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.990
 the question of the system of 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.240
 fruit fly alert 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.270
 embrapa temperate climate develops a 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.400
 set of measures to reduce pest 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.680
 in the production of fruit we put the eggs 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.060
 inside the fruit can put a two 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.240
 three or more 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.590
 It's on that field day we actually 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.760
 we show what the producer has to 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.040
 to do it right 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.320
 What I saw we recommend that they do 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.220
 this time of year where the population 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.720
 music population is still small 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.090
 capsule will continue the field afternoon 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.340
 in other broadcasting properties 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.060
 useful information for members and 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.860
 also for the whole rural community 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.840
 green manuring is an incentive to 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.940
 life that is not what it is 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.239
 fairly wide in the soil and acts that 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.410
 people is fundamentally dependent on 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.410
 make a sustainable agriculture
