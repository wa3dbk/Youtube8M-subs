will lay and then I don't curl the ends
of<00:01:48.149> course<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.020> pull<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.439> over<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.009> pull<00:01:50.280> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
of course and I pull it over and pull it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.889 
of course and I pull it over and pull it
back<00:01:50.549> over<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> side<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> want<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.750> lay

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
down for some reason I find that that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.050 
down for some reason I find that that
gives<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.840> curls<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.619> dimension<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.850> more
