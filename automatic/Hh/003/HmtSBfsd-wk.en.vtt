of those two you're more comfortable
with<00:00:45.020> flipping<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.140> back<00:00:46.170> over<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.219> sort<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
with flipping it back over I can sort of

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.740 
with flipping it back over I can sort of
just<00:00:47.670> show<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.820> how<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.059> works<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.629> this

just show you how it works you get this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.290 
just show you how it works you get this
nice<00:00:49.129> digital<00:00:50.129> readout<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
nice digital readout here now the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.060 
nice digital readout here now the
simplest<00:00:51.750> thing<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> sort<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> I'm

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
simplest thing you can do is sort of I'm

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.290 
simplest thing you can do is sort of I'm
just<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.370> put<00:00:53.550> some<00:00:53.699> pressure<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.180> here

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
just going to put some pressure on here

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.299 
just going to put some pressure on here
with<00:00:54.449> my<00:00:54.600> arm<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.530> you'll<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.160> gives

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
with my arm and you'll see that it gives

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.209 
with my arm and you'll see that it gives
you<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> nice<00:00:56.699> digital<00:00:57.090> readout<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:58.129> you<00:00:59.129> know

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you a nice digital readout of you know

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.700 
you a nice digital readout of you know
how<00:00:59.489> much<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.879> weighs<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:01.109> we're<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.500> about

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
how much this weighs so we're at about

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.780 
how much this weighs so we're at about
thirty<00:01:01.949> pounds<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.930> scale<00:01:04.260> also<00:01:04.890> can

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
thirty pounds here the scale also can

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.550 
thirty pounds here the scale also can
calculate<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:07.170> body<00:01:07.979> fat<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.229> body<00:01:10.229> water

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
calculate your body fat and body water

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.969 
calculate your body fat and body water
percentage<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.580> muscle<00:01:12.000> mass<00:01:12.119> percentage<00:01:12.979> in

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
percentage and muscle mass percentage in

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.469 
percentage and muscle mass percentage in
order<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.880> need<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> set<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.299> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
order to do that you need to set up a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.749 
order to do that you need to set up a
profile<00:01:16.130> I'll<00:01:17.130> show<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.340> how<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.610> that

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
profile I'll show you how to do that

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.270 
profile I'll show you how to do that
real<00:01:17.970> quick<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.259> use<00:01:19.650> these<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
real quick so if you use these up and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.859 
real quick so if you use these up and
down<00:01:20.490> arrows<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> buttons<00:01:21.750> are

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
down arrows right here the buttons are

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.899 
down arrows right here the buttons are
back<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.100> toggle<00:01:23.520> between<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
back here you can toggle between the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.140 
back here you can toggle between the
four<00:01:24.299> different<00:01:24.890> profiles<00:01:25.890> P<00:01:26.280> zero<00:01:26.580> through<00:01:26.970> P

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
four different profiles P zero through P

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.890 
four different profiles P zero through P
three<00:01:28.250> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.369> hit<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.060> hit<00:01:30.240> set<00:01:30.570> you're

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
three if you hit if you hit set you're

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.510 
three if you hit if you hit set you're
gonna<00:01:30.990> actually<00:01:31.200> use<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.770> see<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.220> P

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
gonna actually use it so you see here P

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.249 
gonna actually use it so you see here P
two<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:34.520> for<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> really<00:01:35.850> giant<00:01:36.390> guy<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.930> was<00:01:37.079> just

sort<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.470> messing<00:01:37.770> around<00:01:37.890> setting<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.460> up

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
sort of messing around setting these up

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.060 
sort of messing around setting these up
but<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.390> customize<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.200> your<00:01:40.650> age

data<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.740> after<00:01:56.100> another<00:01:56.390> I'm<00:01:57.390> not<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:57.689> to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
data one after another I'm not going to

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.969 
data one after another I'm not going to
do<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.930> now<00:01:58.110> because<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.530> would<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
do that now because I would have to

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.120 
do that now because I would have to
stand<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.969> thing<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.979> that's<00:02:01.979> going

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
stand up on this thing and that's going

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.440 
stand up on this thing and that's going
to<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.280> hard<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.549> do<00:02:02.670> while<00:02:02.820> making<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> video

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
but hopefully this is enough information

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.679
