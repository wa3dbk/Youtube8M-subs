soon as you've done all that isn't never
just<00:02:27.580> here<00:02:27.849> and<00:02:28.510> can<00:02:29.140> go<00:02:29.290> up<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.620> four<00:02:29.830> people

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
just here and can go up to four people

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.420 
just here and can go up to four people
as<00:02:30.519> per<00:02:30.730> usual<00:02:31.500> anyway<00:02:32.500> you've<00:02:32.709> got<00:02:32.739> this<00:02:33.099> door

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
as per usual anyway you've got this door

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.460 
as per usual anyway you've got this door
the<00:02:33.670> for<00:02:34.209> XP<00:02:34.629> door

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
the for XP door

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.070 
the for XP door
so<00:02:35.920> here<00:02:36.099> again<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.299> then<00:02:37.599> we<00:02:37.690> just<00:02:37.810> change

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
so here again and then we just change

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.270 
so here again and then we just change
that<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.319> four<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.560> again<00:02:42.430> when<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:43.420> open<00:02:43.750> this

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
that to four so again when you open this

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.740 
that to four so again when you open this
you<00:02:45.280> say<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.549> takes<00:02:45.730> four<00:02:45.940> hours<00:02:45.970> from<00:02:46.299> you<00:02:46.510> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
you say it takes four hours from you the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.660 
you say it takes four hours from you the
doors<00:02:47.200> always<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.920> stay<00:02:48.099> open<00:02:48.250> for

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
doors always to stay open for

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.190 
doors always to stay open for
indefinitely<00:02:49.269> there's<00:02:49.660> no<00:02:49.840> way<00:02:49.989> they<00:02:50.140> can

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
indefinitely there's no way they can

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.160 
indefinitely there's no way they can
shut<00:02:50.590> now<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.430> way<00:02:51.819> I'm<00:02:51.970> planning<00:02:52.390> this<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.840> um

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
shut now the way I'm planning this is um

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.979 
shut now the way I'm planning this is um
when<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.799> comes<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.069> a<00:02:54.099> minecart<00:02:54.610> ride<00:02:54.989> I'm

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
when it comes to a minecart ride I'm

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.319 
when it comes to a minecart ride I'm
having<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.380> minecarts<00:02:57.130> sort<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.760> like<00:02:57.970> this

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
having the minecarts sort of like this

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.850 
having the minecarts sort of like this
in<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.930> way<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.140> guess<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:01.780> this<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:02.079> practically

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
in a way I guess so this is practically

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.369 
in a way I guess so this is practically
you<00:03:03.400> know<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:04.239> Train<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:05.079> how<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.769> spreads

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
you know the Train and how it spreads

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.660 
you know the Train and how it spreads
but<00:03:08.379> if<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.709> I'm<00:03:08.980> trying<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.280> figure<00:03:09.519> out<00:03:09.610> a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
but if you I'm trying to figure out a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.000 
but if you I'm trying to figure out a
way<00:03:09.760> how<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.569> if<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.140> missed<00:03:11.379> a<00:03:11.500> train<00:03:11.739> you're

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
way how to if you missed a train you're

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.610 
way how to if you missed a train you're
stuck<00:03:12.310> in<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.819> one<00:03:13.180> area<00:03:13.510> because<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.200> does<00:03:14.379> go

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
stuck in the one area because it does go

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.080 
stuck in the one area because it does go
to<00:03:14.650> different<00:03:14.890> areas<00:03:15.400> as<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:15.610> see<00:03:15.819> it's<00:03:16.030> a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
to different areas as you see it's a

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.849 
to different areas as you see it's a
tunnel<00:03:16.420> what<00:03:16.510> they<00:03:16.629> go<00:03:16.780> through<00:03:16.810> but<00:03:17.799> I'm

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
tunnel what they go through but I'm

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.020 
tunnel what they go through but I'm
still<00:03:18.100> trying<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.370> figure<00:03:18.549> out<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.900> know<00:03:21.030> how

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
still trying to figure out you know how

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.020 
still trying to figure out you know how
to<00:03:22.090> put<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:22.989> if<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.950> time<00:03:24.190> will<00:03:24.400> start<00:03:24.819> for

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
to put it so if the time will start for

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.670 
to put it so if the time will start for
the<00:03:25.090> Train<00:03:25.359> I'll<00:03:25.600> put<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.750> clock<00:03:26.109> underneath

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
the Train I'll put a clock underneath

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.979 
the Train I'll put a clock underneath
and<00:03:27.310> give<00:03:27.519> it<00:03:27.579> a<00:03:27.609> detector<00:03:28.120> rail<00:03:28.329> which<00:03:28.959> is

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
and give it a detector rail which is

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.930 
and give it a detector rail which is
somewhere<00:03:29.410> around<00:03:29.500> here<00:03:29.709> but<00:03:29.889> this<00:03:30.670> is<00:03:30.819> to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
somewhere around here but this is to

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.030 
somewhere around here but this is to
start<00:03:31.150> off<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.480> train<00:03:31.750> they<00:03:32.260> all<00:03:32.410> go<00:03:32.650> if

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
start off the train they all go if

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.629 
start off the train they all go if
you've<00:03:33.700> missed<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.180> you've<00:03:34.329> missed<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.870> and

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
you've missed it you've missed it and

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.250 
you've missed it you've missed it and
there's<00:03:36.639> a<00:03:36.760> few<00:03:37.030> bugs<00:03:37.269> with<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.630> I<00:03:37.720> guess<00:03:37.750> on

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
there's a few bugs with it I guess on

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.500 
there's a few bugs with it I guess on
the<00:03:38.349> corners<00:03:38.799> I'll<00:03:39.760> have<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.000> try<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.269> fix

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
the corners I'll have to try and fix

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.890 
the corners I'll have to try and fix
that<00:03:40.660> something<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.280> other<00:03:42.280> than<00:03:42.459> that

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
that something of it other than that

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.020 
that something of it other than that
it's<00:03:43.900> still<00:03:44.109> working<00:03:44.349> progress<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.310> this<00:03:45.849> one

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
it's still working progress and this one

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.330 
it's still working progress and this one
somehow<00:03:46.269> made<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.750> see<00:03:47.620> as<00:03:47.769> I<00:03:47.799> said<00:03:48.099> there's<00:03:48.280> a

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
somehow made it see as I said there's a

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.370 
somehow made it see as I said there's a
lot<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.579> bugs<00:03:48.730> but<00:03:49.000> um<00:03:49.480> yeah<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:50.109> the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
lot of bugs but um yeah that is the

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.879 
lot of bugs but um yeah that is the
first<00:03:51.040> way<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.250> do<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.609> and<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:53.500> other<00:03:53.530> thing

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
first way to do it and the other thing

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.539 
first way to do it and the other thing
I've<00:03:54.250> had<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.459> so<00:03:54.639> far<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:56.260> random<00:03:56.889> box<00:03:57.099> now

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
I've had it so far is the random box now

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.849 
I've had it so far is the random box now
this<00:03:57.700> also<00:03:57.970> gives<00:03:58.329> you<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> for<00:03:58.840> XP<00:03:59.349> so<00:03:59.590> if<00:03:59.709> I

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
this also gives you a for XP so if I

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.690 
this also gives you a for XP so if I
just<00:04:00.870> know<00:04:04.079> there<00:04:05.079> we<00:04:05.139> go

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
just know there we go

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.280 
just know there we go
I'm<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:06.819> super<00:04:07.000> much<00:04:07.299> more<00:04:07.510> easier<00:04:07.780> so<00:04:07.989> with<00:04:08.200> the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
I'm a super much more easier so with the

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.089 
I'm a super much more easier so with the
random<00:04:08.500> box

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
random box

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.819
