you push down to shift down now you have

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.310 
you push down to shift down now you have
your<00:01:28.890> display<00:01:29.460> over<00:01:29.790> here<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:31.110> showing

eighty-eight<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.830> code<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.100> shows<00:02:02.490> it's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
eighty-eight is the code that shows it's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.760 
eighty-eight is the code that shows it's
running<00:02:03.390> through<00:02:03.570> its<00:02:03.690> diagnostic<00:02:04.320> test<00:02:04.560> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
running through its diagnostic test and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.670 
running through its diagnostic test and
then<00:02:04.980> 25<00:02:05.400> is<00:02:05.700> flat<00:02:05.910> as<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:07.230> means<00:02:07.470> that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
then 25 is flat as on that means that

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.410 
then 25 is flat as on that means that
there<00:02:07.830> are<00:02:07.860> actually<00:02:08.190> no<00:02:08.400> codes<00:02:08.729> no<00:02:08.940> active

there are actually no codes no active

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510 
there are actually no codes no active
codes<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:10.350> if<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:10.560> want<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.740> check<00:02:10.920> inactive

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520

something<00:02:12.930> that's<00:02:13.080> been<00:02:13.260> wrong<00:02:13.440> with<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
something that's been wrong with the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.770 
something that's been wrong with the
transmission<00:02:14.130> however<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.760> not<00:02:14.940> diagnosing

transmission however is not diagnosing
it<00:02:15.990> right<00:02:16.170> now<00:02:16.350> we<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> same<00:02:17.280> thing<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:17.820> we

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
it right now we do the same thing but we

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.090 
it right now we do the same thing but we
do<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.120> four<00:02:18.360> times<00:02:18.390> within<00:02:18.900> five<00:02:19.200> seconds<00:02:19.680> so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
do it four times within five seconds so

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.910 
do it four times within five seconds so
one<00:02:20.520> two<00:02:21.150> three<00:02:21.870> four<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:24.090> go<00:02:24.240> over<00:02:24.450> here

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
one two three four we go over here

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.990 
one two three four we go over here
it's<00:02:26.460> going<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.670> go<00:02:26.760> through<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
it's going to go through the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.990 
it's going to go through the
self-diagnostic<00:02:27.870> again<00:02:31.700> sometimes<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.820> takes

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
self-diagnostic again sometimes it takes

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.300 
self-diagnostic again sometimes it takes
up<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.270> about<00:02:33.450> five<00:02:33.780> five<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.650> seven<00:02:34.950> seconds

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
up to about five five to seven seconds

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.020 
up to about five five to seven seconds
and<00:02:36.380> it's<00:02:37.380> still<00:02:37.590> showing<00:02:37.860> 25<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:38.820> there<00:02:38.970> are

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
and it's still showing 25 so there are

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.710 
and it's still showing 25 so there are
no<00:02:39.120> inactive<00:02:39.750> codes<00:02:40.460> now<00:02:41.460> if<00:02:41.760> we<00:02:41.970> did<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.690> a

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
no inactive codes now if we did have a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.440 
no inactive codes now if we did have a
fault<00:02:43.050> code<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.470> we<00:02:43.560> wanted<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.890> clear<00:02:44.330> we<00:02:45.330> do

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
fault code that we wanted to clear we do

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.520 
fault code that we wanted to clear we do
the<00:02:45.570> exact<00:02:45.870> same<00:02:45.900> thing<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.350> we've<00:02:46.500> been

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
the exact same thing that we've been

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.160 
the exact same thing that we've been
doing<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.100> we<00:02:47.220> do<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.430> within<00:02:47.780> five<00:02:48.780> seconds

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
doing but we do it within five seconds

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.900 
doing but we do it within five seconds
we<00:02:49.440> do<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.620> six<00:02:49.800> times<00:02:49.950> within<00:02:50.220> five<00:02:50.460> seconds

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
we do it six times within five seconds

00:02:50.910 --> 00:03:03.590 
we do it six times within five seconds
so<00:02:51.510> one<00:02:52.050> two<00:02:52.440> three<00:02:52.470> four<00:02:53.340> five<00:02:54.150> six<00:02:54.660> and<00:03:02.600> now

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
so one two three four five six and now

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.110 
so one two three four five six and now
it's<00:03:03.870> solid<00:03:04.739> in<00:03:04.980> four<00:03:05.250> neutral<00:03:05.430> which<00:03:05.850> means

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
it's solid in four neutral which means

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.550 
it's solid in four neutral which means
we're<00:03:06.390> actually<00:03:06.510> ready<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.930> start<00:03:07.020> up<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.500> go

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
we're actually ready to start up and go

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.120 
we're actually ready to start up and go
the<00:03:10.560> codes<00:03:11.060> can<00:03:12.060> be<00:03:12.090> two<00:03:12.810> digit<00:03:13.200> numbers<00:03:13.560> again

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
the codes can be two digit numbers again

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
than that that's pretty much it it's a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.539 
than that that's pretty much it it's a
pretty<00:03:51.330> simple<00:03:51.830> transmission<00:03:52.830> to<00:03:53.160> operate

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
pretty simple transmission to operate

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.100 
pretty simple transmission to operate
personally<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:54.299> like<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.720> lot<00:03:54.810> better<00:03:55.019> than

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
personally I like it a lot better than

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.330 
personally I like it a lot better than
the<00:03:55.320> Allison<00:03:55.830> gives<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> little<00:03:57.209> bit<00:03:57.420> more

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
the Allison gives you a little bit more

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.440 
the Allison gives you a little bit more
control<00:03:59.340> because<00:03:59.640> again<00:03:59.910> it's<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.209> close<00:04:00.420> to

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
control because again it's so close to

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.640 
control because again it's so close to
the<00:04:00.600> steering<00:04:00.900> wheel<00:04:01.049> if<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.320> want<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.560> go

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
the steering wheel if you want to go
