00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to everything in this video i'm going 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.650
 introduce you to nail art with two 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.390
 different techniques 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.950
 an easier and a little bit more 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.599
 difficult that I presented to 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.710
 selection beauties that's why I have 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.710
 made on capsule today 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.570
 the arc data that are going to be 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.430
 presented today an enarque which 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.380
 can be made 100% polish and a rose 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.240
 in troy ounce so for nail art 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.310
 I'm starting to show you how I 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.029
 do it well with the fallou h 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.730
 and painting 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.800
 so there you see from afar I move well 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.090
 the two fingers of my hand so after 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.830
 you have the zoom a little bit more 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.239
 close so here I made degraded to 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.980
 painting because I really like it 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.840
 if not on the kick selection I had 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.309
 does the degrade to the foam so like 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.330
 I will show you here like that you 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.879
 will be able to see the difference 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.020
 so I laid my beige base then 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.059
 so there are two techniques 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.309
 the first technique degrade everything 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.470
 simply with a single color on the 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.330
 base so I do not at all this 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.979
 technique that's why I'm showing you 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.449
 the results it's not melted both 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.320
 colors are not melted i do not like 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.940
 the results 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.710
 so me what I advise you to 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.720
 do it directly on the foam of 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.140
 put both colors so first the 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.299
 beige and then the purple and pat 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.130
 on your nail so on a base 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.130
 white 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.510
 so here is the rendering with the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.890
 degraded to us so that's a lot more 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.420
 melted like that there you have the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.710
 difference between the two techniques 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.110
 I really like both techniques 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.970
 it's different actually the result that 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.190
 holds as well then I took the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.290
 iridescent paint so elysÃ©es paint 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.970
 de joe thought then that really really 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.470
 I recommend it because everything 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.420
 first it will give an effect 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.730
 beautiful in fact at your base 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.820
 and in addition it allows you to make a 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.860
 waterproof layer that will blow you 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.300
 allow to be able to erase the painting 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.280
 even when it's dry so when 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.020
 you are deceived you can erase the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.610
 painting with water so there I the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.560
 laying is sure the varnish and on the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.420
 painting 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.340
 so here I show you the little is so 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.260
 I posed on the left on varnish 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.850
 classic forgiveness painting does not fade 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.830
 not when it's dry while on 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.040
 the iridescent layer you see that its part 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.370
 still pretty good so for the nail 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.220
 art 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.330
 so I took a classic long liner 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 paint 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.030
 violet you can very well me 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.790
 take the varnished liners that are already 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.440
 in the bottle actually it depends on where even 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.760
 a liner and varnish it's the same 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.959
 works very well with both so I 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.170
 started by drawing 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.060
 kind of leaf with the base of the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.680
 wider leaf and then I have 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.350
 added a lot of drops so in 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.300
 crushing the brush I pull everything 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.250
 gently to do it well at 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.500
 bout so I added also small 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.280
 drops son and inside too I 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.280
 added drops 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.280
 and then I took a gold liner and 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.250
 I added a lot of glitter a little 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.570
 in the holes I'm sorry if you do not 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.090
 do not understand very well I am 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.500
 totally cold so I feel that it 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.970
 is going to be pretty funny the bar of his 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.160
 two-mats video but good so voila and 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.989
 after left you have the result at 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.769
 right forgiveness on the polish and left 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.390
 on painting 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.819
 so here I have done silver version 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.950
 gold version it's a really 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.290
 quick to do that I realized in 30 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.670
 minutes with degrading to beauties 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.280
 selection so that's fine 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.730
 affordable so I had laid a varnish 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.140
 matte blue and I always applied 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.730
 same gray paint and if you 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.650
 find that the effect is too much and iridescent 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.970
 so just decrease the paint 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.769
 made to make it a little bit 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.650
 less siren actually because it was 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.630
 a little too much earlier and 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.549
 then I drew 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.700
 pink truncates so my square brush 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.560
 game 30 in the pink and in the white 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.930
 so this is the basic method for 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.180
 to make the rose in fact so I start 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.989
 by making a big arc 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.090
 then a kind of comma mean and then 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.769
 to make it a tiny comma 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.959
 so you have to twist and brush 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.209
 in fact the mistake not to do is 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.400
 do three petals like this if not the 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.010
 flower we will believe that it is open 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.840
 we see two faces then the 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.120
 second step is to redo the same 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.440
 something a little bit below 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.739
 totally below it is necessary that the 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.840
 white be of degraded arles first 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.470
 petals in fact so that's exactly 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.810
 the same 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.060
 always always between 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.040
 every step you have to do two layers 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.720
 so wait until it dries and do 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:26.200
 diapers then I make a little eu 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.720
 to make their turn is another big 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:35.680
 u to finish well as it should be 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:37.480
 swirl and finish is to do 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.660
 I do not know how to explain soon 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.610
 kind of triangle to make the petals 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.550
 in fact who come back like this to 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.710
 middle the heart of the rose so two 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.660
 little triangles like that you try 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.410
 to fill the holes in fact with a little 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.920
 what you can and here a little hop 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.920
 comma 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.080
 then I added the contours with 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.410
 my brush all makes a pie to 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.360
 strawberries 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.040
 so to accentuate to give a little 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.660
 more keys of light and to make 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.850
 a little more the spiral in the middle 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.320
 and afterwards I drew spirals and 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.300
 points next but I fell in 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.200
 battery bay and camera then 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.590
 sorry it did not film here so for 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.590
 the result 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.730
 and here are the results on three 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.260
 capsules so I realized today 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.150
 tell me in comment what is 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.979
 your favorite and tell me if you 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.600
 would like to see more videos on 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.430
 capsules like this one me I you 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.700
 make an appointment next Friday at 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.700
 soon
