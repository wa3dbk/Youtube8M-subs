00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.059
 with a story but not with 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.530
 one year 100000 old relationship 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.410
 between human and violin but 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.269
 between that human dog or wolf and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.910
 you like or not these animals are in 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.830
 any case fascinating in ernstbrunn in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.080
 Lower Austria has been in business for three years 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.689
 in the wolf research center of a worldwide 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.130
 unique institution 's behavior 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.170
 the wolves are examined and theirs 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.170
 partnership 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.170
 cooperation readiness 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.949
 daun 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.370
 wolves are the animals we use 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.170
 Already the longest together are not 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.140
 our ancestors ancestors are for 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.210
 about 60 to 80 thousand years in one 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.070
 big wave emigrated from africa and 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 have already thrown in the middle east 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.840
 we met that, we know 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.520
 high resolution high resolution genetics and 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.860
 apparently, all people were on the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.560
 Northern Hemisphere side with wolves together 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.490
 first in the form of wolves and later in 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.490
 form of dogs 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.450
 15 wolves live in the extensive enclosure in 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.850
 ernstbrunn split on three packs 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.100
 kurt kotrschal and cent work him 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.560
 daily with the wolves the amazing 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.120
 possess social skills and in 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.320
 view of your partnership 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.920
 behave much with people in common 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:43.880
 Of course, from the behavior with more with 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.770
 to do chimpanzees so mean what where 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.110
 but we are closer to wolves it is 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.220
 our our internal 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.920
 willingness to cooperate is not 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.510
 domination of the wolf pack and in 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.220
 normal people groups in good 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.100
 socialized people is that yes 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 Finally, not even when you go up 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.530
 look the street 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.560
 the majority of encounters between 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.360
 People are nice and friendly and nice 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.310
 and you can not do it 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.899
 that means we are in the relationship 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.210
 we wanted a much more similar mission 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:16.160
 Of course, the world could suit us 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.590
 to use violence at all times 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.360
 but they do not want to go for what 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.430
 as long as we do not compete with them 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.410
 give them food or sex partners 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.220
 he can fight with it 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.220
 get along with them 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:36.569
 We have it is the time you always 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.999
 complains terribly roars and 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.999
 my dog or wolf roars then it is called 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:48.810
 which of course does not see in this case 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.459
 because we already know her 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.829
 live in one we and the other 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.019
 system is defended only to the outside 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.019
 inside, the family holds together 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.480
 this is essentially what happens here 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:10.239
 experimental research that is 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.700
 Do you believe how much head set 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.110
 Wanna hunt for communication and 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.299
 share a common experience 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.299
 That's one of the many research questions 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.109
 we raised them all by hand the b 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.329
 there is simply this strong one 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.950
 bond if of course not 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.569
 We also do not want to exaggerate 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.359
 get too close so argues that 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.090
 dogs are but we need of course 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.709
 wolfert is for us neither this before us 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.769
 do not be afraid and therefore for us 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.319
 also do not feel challenged that 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.030
 then someday somehow 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.129
 show that they are higher than that 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.319
 So you need to regulate this 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.870
 social closeness and the whole in one 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.870
 folder is a nice relationship though 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.129
 But that's us, that's us 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.900
 Do not get too close to each other 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.900
 which and wolves people to humans 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.950
 kurt describes kotrschal in his book 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.709
 very detailed the relationships 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.180
 between wolves wounds and humans 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.940
 evolutionary backgrounds and goals 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.560
 the world's most unique wolf 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.359
 research center 200 pages that are not 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.090
 only people but apparently also the 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.090
 Wolves themselves are very worth reading 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.930
 autumn is a year
