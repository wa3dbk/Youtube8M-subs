00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.440 
going to explain the new layout of the
tank<00:00:13.190> so<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> few<00:00:14.460> weeks<00:00:14.670> ago<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.969> made<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.269> video

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
tank so a few weeks ago I made a video

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.540 
tank so a few weeks ago I made a video
about<00:00:15.599> changing<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> layout<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.279> tank

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
about changing the layout of the tank

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.470 
about changing the layout of the tank
and<00:00:18.439> in<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.650> video<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.250> said<00:00:20.699> I'd<00:00:21.060> probably<00:00:21.240> be

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
and in that video I said I'd probably be

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.080 
and in that video I said I'd probably be
changing<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.960> few<00:00:22.140> things<00:00:22.170> around<00:00:22.910> enough<00:00:23.910> for

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
changing a few things around enough for

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.120 
changing a few things around enough for
a<00:00:24.119> week<00:00:24.240> or<00:00:24.390> two<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.779> decided<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.800> looked

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
a week or two I just decided it looked

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.880 
a week or two I just decided it looked
too<00:00:26.340> crowded<00:00:27.170> because<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> had<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.529> piece<00:00:28.710> of

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
too crowded because I had that piece of

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.980 
too crowded because I had that piece of
bog<00:00:29.250> wooden<00:00:29.699> over<00:00:29.939> there<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:30.840> looked

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
bog wooden over there and it just looked

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.069 
bog wooden over there and it just looked
too<00:00:31.170> messy<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> decided<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.600> take<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.809> back

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
too messy so I decided to take it back

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.350 
too messy so I decided to take it back
out<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:35.219> there<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:35.640> no<00:00:35.850> point<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.270> us

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
out so there was really no point of us

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.569 
out so there was really no point of us
putting<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.930> well<00:00:37.739> that's<00:00:37.860> okay<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.460> to

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
putting it in well that's okay I like to

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.369 
putting it in well that's okay I like to
try<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.090> new<00:00:39.270> things<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:40.020> how<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.350> looks

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
try out new things and see how it looks

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.910 
try out new things and see how it looks
and<00:00:40.890> there<00:00:41.670> was<00:00:41.760> no<00:00:41.910> harm<00:00:42.180> done<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.829> yeah<00:00:43.829> I've

took that piece of bog wood out and the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.260 
took that piece of bog wood out and the
decided<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.039> rearrange<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.640> plants<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
decided just to rearrange the plants to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.869 
decided just to rearrange the plants to
see<00:00:48.450> how<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> liked<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.309> main<00:00:50.489> problem

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
see how I liked it and the main problem

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.959 
see how I liked it and the main problem
I<00:00:50.969> had<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.239> tank<00:00:51.800> before<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.399> changed<00:00:53.910> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
I had in the tank before I changed it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.779 
I had in the tank before I changed it
run<00:00:54.120> initially<00:00:54.860> was<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.010> piece<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.430> bog<00:00:56.610> wood

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
run initially was this piece of bog wood

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.650 
run initially was this piece of bog wood
over<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:58.160> had<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.340> big<00:01:00.000> piece<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.270> bog

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
over here I had this big piece of bog

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
over here I had this big piece of bog
wood<00:01:00.840> over<00:01:01.140> there<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:01.829> emptiness<00:01:02.309> over

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
wood over there and just emptiness over

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.210 
wood over there and just emptiness over
here<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.960> me<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.650> balance<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
here and for me that can out balance the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.600 
here and for me that can out balance the
tank<00:01:06.020> can<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> made<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.409> side<00:01:07.770> look<00:01:08.220> heavier

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
tank can I made this side look heavier

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.750 
tank can I made this side look heavier
than<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.060> side<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:10.320> what<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.530> did<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.189> moved

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
than that side so what I did is I moved

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.420 
than that side so what I did is I moved
the<00:01:11.939> Indian<00:01:12.270> red<00:01:12.479> Lily<00:01:12.720> from<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.229> site<00:01:13.470> move

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the Indian red Lily from this site move

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.410 
the Indian red Lily from this site move
outta<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:15.290> unless<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:17.119> it<00:01:18.119> kind<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
outta here unless you can see it kind of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.380 
outta here unless you can see it kind of
bounces<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.960> tank<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> bit<00:01:19.680> Bella<00:01:20.390> I'll

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
bounces the tank out a bit Bella I'll

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.090 
bounces the tank out a bit Bella I'll
probably<00:01:21.630> show<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.409> tank<00:01:22.710> when<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.860> gets

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
probably show you this tank when it gets

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.609 
probably show you this tank when it gets
dark<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> show<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> plants<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> bit

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
dark just to show you the plants a bit

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.249 
dark just to show you the plants a bit
better<00:01:26.150> so<00:01:27.150> there's<00:01:27.299> no<00:01:27.450> glare<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> glass

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
better so there's no glare on the glass

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.190 
better so there's no glare on the glass
but<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.310> think<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.150> Indian<00:01:30.509> red<00:01:30.689> lily<00:01:30.900> does

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
but I think that Indian red lily does

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.359 
but I think that Indian red lily does
balance<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> tank<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.100> bit<00:01:32.430> better<00:01:34.009> before<00:01:35.009> it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
balance the tank a bit better before it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.039 
balance the tank a bit better before it
was<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.700> all<00:01:35.880> bare<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.479> there<00:01:36.689> was<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
was just all bare here there was just a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.710 
was just all bare here there was just a
few<00:01:37.229> crypts<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.700> decided<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.299> move<00:01:39.420> pretty

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
few crypts and I decided to move pretty

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.440 
few crypts and I decided to move pretty
much<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> crypts<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> center<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
much all the crypts to the center of the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.160 
much all the crypts to the center of the
tank<00:01:43.460> because<00:01:44.460> I've<00:01:44.579> got<00:01:44.759> quite<00:01:45.270> bren<00:01:45.659> crypts

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
tank because I've got quite bren crypts

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.170 
tank because I've got quite bren crypts
so<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.710> for<00:01:46.979> would<00:01:47.040> make<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.369> good<00:01:47.520> transition

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
so I for would make a good transition

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.359 
so I for would make a good transition
from<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> bog<00:01:48.720> wood<00:01:48.930> into<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> Ludwig<00:01:50.220> Lea

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
from the bog wood into the Ludwig Lea

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.980 
from the bog wood into the Ludwig Lea
and<00:01:50.640> things<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.570> put<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and things like that so I put in the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.080 
and things like that so I put in the
middle<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.340> kind<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.549> blends<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
middle and it just kind of blends the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.690 
middle and it just kind of blends the
wood<00:01:54.270> out<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> bit<00:01:54.750> better<00:01:55.070> over<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
wood out a bit better over here in the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.300 
wood out a bit better over here in the
back<00:01:56.850> up<00:01:57.090> at<00:01:57.210> some<00:01:57.240> Ludwig<00:01:57.719> yeah<00:01:58.040> just<00:01:59.040> because

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
back up at some Ludwig yeah just because

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.789 
back up at some Ludwig yeah just because
before<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.570> hidden<00:02:00.990> behind<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.409> bog<00:02:01.590> wood

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
before it was hidden behind the bog wood

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.609 
before it was hidden behind the bog wood
in<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.310> corner<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.990> I've<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.020> put<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.439> at

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
in that corner so I've just put it at

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.810 
in that corner so I've just put it at
the<00:02:04.740> back<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.070> tank<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.549> think<00:02:05.729> it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the back of the tank and I think it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.999 
the back of the tank and I think it
looks<00:02:05.909> really<00:02:06.180> nice<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:06.840> doing<00:02:07.140> well<00:02:07.350> taking

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
looks really nice it's doing well taking

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.420 
looks really nice it's doing well taking
off<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:09.420> star<00:02:09.720> grass<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.379> had<00:02:10.709> around<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.250> base

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
off the star grass I had around the base

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.100 
off the star grass I had around the base
of<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.700> bog<00:02:12.030> wood<00:02:12.209> over<00:02:12.360> here

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
of the bog wood over here

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.410 
of the bog wood over here
and<00:02:13.560> I've<00:02:13.740> just<00:02:13.950> kind<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.820> cut<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.240> into

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and I've just kind of cut it up into

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.350 
and I've just kind of cut it up into
small<00:02:15.540> bits<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.820> because<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:17.910> was<00:02:17.970> growing

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
small bits and because it was growing

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.820 
small bits and because it was growing
really<00:02:18.630> well<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:19.110> probably<00:02:19.410> one<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.740> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
really well it's probably one of the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.400 
really well it's probably one of the
fastest<00:02:20.190> growing<00:02:20.340> plants<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:20.880> my<00:02:21.060> tank<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.630> just

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
fastest growing plants in my tank I just

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.710 
fastest growing plants in my tank I just
pull<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.680> up<00:02:22.910> planting<00:02:23.910> there<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.210> little<00:02:24.420> bits

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
pull it up planting there in little bits

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.040 
pull it up planting there in little bits
and<00:02:25.440> trying<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.130> make<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.700> carpet<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.690> I've

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
and trying to make a carpet of that I've

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.350 
and trying to make a carpet of that I've
got<00:02:28.230> some<00:02:28.380> over<00:02:28.650> here<00:02:28.830> as<00:02:29.040> well<00:02:29.270> so<00:02:30.270> that's

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
got some over here as well so that's

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.890 
got some over here as well so that's
probably<00:02:30.660> doubled<00:02:31.380> in<00:02:31.620> size<00:02:32.420> since<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.600> got<00:02:33.750> it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
probably doubled in size since I got it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.380 
probably doubled in size since I got it
so<00:02:34.320> it's<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.400> really<00:02:35.640> good<00:02:35.910> plant<00:02:36.180> very

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
so it's a really good plant very

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.260 
so it's a really good plant very
fast-growing<00:02:37.580> you<00:02:38.580> might<00:02:38.760> actually<00:02:38.940> have<00:02:39.240> to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
fast-growing you might actually have to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.650 
fast-growing you might actually have to
trim<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.290> once<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.340> week<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.330> keep<00:02:42.390> it

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
trim it once a week just to keep it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.490 
trim it once a week just to keep it
under<00:02:42.870> control

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
under control

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.040 
under control
there<00:02:44.340> reach<00:02:44.550> our<00:02:44.730> Eaton's<00:02:45.150> has<00:02:45.540> been<00:02:45.780> growing

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
there reach our Eaton's has been growing

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.040 
there reach our Eaton's has been growing
really<00:02:46.290> fast<00:02:46.440> -<00:02:46.920> I've<00:02:47.730> had<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.970> cake<00:02:48.570> girl<00:02:48.780> off<00:02:48.930> a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
really fast - I've had a cake girl off a

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.610 
really fast - I've had a cake girl off a
rock<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:50.540> retie<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.570> because<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.260> was<00:02:52.350> kind<00:02:52.560> of

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
rock and retie it because it was kind of

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.010 
rock and retie it because it was kind of
coming<00:02:52.890> loose<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:54.360> when<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.600> tie<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:54.990> your

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
coming loose so when you tie it on your

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.449 
coming loose so when you tie it on your
rocks<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.500> make<00:02:55.680> sure<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.980> tie<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.220> down

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
rocks just make sure you tie it down

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.270 
rocks just make sure you tie it down
tight<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.290> I've<00:02:58.290> got<00:02:58.440> some<00:02:58.560> spare<00:02:58.890> which<00:02:59.130> I

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
tight and I've got some spare which I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.940 
tight and I've got some spare which I
flew<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.550> ins<00:02:59.700> over<00:02:59.940> here<00:03:00.530> which<00:03:01.530> I'm<00:03:01.680> thinking

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
flew it ins over here which I'm thinking

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.070 
flew it ins over here which I'm thinking
about<00:03:02.010> using<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.790> an<00:03:02.910> old<00:03:03.090> tank<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.959> old

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
about using in an old tank in the old

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.600 
about using in an old tank in the old
fightin<00:03:04.440> fish<00:03:04.590> tank<00:03:04.860> I'm<00:03:05.160> thinking<00:03:05.459> about

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
fightin fish tank I'm thinking about

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.090 
fightin fish tank I'm thinking about
putting<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:05.970> on<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.180> table<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:07.040> having<00:03:08.040> a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
putting it on this table and having a

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.430 
putting it on this table and having a
kind<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:09.000> were<00:03:09.180> gummy<00:03:09.570> setup<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:10.260> think

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
kind of it were gummy setup I think

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.740 
kind of it were gummy setup I think
that's<00:03:10.590> how<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.709> see<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.209> if<00:03:12.209> I'm<00:03:12.330> looking<00:03:12.660> at

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that's how you see it if I'm looking at

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.690 
that's how you see it if I'm looking at
in<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.170> proper<00:03:13.470> plant<00:03:13.860> substrate<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:14.550> like

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
in the proper plant substrate it's like

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.390 
in the proper plant substrate it's like
a<00:03:15.090> manual<00:03:15.450> soil<00:03:15.810> different<00:03:16.230> things<00:03:16.440> people

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
a manual soil different things people

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.060 
a manual soil different things people
have<00:03:17.880> been<00:03:18.000> written<00:03:18.410> recommending<00:03:19.410> Fluval

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
have been written recommending Fluval

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.660 
have been written recommending Fluval

bio motion filter media in the filter

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.170 
bio motion filter media in the filter
okay<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.950> my<00:03:34.980> fella<00:03:35.430> cartridge<00:03:35.880> it

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
contains the biological media and let's

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.460 
contains the biological media and let's
open<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.630> up<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.050> have<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.470> look<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.780> is

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
open it up and have a look so this is

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.250 
open it up and have a look so this is
the<00:03:43.709> media<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.310> received<00:03:44.760> with<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.120> tank<00:03:45.390> and

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
the media I received with the tank and

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.680 
the media I received with the tank and
you<00:03:46.380> can<00:03:46.500> see<00:03:46.680> it's<00:03:46.800> quite<00:03:46.920> brown<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.690> that's

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
you can see it's quite brown and that's

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.360 
you can see it's quite brown and that's
the<00:03:48.900> bacteria<00:03:49.440> I've<00:03:49.590> settled<00:03:49.920> on<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.220> so

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
the bacteria I've settled on it so

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.120 
the bacteria I've settled on it so
that's<00:03:50.459> quite<00:03:50.760> good<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.440> this<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.739> bio

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
that's quite good and this is the bio

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.550 
that's quite good and this is the bio
motion<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.790> fill<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.120> media<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.720> think<00:03:55.320> I

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
motion to fill a media I think I

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.080 
motion to fill a media I think I
received<00:03:55.950> this<00:03:56.070> about<00:03:56.340> four<00:03:56.580> or<00:03:56.670> five<00:03:56.850> weeks

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
received this about four or five weeks

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.840 
received this about four or five weeks
ago<00:03:57.680> so<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.769> hasn't<00:03:58.920> been<00:03:59.070> a<00:03:59.160> tank<00:03:59.459> not<00:03:59.610> long

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
ago so it hasn't been a tank not long

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.130 
ago so it hasn't been a tank not long
but<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.180> can<00:04:00.209> see<00:04:00.510> there's<00:04:00.720> some<00:04:00.870> dark

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
but you can see there's some dark

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.320 
but you can see there's some dark
splotches<00:04:01.440> on<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:01.980> there<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:03.000> that's<00:04:03.239> the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
splotches on it there and that's the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.720 
splotches on it there and that's the
bacteria<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.140> that's<00:04:04.290> really<00:04:04.530> good<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.459> it

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
bacteria so that's really good and it

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.600 
bacteria so that's really good and it
seems<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.030> be<00:04:06.090> Wiggin<00:04:07.130> can't<00:04:08.130> really<00:04:08.340> tell

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
seems to be Wiggin can't really tell

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.130 
seems to be Wiggin can't really tell
what's<00:04:08.850> happening<00:04:09.209> inside<00:04:09.360> because

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
what's happening inside because

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.600 
what's happening inside because
apparently<00:04:10.560> it's<00:04:10.709> got<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:10.890> much<00:04:11.100> larger

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
apparently it's got a much larger

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.470 
apparently it's got a much larger
surface<00:04:12.000> area<00:04:12.360> on<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.560> inside<00:04:13.910> but<00:04:14.910> let's

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
surface area on the inside but let's

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.270 
surface area on the inside but let's
hope<00:04:15.660> it's<00:04:15.840> doing<00:04:16.080> its<00:04:16.200> job<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.830> seems<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.190> be

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
hope it's doing its job it seems to be

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.880 
hope it's doing its job it seems to be
doing<00:04:17.519> its<00:04:17.669> job<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:18.720> want<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.290> say<00:04:19.410> thank<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.739> to

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
doing its job I want to say thank you to

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.159 
doing its job I want to say thank you to
pond<00:04:20.220> guru<00:04:20.609> for<00:04:20.910> that<00:04:21.090> he<00:04:21.419> sent<00:04:21.630> us<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:21.810> about

we're asking a lot of people have been
asking<00:04:30.720> for<00:04:30.780> an<00:04:30.990> update<00:04:31.050> on<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:31.410> pond<00:04:31.740> I'll

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
asking for an update on the pond I'll

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.340 
asking for an update on the pond I'll
try<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.030> make<00:04:33.120> an<00:04:33.240> update<00:04:33.540> video<00:04:33.750> for<00:04:34.199> you

next<00:04:39.389> two<00:04:39.720> weeks<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:41.370> could<00:04:41.610> be<00:04:41.729> problematic

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
next two weeks so I could be problematic

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.969 
next two weeks so I could be problematic
but<00:04:42.720> yeah<00:04:42.960> I'll<00:04:43.229> try<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.530> make<00:04:43.620> a<00:04:43.710> video<00:04:43.949> for

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
but yeah I'll try and make a video for

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.909 
but yeah I'll try and make a video for
you<00:04:44.190> this<00:04:44.370> week<00:04:44.580> or<00:04:44.729> next<00:04:44.760> week<00:04:45.650> I'm<00:04:46.650> planning

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.950 
you this week or next week I'm planning
a<00:04:47.190> dig<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.699> pond<00:04:47.910> deeper<00:04:48.240> over<00:04:48.479> the<00:04:48.690> summer

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
a dig the pond deeper over the summer

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.450 
a dig the pond deeper over the summer
hold<00:04:49.169> this<00:04:49.320> so<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:49.800> can<00:04:49.949> look<00:04:50.100> forward<00:04:50.340> to

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
hold this so you can look forward to

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.710 
hold this so you can look forward to
that

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
that

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.570 
that
all<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.199> fish<00:04:52.350> are<00:04:52.500> doing<00:04:52.530> fine<00:04:52.860> in<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.160> pond

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
all the fish are doing fine in the pond

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.060 
all the fish are doing fine in the pond
and<00:04:54.120> I'll<00:04:54.360> move<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:54.660> baby<00:04:54.840> goldfish<00:04:55.380> out<00:04:55.590> into

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
and I'll move the baby goldfish out into

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.040 
and I'll move the baby goldfish out into
the<00:04:56.160> pond

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
the pond

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.680 
the pond
about<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.080> month<00:04:58.320> ago<00:04:59.270> because<00:05:00.270> one<00:05:00.450> of<00:05:00.600> them

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
about a month ago because one of them

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.960 
about a month ago because one of them
died<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.200> I've<00:05:01.290> only<00:05:01.440> got<00:05:01.620> two<00:05:01.889> now<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:02.550> died<00:05:02.760> us

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
died so I've only got two now it died us

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.780 
died so I've only got two now it died us
swim<00:05:03.450> bladder<00:05:03.720> disease<00:05:03.990> like<00:05:04.530> like<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.580> rest

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
swim bladder disease like like the rest

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.740 
swim bladder disease like like the rest
of<00:05:05.970> them

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
of them

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.659 
of them
so<00:05:07.139> I<00:05:07.169> decided<00:05:07.560> instead<00:05:07.889> of<00:05:08.130> keeping<00:05:08.460> them<00:05:08.550> in

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
so I decided instead of keeping them in

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.790 
so I decided instead of keeping them in
a<00:05:08.760> small<00:05:09.000> tank<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.690> might<00:05:10.200> as<00:05:10.320> well<00:05:10.380> put<00:05:10.680> them

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
a small tank I might as well put them

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.530 
a small tank I might as well put them
out<00:05:10.919> in<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.070> pond<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.520> hope<00:05:11.729> for<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.030> best

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
out in the pond and hope for the best

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.780 
out in the pond and hope for the best
and<00:05:13.200> they're<00:05:13.440> still<00:05:13.680> alive<00:05:13.830> has<00:05:14.280> seen<00:05:14.310> beating

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
and they're still alive has seen beating

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.690 
and they're still alive has seen beating
well<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.270> then<00:05:16.110> that<00:05:16.139> small<00:05:16.410> small<00:05:17.280> enough<00:05:17.520> to

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
well and then that small small enough to

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.300 
well and then that small small enough to
be<00:05:17.820> eaten<00:05:18.150> by<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.300> fish<00:05:18.590> so<00:05:19.590> hopefully<00:05:20.160> they

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
be eaten by the fish so hopefully they

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.510 
be eaten by the fish so hopefully they
do<00:05:20.430> Fanueil<00:05:20.820> further<00:05:21.060> summer<00:05:22.220> so<00:05:23.220> that<00:05:23.340> means
