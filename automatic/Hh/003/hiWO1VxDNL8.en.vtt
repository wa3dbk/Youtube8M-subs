00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
just an order the size and you can get

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.020 
just an order the size and you can get
for<00:01:55.710> height<00:01:55.920> wise<00:01:56.189> i<00:01:56.430> don't<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.880> can

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
for height wise i don't know if you can

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.450 
for height wise i don't know if you can
see<00:01:58.579> might<00:01:59.579> bring<00:01:59.790> them<00:01:59.909> closer

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
see might bring them closer

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.430 
see might bring them closer
so<00:02:02.460> once<00:02:03.090> higher<00:02:03.510> than<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.050> other<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
so once higher than the other and

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.950 
so once higher than the other and
there's<00:02:04.770> also<00:02:05.010> a<00:02:05.460> smaller<00:02:05.940> one<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.420> well<00:02:06.600> so

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
there's also a smaller one as well so

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.130 
there's also a smaller one as well so
you<00:02:07.050> can<00:02:07.260> get<00:02:07.440> sort<00:02:08.070> of<00:02:08.130> high<00:02:08.850> medium<00:02:09.570> and<00:02:09.780> low

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you can get sort of high medium and low

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.710 
you can get sort of high medium and low

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
they've got red but definitely they've

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.980

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
got black and brown and looks like what

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.890 
got black and brown and looks like what
one<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.230> each<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.790> they<00:02:20.790> went<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.360> expenses

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
one of each and they went to expenses

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.140 
one of each and they went to expenses
that<00:02:22.020> compared<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> normal<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.220> Seoul<00:02:23.550> they

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
that compared to a normal in Seoul they

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.840 
that compared to a normal in Seoul they
went<00:02:24.420> really<00:02:24.900> much<00:02:25.230> more<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.920> think<00:02:26.700> they're

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
went really much more I think they're

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.240 
went really much more I think they're
pretty<00:02:27.120> much<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.570> same<00:02:27.780> or<00:02:28.020> cheaper<00:02:28.250> actually

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
pretty much the same or cheaper actually

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.730 
pretty much the same or cheaper actually
and<00:02:29.600> they<00:02:30.600> need<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.930> last<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.320> really<00:02:31.470> long<00:02:31.590> time

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
and they need to last a really long time

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.060 
and they need to last a really long time
like<00:02:32.250> normal<00:02:32.610> insults<00:02:33.230> only<00:02:34.230> last<00:02:34.470> six<00:02:34.709> months

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
like normal insults only last six months

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.280 
like normal insults only last six months
to<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> year<00:02:35.459> because<00:02:36.300> they<00:02:36.660> compact<00:02:37.140> because

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
to a year because they compact because

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.080 
to a year because they compact because
they're<00:02:37.590> made<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.830> foam<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.100> squishy<00:02:38.940> stuff

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
they're made of foam and squishy stuff

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.050 
they're made of foam and squishy stuff
and<00:02:39.600> whereas<00:02:40.500> these<00:02:40.650> are<00:02:40.860> me<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.070> just<00:02:41.310> keep<00:02:41.880> on

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and whereas these are me to just keep on

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.850 
and whereas these are me to just keep on
laughing<00:02:42.209> because<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.470> run<00:02:43.590> them<00:02:43.770> over

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
laughing because you can run them over

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.920 
laughing because you can run them over
with<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.130> drop<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:45.450> they're<00:02:45.600> really<00:02:45.720> good

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
with a drop and and they're really good

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.750 
with a drop and and they're really good
so<00:02:46.110> it's<00:02:46.260> just<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.740> velcro<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.459> have<00:02:47.610> to

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
so it's just the velcro that you have to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.050 
so it's just the velcro that you have to
keep<00:02:47.880> changing<00:02:48.120> every<00:02:48.540> now<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.260> again<00:02:49.320> but

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
keep changing every now and again but

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.900 
keep changing every now and again but
their<00:02:51.060> thing<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.330> lifesaver<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.910> hopefully

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
their thing a lifesaver so hopefully

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.230 
their thing a lifesaver so hopefully
they'll<00:02:54.120> work<00:02:54.300> someone
