00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.650
 It's time to follow the ace 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.030
 of the match between Germany and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.710
 Cameroon 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.789
 that ace who was a card 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.160
 key to your team 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.500
 samuel eto'o even against a selection 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.060
 Very strong German shrimp got 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.670
 make a good game 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.070
 thanks to the striker since the beginning of 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.230
 departure is all too much work for the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.829
 German quarterbacks moving 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.050
 enough and calling the game for you 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.390
 after a nice move getting rid of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.030
 with the ability of markers and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:49.620
 risked a kick for quiet defense 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:52.079
 the German goalkeeper giving passes and creating 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.210
 plays and all show 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.969
 attack in a good position to finish with 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.960
 sure samuel eto'o was the most 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.960
 conscious in the field 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.310
 with space the camaronese risked a kick 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.009
 placed and the goalie will defend fell 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.270
 in the corner to make the defense more than 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.850
 nothing worked 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.820
 the rebound and was well tried 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 positioned and took advantage of the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.320
 German defense to make the first 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.320
 showing the goal luster and opportunism 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.060
 in celebration is so was there in 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.290
 flagpole make the polemic the pose of 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.710
 old 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.250
 the striker took the sling and showed that 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.880
 It's in great shape making it uncomfortable. 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.700
 Who's calling the old man out there? 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.770
 although the game has been in the draw and I'm 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.960
 had a outstanding performance 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.950
 becoming a true leader in 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.979
 field 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.390
 It is not by chance that the ace was the ace of the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.320
 match 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.899
