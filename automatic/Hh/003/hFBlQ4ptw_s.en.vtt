it's a nice-lookin stick from TPS
they've<00:00:13.380> really<00:00:13.560> done<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.710> great<00:00:13.890> job<00:00:14.040> on<00:00:14.400> this

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
they've really done a great job on this

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.519 
they've really done a great job on this
stick<00:00:14.760> starting<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:15.840> the<00:00:15.900> upper<00:00:16.110> portion<00:00:16.470> of

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
stick starting on the upper portion of

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.620 
stick starting on the upper portion of
it<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.800> shaft<00:00:17.099> construction<00:00:17.700> of<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.939> fairly

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
it the shaft construction of it fairly

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.060 
it the shaft construction of it fairly
traditional<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.200> have<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.349> slightly<00:00:19.710> concave

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
traditional you have a slightly concave

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.190 
traditional you have a slightly concave
walls<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.759> both<00:00:20.910> sides<00:00:21.150> with<00:00:21.930> pretty

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
walls on both sides with pretty

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.749 
walls on both sides with pretty
traditional<00:00:22.439> corners<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.369> slightly

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
traditional corners so it's slightly

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.790 
traditional corners so it's slightly
rounded<00:00:24.090> as<00:00:24.210> well<00:00:24.390> as<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.840> nice<00:00:25.290> feel<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.590> it

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
rounded as well as a nice feel to it

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.319 
rounded as well as a nice feel to it
really<00:00:26.160> allows<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.640> get<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.790> good<00:00:27.000> grip<00:00:27.180> on

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:27.329 
really allows you to get a good grip on

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.839 
really allows you to get a good grip on
the<00:00:27.480> stick<00:00:27.720> also<00:00:28.680> as<00:00:28.980> far<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.160> grip<00:00:29.460> goes<00:00:29.640> as

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the stick also as far as grip goes as

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.550 
the stick also as far as grip goes as
you<00:00:29.970> move<00:00:30.149> down<00:00:30.300> starting<00:00:30.810> right<00:00:30.930> about<00:00:31.050> here

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
you move down starting right about here

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.680 
you move down starting right about here
to<00:00:32.040> here<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.940> some<00:00:33.239> textured

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
to here they have some textured

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
to here they have some textured
materials<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> corners<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.970> is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
materials on the corners of it this is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.849 
materials on the corners of it this is
pretty<00:00:36.329> similar<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:36.870> Bauer's<00:00:37.320> doing<00:00:37.620> on

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
pretty similar to what Bauer's doing on

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.310 
pretty similar to what Bauer's doing on
their<00:00:38.250> supreme<00:00:38.670> series<00:00:38.910> sticks<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.539> the<00:00:39.660> 195

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
their supreme series sticks like the 195

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.900 
their supreme series sticks like the 195
where<00:00:40.890> they're<00:00:41.070> adding<00:00:41.309> just<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.579> little<00:00:41.789> bit

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
where they're adding just a little bit

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.340 
where they're adding just a little bit
of<00:00:41.969> texture<00:00:42.269> on<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> corners<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.199> add<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of texture on the corners to add a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
of texture on the corners to add a
little<00:00:43.590> more<00:00:43.739> grip<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.090> lower<00:00:45.329> hand

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
little more grip for that lower hand

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.110 
little more grip for that lower hand
placement<00:00:46.199> so<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.949> particularly<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.699> that<00:00:47.910> it

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
placement so I particularly like that it

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.910 
placement so I particularly like that it
doesn't<00:00:48.269> have<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.570> tacky<00:00:48.839> grip<00:00:49.140> coating<00:00:49.559> but

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
doesn't have a tacky grip coating but

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.110 
doesn't have a tacky grip coating but
still<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.339> a<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:50.670> bit<00:00:50.820> better<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
still you get a little bit better a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.660 
still you get a little bit better a
stick<00:00:51.570> control<00:00:51.929> fat<00:00:52.140> feature<00:00:52.440> there<00:00:52.769> I'm<00:00:53.460> also

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
stick control fat feature there I'm also

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.189 
stick control fat feature there I'm also
another<00:00:54.030> really<00:00:54.359> great<00:00:54.480> thing<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> they've

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
another really great thing that they've

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.959 
another really great thing that they've
done<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.589> this<00:00:55.800> stick<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> they've<00:00:56.339> provided<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
done on this stick is they've provided a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.750 
done on this stick is they've provided a
tech<00:00:57.449> saw<00:00:57.660> Liam<00:00:58.019> wrap<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.679> it<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.519> basically

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
tech saw Liam wrap on it so basically

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.829 
tech saw Liam wrap on it so basically
that's<00:00:59.879> gonna<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.179> kind<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.510> silver

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
that's gonna be kind of this silver

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.899 
that's gonna be kind of this silver
material<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.679> in<00:01:02.070> there<00:01:02.249> this

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
material that you can see in there this

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.509 
material that you can see in there this
is<00:01:03.089> a<00:01:03.120> fabric<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.929> woven<00:01:04.230> fabric<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.980> so<00:01:05.400> that's

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
is a fabric a woven fabric and so that's

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.890 
is a fabric a woven fabric and so that's
going<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> increase<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.240> overall<00:01:06.270> strength

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
going to increase the overall strength

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.840 
going to increase the overall strength
of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.230> stick<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.650> well<00:01:07.980> as<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> nice<00:01:08.580> feature

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
of the stick as well as a nice feature

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.950 
of the stick as well as a nice feature
that's<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.480> it's<00:01:09.660> going<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.810> help

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that's going to do is it's going to help

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.260 
that's going to do is it's going to help
cut<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.560> some<00:01:10.800> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.980> vibrations

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
cut down on some of the vibrations

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.160 
cut down on some of the vibrations
running<00:01:12.270> through<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.510> stick<00:01:12.750> wire<00:01:12.930> plane

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
running through the stick wire plane

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.130 
running through the stick wire plane
subscriber<00:01:13.620> nice<00:01:13.800> solid<00:01:14.220> feel<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.140> also

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
subscriber nice solid feel to it also

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.780 
subscriber nice solid feel to it also
they've<00:01:16.470> used<00:01:16.650> some<00:01:16.860> nice<00:01:17.010> graphite

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
they've used some nice graphite

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.400 
they've used some nice graphite
materials<00:01:18.300> so<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> really<00:01:19.170> light

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
materials so you have a really light

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.050 
materials so you have a really light
feel<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:20.010> you<00:01:20.100> really<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:20.670> good<00:01:20.850> power

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
feel but you really get some good power

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.650 
feel but you really get some good power
on<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
on it

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.530 
on it
they've<00:01:22.200> also<00:01:22.470> kind<00:01:23.010> of<00:01:23.100> altered<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.970> Flex<00:01:24.330> of

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
they've also kind of altered the Flex of

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.180 
they've also kind of altered the Flex of
the<00:01:24.630> stick<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.870> little<00:01:25.080> bit<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:26.010> it's

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
the stick a little bit so what it's

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.270 
the stick a little bit so what it's
going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.760> as<00:01:27.480> GPS<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.470> saying<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.890> it's

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
going to do is as GPS is saying is it's

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.010 
going to do is as GPS is saying is it's
going<00:01:29.370> to<00:01:29.430> allow<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.880> maximize<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
going to allow you to maximize the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.450 
going to allow you to maximize the
energy<00:01:31.140> loaded<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.800> on<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.070> sticks<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
energy loaded up on your sticks and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.040 
energy loaded up on your sticks and
really<00:01:32.640> gain<00:01:32.850> all<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.420> energy<00:01:33.780> from<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
really gain all the energy from the

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.970 
really gain all the energy from the
stick<00:01:34.260> flex<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.770> it

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
stick flex on it

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.640 
stick flex on it
it's<00:01:35.370> a<00:01:35.490> tri<00:01:35.790> balanced<00:01:36.180> design<00:01:36.350> so<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.500> good

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
it's a tri balanced design so it's good

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.260 
it's a tri balanced design so it's good
like<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.010> said<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.730> to<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:39.240> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
like I said it's really going to have a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.420 
like I said it's really going to have a
full<00:01:39.660> flex<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.260> stick<00:01:40.500> allowing<00:01:41.100> maximum

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
full flex of the stick allowing maximum

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.220 
full flex of the stick allowing maximum
energy<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.090> those<00:01:42.240> big<00:01:42.450> slap<00:01:42.750> shots<00:01:43.020> and

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
energy on those big slap shots and

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.920 
energy on those big slap shots and
one-timers<00:01:43.800> as<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.970> move<00:01:45.150> down<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:45.570> bottom

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
one-timers as we move down to the bottom

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.720 
one-timers as we move down to the bottom
portion<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:46.830> have<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.010> nice<00:01:47.130> taper<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.700> it

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
portion you do have a nice taper to it

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.250 
portion you do have a nice taper to it
this<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.060> gonna<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> low<00:01:48.570> kick<00:01:48.810> point<00:01:49.020> as

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
this is gonna have a low kick point as

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.720 
this is gonna have a low kick point as
well<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:49.650> that<00:01:49.740> responsive<00:01:50.370> feel<00:01:50.550> you'd

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
well as that responsive feel you'd

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.810 
well as that responsive feel you'd
expect<00:01:51.150> from<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> one-piece<00:01:51.780> stick<00:01:52.490> now<00:01:53.490> taking

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
expect from a one-piece stick now taking

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.310 
expect from a one-piece stick now taking
a<00:01:53.850> look<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.300> portion<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.870> the<00:01:54.930> stick<00:01:55.170> this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
a look at this portion of the stick this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.830 
a look at this portion of the stick this
is<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.620> to<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:55.920> ptc<00:01:56.580> or<00:01:56.850> power<00:01:57.150> transfer

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
is going to be the ptc or power transfer

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.900 
is going to be the ptc or power transfer
channel<00:01:58.290> basically<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.370> is<00:01:59.490> where<00:01:59.820> you

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
channel basically what it is where you

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.430 
channel basically what it is where you
see<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.150> metallic<00:02:00.720> kind<00:02:01.050> of<00:02:01.110> coloring

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
see that metallic kind of coloring

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.410 
see that metallic kind of coloring
that's<00:02:01.980> going<00:02:02.160> to<00:02:02.220> be<00:02:02.340> an<00:02:02.430> indentation<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that's going to be an indentation in the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.480 
that's going to be an indentation in the
shaft<00:02:03.780> transferring<00:02:04.680> into<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.100> blade<00:02:05.310> they

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
shaft transferring into the blade they

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.850 
shaft transferring into the blade they
have<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:05.940> both<00:02:06.240> sides<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.870> stick<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
have that on both sides of the stick and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.199 
have that on both sides of the stick and
what<00:02:08.190> that's<00:02:08.399> going<00:02:08.519> to<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.149> to

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
what that's going to do is it's going to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.210 
what that's going to do is it's going to
help<00:02:09.420> maximize<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.229> energy<00:02:10.560> transfer<00:02:11.009> from

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
help maximize the energy transfer from

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.640 
help maximize the energy transfer from
the<00:02:11.670> upper<00:02:12.000> portion<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> stick<00:02:12.720> down<00:02:13.200> into

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the upper portion of the stick down into

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.800 
the upper portion of the stick down into
the<00:02:13.770> blade<00:02:13.980> now<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> blade<00:02:15.660> of

the blade now going on to the blade of

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
the blade now going on to the blade of
the<00:02:15.870> stick<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.470> a

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
the stick this is a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.740 
the stick this is a
sent<00:02:17.100> carbon<00:02:17.550> material<00:02:17.910> blade<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.570> it's<00:02:18.660> going

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
sent carbon material blade so it's going

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.020 
sent carbon material blade so it's going
to<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.020> great<00:02:19.440> responsive<00:02:20.310> lively<00:02:20.790> feel

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
to have a great responsive lively feel

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.820 
to have a great responsive lively feel
to<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.510> then<00:02:21.900> also<00:02:22.050> another<00:02:22.350> feature<00:02:22.590> that

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
to it and then also another feature that

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.140 
to it and then also another feature that
they've<00:02:22.950> done<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.580> has<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
they've done on this it has it it's a

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.000 
they've done on this it has it it's a
very<00:02:24.390> thin<00:02:24.780> blade<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> lot<00:02:25.320> thinner<00:02:25.590> than<00:02:25.710> some

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
very thin blade a lot thinner than some

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.530 
very thin blade a lot thinner than some
of<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.130> other<00:02:26.250> ones<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.580> market<00:02:26.610> it

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
of the other ones on the market it

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.940 
of the other ones on the market it
actually<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.080> little<00:02:28.200> bit<00:02:28.350> thicker<00:02:28.710> on<00:02:28.830> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
actually is a little bit thicker on the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.980 
actually is a little bit thicker on the
bottom<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.490> then<00:02:29.850> kind<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.210> tapers<00:02:30.630> as<00:02:30.810> you

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
bottom and then kind of tapers as you

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.900 
bottom and then kind of tapers as you
move<00:02:31.200> up<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:31.740> even<00:02:32.040> thinner<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.520> so

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
move up to be even thinner on it so

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.370 
move up to be even thinner on it so
being<00:02:33.210> with<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.480> thinner<00:02:33.840> design<00:02:34.020> you're

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
being with that thinner design you're

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.770 
being with that thinner design you're
not<00:02:34.470> gonna<00:02:34.590> have<00:02:34.770> as<00:02:34.920> much<00:02:34.950> foam<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.210> but

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
not gonna have as much foam in it but

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.450 
not gonna have as much foam in it but
it's<00:02:36.990> going<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.140> give<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> nice<00:02:37.740> responsive

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
it's going to give you a nice responsive

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.790 
it's going to give you a nice responsive
lively<00:02:39.060> feel<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.570> great<00:02:40.110> energy<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:40.650> your

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
lively feel and great energy on your

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.430 
lively feel and great energy on your
shots<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.090> overall<00:02:42.420> feel<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.170> stick

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
shots so the overall feel of this stick

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.010 
shots so the overall feel of this stick
is<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:44.730> has<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> great<00:02:45.180> lightweight<00:02:45.630> feel<00:02:45.870> it

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
is it has a great lightweight feel it

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.690 
is it has a great lightweight feel it
doesn't<00:02:46.320> feel<00:02:46.470> overly<00:02:46.800> blade<00:02:47.160> heavy<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.670> it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
doesn't feel overly blade heavy to it

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.460 
doesn't feel overly blade heavy to it
and<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.450> not<00:02:48.480> gonna<00:02:48.720> be<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> lightest<00:02:49.290> stick

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
and it's not gonna be the lightest stick

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.050 
and it's not gonna be the lightest stick
on<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.680> market<00:02:50.070> but<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:50.550> definitely<00:02:50.730> gonna

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
on the market but it's definitely gonna

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.150 
on the market but it's definitely gonna
be<00:02:51.180> up<00:02:51.480> there<00:02:51.510> with<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> light<00:02:52.110> sticks<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:53.100> it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
be up there with the light sticks and it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.070 
be up there with the light sticks and it
has<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.310> nice<00:02:53.610> like<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.060> said<00:02:54.120> balance<00:02:54.720> feel<00:02:54.900> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
has a nice like I said balance feel to
