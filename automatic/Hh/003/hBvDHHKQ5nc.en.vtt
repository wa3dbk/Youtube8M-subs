00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.130
 today well we find ourselves for 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.020
 a video a bit special you could in 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.690
 effect note in the beginning of this 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.299
 video that links to a generic mehr 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.860
 generic what are you going to tell me eh 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.369
 well just a project that me 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.320
 is extremely important because it makes 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.040
 now about a year and a half that 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.770
 I am working on it 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.380
 and then today I'm here 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.350
 propose the project then first of all 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.470
 what is this project and well actually I 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.630
 account realize a whole season of 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.000
 stargate atlantis by resuming 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.350
 the story created by brad wright of 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.610
 benchmarks robert six couples because the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.039
 series in fact she stopped without 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.300
 end and so I want to create this 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.360
 end on minecraft 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.130
 rest assured I will give you a summary of 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.479
 the true stargate series atlantis for 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.789
 those who do not know well the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.019
 series for you to understand 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.910
 this season 6 that I will achieve with 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.030
 you because for that I would need 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.079
 of them I will actually need actors 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.810
 and extras 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.430
 simply for the extras low 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.310
 everyone no extras it is enough 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.130
 just fill out the form that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.550
 figure in the description 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.310
 and therefore I recall that 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.570
 figuring it's an actor but that takes 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.530
 never speak so in fact it's a 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.010
 actor who will not move who will be appearing 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.800
 in fact 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.570
 and then for Ben actors it's a 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.700
 little more complicated because I would like 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.250
 competent actors and 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.930
 and to come it will be necessary first of all 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.879
 fill in the second form which is 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.170
 in the description which is a bit more 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.800
 complex will not make mistakes 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.610
 will need to write more etc and then you 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.290
 will have an oral interview on Skype 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.670
 to finish on some kind of casting you 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.830
 will try different roles of 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.930
 characters and I'll be there to judge if 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.519
 you are good or not so in total 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.099
 I will need a lot of extras 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:18.140
 and 17 different ambient actors 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.269
 So here we go on this I hope that 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.299
 the pilot episode will please you and you 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.750
 many will want to participate and 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.750
 want to help me 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.590
 I would also like to clarify that the episode 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.959
 pilot will be coming out in quite a long time 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.970
 because see the credits that you 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.880
 have seen it really took me two days 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.349
 to do so he imagines imagine a 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.299
 episode know that it must be written and 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.890
 it's the pilot episode I've already 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.319
 written but for the next episodes 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.810
 since if the pilot episode 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.450
 season 6 works if you like it 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.760
 I will do other others others 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.010
 episodes for season 6 and I'll finish 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.739
 even the stargate series atlantis he 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:07.190
 must and then I think that's all 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.590
 I'll get back to you to beat for 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.389
 them I do not know to talk about the series 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.760
 for a moment I will make a video to talk 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.530
 of this new series of this new 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.560
 project because I will actually need 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.150
 other people especially for 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.100
 subtitles in English and why not 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.740

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.639
 trilingual to help me for the under 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.710

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.479
 this series will please you that you will be 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.650
