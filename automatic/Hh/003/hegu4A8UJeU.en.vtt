have<00:05:14.630> to<00:05:14.810> explain<00:05:15.050> why<00:05:15.650> they<00:05:16.190> had<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.490> be

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
have to explain why they had to be

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.630 
have to explain why they had to be
pushed<00:05:17.060> into<00:05:17.420> it<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.470> others<00:05:18.860> in<00:05:19.310> the

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
pushed into it and the others in the

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.330 
pushed into it and the others in the
past<00:05:19.940> and<00:05:20.390> you<00:05:21.080> can't<00:05:21.410> say<00:05:21.740> that<00:05:22.070> they<00:05:22.280> were

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
past and you can't say that they were

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.440 
past and you can't say that they were
any<00:05:22.820> more<00:05:23.800> spiritual<00:05:24.800> than<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:25.730> crowd<00:05:26.090> is

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
any more spiritual than the crowd is

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.800 
any more spiritual than the crowd is
today<00:05:27.020> and<00:05:27.320> yet<00:05:27.560> it's<00:05:27.860> at<00:05:28.130> low<00:05:28.310> ebb<00:05:28.550> today<00:05:29.120> but

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
today and yet it's at low ebb today but

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.170 
today and yet it's at low ebb today but
I<00:05:30.050> don't<00:05:30.440> think<00:05:30.710> that<00:05:31.010> you<00:05:31.220> could<00:05:31.460> rule<00:05:31.910> them

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
I don't think that you could rule them

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.810 
I don't think that you could rule them
out<00:05:32.390> altogether
