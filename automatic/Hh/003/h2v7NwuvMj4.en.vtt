00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.690 

so<00:00:05.620> there's<00:00:05.830> several<00:00:06.040> different<00:00:06.130> types<00:00:06.370> of

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:06.700 
so there's several different types of

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.789 
so there's several different types of
drawings<00:00:07.090> that<00:00:07.390> you<00:00:07.450> can<00:00:07.569> do<00:00:07.720> in<00:00:08.290> ways<00:00:08.559> that

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:08.799 
drawings that you can do in ways that

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:09.690 
drawings that you can do in ways that
you<00:00:08.920> can<00:00:09.070> use<00:00:09.190> ChemDraw

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
you can use ChemDraw

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.650 
you can use ChemDraw
in<00:00:10.030> the<00:00:10.270> classroom<00:00:10.719> so<00:00:11.320> we<00:00:11.680> can<00:00:12.040> draw<00:00:12.250> a<00:00:12.660> simple

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
in the classroom so we can draw a simple

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.170 
in the classroom so we can draw a simple
reaction

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.490 

where<00:00:22.180> I'm<00:00:22.330> doing<00:00:22.510> like<00:00:22.869> an<00:00:22.990> sn2<00:00:23.380> type

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
where I'm doing like an sn2 type

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.990 
where I'm doing like an sn2 type
reaction

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.840 

you<00:00:31.510> can<00:00:31.750> type<00:00:32.650> in<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:33.130> name<00:00:33.250> of<00:00:33.400> your<00:00:33.580> solvent

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
you can type in the name of your solvent

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.320 
you can type in the name of your solvent
if<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.270> don't<00:00:34.450> want<00:00:34.630> to<00:00:35.580> draw<00:00:36.580> it<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:39.330> then

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
if you don't want to draw it and then

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:48.119 
if you don't want to draw it and then
draw<00:00:40.540> your<00:00:40.690> products<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:47.199> if<00:00:47.710> you<00:00:47.800> don't<00:00:47.980> like

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
draw your products and if you don't like

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.380 
draw your products and if you don't like
the<00:00:48.280> way<00:00:48.430> that<00:00:48.610> you<00:00:48.670> drew<00:00:48.850> your<00:00:48.970> product<00:00:49.300> you

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
the way that you drew your product you

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.140 
the way that you drew your product you
can<00:00:49.510> use<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.629> sweet<00:00:49.960> button<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:51.670> clean<00:00:51.879> up<00:00:52.030> the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
can use a sweet button to clean up the

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.950 
can use a sweet button to clean up the
structure<00:00:53.250> afterwards<00:00:54.570> that's<00:00:55.570> one<00:00:55.780> type<00:00:55.930> of

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
structure afterwards that's one type of

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.420 
structure afterwards that's one type of
drawing<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.350> you<00:00:56.440> can<00:00:56.559> do<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:58.180> can<00:00:58.330> also<00:00:58.480> draw

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
drawing that you can do we can also draw

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:08.370 
drawing that you can do we can also draw
chair<00:01:00.430> structures<00:01:06.509> and<00:01:07.509> from<00:01:07.899> that<00:01:08.080> we<00:01:08.229> can

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
chair structures and from that we can

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.850 
chair structures and from that we can
make<00:01:10.050> our<00:01:11.050> different<00:01:11.410> substituted

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
make our different substituted

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.340 
make our different substituted
cyclohexanes<00:01:17.550> you<00:01:18.550> can<00:01:18.850> go<00:01:19.000> through<00:01:19.350> ring

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
cyclohexanes you can go through ring

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:29.510 
cyclohexanes you can go through ring
flip

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.359 

to<00:01:29.969> make<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.689> higher-energy<00:01:31.679> diaxial

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to make the higher-energy diaxial

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.090 
to make the higher-energy diaxial
structure<00:01:32.909> versus<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> diet<00:01:33.689> Oriole<00:01:36.950> we<00:01:37.950> can

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
structure versus the diet Oriole we can

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.410 
structure versus the diet Oriole we can
use<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.429> to<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:39.259> like<00:01:40.259> our<00:01:40.409> orbitals<00:01:43.939> so<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:44.969> can

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
use it to do like our orbitals so I can

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.800 
use it to do like our orbitals so I can
ask<00:01:45.689> students<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.619> draw<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:50.209> molecular<00:01:51.209> orbital

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
ask students to draw a molecular orbital

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.309 
ask students to draw a molecular orbital
for<00:01:53.060> butadiene<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:57.630> could<00:01:57.929> have<00:01:58.049> them<00:01:58.140> draw

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
for butadiene and I could have them draw

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.419 
for butadiene and I could have them draw
the<00:01:59.420> bonding<00:02:00.420> molecular<00:02:00.450> orbital<00:02:01.079> or<00:02:01.860> we

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
the bonding molecular orbital or we

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:03.979 
the bonding molecular orbital or we
could<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.729> them<00:02:02.909> draw<00:02:03.149> an<00:02:03.450> anti-bonding

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
could have them draw an anti-bonding

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.539 
could have them draw an anti-bonding
molecular<00:02:04.140> orbital<00:02:04.709> by<00:02:05.159> turning<00:02:05.429> these

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
molecular orbital by turning these

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:30.800 
molecular orbital by turning these
around<00:02:11.599> and<00:02:12.599> then<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:12.930> them<00:02:13.049> label<00:02:13.319> it

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.330 

we<00:02:31.049> can<00:02:31.200> also<00:02:31.379> use<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.890> do<00:02:32.010> Newman

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
we can also use it to do Newman

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:49.580 
we can also use it to do Newman
projections

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.660 

and<00:02:50.590> with<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.769> Newman<00:02:51.010> projections<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.549> can

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
and with the Newman projections I can

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.149 
and with the Newman projections I can
have<00:02:51.819> them<00:02:52.500> draw<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.650> different<00:02:53.890> atoms

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
have them draw in the different atoms

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.369 
have them draw in the different atoms
that<00:02:54.370> they<00:02:54.430> have<00:02:54.580> so<00:02:55.000> maybe<00:02:55.510> we<00:02:55.629> have<00:02:55.659> two

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
that they have so maybe we have two

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:57.869 
that they have so maybe we have two
hydrogen's<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:56.920> carbon<00:02:57.250> on<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.430> front<00:02:57.670> and

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
hydrogen's and a carbon on the front and

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:12.010 
hydrogen's and a carbon on the front and
two<00:02:58.090> hydrogens<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.569> carbon<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:58.959> back

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.230 

and<00:03:12.170> then<00:03:12.680> we<00:03:12.830> need<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.070> go<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.460> start

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
and then we need to go and start

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.420 
and then we need to go and start
rotating<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.660> back<00:03:14.840> one<00:03:15.020> around<00:03:15.260> so<00:03:16.100> my<00:03:16.370> two

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
rotating the back one around so my two

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:29.360 
rotating the back one around so my two
hydrogens<00:03:16.960> will<00:03:17.960> be<00:03:18.080> moving

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.650 

and<00:03:29.819> then<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:29.940> could<00:03:30.090> have<00:03:30.180> them<00:03:30.300> go<00:03:30.480> through

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
and then I could have them go through

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.470 
and then I could have them go through
and<00:03:31.400> tell<00:03:32.400> me<00:03:32.489> which<00:03:32.640> ones<00:03:32.819> highest<00:03:33.180> energy

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
and tell me which ones highest energy

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.699 
and tell me which ones highest energy
come<00:03:33.840> from<00:03:34.019> or<00:03:34.110> which<00:03:34.200> ones<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.470> lowest

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
come from or which ones the lowest

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.589 
come from or which ones the lowest
energy<00:03:34.800> come<00:03:35.099> from<00:03:35.129> or<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.390> one

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
energy come from or so that this one

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.400 
energy come from or so that this one
with<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.810> staggered<00:03:37.560> ante<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:37.980> would<00:03:38.190> be<00:03:38.310> low

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
with a staggered ante you would be low

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.550 
with a staggered ante you would be low
lowest<00:03:40.410> energy<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:42.510> one<00:03:43.050> of<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.200> ones<00:03:43.349> with

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
lowest energy and one of the ones with

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.309 
lowest energy and one of the ones with
eclipsed<00:03:44.099> could<00:03:44.670> be<00:03:44.849> one<00:03:45.300> of<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.480> highest

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
eclipsed could be one of the highest

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.860 
eclipsed could be one of the highest
energy
