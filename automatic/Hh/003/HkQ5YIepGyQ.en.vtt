00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
to hide behind one of these rocks this

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.559 
to hide behind one of these rocks this
is<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:47.909> rock<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.179> you're<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.359> to<00:01:48.420> be

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
is the rock that you're going to be

is the rock that you're going to be
getting<00:01:48.689> onto<00:01:48.929> later<00:01:49.289> but<00:01:49.889> I'm<00:01:50.069> just<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
getting onto later but I'm just going to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.249 
getting onto later but I'm just going to
hide<00:01:50.579> behind<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.020> wait

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
hide behind here and you can just wait

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.129 
hide behind here and you can just wait
for<00:01:52.469> this<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.799> go<00:01:53.069> off<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.789> not<00:01:53.819> activate<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
for this to go off do not activate the

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:57.230 
for this to go off do not activate the
center<00:01:55.590> platform<00:01:55.859> to<00:01:56.520> activate<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.999> bridge

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
center platform to activate the bridge

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.020 
center platform to activate the bridge
or<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.689> will<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.229> work<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.219> after<00:01:59.429> this<00:01:59.729> lamp

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
or this will not work so after this lamp

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.999 
or this will not work so after this lamp
explodes<00:02:00.600> right<00:02:00.810> here<00:02:01.319> you<00:02:01.679> will<00:02:01.710> need<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
explodes right here you will need to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.289 
explodes right here you will need to
head<00:02:02.189> back<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.429> the<00:02:02.670> rock<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> showed<00:02:03.270> you

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
head back to the rock that I showed you

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.569 
head back to the rock that I showed you
previously<00:02:03.659> now<00:02:04.649> I'm<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:04.889> going<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.159> kind<00:02:05.520> of

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
previously now I'm just going to kind of

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.699 
previously now I'm just going to kind of
go<00:02:05.759> over<00:02:05.969> there<00:02:06.179> after<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.079> activate<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
go over there after I activate the

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.460 
go over there after I activate the
center<00:02:08.009> platform<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.840> will<00:02:10.110> only<00:02:10.319> work

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
center platform and this will only work

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.680 
center platform and this will only work
if<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.860> says<00:02:11.039> fireteams<00:02:11.610> revives<00:02:12.000> reenabled

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
if it says fireteams revives reenabled

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.750 
if it says fireteams revives reenabled
and<00:02:13.530> that's<00:02:13.709> just<00:02:13.890> when<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.130> know<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.670> you

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and that's just when you know that you

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.490 
and that's just when you know that you
did<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.030> correctly<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.960> once<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.170> send<00:02:16.410> on

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
did it correctly so once you send on

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.830 
did it correctly so once you send on
this<00:02:16.620> rock<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.070> will<00:02:17.220> not<00:02:17.970> allow<00:02:18.270> any<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
this rock it will not allow any of the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.600 
this rock it will not allow any of the
thralls<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.320> come<00:02:19.470> get<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.040> then

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
thralls to come get you and then

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.790 
thralls to come get you and then
the<00:02:20.820> ogre<00:02:21.180> will<00:02:21.420> spawn<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.440> have<00:02:22.590> a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
the ogre will spawn now I have a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.070 
the ogre will spawn now I have a
icebreaker<00:02:23.490> in<00:02:24.000> icebreaker<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.660> actually<00:02:24.810> got

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
icebreaker in icebreaker I actually got

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.200 
icebreaker in icebreaker I actually got
it<00:02:25.230> from<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.650> exotic<00:02:26.220> chest<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.790> very

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
it from the exotic chest in the very

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.150 
it from the exotic chest in the very
beginning<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.840> was<00:02:28.050> very<00:02:28.350> excited<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:29.010> that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
beginning so I was very excited for that

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.550 
beginning so I was very excited for that
but<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.000> guys<00:02:30.150> see<00:02:30.360> right<00:02:30.600> here<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.200> ogre

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
but as you guys see right here the ogre

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.380 
but as you guys see right here the ogre
I'm<00:02:31.740> getting<00:02:32.040> crit<00:02:32.280> hits<00:02:32.520> on<00:02:32.730> them<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.000> then

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
I'm getting crit hits on them and then

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.660 
I'm getting crit hits on them and then
after<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.140> kill<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.410> ogre<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.370> bridge

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
after you kill the ogre the bridge

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.480 
after you kill the ogre the bridge
should<00:02:35.910> be<00:02:36.090> clear<00:02:36.540> now<00:02:37.080> one<00:02:37.710> thing<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.430> lot

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
should be clear now one thing that a lot

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.030 
should be clear now one thing that a lot
of<00:02:38.640> people<00:02:38.730> don't<00:02:39.360> uh<00:02:39.630> don't<00:02:39.960> believe<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.980> that
