00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.920 
of those obviously you've got doors that
open<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.119> both<00:01:54.329> sides

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.090 

again<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.260> really<00:01:58.530> neat<00:01:58.710> features

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
again one of the really neat features

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.830 
again one of the really neat features
about<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.610> model<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.510> way<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.780> he

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
about this model is the way that he

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.660 
about this model is the way that he
designed<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:01.409> hood<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.250> way<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> hood

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
designed the hood and the way the hood

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.880 
designed the hood and the way the hood
flips<00:02:02.970> up<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.170> flip<00:02:10.440> forward

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
flips up this is just a flip forward

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.360 
flips up this is just a flip forward
just<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.190> really<00:02:11.490> neat<00:02:11.640> mechanism

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.270 

okay<00:02:16.370> obviously<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.940> engine<00:02:17.240> in<00:02:17.360> there<00:02:18.280> that

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
okay obviously the engine in there that

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.640 
okay obviously the engine in there that
is<00:02:19.550> that<00:02:19.850> reciprocate<00:02:20.480> saz<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.900> depending<00:02:21.590> on

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
is that reciprocate saz you depending on

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.500 
is that reciprocate saz you depending on
what<00:02:21.710> gear<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.370> have<00:02:22.520> an<00:02:22.640> end<00:02:22.790> up<00:02:22.880> there<00:02:23.060> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
what gear you have an end up there the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.230 
what gear you have an end up there the
the<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.590> Pistons<00:02:25.130> reciprocate<00:02:25.760> as<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.030> roll

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
the the Pistons reciprocate as you roll

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.460

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
there's just a real good look at it from

there's just a real good look at it from
the<00:04:59.040> front<00:04:59.720> let's<00:05:00.720> take<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.870> good<00:05:01.050> look<00:05:01.230> at<00:05:01.440> it

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
the front let's take a good look at it

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:09.770 
the front let's take a good look at it
from<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.800> inside

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.909 

like<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:10.930> said<00:05:10.990> in<00:05:11.229> the<00:05:11.319> beginning<00:05:11.410> all<00:05:11.889> the

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
like I said in the beginning all the

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.770 
like I said in the beginning all the
steer<00:05:12.310> there<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:12.610> no<00:05:12.759> hand<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.090> God<00:05:13.270> steering

all the steering is done via the

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:26.430 
all the steering is done via the
steering<00:05:16.449> wheel<00:05:16.629> inside<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.289> cab<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.930> as<00:05:26.319> you

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
steering wheel inside the cab and as you

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.879 
steering wheel inside the cab and as you
can<00:05:26.560> see<00:05:26.620> here<00:05:27.069> you've<00:05:27.400> got<00:05:27.840> your<00:05:28.840> shifter<00:05:29.289> and

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
can see here you've got your shifter and

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.430 
can see here you've got your shifter and
the<00:05:30.129> your<00:05:30.639> four-speed<00:05:31.120> shifter<00:05:31.569> there<00:05:32.199> is<00:05:32.289> no

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
the your four-speed shifter there is no

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.279 
the your four-speed shifter there is no
reverse<00:05:32.830> but<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.669> four<00:05:33.879> speeds<00:05:34.210> are<00:05:34.419> in<00:05:34.629> will

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
reverse but the four speeds are in will

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.200 
reverse but the four speeds are in will
you<00:05:35.409> call<00:05:35.710> your<00:05:35.740> standard<00:05:36.340> configuration<00:05:37.030> so

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
you call your standard configuration so

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.559 
you call your standard configuration so
there<00:05:37.360> would<00:05:37.509> be<00:05:37.539> first<00:05:37.870> gear<00:05:38.199> second<00:05:39.159> gear

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
there would be first gear second gear

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.439 
there would be first gear second gear
slide<00:05:40.569> it<00:05:40.720> over<00:05:40.870> up<00:05:41.199> third<00:05:41.710> gear<00:05:41.979> and<00:05:42.360> all<00:05:43.360> the

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
slide it over up third gear and all the

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.689 
slide it over up third gear and all the
way<00:05:43.539> back<00:05:43.780> there<00:05:44.080> is<00:05:44.289> fourth<00:05:44.560> gear<00:05:44.800> and<00:05:45.580> all

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
way back there is fourth gear and all

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.120 
way back there is fourth gear and all
this<00:05:45.819> does<00:05:46.090> is<00:05:46.300> as<00:05:46.780> you<00:05:47.169> as<00:05:47.380> you<00:05:47.500> roll<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.889> card

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
this does is as you as you roll the card

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.399 
this does is as you as you roll the card
at<00:05:48.310> a<00:05:48.340> constant<00:05:48.759> speed<00:05:48.909> and<00:05:49.419> you<00:05:49.810> shift<00:05:50.020> gears

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
at a constant speed and you shift gears

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.770 
at a constant speed and you shift gears
that<00:05:50.800> changes<00:05:51.190> the<00:05:51.280> gear<00:05:51.460> ratio<00:05:51.849> which

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
that changes the gear ratio which

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.710 
that changes the gear ratio which
changes<00:05:53.289> how<00:05:53.349> quickly<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:54.130> engine<00:05:54.720> the

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
changes how quickly the engine the

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.879 
changes how quickly the engine the
Pistons<00:05:56.110> and<00:05:56.259> the<00:05:56.380> engine<00:05:56.650> reciprocate<00:05:57.220> so<00:06:01.889> my

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
Pistons and the engine reciprocate so my

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.770 
Pistons and the engine reciprocate so my
