00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 we will all be working yeast today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:14.009
 Natural or yeast ever we need remo 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:16.730
 a very little flour and water while 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.730
 a little water 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.580
 the name from a little flour 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:55.270
 a pastel of this with accommodations 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:59.360
 now the only thing to do to make that 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.520
 the bacteria in the air transform 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.580
 starch flour and sugar 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.970
 simple to activate the process 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.070
 leavening is to put the 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.790
 lid of a container above without 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.350
 contained the impact tomorrow of living here 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:22.240
 in for two days after that 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.240
 take another water 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.040
 in the other peoples farini I look forward to how 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.540
 base with a flour that I am more 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.920
 often that you are not one of the first 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.360
 cinematographic that I am not among other things 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.930
 like this one of the bread will mix this 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:50.820
 operation will have to be done every two days 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:55.310
 for 16 days he is aware of 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:03.930
 above without closing and never leaving 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:13.310
 arrived on the sixteenth day they arrive 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:16.110
 immediately an engine acted after which 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.820
 but we can refresh a dossier with 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.350
 all the flours we use 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.940
 usually the various networks you are 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.850
 mainly they are the same as they are 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.680
 manitoba flour 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.220
 as I said before the senator of 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.860
 ground and kamut flour to a 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.670
 refreshment that happens that I do 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.360
 usually every 48 hours 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:48.230
 I add a little of the flour that I 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:48.230
 I use water with a pillow 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.920
 burns 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:09.980
 remember that the sourdough for 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.350
 always use from the refreshed three 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.890
 hours before 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.260
 always remember that every maximum 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.000
 three days keeping it in the refrigerator must 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:29.500
 be fresh always putting it as of 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.500
 water could not tell 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.000
 one last thing if it happens to 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.700
 leave not being able to draw the debt it 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.310
 make it harder 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.710
 propose a card inside 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.160
 component tissue in freezer that 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.140
 so much bacteria inside 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.070
 by saying bergamo calmly 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.550
 when you come back just let it thaw 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.720
 put a little water and flour e 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.940
 start over with the process of 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.390
 rehabilitation for example this is a 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.739
 yeast that years around four years and 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.360
 half that gets fresh when I need it 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.450
 begins to cool today 8 October 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.190
 hours seems like a kilo and quote 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:33.930
 if they use two primary end 2 kg 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:39.260
 remember that for every kilo of flour 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.260
 we will be friends from 200 to 300 grams 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.020
 this is yeast 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.490
 after a rising night pro 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.100
 naturally in the refrigerator more or less a 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.940
 4 created because this would be the strength 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.450
 also released in from within the 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.450
 jar 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.419
 an alexander show and the next 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.419
 recipe
