00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 this matter that we are going to represent now 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.049
 It's very special for us. 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.389
 the owner met the architect 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.700
 andrea on why she saw one of her 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.910
 projects in our magazine and liked both 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.580
 who hired the project that was the cover of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.770
 kaza south magazine of august 2012 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.460
 It bears the signature of the brand he decorates 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.460
 company 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.429
 we are here to show you a little 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.460
 more about the project than the cover 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.410
 South kaza magazine is this project started 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.719
 a year and a half ago with the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.000
 development of the architect he is 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.770
 a land which was in a way good 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.530
 in the development of the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.410
 because it is small but 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.180
 requires a proposal from owners who 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.250
 wanted lots of integration of the residence 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.410
 with the environment rather integration of 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.949
 environments and this was the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.309
 project is on top of this proposal to 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.739
 developed a contemporary project 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.750
 working in a more current language and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.670
 working architect looking 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.930
 to explore the most of what we had 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.420
 of garden 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.850
 so we developed a ladder that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.960
 it integrates peace on land with 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.900
 the upper 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.900
 it is also in an open way that ends 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.390
 ended up creating an internal garden underneath 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.430
 of her that ended up adding and if 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.390
 inserting the whole context of the area 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.390
 social cover 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.680
 on entering the house we are faced with 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.140
 whole integrated social area 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.900
 we see the book in the foreground in 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.790
 which has the verticalization of the project with 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.890
 the incidence of illumination to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.850
 We have a central fireplace that divides 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.770
 the social being with the intimate being in the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.600
 thinking about this same integration is the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.670
 The dining room has two doors 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.190
 running as soon as they are 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.250
 open they also integrate the area of 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.250
 barbecue grill 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.930
 this barbecue got inside her 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.659
 an area of space it is covered all 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.200
 with glazed area both on the ceiling and 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.200
 on its sides 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.720
 the proposal to bring her into the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.650
 house was just to supply the garden 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.650
 which was not so great 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.730
 the kitchen is designed to be a 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.860
 gourmet kitchen 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.570
 so it integrates both the barbecue 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.570
 As for the dining area 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.670
 as soon as we reach the second floor 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.980
 of the House 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.530
 the first view we have is the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.840
 home theater that was developed from 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.240
 to be able to receive all the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.860
 residents of the house was then placed in 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.290
 a very wide sofa extremely 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.770
 comfortable all of them with chefs 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.730
 retractable to the entire automation part of the 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.700
 home theater 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.090
 it was developed embedded in the ceiling 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.730
 Why stay in a cleaner way? 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.050
 and there were no boxes 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.050
 of sound 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.069
 the couple's suite 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.719
 it was actually developed as the 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.239
 heart of the house, right? 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:23.349
 then it is a super large space where 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.750
 We have a large glass window 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.840
 which brings lots of light and lots of 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.260
 visibility to another outside area is 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.049
 Because of this we put 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.269
 television at the front but it was 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.030
 worked a hydraulic lift that 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.950
 makes this television low and it 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.950
 is hidden inside this property 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.040
 at the customer's request the suite bathroom 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.570
 was developed as a space where 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.760
 she could relax 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.840
 so we have a bathtub space 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.600
 is and next to one the step transforms 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.840
 in a small area with shades where it can 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:13.670
 rest and have your moment of 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:16.580
 relax and just next to the tub people 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.130
 has the box that was worked two 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.480
 showers to keep a 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.480
 bit of the couple's privacy 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.730
 daughter's suite was 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.430
 most romantic way then we have 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.120
 we keep the idea of ​​the clear tonality 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.950
 but with some touch of green and horn 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.800
 where we were able to explore 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.860
 working charles cushions and giving 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.160
 this city ​​grace with brightness and fabrics 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.010
 the more dense it is in the center of the 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.490
 your room to television placement 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.340
 that divides the sleeping area and area 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.660
 studies and this television has a 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.669
 vertical where we get is 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.250
 rotate the television to watch 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.270
 both part of the bed and the part 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.640
 of the study 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.450
 the fidi guests was developed to 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:15.080
 meet visitors and also the daughter 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.460
 older as you would with 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.970
 spend the weekend in the house of 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.200
 parents 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.950
 then it was developed in a way 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.560
 more neutral is without a character of 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:28.510
 male or female for us to power 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.510
 meet the need of the moment 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.280
 wealth in the composition of all 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.950
 finishes was very important 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.500
 partnership with marily de corda that 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.540
 provided the wallpapers that were 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.320
 applied throughout the residence 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.540
 curtains 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.020
 carpets and all objects of 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.020
 decoration 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.220
 the consultant monreal she was 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.560
 very important for the implementation of 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.200
 project because she was able to translate 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.670
 faithfully everything that was designed by the 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.920
 office 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.960
 in the work that you can see today 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.090
 so they performed all the work 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.400
 worked with all the finishes of 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.560
 skirting boards 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.080
 everything was executed following the 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.510
 detailing the office to completion 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.470
 that I shot of a project like this is 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.500
 that when customers can give us 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:27.080
 all the necessary confidence makes 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.640
 a project when we work 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.510
 we specify when we think 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.880

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.730
