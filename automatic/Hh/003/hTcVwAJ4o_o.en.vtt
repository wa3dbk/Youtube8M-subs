00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.710
 hello youtubers 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.340
 incredible but true this channel has 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.260
 77 subscribers 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.209
 that's why I'll do the tag of 50 things 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.930
 about me but to do it a little more 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.359
 special will be 37 the reason why I 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.400
 I'm so glad that they are 77 is that the 7 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.529
 it's my favorite number I've never put 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.150
 false eyelashes and if one day then 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.909
 I think it will be a real catastrophe 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.100
 when I was little I watched the film pocahontas de 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:35.350
 Disney I wanted to imitate the mane of the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.239
 protagonist and I left my hair super 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.100
 long until the second that I 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.350
 I married and I cut it at neck level 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.360
 I have the habit of associating my 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.610
 favorite songs to the people to whom 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.260
 want and then if those people I 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.880
 fail or hurt me because the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.440
 consequence he pays on all that 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.810
 song that I can not return to 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.040
 listening as a child I wanted to be lara 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.990
 croft 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.680
 I do not know why but I get stuck 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.810
 accents to the moment my favorite place of 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.660
 whole world is london there I feel 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.390
 super comfortable with the customs with the 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.900
 language and good is london I'm going to 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.810
 say about him until very recently I had the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.990
 full room but absolutely full of 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.330
 posters I do not know the reason but from 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.810
 I've had very good resistance to the 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.990
 food that burns and the truth is that if 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.330
 someone asks me hey this dish burns 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.870
 or not because I can not say it because it is 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.760
 that does not affect me at all 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.070
 I can not leave without something put in the 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.620
 my left wrist many years ago my 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.290
 Grandma gave me a black bracelet but 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.350
 the partridge was broken and now what I have 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.950
 it's a coda I started with youtube in the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.810
 year 2007 and the account is still active 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.120
 what happens I try to keep it a little 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.120
 secretly because it's ridiculous 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.380
 he played the piano piano and sang but 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.979
 I am very bad malísima touching the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.659
 guitar my favorite smell is lavender 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.119
 I spent a whole day in london 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.989
 looking for a disk or several of joan jett 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.540
 In the end I found it and I have not yet 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.250
 released as a child I thought that 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.950
 blender blades were of 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.880
 plastic or foam rubber so one day 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.610
 you check, I cut myself, I had the honor of 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.940
 meet pierce trosman the old 007 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.000
 and the truth is that he was gorgeous yet 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.110
 I keep my stuffed from childhood 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.940
 write a diary 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.400
 I think that if some day I have a daughter 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.190
 I'll call emma because it's pronounced the same 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.290
 in English and Spanish and it is also a 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.720
 of my favorite heroines written by 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.730
 full you've always wanted to have a 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.950
 horse or a unicorn 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.989
 I have been and still am a big fan of 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.150
 jonas brothers when they came to madrid 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.610
 three years ago to give one of the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.590
 concerts I was one of those crazy fans 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.500
 that came out in the magazines screaming 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.560
 today and crying but the truth is that 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.420
 I knew very very good people I have a 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.680
 piggy bank where I only keep money for 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.230
 travel in the future with my best friend 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.659
 at 14 he wrote a book and did not 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.299
 I have no idea where it is 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.879
 I have a terrible panic to the pigeons 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.659
 the dogs to the seagulls and to the 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.659
 surgical operations 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.660
 I have not met anyone who has 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.730
 same dimples as me but let's never 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.150
 they have made me feel 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.190
 I love to go by bike and swim I cry a lot 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.810
 with any movie made of 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.630
 small my parents had me 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.760
 requisition the pinocho movie and dumbo 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.540
 I believe in ghosts and in life 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.540
 alien 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.330
 I love re decorating my room one and 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.040
 again and move the furniture 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.310
 I constantly have the bad habit 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.800
 of feeling offended to the minimum if I go 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.780
 down the street and someone says ugly though 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.580
 I do not know anything about it, I think I 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.970
 is saying to me and then I had a 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.950
 little bad I will have spent thousands and thousands of 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.040
 hours playing the sims is that it's 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.560
 addictive I let myself be carried away by my 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.810
 prejudices thing that I do not like because 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.610
 I always judge a person at first 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.820
 view and the truth is that it should 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.250
 change it and my historical characters 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.830
 favorites are enrique eighth and maría 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.310
 antonieta is curious because one cuts the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.620
 head and the other cut off his head 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.360
 I've always wanted to take the car and go to 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.970
 Nowhere 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.250
 I have the frenulum super short and in fact 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.980
 As a child it was very difficult for me to say 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.160
 letter r if I read a conversation of 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.830
 whatsapp or any chat I put 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.840
 little voices what is quite funny I 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.120
 5 movies are missing to have the 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.310

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.860
