00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello you love that again 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.179
 has switched to a new video 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.900
 on the children's channel of 9999 things and 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.580
 yes we are not a pure children's channel 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.810
 Teenagers look here to mom's dads 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 and also bastl fans and I have today 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.060
 once again something made and was one 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.769
 pocket liters many may have 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.529
 seen that I have a cell phone case 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.529
 tinkered violet and also a 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.930
 I have embellished the exercise book and I had 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.250
 still paper scraps left and thought 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.570
 I 'm just doing something nice 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.500
 violetta of it 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.610
 and so he looks now I explain 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.980
 a little bit what I did 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.710
 I've got textured paper 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.079
 taken and that is so too small 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.110
 golden shimmer in the camera looks yellow 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.039
 but that's a bit off 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.230
 held gold and you see this 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.879
 structures on it and let's start 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.070
 a first fold at i have here 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.580
 completely a postcard stuck on it 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.590
 because I found this motif so beautiful 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.119
 have and now have here of course 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.390
 divorce rights are cut out with 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.369
 violet and these two worshipers and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.619
 I thought the saying fits in well 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.580
 it does not work without it 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.170
 and all that I have a bit 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.790
 with my zigzag scissors 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.460
 have cut out here yet heart out 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.119
 glued and on the side such rhinestones 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.630
 steinchen 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.270
 they go down to the second one 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.630
 case you stand the rest of the postcard 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.520
 and here again violet and hers 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.799
 girlfriends the whole I have one 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.710
 bit on it with rubber glued to it 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.049
 it settles a bit and also 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.470
 I have the complete violetta on me 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.470
 recognized 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.810
 and yes, here's a heartfelt one 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.570
 I have still put in brace here 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.520
 I glued you to it and 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.520
 Here below you can see the rest of the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.390
 Violet I see that this is so 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.119
 a bit dependent 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.179
 and of course the Disney purple 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.700
 character 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.260
 I also stuck it with rubber 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.109
 I have a few stickers left here 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.430
 made and the whole thing was left 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.950
 and right you see the rhinestone 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.359
 Steinchen and I think it would have more 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.709
 That should not be allowed 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.680
 been overloaded 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.170
 and yes you can see that easy 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.639
 to tinker a pocket letter who is now 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.609
 I do not know the pocket letter is me 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.900
 will again a separately now 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.150
 separate video to turn because I 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.099
 but many got questions what 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.730
 pocket letter is why you pocket liters 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:46.060
 I think that's what happens now 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.819
 in 12 video later I explain to you 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.060
 the whole thing again so that's mine 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.419
 julia pocket letter and just out 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.069
 some paper pages a few stickers 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:03.159
 and of course newspaper clippings 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.709
 from the respective star d-mark and 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.060
 unfortunately the pop is done that way 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.400
 from me 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.599
 I thank you for seeing and hope 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.109

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.109
