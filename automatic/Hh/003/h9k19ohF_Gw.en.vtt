one<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.490> there<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:49.439> installation<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
one in there the installation is the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.499 
one in there the installation is the
reverse<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:52.130> taking<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.220> out<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.729> pretty

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
reverse of the taking it out so pretty

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.020 
reverse of the taking it out so pretty
simply<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> new<00:01:56.340> filter<00:01:56.579> push<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
simply just get the new filter push it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.660 
simply just get the new filter push it
back<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.920> put<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.950> glovebox<00:01:59.280> back

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
back in and put the glovebox back

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.920 
back in and put the glovebox back
together<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> spring-loaded

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
together and this is the spring-loaded

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.370 
together and this is the spring-loaded
cable<00:02:04.100> it's<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.219> spring-loaded<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.380> dampens

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
cable it's a spring-loaded so it dampens

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.669 
cable it's a spring-loaded so it dampens
the<00:02:08.310> coming<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.509> glove<00:02:10.080> box<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.590> it

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
the coming out of the glove box so it

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.050 
the coming out of the glove box so it
doesn't<00:02:10.920> come<00:02:11.039> too<00:02:11.220> fast<00:02:11.459> when<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:11.849> full

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
doesn't come too fast when it's full

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.270 
doesn't come too fast when it's full
that's<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:13.020> purpose<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.680> cable

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
that's the purpose of this cable

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.770 
that's the purpose of this cable
and<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.090> put<00:02:15.240> everything<00:02:15.450> back<00:02:15.630> together

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
and you put everything back together

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.890 
and you put everything back together
just<00:02:16.680> put<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.920> cable<00:02:17.250> back<00:02:17.460> on<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.030> you're

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
just put the cable back on it and you're

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.850 
just put the cable back on it and you're
ready<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.140> roll<00:02:19.460> thanks<00:02:20.460> for<00:02:20.580> watching
