00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.160
 with two wins in a row, they mainly 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.429
 a grand at psv fc eindhoven for the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.349
 home game against Belgian agent 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.599
 two weeks ago it was won 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.849
 the national team of thailand 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.550
 and last week the team from 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.520
 attyfoot at fokker each door by 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.400
 winning sc outfielder 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.279
 and now the Belgian agent is visiting 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.220
 and immediately the opening phase for psv is there 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.800
 we said good kill put here from myrthe 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.980
 moorrees 11 plays 3 minutes early 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.079
 namely the lead for PSV FC 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.850
 eindhoven 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.309
 went through well twice 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.829
 nice chance to play then 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.469
 clips two questions and for an empty purpose 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.539
 is it then easy to slide in 1 0 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.530
 so be for pff by a goal 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.530
 myrthe moorrees 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.780
 npcf said we keep attacking 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.609
 the holes are big in defense 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.489
 from the border and here the chance of daria 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.140
 coal and this time a rescue 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.700
 nicky a question 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.700
 good attempt by the outdoor player 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.170
 but i could stand there the kicked 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.150
 goal scorers myrthe moorrees 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.540
 completely free of the rear of the donk 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.220
 meulen therefore and then it is already whole 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.500
 fast 2 0 completely released first 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.590
 city â€‹â€‹that is here from the donk and also 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.869
 vermeulen is not covered state 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.790
 in the right place and so this just ask 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.409
 For the second time in a short time many 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.820
 true but psv there are deaf continues 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.260
 here from the donk 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.710
 brought down 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.510
 [Applause] 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.000
 breakthrough player or not it seems 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.940
 yes it is just waiting for the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.150
 decision of referee bierings 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.760
 stomach and noses the defender 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.300
 agent actually knows enough about the 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.160
 red card is showing chips no 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.610
 Question is then ubs where it is called one 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.040
 clear scoring opportunity taken away and so 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.180
 a red card 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.670
 moreese with the free kick and this time 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.650
 then sit down for the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.890
 visitors from belgium also called the box one 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.890
 played 25 minutes 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.780
 208 with ten more 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.250
 and then nadia coal comes again 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:34.930
 from the right and b it is formula 3 0 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:38.500
 played less than half an hour and then 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.250
 it was a very tough evening for the ordinary 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.260
 from agent and therefore also a very nice one 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.480
 that of psv fc eindhoven 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.880
 here again to coal again 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.680
 cross 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.250
 now once worked me away again 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.480
 not too good farmer had pics at once 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.130
 passed two men 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.960
 vermeulen stands again for the goal and 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.000
 again it can be tasted 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.010
 of the peak 403 times 35 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.620
 played for minutes 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.380
 what a wonderful evening for her good 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.380
 brother's action 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.010
 vermeulen was in the right place again 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.550
 she 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.370
 nicky question was perhaps another 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.980
 to suggested then it goes in the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.090
 second half not much better at the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.810
 Belgium 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.810
 here a handball 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.490
 free kick for psv fc eindhoven 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.120
 good position have some 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.260
 players with a good kick moorrees 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.810
 is one of them 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.340
 borat but also this daniel from the donk 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.230
 5 0 and she is very happy with that 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.050
 the donk 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.450
 through the wall it looks like one 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.140
 ask on the wrong foot 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.700
 [Music] 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.880
 and then she and nothing can cope 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.880
 change 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.920
 then the five stands for then you can 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.010
 they give some playful rest of the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.080
 I have been injured for a long time and as well 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.659
 the time to let your players 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.159
 debuting in the bene league like glenn 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.799
 there van lieshout look here the construction 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.299
 first ball contact 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.989
 and if something him very neat inside one 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.989
 day of the goal 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.519
 again a good coal pass 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.990
 runs well 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.430
 And then you can say that this is tight 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.169
 shot in the intersection and yes what 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.789
 will it go through her head I you 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.789
 a question 6 goal against 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.180
 and then plate it worse for her and 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.729
 her teammates formula 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.789
 faster than the defense of Ghent 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.370
 way to the goal but this is good 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.960
 defended by sylvana tieleman encoder 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.960
 but for PSV FC Eindhoven 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.180
 but vermeulen was looking for a4 a day 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.870
 and morris with the corner there is again 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.620
 vermeulen there is every fourth source 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.669
 good in your head 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.669
 bouvy come out 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:15.389
 7 0 the intermediate position between PSVs you 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.760
 by the agent much more than everyone else 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.169
 but it was expected in advance 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.880
 scoreboard also gives real 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:26.520
 7 0 arrives therefore by their eighth 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.530
 farmer is lockable from a distance she seems 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.419
 to go about it still on the bar 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.760
 it remains 7 0 but what a good one 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.130
 victory of PSV FC Eindhoven 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.099
 Yes, it actually scores again 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.270
 good result so very satisfied then not 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.940
 scored once but then you do it 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.750
 tens 4 times yes yes well in principle 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.700
 were common place today 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.870
 and the first three were actually on one 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.630
 the same way we got there this week 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.070
 trained on and the last one was from one 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.840
 corner so that was finally done 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.640
 once beautiful and proud to you 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.780
 opponent but we are competition 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.520
 picked up well 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.740
 little green goes with a red card 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.500
 that's really one of all of us 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.120
 beautiful evening and pretty good football 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.450
 nice football show very much 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.500

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.580
 promotion what can be for 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.640

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.500
 to and want to win against aa gent 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.060
 this is the stand after these games 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.419
 the benelux therefore is a leader 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.550
 followed by ajax and fc twente psv fc 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:24.520
 Eindhoven is in 8th place and goes 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.870
 Tuesday evening visiting FC Twente 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.450
 another home game is waiting on Friday 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.780
 then anderlecht opponent on 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.780
 re-entry
