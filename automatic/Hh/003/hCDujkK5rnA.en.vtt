00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:02.250
 Well 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.180
 women's tears creates a romantic 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.410
 the atmosphere is not only in Hollywood films 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.899
 according to the informant 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.139
 she know from personal experience in which there is 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.740
 if you order this project from men 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.160
 medicine when i cry they become 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.189
 more gentle sensitive to 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.829
 sometimes japan passionate 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:20.300
 situations 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.789
 later however recent research 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.949
 showed that if a man is 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.300
 close enough to this to feel 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.269
 the smell of female tears effect is obtained 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.069
 directly opposite 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:32.600
 the issue of law of occupation 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.940
 amazing that seriously not 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.540
 considered about it of course it was possible 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.770
 guess but then we will be surprised if 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.350
 the project will succeed in this background from the institute 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.760
 Weizmann in Israel 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.350
 told that his research 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.800
 set the following parameters for a man 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.789
 smelling female tears 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.679
 blood testosterone levels drop by 10 15 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.110
 percent 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.120
 plans to collect more than some 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.460
 chemical reaction 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.540
 probably after breaking up 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.650
 i used to he 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.930
 one of the six women who provided 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.910
 scholarly material shedding tears but 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.420
 melodrama I shut up nasty and other 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.440
 sad Finns for her 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.190
 detected effect may have 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.200
 therapeutic value for example for 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.130
 reduce testosterone levels 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.340
 prostate cancer patients and sometimes 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.850
 completely harmless and treatment methods 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.970
 honorary residents of this region are planning 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.050
 also study the effect of childhood tears 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.240
 on the body of adults and that's what men 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.330
 tears have a particular effect on 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.530
 women are noted by many including 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.910
 politicians such as ex-president george 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.340
 bush 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.490
 and the current speaker of the chamber 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.490
 representatives john baner 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.369
 side lane 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.740
 I'm sure men call a woman 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.859
 a surge of tenderness analysis seems to me 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.009
 it's so touching as if you 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.799
 opens and the quivering side 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.990
 male character she changed the money 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.659
 played but everyone knows local 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.860
 feelings strengthens feelings 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.380
 The woman with whom we spoke believed that 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.880
 tears make them men 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.049
 more sexy
