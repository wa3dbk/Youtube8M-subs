00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 Once the fresh minimize file that contains Think how many there are aliens 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.630
 Inactive material is good because of sulfuric acid 7 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:17.789
 You think this is the problem that we have won the least fruit 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.199
 When you are harvesting your nutrients over time as your time passes by 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.939
 It will be lost. 4 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:29.670
 So when you have the nutrients at its peak , 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:33.000
 Storing can reduce nutrient losses, so when you look at it 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.360
 Frozen foods may be better . 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.280
 4 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 In fact, this food survey was the first time that frozen vegetables and shelves were minimized. 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:48.660
 I did a comparison and compared the various things I did, but I was in the fresh corner 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:53.460
 It seemed frozen rather than something that actually frozen off nutrients are confident 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:58.559
 Since the things that vegetables have become nutrients are also confirmed, 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:02.250
 287 was also frozen foods are nutrient poor do not get that verdict jyeotdaneun 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.880
 If these are little changed with all bachyeoteu all your Example 4 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.860
 I am able to type a cold add 6s a little more 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.700
 I'd rather just freeze in a bar to be tied in the fridge. 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.229
 Ah 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 There are a lot of attempts, for example . 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.520
 Internal injuries have I tried the strawberry experiment 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:28.470
 Fresh strawberries, unlike me mates, and now has been stored in the freezer refrigerator not gel daughter 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:33.360
 What did the moon's surface so what tests have total vitamin c 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:38.610
 There's total antioxidants and polyphenols, a very good physiology. 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:44.130
 It's an active problem . I'll compare three of them . Frozen strawberries are fresh strawberries. 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:48.509
 There was not much difference, but I kept it in the refrigerator for about a week. 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:54.299
 Total polyphenol content decreased by 81%. 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:56.310
 Another 19% of vitamin c and antioxidants here are 23% Very 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.390
 It is said to have decreased significantly 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.549
 So when we bring in a little bit of what we want at home, 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:10.259
 Saenggipnida geotyiraneunde to give us this or would label again 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:16.400
 When you'd rather extreme cases ssaeksi to spend a day or two just leave it neogeul 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.400
 I think it's one way to freeze the rest.
