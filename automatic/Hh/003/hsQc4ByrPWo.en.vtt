will do is get these chips off and put
them<00:00:55.190> onto<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.700> sea<00:00:55.940> is<00:00:56.060> so<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.630> CIS<00:00:57.050> works<00:00:57.350> so

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
them onto the sea is so the CIS works so

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.710 
them onto the sea is so the CIS works so
get<00:00:58.490> a<00:00:58.520> pointed<00:00:59.000> blade<00:00:59.329> put<00:00:59.990> it<00:01:00.140> underneath

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
get a pointed blade put it underneath

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.850 
get a pointed blade put it underneath
and<00:01:02.720> click<00:01:03.020> it<00:01:03.170> off<00:01:04.390> back<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:05.720> tip<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.590> picked

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
and click it off back to tip this picked

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.790 
sticking to that knife the back is still
sticky<00:01:12.009> then<00:01:13.009> you<00:01:13.579> have<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:13.850> get<00:01:14.090> your<00:01:14.570> CIF<00:01:15.500> and

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800

just for example we'll get the small

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.760 
just for example we'll get the small
black<00:01:22.040> from<00:01:22.940> here<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.390> take<00:01:23.690> off<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.530> thing

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
black from here and take off the thing

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.460 
black from here and take off the thing
we've<00:01:25.280> got<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.460> put<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.729> chip<00:01:26.049> where<00:01:27.049> it<00:01:27.260> was

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
we've got to put the chip where it was

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.710 
we've got to put the chip where it was
on<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:29.710> cartridge<00:01:30.710> on<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.640> sea<00:01:31.820> is<00:01:31.970> so

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
on the cartridge on to the sea is so

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.260 
on the cartridge on to the sea is so
it's<00:01:32.870> pretty<00:01:33.049> simple<00:01:33.320> just<00:01:33.770> stick<00:01:34.760> it<00:01:34.970> onto

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
it's pretty simple just stick it onto

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.109 
it's pretty simple just stick it onto
their<00:01:39.040> there<00:01:40.040> that's<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.729> chip<00:01:40.940> is

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
their there that's it the chip is

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.480 
their there that's it the chip is
swapped<00:01:41.600> over<00:01:42.080> now<00:01:42.409> this<00:01:42.590> five<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:43.040> them<00:01:43.159> to<00:01:43.310> do

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
swapped over now this five of them to do

colors there is five of those to do
that's<00:01:48.440> all<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.619> do<00:01:48.770> with<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:48.979> chip<00:01:49.220> if<00:01:49.520> it

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
that's all you do with the chip if it

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.200 
that's all you do with the chip if it
isn't<00:01:50.540> sticky<00:01:51.010> just<00:01:52.010> put<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.220> bit<00:01:52.670> of<00:01:52.700> glue<00:01:52.970> the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
isn't sticky just put a bit of glue the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.000 
isn't sticky just put a bit of glue the
other<00:01:53.330> side<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:53.900> stick<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.200> down<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.770> leave
