00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
it's pretty cool the idea is pretty cool

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.140 
it's pretty cool the idea is pretty cool
it's<00:00:44.620> two<00:00:44.800> weapons<00:00:45.190> in<00:00:45.280> one<00:00:45.460> it<00:00:45.640> is<00:00:45.730> a<00:00:45.820> shotgun

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.850 
it's two weapons in one it is a shotgun
and<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.629> heavy<00:00:46.809> weapon<00:00:47.170> so<00:00:47.320> all<00:00:47.379> you<00:00:47.470> have<00:00:47.590> to<00:00:47.710> do

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
and a heavy weapon so all you have to do

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.110 
and a heavy weapon so all you have to do
is<00:00:48.040> when<00:00:48.220> you're<00:00:48.370> playing<00:00:48.489> whether<00:00:48.699> you<00:00:48.879> press

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
is when you're playing whether you press

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.180 
is when you're playing whether you press
left<00:00:49.600> on<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.840> d-pad<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.440> this<00:00:50.620> weapon<00:00:50.920> turns

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
left on the d-pad and this weapon turns

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.310 
left on the d-pad and this weapon turns
into<00:00:51.399> a<00:00:51.579> shotgun<00:00:51.970> now<00:00:52.600> as<00:00:52.690> far<00:00:52.870> as<00:00:52.930> for<00:00:53.200> heavy

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
into a shotgun now as far as for heavy

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.080 
into a shotgun now as far as for heavy
weapons<00:00:53.739> it<00:00:53.920> is<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.130> fastest<00:00:54.520> heavy<00:00:54.700> weapon

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
weapons it is the fastest heavy weapon

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.360 
weapons it is the fastest heavy weapon
in<00:00:55.180> its<00:00:55.329> category<00:00:55.660> meaning<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.649> mobility<00:00:57.190> is

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
in its category meaning the mobility is

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.760 
in its category meaning the mobility is
actually<00:00:57.880> faster<00:00:58.390> than<00:00:58.899> most<00:00:59.200> of<00:00:59.469> the<00:00:59.590> heavy

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
actually faster than most of the heavy

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.680 
actually faster than most of the heavy
weapons<00:00:59.950> out<00:01:00.250> there<00:01:00.309> ok<00:01:01.180> now<00:01:01.329> there's<00:01:01.540> two

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
weapons out there ok now there's two

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.389 
weapons out there ok now there's two
variants<00:01:01.989> we<00:01:02.079> have<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.380> armed<00:01:02.559> werewolf<00:01:03.219> and

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
variants we have the armed werewolf and

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.030 
variants we have the armed werewolf and
then<00:01:04.059> we<00:01:04.210> have<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.509> regular<00:01:04.869> old<00:01:05.110> on<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.740> olam

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
then we have the regular old on the olam

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.889 
then we have the regular old on the olam
werewolf<00:01:06.520> has<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.700> negative<00:01:07.180> one<00:01:07.330> accuracy<00:01:07.780> but

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
werewolf has a negative one accuracy but

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:09.510 
werewolf has a negative one accuracy but
has<00:01:08.050> two<00:01:08.140> plus<00:01:08.380> one<00:01:08.410> mobility<00:01:09.070> so<00:01:09.190> obviously

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
has two plus one mobility so obviously

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.830 
has two plus one mobility so obviously
this<00:01:09.700> would<00:01:09.880> be<00:01:09.910> for<00:01:10.210> players<00:01:10.450> who<00:01:10.539> like<00:01:10.780> to

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
this would be for players who like to

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.359 
this would be for players who like to
rush<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.140> little<00:01:11.440> bit<00:01:11.530> more<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:11.920> then<00:01:12.280> the

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
rush a little bit more and then the

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.980 
rush a little bit more and then the
regular<00:01:12.700> old<00:01:12.910> home<00:01:13.090> will<00:01:13.450> be<00:01:13.539> for<00:01:13.720> players

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
regular old home will be for players

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.870 
regular old home will be for players
that<00:01:14.110> you<00:01:14.649> know<00:01:14.770> what<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:15.190> most<00:01:15.310> accuracy<00:01:15.789> is

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
that you know what the most accuracy is

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.609 
that you know what the most accuracy is
possible<00:01:16.330> with<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.479> weapon<00:01:16.899> and<00:01:17.050> then<00:01:17.470> of

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
possible with a weapon and then of

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.380 
possible with a weapon and then of
course<00:01:17.649> don't<00:01:18.369> like<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.850> rush<00:01:19.000> as<00:01:19.149> much

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
course don't like to rush as much

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.150 
course don't like to rush as much
obviously<00:01:20.170> we<00:01:20.320> have<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.560> regular<00:01:20.890> red

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
obviously we have the regular red

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.800 
obviously we have the regular red
outside<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.789> therm<00:01:22.030> or<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.270> target<00:01:22.570> hand<00:01:22.750> so

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
outside the therm or the target hand so

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.779 
outside the therm or the target hand so
they<00:01:22.930> ACOG<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.319> laser<00:01:23.470> side<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:23.860> stock<00:01:24.160> extend

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
they ACOG the laser side to stock extend

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.609 
they ACOG the laser side to stock extend
the<00:01:24.850> max<00:01:25.060> quick-draw<00:01:25.600> parabolic<00:01:26.200> microphone

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
the max quick-draw parabolic microphone

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.620 
the max quick-draw parabolic microphone
that<00:01:26.770> that's<00:01:27.039> rightfully<00:01:27.550> we<00:01:28.030> even<00:01:28.179> have<00:01:28.450> on

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
that that's rightfully we even have on

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.150 
that that's rightfully we even have on
rapid-fire<00:01:29.350> for<00:01:29.770> those<00:01:29.860> of<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.039> guys<00:01:30.100> who

want to increase the actual fire rate of
this<00:01:32.709> weapon<00:01:33.119> obviously<00:01:34.119> as<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.390> guys<00:01:34.539> put

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
this weapon obviously as you guys put

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.029 
this weapon obviously as you guys put
attachments<00:01:35.140> it'll<00:01:35.349> increase<00:01:35.679> or<00:01:35.920> decrease

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
attachments it'll increase or decrease

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.550 
attachments it'll increase or decrease
in<00:01:36.429> stats<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:37.030> do<00:01:37.270> keep<00:01:37.539> in<00:01:37.660> mind<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.929> ABS<00:01:38.289> for

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
in stats I do keep in mind the ABS for

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.139 
in stats I do keep in mind the ABS for
this<00:01:38.709> weapon<00:01:38.920> aim-down-sight<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:39.819> actually<00:01:40.119> a

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
this weapon aim-down-sight is actually a

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.190 
this weapon aim-down-sight is actually a
little<00:01:40.270> bit<00:01:40.360> slow<00:01:40.599> at<00:01:40.750> least<00:01:40.869> that's<00:01:41.020> what<00:01:41.170> it

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
little bit slow at least that's what it

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.600 
little bit slow at least that's what it
fell<00:01:41.410> engineer<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:42.160> I<00:01:42.220> think<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.580> a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
fell engineer so I think that a

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.219 
fell engineer so I think that a
quick-draw<00:01:43.090> grip<00:01:43.330> would<00:01:43.479> be<00:01:43.660> essential<00:01:44.200> for

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
quick-draw grip would be essential for

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.040 
quick-draw grip would be essential for

fire<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.590> actually<00:01:48.099> think<00:01:48.399> that<00:01:48.520> would<00:01:48.729> be

actually pretty handy and some extent
