00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.990 

last<00:01:44.110> but<00:01:44.440> not<00:01:44.620> least<00:01:44.920> in<00:01:45.220> terms<00:01:45.430> of<00:01:45.670> shooting

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
last but not least in terms of shooting

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.990 
last but not least in terms of shooting
the<00:01:46.360> boots<00:01:46.630> weren't<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:46.990> best<00:01:47.230> in<00:01:47.650> my<00:01:47.890> opinion

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the boots weren't the best in my opinion

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.400 
the boots weren't the best in my opinion
mainly<00:01:49.000> due<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.390> boots<00:01:49.630> being<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.170> light

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
mainly due to the boots being so light

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.230 
mainly due to the boots being so light
it<00:01:50.620> started<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:50.980> hurt<00:01:51.160> my<00:01:51.370> throat<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.730> few<00:01:51.910> hours

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
it started to hurt my throat a few hours

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:11.340 
it started to hurt my throat a few hours

overall I give this boot seven out of
ten<00:02:14.090> mainly<00:02:14.540> due<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.840> lack<00:02:15.020> of<00:02:15.050> durability

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830
