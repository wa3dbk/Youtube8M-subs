00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.140 
day to day you can be a vixen you can be
in<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> boardroom<00:01:59.400> you<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.729> doing<00:01:59.880> all

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
in the boardroom you can you doing all

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.359 
in the boardroom you can you doing all
these<00:02:00.299> things<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.869> at<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.979> end<00:02:02.010> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.220> day

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
these things but at the end of the day

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.789 
these things but at the end of the day
what<00:02:02.549> matters<00:02:02.580> is<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.150> you<00:02:03.360> feel<00:02:03.510> confident

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
what matters is that you feel confident

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.289 
what matters is that you feel confident
and<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.219> think<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.090> brand

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and I think that's really the brand

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.990 
and I think that's really the brand
philosophy
