00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
this is going to vibrate one time saying

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.740 
this is going to vibrate one time saying
that<00:01:01.829> that's<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.219> next<00:01:02.489> digit<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.420> next

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
digit which is eight it's going to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.830 
digit which is eight it's going to
vibrate<00:01:05.460> eight<00:01:05.850> times<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.330> would<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.510> 12

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
vibrate eight times so it would be 12

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.310 
vibrate eight times so it would be 12
times<00:01:06.960> pause<00:01:07.830> one<00:01:08.549> time<00:01:08.790> pause<00:01:09.180> 8<00:01:09.630> all<00:01:10.200> right
