00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
masa is that I have to let it stand for

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.490 
masa is that I have to let it stand for
at<00:02:08.810> least<00:02:09.129> fifteen<00:02:10.129> to<00:02:10.310> twenty<00:02:10.910> minutes

at least fifteen to twenty minutes

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.790 
at least fifteen to twenty minutes
to<00:02:12.500> rest<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:16.190> it<00:02:16.519> can<00:02:16.760> get<00:02:17.140> rehydrated

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
to rest so the so it can get rehydrated

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.170 
to rest so the so it can get rehydrated
and<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.879> masa<00:02:20.150> can<00:02:21.080> be<00:02:21.349> very<00:02:21.830> elastic<00:02:22.340> once<00:02:22.879> I

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
and the masa can be very elastic once I

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.250 
and the masa can be very elastic once I
formed<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.780> tortilla<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.720> double<00:02:27.110> ready

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
formed the tortilla so the double ready

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.220 
formed the tortilla so the double ready
rattle<00:02:27.709> around<00:02:27.860> 20<00:02:28.610> minutes<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.870> became

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
rattle around 20 minutes and it became
