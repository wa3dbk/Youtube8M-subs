00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
your emblem and player card first start

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.439 
your emblem and player card first start
off<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> rounded<00:00:16.049> square<00:00:16.170> make<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.740> white<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.850> a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
off a rounded square make it white and a

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.790 
off a rounded square make it white and a
little<00:00:18.539> bit<00:00:18.930> smaller<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.289> put<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.590> middle

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
little bit smaller and put in the middle

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.800 
little bit smaller and put in the middle
and<00:00:19.949> then<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.340> get<00:00:20.930> a<00:00:22.010> rectangle<00:00:23.010> medium<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
and then you get a rectangle medium and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.980 
and then you get a rectangle medium and
put<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.019> side<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:26.449> you<00:00:27.449> make<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.750> red

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
put it to the side and you make it red

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.310 
put it to the side and you make it red
and<00:00:28.369> then<00:00:29.369> duplicate<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.210> layer<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.779> put<00:00:31.260> it

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and then duplicate that layer and put it

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.380 
and then duplicate that layer and put it
to<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> other<00:00:31.590> side<00:00:31.820> like<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:33.000> doing<00:00:33.360> right

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
to the other side like I'm doing right

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.540 
to the other side like I'm doing right
now<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:35.780> tweak<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> little<00:00:37.559> bit<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.190> how<00:00:38.489> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
now and tweak it a little bit to how you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.520 
now and tweak it a little bit to how you
want<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.899> want<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> leave<00:00:40.260> enough<00:00:40.500> space

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
want it you want to leave enough space

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.880 
want it you want to leave enough space
in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.100> middle<00:00:41.219> where<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.180> white<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:43.379> make

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
in the middle where it's white to make

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
in the middle where it's white to make
your<00:00:44.219> maple<00:00:44.969> leaf<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.250> then<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:48.539> grab<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
your maple leaf and then you grab the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.389 
your maple leaf and then you grab the
pointed<00:00:49.739> shield<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:52.070> rotate<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.129> until

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
pointed shield and you rotate it until

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.660 
pointed shield and you rotate it until
it's<00:00:53.670> upside<00:00:54.000> down<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.629> make<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.989> smaller<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
it's upside down and make it smaller and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.610 
it's upside down and make it smaller and
put<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> where<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.969> want<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.480> then<00:00:58.320> make

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
put it where you want it and then make

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.920 
put it where you want it and then make
that<00:00:58.890> red<00:00:59.390> and<00:01:00.949> then<00:01:01.949> duplicate<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.260> twice<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
that red and then duplicate it twice and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.010 
that red and then duplicate it twice and
put<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> other<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.290> off<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> side<00:01:09.020> right

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
put the other one off to the side right

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.560 
put the other one off to the side right
side<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.409> an<00:01:10.530> angle<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:11.909> doing<00:01:12.150> now<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
side at an angle like I'm doing now and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.160 
side at an angle like I'm doing now and
then<00:01:13.260> put<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.310> other<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> left<00:01:15.900> side

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
then put the other one to the left side

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.170 
then put the other one to the left side
at<00:01:16.350> an<00:01:16.439> angle<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.430> doing<00:01:17.670> now<00:01:20.180> you'll

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
at an angle like I'm doing now you'll

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
at an angle like I'm doing now you'll
notice<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.689> move<00:01:22.170> everything<00:01:22.740> down

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
notice that I move everything down

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.030 
notice that I move everything down
because<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.909> didn't<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.750> start<00:01:25.040> grab

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
because I didn't like it at start grab

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.929 
because I didn't like it at start grab
the<00:01:26.250> square<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:28.400> usually<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> put<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> there

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the square and usually you put it there

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.520 
the square and usually you put it there
but<00:01:30.119> I'm<00:01:30.270> putting<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.750> down<00:01:30.930> further<00:01:31.290> because

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
but I'm putting it down further because

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.780 
but I'm putting it down further because
i'm<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.280> shift<00:01:32.520> everything

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
i'm just going to shift everything

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.499 
i'm just going to shift everything
downwards<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.960> make<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.200> red<00:01:37.439> as<00:01:37.950> well<00:01:38.509> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
downwards and make that red as well and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.600 
downwards and make that red as well and
I<00:01:40.409> guess<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:41.040> doing<00:01:41.250> here<00:01:41.430> I'm<00:01:41.490> just

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
I guess like I'm doing here I'm just

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.610 
I guess like I'm doing here I'm just
shifting<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.180> down<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:43.200> make<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.590> look<00:01:43.770> better

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:57.399 

like<00:01:50.280> so

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.719 

and<00:01:57.770> just<00:01:58.520> tweaking<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.630> pointed<00:02:00.170> shields

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
and just tweaking the pointed shields

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:15.070 
and just tweaking the pointed shields
and<00:02:02.289> now<00:02:05.380> on<00:02:08.619> your<00:02:09.619> next<00:02:09.830> layer<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:14.000> grab<00:02:14.810> I

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
and now on your next layer you grab I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.160 
and now on your next layer you grab I
think<00:02:15.379> the<00:02:16.120> rectangle<00:02:17.120> thin<00:02:17.360> yep<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:20.170> make

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
think the rectangle thin yep and make

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.800 
think the rectangle thin yep and make
that<00:02:21.440> red<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:21.980> put<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.599> just<00:02:23.599> sticks

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
that red and put it so it just sticks

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.750 
that red and put it so it just sticks
out<00:02:24.019> so<00:02:24.260> it's<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.500> stem<00:02:24.769> of<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.920> maple<00:02:25.580> leaf

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
out so it's the stem of the maple leaf

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.530 
out so it's the stem of the maple leaf
and<00:02:26.000> then<00:02:27.819> grab<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.349> triangle<00:02:30.349> medium<00:02:30.709> and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
and then grab the triangle medium and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.960 
and then grab the triangle medium and
rotate<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.569> so<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.930> sticks<00:02:33.170> out<00:02:33.349> of<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.970> bottom

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
rotate it so it sticks out of the bottom

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.280 
rotate it so it sticks out of the bottom
left<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.480> bottom<00:02:35.750> right<00:02:35.900> corner<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
left of the bottom right corner of the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.080 
left of the bottom right corner of the
square<00:02:36.670> whichever<00:02:37.670> one<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.849> want<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.030> do

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
square whichever one you want to do

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.809 
square whichever one you want to do
first<00:02:38.269> doesn't<00:02:38.720> matter<00:02:39.489> so<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.579> looks<00:02:40.730> like

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
first doesn't matter so it looks like

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.589 
first doesn't matter so it looks like
that<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:42.099> then<00:02:43.099> wrote<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:44.500> duplicate<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.650> and

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
that and then wrote a duplicate it and

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.970 
that and then wrote a duplicate it and
make<00:02:47.599> it<00:02:47.629> on<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.140> other<00:02:48.200> side<00:02:48.500> as<00:02:48.829> well<00:02:50.980> and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
make it on the other side as well and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.599 
make it on the other side as well and
then<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:53.319> just<00:02:54.319> duplicated<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.040> still<00:02:55.400> same

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
then I just duplicated that still same

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.110 
then I just duplicated that still same
layers<00:02:55.849> again<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.390> make<00:02:56.510> them<00:02:56.750> white<00:02:57.109> and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
layers again and make them white and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.640 
layers again and make them white and
then<00:02:59.120> you<00:03:00.079> put<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.349> where<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:00.980> am<00:03:02.109> at<00:03:03.109> the<00:03:03.440> top

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
then you put it where I am at the top

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
then you put it where I am at the top
left<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.310> mayfly<00:03:05.209> or<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:06.049> leaf<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:07.459> that

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
left of the mayfly or the leaf so that

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.780 
left of the mayfly or the leaf so that
it<00:03:07.819> just<00:03:07.970> just<00:03:08.299> makes<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.630> look<00:03:08.690> sharper<00:03:09.290> and

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.979 

duplicate<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.000> layer<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.599> made<00:03:14.780> and

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
put on the other side just so it defines

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.379 
put on the other side just so it defines
