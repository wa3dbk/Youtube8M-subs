00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
play down the stretch because what I

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.190 
play down the stretch because what I

teams that could be a big difference and

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.969 
teams that could be a big difference and
he's<00:05:05.539> an<00:05:05.690> x-factor<00:05:06.139> going<00:05:06.710> into<00:05:06.889> the

there's<00:05:11.599> a<00:05:11.660> lot<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:11.840> questions<00:05:12.320> left<00:05:12.530> well

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
there's a lot of questions left well

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.560 
there's a lot of questions left well
mainly<00:05:13.130> though<00:05:13.460> how<00:05:13.669> come<00:05:13.849> the<00:05:13.940> biking<00:05:14.060> Sunday
