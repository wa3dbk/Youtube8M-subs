just kind of like put in some username
and<00:00:34.520> recently<00:00:36.079> youtube<00:00:37.079> has<00:00:37.110> allowed<00:00:37.770> people

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
and recently youtube has allowed people

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.180 
and recently youtube has allowed people
to<00:00:38.309> change<00:00:38.730> their<00:00:38.850> name<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.690> google+<00:00:40.469> pages

to change their name with google+ pages

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.930 
to change their name with google+ pages
so<00:00:41.820> i<00:00:41.989> decided<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.140> do<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.590> because<00:00:43.800> i<00:00:44.340> just

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
so i decided to do that because i just

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.060 
so i decided to do that because i just
think<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.480> time<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> let<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.920> the
