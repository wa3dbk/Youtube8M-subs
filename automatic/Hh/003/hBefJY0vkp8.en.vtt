00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 council johannes smoke e-mobility 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.700
 soon also in public bus traffic 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.460
 how important is this step for 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.590
 Vorarlberg sometimes a test vehicle 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
 the first time test driven so to speak 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.210
 it works so much you can say 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.250
 But we want to be in the next spring 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.230
 do a real acid test that 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.470
 means we get a bus into the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.500
 land and drive because in real operation in 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.929
 public transport in with 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.430
 full load, so to speak, three weeks long and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.200
 will see if it also in everyday life 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.120
 works with full load 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.950
 with the circulation cycles we have too 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.950
 Do it with us in the spring, if you too 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.620
 heat must because also an electric bus 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.059
 want to be heated 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.370
 the concept is by itself convincing it 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.440
 There are already several cities in Europe where 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.559
 it works but we want it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.610
 Of course first in the endurance test 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.670
 try on 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.800
 So first the test how should be 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 because public transport continues 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.309
 evolve into hide what's that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.860
 wishful thinking 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.799
 So electromobility is just down 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.549
 sure in the future topic because we just 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.890
 in very busy areas where the buses 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.060
 drive with diesel 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.150
 have a problem with the air quality 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.700
 and this with electromobility 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.850
 course away is because a question 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.960
 be whether the things then pay off 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.479
 as it looks at the moment now 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.640
 the buses would have a payback period 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.860
 you will be around five to seven years old 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.850
 have to look at each other 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.320
 We will be in total 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.180
 public transport safe quality 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.619
 that means the clock is still improving 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.009
 better make the daytime 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.350
 try to make it better 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.210
 also when the offer on the train 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.579
 still some to improve the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.680
 railway offensive continues we have 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.390
 Total in the government program 300 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.170
 million euro package the next five 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.520
 years with males at bus altogether at 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.840
 public transport that we on the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.049
 rail and bring to the street 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.049
 want
