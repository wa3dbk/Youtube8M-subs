00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.650 
exactly yeah I mean it's how you know if
you<00:02:31.220> did<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.490> with<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.730> special<00:02:32.180> ed<00:02:32.330> kids

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
you did this with the special ed kids

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.449 
you did this with the special ed kids
they<00:02:33.590> might<00:02:33.830> be<00:02:33.980> able<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.250> draw<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.459> picture

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
they might be able to draw a picture

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.590 
they might be able to draw a picture
mm-hmm<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:37.610> it's<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> kind<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.180> thing<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:38.450> the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
mm-hmm and it's the kind of thing if the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.240 
mm-hmm and it's the kind of thing if the
kids<00:02:38.810> do<00:02:39.050> want<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.380> put<00:02:39.530> their<00:02:39.680> fingers<00:02:39.980> in<00:02:40.100> it

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
kids do want to put their fingers in it

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.830 
kids do want to put their fingers in it
right<00:02:40.610> let<00:02:40.940> them<00:02:41.060> put<00:02:41.180> their<00:02:41.300> fingers<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.630> it

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
right let them put their fingers in it

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.640 
right let them put their fingers in it
right<00:02:42.110> all<00:02:42.380> right

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
right all right

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.730 
right all right
paste<00:02:42.860> right<00:02:43.370> water<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.850> water<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:45.560> they

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
paste right water and water and and they

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.860 
paste right water and water and and they
can<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.310> know<00:02:46.400> kind<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.730> do<00:02:46.880> this<00:02:47.060> thing<00:02:47.120> and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
can you know kind of do this thing and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.670 
can you know kind of do this thing and
the<00:02:47.989> idea<00:02:48.019> is<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.950> where<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:50.530> resist<00:02:51.530> is

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
the idea is that where the resist is

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.660 
the idea is that where the resist is
it's<00:02:51.890> gonna<00:02:52.040> dry<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:53.530> indigo<00:02:54.530> won't<00:02:54.800> indigo

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
it's gonna dry and indigo won't indigo

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.130 
it's gonna dry and indigo won't indigo
well<00:02:55.850> get<00:02:56.000> into<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.330> was<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> very<00:02:56.750> very<00:02:56.870> pale

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
well get into it was a very very pale

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.210 
well get into it was a very very pale
there<00:02:57.410> right<00:02:57.650> right

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
there right right

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.160 
there right right
where<00:02:58.459> there<00:02:58.610> is<00:02:58.640> no<00:02:58.790> resist<00:02:59.600> then<00:02:59.870> it's<00:03:00.050> gonna

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
where there is no resist then it's gonna

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.800 
where there is no resist then it's gonna
be<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.500> darker<00:03:00.860> blue<00:03:00.980> of<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.190> Indigo<00:03:01.670> mm-hmm

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
be the darker blue of the Indigo mm-hmm

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.120 
be the darker blue of the Indigo mm-hmm
and<00:03:02.900> then<00:03:03.080> what<00:03:03.200> kind<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.530> happens<00:03:03.950> because

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
and then what kind of happens because

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.790 
and then what kind of happens because
the<00:03:04.489> water<00:03:04.790> sort<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.239> leeches<00:03:05.630> out<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:06.440> sort<00:03:06.739> of

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
the water sort of leeches out it sort of

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.220 
the water sort of leeches out it sort of
makes<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.250> little<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:08.000> tiny<00:03:08.450> bit<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.840> resist

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
makes a little a tiny bit of a resist

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.780 
makes a little a tiny bit of a resist
out<00:03:09.410> here<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.650> little<00:03:09.920> bit<00:03:10.040> lighter<00:03:10.280> in<00:03:10.430> color

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
out here a little bit lighter in color

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.430 
out here a little bit lighter in color
so<00:03:11.450> they'll<00:03:11.600> get<00:03:11.750> different<00:03:12.140> shades<00:03:12.320> of

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
so they'll get different shades of

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.960 
so they'll get different shades of
indigo<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.980> they'll<00:03:13.130> have<00:03:13.310> their<00:03:13.519> picture

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
indigo and they'll have their picture

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.890 
indigo and they'll have their picture
mhm<00:03:14.480> mhm<00:03:15.130> okay<00:03:16.130> that's<00:03:16.730> cool<00:03:17.000> no<00:03:17.600> one<00:03:17.720> looks

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
mhm mhm okay that's cool no one looks

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.660 
mhm mhm okay that's cool no one looks
something<00:03:18.380> up<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.890> then<00:03:19.070> like<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.400> said<00:03:19.430> they

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
something up and then like I said they

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.190 
something up and then like I said they
can<00:03:19.700> either<00:03:19.880> just<00:03:20.090> do<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.300> freehand<00:03:20.570> or<00:03:21.110> they

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
can either just do it freehand or they

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.300 
can either just do it freehand or they
could<00:03:21.350> draw<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.530> picture<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.920> then<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.040> just

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
could draw a picture and then you just

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.730 
could draw a picture and then you just
put<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.459> fab
