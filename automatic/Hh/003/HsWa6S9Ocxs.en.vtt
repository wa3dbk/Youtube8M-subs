00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:08.940
 they are already vacations and if good in a 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.919
 less short language are already holidays and 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.980
 granddaughters 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:17.099
 all the pressures are going is incredible 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.800
 It's a very short vacation but 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.890
 anyway, they are important and what good 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.630
 let's start we like it and good at 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 this singing video so much 5 online is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.960
 I'm going to teach a secret a study but 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.660
 I miss the different and the special 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.640
 if this is very special then 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.110
 you have to treat them a deal 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.200
 deserved because it is special and good what 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.380
 What is special about this secret is that it is 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.060
 good thing is that this secret as how 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.040
 rays could put that in words all 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.940
 the secrets are in this secret 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.520
 because this secret is the map of gta 5 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.010
 it's not the map it's the whole grand map 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.900
 theft auto 5 and nothing maybe some 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.420
 think that I am well smoked and that 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.700
 maybe I'm inventing everything or maybe 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.020
 do not be honestly dreaming I think that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.710
 maybe I'm not dreaming but 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.750
 Well this secret is good I 'm going 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.450
 to say so nothing else is that 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.820
 not like the map of the grand theft auto 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.579
 really is the good figure but it is the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.859
 figure of leonardo of the ninja turtles 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.990
 that's why I say it 's so weird 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.020
 not maybe if they have not closed the video yet 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.130
 they will see that when they go to the countries 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.200
 that they had not paid attention to her as 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.000
 come when you get on the map the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.719
 game never gives them the full map not 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.329
 there is never a big picture of all the 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:42.149
 map simply looks like a piece not 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.649
 say that 30% of the map and then there 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.009
 you are going down news and download the map 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.989
 and all that but if you look for the image of 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.420
 map as good as here has it in 

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:53.729
 screen in fact see how it is not here 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.920
 with nothing is not unedited but here already 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.380
 you can give this an air not that 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.909
 it really is one of the ninja turtles 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.890
 what is this leonardo that in fact 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.380
 leonardo 67 of the ninja turtles the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.599
 this one that has both catanas and has 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.429
 his blue cloth good his mask or I do not know 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:11.910
 why bring that rag in fact I think 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.680
 that your eyes are that rag if you really 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.870
 although that would not make any sense 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.220
 but good ninja turtles do not either 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.270
 they have so good chicken now the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.490
 same map 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.130
 now yes that highlighted not highlighted in 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.250
 the points that look like they see here is 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.280
 this one very clear do not see how the image is 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.410
 exactly because leonardo does not see how 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.480
 has and therefore the hand not as you know 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.790
 ninja turtles have four fingers this 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.430
 well the thumb counts as the fourth and 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.260
 nothing good here looks like nothing else three 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.880
 fingers are up there are not the ones that are 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.230
 up and good by the hand then 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.430
 the shell is also remarked or 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.770
 how are the ninja turtles have 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.890
 shell because they are turtles and 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.260
 turtles usually have a shell and 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.400
 the expert castilla also have it 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.440
 eat here you can also highlight the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.840
 shell as you see the lines that I'm 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.600
 grabbing here are not coming out of the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.070
 nothing or is it really can be seen 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.110
 how they really are re marks of the map 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.400
 you can see it so they do not say 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.610
 nothing but yes or I can also 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.590
 draw peter pan was going to come out there 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.860
 because it is also highlighted but not 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.300
 it is more than also the highlighting the 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.810
 colors not for example in the mask 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.440
 see what 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.440
 is blue 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.720
 are those summer tones free you 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.060
 really but good you are saying here 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.099
 since the mask is fine 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.050
 blue not and good here the mouth the only 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.610
 that could be that it does not match is the 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.050
 mouth because how the turtles look 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.880
 ninja because his head is all green and 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.160
 in fact his whole body is green but 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.870
 maybe it's well put there for I do not know 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.370
 to differentiate a little not that it looked 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.590
 And also to put desert not 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.970
 they put desert and then it is not like that 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.769
 completely clear imagine that everything 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.630
 out green and trees I think I do not think 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.810
 that there must be a little more variation in 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.640
 the weather and nothing like they see there on the track 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.350
 landing the east hangar of trevor 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.269
 I think it is the trevor or the other 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.400
 I do not know what bank it is but it coincides 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.200
 exactly in the part where I would go 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.569
 the mouth is not there as well as more for 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.870
 it's like right in the center of the eyes 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.580
 of the mask and well there they can also 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.440
 view at sea and you can remark 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.150
 the eyes is a little bluer no where 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.489
 the eyes would go the water is a little more 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.109
 blue and has like that shape as well as the 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.660
 they have the ninja turtles like that form 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.280
 of angry eyes as well as triangle and 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.870
 well below we have as well as the way 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.840
 of the shell or what it would be 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.050
 because the carapace there has as the 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.570
 chest there good not the chest has like 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.150
 shells in front I do not know how it 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.740
 say and putting back looks like 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.210
 he has an arm not like he has a 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.160
 arm in front of the other back and 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.740
 as you see the city of saints so the 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.199
 perspective his sword does not and this matches 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.169
 too much is too much because the 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.750
 mask is blue and has a sword no no 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.699
 that's how I have something else is this 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.610
 leonardo the only one who uses swords and the 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.430
 that coincides not the one that the mask 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.590
 it's blue because the sword is this way 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.690
 silver and long there you can see how 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.570
 how the form and good is sad regis 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.180
 massive is not something very very massive because 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.760
 obviously the whole map is not in the 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.010
 The gta gta is full of stories of 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.889
 made the creators of the migrant this 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.930
 car when the great deal came out 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.970
 obviously they said there were so many 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.110
 secrets not that they did not believe that 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.810
 they were going to find all the secrets that 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.690
 they had put and well no what better than 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.370
 put all the secrets in others 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.560
 secrets not in a secret is much more 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.620
 big not obviously 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.210
 is a game that is defined by its 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.410
 secret 2 obviously by example and 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.300
 for everything else but I think I 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.520
 I would dare to say that it is the game where 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.100
 more sister is found not by the 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.510
 greatness that has not the map everything be 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.860
 everything you can do and good here 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.919
 I started to spin like that with the plane 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.930
 for example here we are on the finger of 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.150
 middle of the finger and there's the east the 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.090
 offices these of the foot is also weird 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.889
 Not that I do not think it's something to do 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.570
 but good there are the offices as 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.340
 see if we go to the head to the head 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.550
 it would head for leonardo 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.889
 they are up to the global east there can they 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.520
 see how like chile mode it is 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.710
 completely full occupying his montañez 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.180
 and then what would be the state then 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.340
 obviously the whole city ​​is not everything 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.440
 that I can cover in the city and then 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.090
 as it is everything would be all for this 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.550
 secret not because there is the truth that I 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.560
 interested enough for the greatness 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.689
 what is obviously not the historical 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.659
 bigger in size maybe not in 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:34.479
 in this meaning because it is only 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:37.329
 a ninja turtle but in space what 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.249
 encompasses what it means to have all 

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:41.199
 the historical within a historical the 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:43.299
 true that that's done is done 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.499
 completely wonderful so 

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:47.110
 if you who think or if it is a 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:48.999
 history has any relationship with him or 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.979
 what do they think they say free if he and 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:52.569
 good in your feelings good to what 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.249
 better not because if you are not going to write me 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:57.459
 as the story of his life and he's going to have 

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:58.749
 a whole text a whole essay to do 

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.610
 reference to all the things that have 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:02.169
 done and not not honestly if someone 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.419
 do that I'm not going to read it because 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.219
 imagine reading another person's life 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.759
 in your life I would not give you time because 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:11.769
 I give time unless you have lived 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:13.869
 about five years 

00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:17.050
 maybe a five-year story can 

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:18.219
 be short but others not so so 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.439
 nothing else would be everything I hope you have 

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:24.459
 liked hours for this video and even the 

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:25.989
 next and see you later this morning and already 

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:29.819
 they're going to start the projects and all that 

00:07:25.989 --> 00:07:29.819
 it's going to get crazy and very good 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.390
 Y 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.290
 Y
