00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.630
 it was he who did collab on this Friday 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.610
 if catherine it needed a video a little 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.199
 special I explain to you why so 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.430
 if you want to stay until the end of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.970
 the video he must have a small 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.619
 ad 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.090
 I started right away with the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.890
 theme of the week that I made to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.600
 half precisely because of the no this 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.050
 that I do at the end of the video 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.789
 so these women is unlikely to do you 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.650
 so the first thing I address that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.360
 I hate coffee I drink no coffee 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.770
 I do not drink hot chocolate I do not like 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.750
 really not hot drinks 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.550
 so I see just acquiescence of 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.860
 water times soft drinks this 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.790
 is not rare second thing I 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.320
 never in europe 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.059
 it's something I'd like to do 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.460
 at least once in my life was going in 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.440
 europe but i'm never going to go yet 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.649
 in no other country in europe 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.210
 i love zombie games or xbox i have 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.219
 may not look like that but I am 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.989
 a girl my pc dead rising and the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.510
 three gravelines and these are my eyes 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.770
 two favorite friends despite the fact that I 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.769
 can excel in any 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.200
 xbox audio i love dead rising this is 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.060
 really a friend I actually preferred 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.710
 speak french and in july i speak 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.090
 French in the lives every day I 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.260
 speak French at school but I have 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.549
 learned English I was still 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.490
 I like I think it's true I had 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.320
 11 years old I do not really practice in 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.950
 everyday life but I'm talking 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.500
 very good english 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.270
 so that's it and finally the last 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.380
 did I did that I already had 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.090
 black hair 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.920
 yes I said I had hair no and 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.299
 I do not have photos to show you 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.650
 because I can not find it unless I 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.759
 search in the markets and that one 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.110
 find a but here is asked 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.000
 why I made the ground a fair 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.890
 half and that I seem to speak 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.500
 very quickly because super prefect actually 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.860
 it's Friday morning it's almost 11 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.390
 in the morning in canada which is 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.820
 the leader in France think five years ago 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.229
 in the evening I even filmed my videos 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.880
 or because I have more time 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.549
 so I wanted to tell you 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.110
 that you probably felt me ​​coming to 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.700
 that time but it's my 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.009
 last and mouse videos that sticks to him 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.030
 at bhl I am obliged to 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.250
 let my friday actually 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.890
 I already had who pays a few months of 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.330
 that I had come to make a day and 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.069
 gulli but unfortunately I can not 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.470
 simply no longer do it like in 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.970
 this moment i can i'm going to post the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.980
 video really very scared on this friday 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.930
 because I do not have the choice to do this 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.180
 just absolutely not have the time and have 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.950
 unfortunately found his fear of doing 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.300
 videos of lower quality then 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.800
 really super short because I had 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.690
 no time for him but I did not have the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.040
 time to do the editing and between 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.950
 school and all I have to do 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.660
 unfortunately I had more the heap and 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.620
 especially elderly lady who does because 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.650
 I really liked the atmosphere 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.090
 on the calade I team up to 100% I 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.620
 will not have done little to ever 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.030
 it's clear that it's super good 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.920
 friends that's in between talking 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.060
 maybe once in a while 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.800
 I want to go back to doing a little 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.660
 appearance on wii that was collab but 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.030
 unfortunately I have to leave my 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.400
 regular friday I still do not know who 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.260

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.620

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.290

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.880
 that you enjoyed my videos of 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.530

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.810
 do not worry at all that I'm staying on my 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.989
 chain that is gray to say that if 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.220
 you never want to talk to me or 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.900
 keep watching videos of me 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.970

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.290
