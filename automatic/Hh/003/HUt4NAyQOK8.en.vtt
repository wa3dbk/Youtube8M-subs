it already has a weak spot there the
supply<00:01:17.220> depots<00:01:17.580> usually<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> weak<00:01:18.960> spot

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
supply depots usually are the weak spot

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.940 
supply depots usually are the weak spot

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
fairly hittable by a baneling and here

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
fairly hittable by a baneling and here
on<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.049> own<00:01:28.350> cellar<00:01:28.799> side<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.729> picking

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
on the own cellar side is just picking

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.300 
on the own cellar side is just picking
up<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.240> extractor<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:31.740> starting<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
up the extractor and now starting the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.600 
up the extractor and now starting the
spawning<00:01:32.670> pool<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.350> usually<00:01:34.979> when<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.460> have

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
spawning pool so usually when you have

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.100 
spawning pool so usually when you have
this<00:01:35.759> kind<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.060> opening<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.570> Zerg<00:01:36.840> side

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
this kind of opening on the Zerg side

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.630 
this kind of opening on the Zerg side
where<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.439> pick<00:01:37.619> up<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> extractor<00:01:38.369> first

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
where you pick up the extractor first

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.490 
where you pick up the extractor first
and<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> spawning<00:01:39.210> pool<00:01:39.450> second<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and the spawning pool second the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980 
and the spawning pool second the
objective<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.460> enough<00:01:42.180> gas<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.750> just

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
objective is to have enough gas to just

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.649 
objective is to have enough gas to just
go<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.740> zergling<00:01:44.220> speed<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.149> second<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
go for zergling speed the second the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.780 
go for zergling speed the second the
spawning<00:01:45.930> pool<00:01:46.200> pops<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:47.340> that's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
spawning pool pops and I think that's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.030 
spawning pool pops and I think that's
what<00:01:47.970> you're<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> see<00:01:48.509> once<00:01:48.720> more<00:01:49.040> LG

eight<00:02:59.010> zerglings<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.939> then<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:01.079> think<00:03:01.560> he

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
eight zerglings and then I think he

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.500 
eight zerglings and then I think he
needs<00:03:01.889> to<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.220> something<00:03:02.519> because<00:03:02.849> we<00:03:03.329> do
