00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.599
 Let's go now 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.359
 Probably topped and the side is a hand 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.470
 It is a master program 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.210
 l 75% 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.779
 Top professionals in the great world are now in the process of establishing depression 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.609
 It is said that 75% 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.449
 It's a Yui Ant 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.280
 Despite backhand before 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.030
 Three quarters of the 3/4 shot will be at 16 o'clock. 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.020
 is not it 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.470
 So of course if the bill is overwhelmingly a weapon 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.960
 I do not handle it because I recommend 5 games 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.420
 The dissolution of New York is also this way and I want to stop the reaction 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.900
 It is not enhanced 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.920
 So it was great in the manufacturing industry but at first one 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.380
 Such an important point is 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.380
 Bad weather course how is this usage 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.210
 It's a stretch 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.210
 In this way 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.050
 It is this form a little 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.280
 It was a difference this time 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.250
 It is this form too 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.250
 I'm lacquered 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.920
 This is a low place this time 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.160
 I'm jealous 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.880
 It is as you did Dior 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.350
 Well as it is 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.950
 I really use this 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.130
 I'm still at the ticket 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.200
 It is said what happens if you shake it 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.280
 Northern 4 islands can not be 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
 Also I taste before the fire 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.100
 Followed by two s 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.369
 Another way to use for workers to exchange opinions at once 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.340
 is not it 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.399
 Stakeout 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.950
 Hiroki Fukui Reed 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.100
 This is how the school of way wins 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.229
 Ota City used expression to strengthen offerings, but 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.380
 The shoulders move later 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.380
 After setting 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.310
 I always 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.729
 As you say 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.349
 Decrease and experience-Zure is also happening in high school 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.610
 This is pretty 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.570
 I got a general test 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.879
 Vs knot 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.620
 The king used to test with his own body. 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:26.979
 It is a problem 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.229
 It is not because it is exposed but 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.699
 Koda Kumi has no protection 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.120
 Here is the classification function 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.009
 From the promulgation designated as the background 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.229
 Guru song semicircle 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.669
 Half circle 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.630
 It is from now 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.099
 We mounted this time 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.050
 In the curtain and your own 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.689
 It is Ori place 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.409
 One-year-old child has a big fuss 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.399
 Because there is a picture 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.579
 It's okay I'm back fist fist 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.579
 The other party is yes 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.309
 It is a question corner from the member 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:10.939
 Inherently low 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.239
 Stretching slice 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.629
 The tough initial low price partner's politics grow minimum 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.689
 Against the ball 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.689
 The course that returns well with asp 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.949
 It is a hearty question 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.040
 Of course you slice 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.840
 idea 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.200
 It's a size 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.729
 Number of achievements 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.879
 If there are any questions about doing just enough 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.629
 sp want to understand
