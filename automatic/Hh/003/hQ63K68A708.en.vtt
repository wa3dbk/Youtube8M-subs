00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
be one that I'm missing but and then I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.940 
be one that I'm missing but and then I
had<00:01:08.280> all<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.670> ones<00:01:08.880> from<00:01:09.060> left<00:01:09.540> 4<00:01:09.630> dead<00:01:09.780> 2<00:01:09.950> but

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
had all the ones from left 4 dead 2 but

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.170 
had all the ones from left 4 dead 2 but
unfortunately<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.490> kind<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.760> ran<00:01:11.909> out<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.060> room

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
unfortunately I kind of ran out of room

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
unfortunately I kind of ran out of room
I<00:01:12.450> thought<00:01:12.600> these<00:01:12.720> were<00:01:12.840> gonna<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> little

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I thought these were gonna be a little

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.810 
I thought these were gonna be a little
bit<00:01:13.350> smaller<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:14.520> were<00:01:14.580> all<00:01:14.700> gonna

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
bit smaller or that they were all gonna

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
bit smaller or that they were all gonna
be<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.180> horizontal<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> cats<00:01:16.740> meowing

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
be like horizontal and the cats meowing

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.130 
be like horizontal and the cats meowing
though<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.090> were<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.210> gonna<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.479> horizontal

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
though they were all gonna be horizontal

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.570 
though they were all gonna be horizontal
but<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.860> wasn't<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> case<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.490> I

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
but that really wasn't the case so I

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.280 
but that really wasn't the case so I
kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> ran<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.119> room<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.140> were

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
kind of ran out of room so you were

all<00:01:34.860> good<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.880> don't<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.750> had<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> new

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
all good I don't know if I had the new

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.170 
all good I don't know if I had the new
TV<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> got<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> new<00:01:38.250> TV<00:01:38.659> because<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.200> old<00:01:40.680> TV

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
TV but I got a new TV because the old TV

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.050 
TV but I got a new TV because the old TV
was<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> $200<00:01:43.159> clearance<00:01:44.159> display<00:01:44.640> TV<00:01:45.030> I

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
was like a $200 clearance display TV I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.340 
was like a $200 clearance display TV I
got<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> was<00:01:45.570> still<00:01:45.810> working<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:46.110> Target

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
got when I was still working at Target

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.170 
got when I was still working at Target
so<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> figured<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.460> was<00:01:47.579> about<00:01:47.640> time<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:48.090> an

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
so I figured it was about time for an

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.490 
so I figured it was about time for an
upgrade<00:01:48.299> considering<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.110> thing<00:01:49.290> had<00:01:49.380> been

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
upgrade considering that thing had been

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.429 
upgrade considering that thing had been
on<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> while<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:52.020> was<00:01:52.110> still<00:01:52.320> from

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
on for a while and it was still from

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.910 
on for a while and it was still from
Target<00:01:52.860> era<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.399> got<00:01:54.270> rid<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.770> got

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
Target era so got rid of that but we got
