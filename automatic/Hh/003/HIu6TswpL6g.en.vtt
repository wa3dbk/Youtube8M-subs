00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.780
 hello to all and it's him we get 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.820
 found today for a beautiful 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.529
 video a hamlet of tutos ya saw you 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.600
 learn to open and redirect calf 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.070
 pig on the ninebox of sfr all 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.420
 naturally so it 'll be useful to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.490
 anyone who wants to create a server 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.900
 that this meaning have minecraft 20 servers 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.310
 counter strike a server web server 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.840
 cloud etc 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.880
 so first of all, we'll have to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.559
 connect to the configuration interface 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.020
 of your neufbox 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.700
 if you do not know the address to enter 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.710
 in your web browser it's very 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.280
 simple just get started 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.200
 all accessory programs executed 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.210
 or so faster the windows key 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.829
 plus do you type then c is 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.030
 conducted you will arrive in this 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.320
 window and you're going to type ip config 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.289
 here you go back a little bit 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.329
 and you are going to look for the gateway by 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.370
 default here is the gateway by 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.270
 default at home is an egg 2.168 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.129
 points 1 point 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.830
 so you will go back to your 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.520
 internet browser made 1.9 corner 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.650
 from a 6 8 points 3 and you have arrived 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.390
 on your neufbox 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.710
 so in this window we will 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.380
 to be able to configure it when you go 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.060
 first go into the network and then 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.470
 identify you then for this purpose 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.150
 to identify two methods 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.549
 you have a little button on them 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.689
 last ninebox of sfr you press and 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.390
 you will be able to connect without 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.390
 account otherwise you can grab at 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.079
 the old and well your identifier 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.400
 more password 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.530
 so if you have not changed anything 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.810
 the username and password admin 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.579
 if you have changed 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.079
 you just have to type your word 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.250
 past 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.850
 here you go then go 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.100
 in two mats and that's where everything goes 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.630
 to be played and everything is so simple 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.329
 it will be done in 30 seconds 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.740
 then you're going to type in a name so 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.799
 for example if it's a minecraft knowledge 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.540
 of the step and a server crash by 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.100
 example here you will choose the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.689
 protocol hours actually you choose 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.490
 not really at random you choose 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.530
 following the server as it is and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.300
 so does you usually find 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.030
 on the internet as well as she believes everything 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.650
 If the choice 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.060
 so for them were at worst if you 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.010
 do not know you choose both 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.890
 then you will leave port and if 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.930
 you have you are going to type the port of 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.080
 your server so for servers one 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.090
 trace I think it's the port 2 5 5 6 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.470
 5 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.250
 then you retype them again 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.230
 destination 2,5 5 6 5 is here in 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.840
 the destination ip address you go 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.280
 type the local ip address of your 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.220
 server so if you do not know her 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.319
 not you do this little single draw and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.980
 you 're going to get in there via grace 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.250
 to his name 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.560
 the pc where the server is hosted so by 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.180
 example if it would be my pc there it would be 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:56.470
 that this ip address you click there you 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.459
 get validated and then you do the 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.550
 little more here to activate and added this 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.670
 this port is here so you just opened 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.269
 your port to even redirect it to each 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.319
 times on the server there is on my pc here 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.799
 and everyone will be able to connect 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.980
 a meaning we take to your server 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.380
 so the next massa tutorial will be how 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.329
 have a fixed ip very useful also for 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.500
 those who want to create a server so 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.660

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.120
