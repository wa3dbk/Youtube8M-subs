a<00:01:00.870> showboat<00:01:01.379> skill<00:01:01.649> move<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.280> looks

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
a showboat skill move but it looks

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.009 
a showboat skill move but it looks
really<00:01:02.940> good<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.750> done<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
really good if you can get it done in a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.920 
really good if you can get it done in a
match<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.549> hold<00:01:05.790> l2<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.510> then

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
match to do this you hold l2 and then

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.899 
match to do this you hold l2 and then
spin<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:07.560> analog<00:01:07.770> stick<00:01:07.909> clockwise

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
spin the right analog stick clockwise

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.200 
spin the right analog stick clockwise
twice<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:10.619> next<00:01:10.799> skill<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.670> reverse<00:01:11.970> toe

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
twice the next skill is the reverse toe

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.109 
twice the next skill is the reverse toe
bounce<00:01:12.619> it's<00:01:13.640> again<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.790> pretty<00:01:14.909> useless

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
bounce it's again it's pretty useless

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.450 
bounce it's again it's pretty useless
it's<00:01:15.570> basically<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.080> showboat<00:01:16.530> move<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.310> do

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
it's basically a showboat move but to do

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.510 
it's basically a showboat move but to do
this<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.330> hold<00:01:18.630> l2<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.439> then<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.369> hold

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
this you hold l2 and then you just hold

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.700 
this you hold l2 and then you just hold
it<00:01:20.700> either<00:01:20.939> left<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.420> right<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.229> left<00:01:22.259> or

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it either left or right to go left or

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.450 
it either left or right to go left or
right<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:24.390> finally<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.229> bar<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.590> flick<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
right and finally the bar can flick the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.120 
right and finally the bar can flick the
back<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.880> flick<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.840> contextual<00:01:28.650> skill

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
back out flick is a contextual skill

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.330 
back out flick is a contextual skill
move<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.720> it's<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.110> really<00:01:31.740> hard<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.159> pull

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
move and it's it's really hard to pull

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.100 
move and it's it's really hard to pull
off<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:33.079> to<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.850> hold<00:01:35.850> l2<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.570> then

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
off but to do this you hold l2 and then

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.289 
off but to do this you hold l2 and then
hold<00:01:37.530> back<00:01:38.009> when<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.610> coming<00:01:38.820> towards<00:01:39.150> you

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
hold back when it's coming towards you

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.420 
hold back when it's coming towards you
but<00:01:39.780> also<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.470> defender<00:01:40.920> has<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.310> be

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
but also the defender has to be

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.190 
but also the defender has to be
pressuring<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> has<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.869> timed

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
pressuring you and it has to be timed

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.219 
pressuring you and it has to be timed
perfectly<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> hopefully<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> has<00:01:45.750> helped<00:01:46.110> I

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
perfectly so hopefully this has helped I

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.810 
perfectly so hopefully this has helped I
find<00:01:46.680> personally<00:01:46.890> when<00:01:47.250> somebody<00:01:47.549> talks

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
find personally when somebody talks

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.340
