00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
okay this is not a tangle free cable but

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.910 
okay this is not a tangle free cable but
it<00:02:39.750> does<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> pretty<00:02:40.109> good<00:02:40.260> job<00:02:40.409> of<00:02:40.709> keeping

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
it does a pretty good job of keeping

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.819 
it does a pretty good job of keeping
tangles<00:02:41.579> out<00:02:41.790> bay<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:43.019> yeah<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.260> will<00:02:43.500> notice

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
tangles out bay but yeah you will notice

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.640 
tangles out bay but yeah you will notice
the<00:02:43.950> odd<00:02:44.040> one<00:02:44.189> up<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.489> when<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.260> use<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:46.500> if

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the odd one up to when you use it so if

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.949 
the odd one up to when you use it so if
we<00:02:46.739> actually<00:02:46.829> look<00:02:47.010> at<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.250> cable<00:02:47.959> hopefully

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
we actually look at the cable hopefully

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.979 
we actually look at the cable hopefully
we<00:02:49.079> can<00:02:49.230> focus<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.799> this<00:02:51.739> okay<00:02:52.739> maybe<00:02:53.069> not<00:02:53.989> well

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
we can focus on this okay maybe not well

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.869 
we can focus on this okay maybe not well
basically<00:02:55.169> it's<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.590> fairly<00:02:55.950> decent<00:02:56.099> cable<00:02:56.639> not

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
basically it's a fairly decent cable not

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.690 
basically it's a fairly decent cable not
particularly<00:02:57.510> thick<00:02:58.280> but<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.370> doesn't<00:02:59.609> feel

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
particularly thick but it doesn't feel

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.099 
particularly thick but it doesn't feel
flimsy<00:02:59.879> it<00:03:00.180> doesn't<00:03:00.419> feel<00:03:00.599> like<00:03:00.659> it's<00:03:00.989> gonna

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
flimsy it doesn't feel like it's gonna

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.080 
flimsy it doesn't feel like it's gonna
break<00:03:01.349> only<00:03:01.889> thing<00:03:02.159> is<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.609> cable<00:03:02.819> is

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
break only thing is that the cable is

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.869 
break only thing is that the cable is
actually<00:03:03.419> joined<00:03:03.689> to<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.049> earphones

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
actually joined to the earphones

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.550 
actually joined to the earphones
so<00:03:05.879> if<00:03:05.969> the<00:03:06.090> cable<00:03:06.450> does<00:03:06.689> break<00:03:07.109> you<00:03:07.319> can<00:03:07.469> have

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
so if the cable does break you can have

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.869 
so if the cable does break you can have
to<00:03:07.680> get<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:07.889> repaired<00:03:08.189> you<00:03:08.370> can't<00:03:08.609> just<00:03:08.790> sort

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
to get it repaired you can't just sort

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.059 
to get it repaired you can't just sort
of<00:03:08.939> take<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.209> out<00:03:09.450> get<00:03:09.629> any<00:03:09.750> cable<00:03:10.169> you<00:03:10.859> have<00:03:10.980> to

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
of take it out get any cable you have to

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.619 
of take it out get any cable you have to

today's<00:03:19.560> standards<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:21.049> yeah<00:03:22.049> it<00:03:22.109> does<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
today's standards and yeah it does the

today's standards and yeah it does the
job<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.979> lot<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.609> prefer<00:03:23.940> 90<00:03:24.329> degrees<00:03:24.659> just

while using it sometimes you get
connectors<00:03:36.000> which<00:03:36.150> comes<00:03:36.359> straight<00:03:36.629> out

words and they're quite obtrusive anyway
the<00:03:39.750> earphones<00:03:40.049> themselves<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:40.889> they<00:03:41.220> are

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
the earphones themselves so they are

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.280 
the earphones themselves so they are
really<00:03:41.879> big<00:03:42.090> as<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:42.900> see<00:03:43.109> they<00:03:43.259> are

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
really big as you can see they are

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.990 
really big as you can see they are
they're<00:03:43.769> really<00:03:44.220> they're<00:03:44.370> massive<00:03:44.849> they're

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
they're really they're massive they're

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.610 
they're really they're massive they're
the<00:03:45.180> biggest<00:03:45.359> statements<00:03:45.840> I've<00:03:45.930> ever<00:03:46.139> seen<00:03:46.439> or

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
the biggest statements I've ever seen or

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.119 
the biggest statements I've ever seen or
used<00:03:46.889> and<00:03:48.739> so<00:03:50.150> basically<00:03:51.150> they<00:03:51.810> don't<00:03:52.079> feel<00:03:52.919> as

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
used and so basically they don't feel as

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.949 
used and so basically they don't feel as
heavy<00:03:53.370> as<00:03:53.519> they<00:03:53.669> look<00:03:53.909> just<00:03:54.239> because<00:03:54.389> it's<00:03:54.780> all

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
heavy as they look just because it's all

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.110 
heavy as they look just because it's all
plastic<00:03:55.259> construction<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.189> that's<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.669> good

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
plastic construction so that's a good

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.399 
plastic construction so that's a good
thing<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:57.419> a<00:03:57.479> bad<00:03:57.509> thing<00:03:57.659> really<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:58.109> mean<00:03:58.290> they

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
thing and a bad thing really I mean they

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.949 
thing and a bad thing really I mean they
do<00:03:58.470> feel<00:03:59.000> almost<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.060> little<00:04:00.209> bit<00:04:00.299> cheap<00:04:00.750> in

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
do feel almost a little bit cheap in

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.800 
do feel almost a little bit cheap in
some<00:04:01.259> senses<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.829> mean<00:04:02.009> you<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.299> would<00:04:03.479> you

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
some senses I mean you you would you

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.659 
some senses I mean you you would you
wouldn't<00:04:04.049> get<00:04:04.169> that<00:04:04.349> idea<00:04:04.709> from<00:04:04.769> from<00:04:05.459> looking

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
wouldn't get that idea from from looking

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.099 
wouldn't get that idea from from looking
at<00:04:05.759> the<00:04:05.819> package<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.239> mean<00:04:06.419> from<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:06.689> packaging

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
at the package I mean from the packaging

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.379 
at the package I mean from the packaging
these<00:04:07.199> look<00:04:07.409> like<00:04:07.620> they<00:04:07.769> were<00:04:07.829> built<00:04:08.329> you<00:04:09.329> know

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
these look like they were built you know

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.119 
these look like they were built you know
it<00:04:09.720> looks<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.139> was<00:04:10.229> built<00:04:10.409> like<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.590> tank

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
it looks like it was built like a tank

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.309 
it looks like it was built like a tank
but<00:04:11.639> you<00:04:12.150> had<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.329> live<00:04:12.479> in<00:04:12.599> themselves<00:04:12.989> feel

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
but you had to live in themselves feel

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.819 
but you had to live in themselves feel
very<00:04:13.859> light<00:04:14.509> in<00:04:15.509> the<00:04:15.870> cheap<00:04:16.139> kind<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.620> way<00:04:16.769> if

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
very light in the cheap kind of way if

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.569 
very light in the cheap kind of way if
you<00:04:17.039> know<00:04:17.159> what<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.280> mean

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
you know what I mean

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.330 
you know what I mean
so<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.329> feels<00:04:18.840> very<00:04:18.959> plasticky<00:04:19.769> very<00:04:20.099> glossy

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
so it feels very plasticky very glossy

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.159 
so it feels very plasticky very glossy
and<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:21.479> mean<00:04:21.599> it<00:04:21.659> does<00:04:21.779> actually<00:04:21.900> have<00:04:22.109> a

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
and I mean it does actually have a

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.510 
and I mean it does actually have a
button<00:04:22.349> on<00:04:22.590> here<00:04:22.800> which<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.010> can<00:04:23.130> use<00:04:23.159> to<00:04:23.400> skip

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
button on here which you can use to skip

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.100 
button on here which you can use to skip
tracks<00:04:23.969> and<00:04:24.150> that<00:04:24.210> feels<00:04:24.479> a<00:04:24.599> little<00:04:24.630> bit<00:04:24.960> loose

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
tracks and that feels a little bit loose

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.470 
tracks and that feels a little bit loose
as<00:04:25.349> well<00:04:25.529> so<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.340> actual<00:04:26.580> build<00:04:26.789> quality

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
as well so the actual build quality

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.030 
as well so the actual build quality
I'm<00:04:27.660> gonna<00:04:27.810> go<00:04:27.990> ahead<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.230> say<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.470> not<00:04:28.770> too

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
I'm gonna go ahead and say is not too

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.890 
I'm gonna go ahead and say is not too
great<00:04:29.400> but<00:04:29.640> the<00:04:30.240> sound<00:04:30.480> is<00:04:30.660> where<00:04:30.810> these

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
great but the sound is where these

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.600 
great but the sound is where these
things<00:04:31.080> are<00:04:31.290> absolute<00:04:31.800> incredible<00:04:32.040> like

somewhere on there they sound a lot

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.320 
somewhere on there they sound a lot
better<00:04:43.650> than<00:04:43.860> them<00:04:44.070> these<00:04:44.880> things<00:04:45.120> are

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
better than them these things are

clear highs and you can hear everything

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.940 
clear highs and you can hear everything
in<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.210> music<00:04:51.570> mids<00:04:51.900> uh<00:04:52.110> mids<00:04:52.590> are<00:04:52.710> there

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
in the music mids uh mids are there

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.070 
in the music mids uh mids are there
they're<00:04:53.790> not<00:04:53.820> exactly<00:04:54.270> protruding<00:04:54.960> but

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
they're not exactly protruding but

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.340 
they're not exactly protruding but
they're<00:04:55.200> definitely<00:04:55.320> present<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.080> mean

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
they're definitely present and so I mean

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.570 
they're definitely present and so I mean
I<00:04:58.500> wouldn't<00:04:58.710> say<00:04:58.770> it's<00:04:58.980> a<00:04:59.010> balanced<00:04:59.340> sound

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
I wouldn't say it's a balanced sound

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.820 
I wouldn't say it's a balanced sound
because<00:04:59.940> it<00:05:00.060> isn't<00:05:00.180> but<00:05:00.600> it's<00:05:01.440> it's<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.800> very

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
because it isn't but it's it's a very

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.350 
because it isn't but it's it's a very
good<00:05:02.250> sign<00:05:02.460> it's<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.670> kind<00:05:02.850> of<00:05:02.910> sound<00:05:03.090> that

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
good sign it's the kind of sound that

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.960 
good sign it's the kind of sound that
will<00:05:03.450> you<00:05:03.810> know<00:05:03.930> get<00:05:04.140> you<00:05:04.230> dancing<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:04.980> get

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
will you know get you dancing and get

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.640 
will you know get you dancing and get
you<00:05:06.060> in<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.240> mood<00:05:06.420> and<00:05:06.690> I<00:05:06.750> think<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:07.080> it's

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
you in the mood and I think you it's

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.320 
you in the mood and I think you it's
made<00:05:07.920> for<00:05:08.220> people<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.730> enjoy<00:05:08.880> their<00:05:09.210> music

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
made for people to enjoy their music

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.310 
made for people to enjoy their music
from<00:05:10.610> more<00:05:11.610> than<00:05:11.640> anything<00:05:11.970> which<00:05:12.300> I<00:05:12.630> mean<00:05:12.780> is

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
from more than anything which I mean is

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.720 
from more than anything which I mean is
what<00:05:13.560> most<00:05:13.740> people<00:05:14.040> are<00:05:14.100> looking<00:05:14.160> for<00:05:14.490> really

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
what most people are looking for really

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.330 
what most people are looking for really
I<00:05:14.880> mean<00:05:15.150> most<00:05:15.420> people<00:05:15.510> aren't<00:05:15.870> looking<00:05:16.050> for

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
I mean most people aren't looking for

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.550 
I mean most people aren't looking for
the<00:05:17.340> exact<00:05:17.760> you<00:05:18.330> know<00:05:18.360> an<00:05:18.510> exact<00:05:18.840> replication

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
the exact you know an exact replication

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.260 
the exact you know an exact replication
of<00:05:19.650> what<00:05:19.710> was<00:05:19.980> heard<00:05:20.190> in<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.400> studio<00:05:20.910> when<00:05:21.180> it

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
of what was heard in the studio when it

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.090 
of what was heard in the studio when it
was<00:05:21.360> created<00:05:21.840> or<00:05:21.900> whatever<00:05:22.170> they<00:05:22.770> just<00:05:22.800> want

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
was created or whatever they just want

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.380 
was created or whatever they just want
the<00:05:23.190> music<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.610> sounds<00:05:23.880> good<00:05:24.060> and<00:05:24.240> this

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
the music that sounds good and this

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.320 
the music that sounds good and this
mutes<00:05:25.110> music<00:05:25.500> sound<00:05:25.740> good<00:05:26.000> anyway<00:05:27.000> so<00:05:27.060> you<00:05:27.180> got

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
mutes music sound good anyway so you got

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.680 
mutes music sound good anyway so you got
a<00:05:27.360> very<00:05:27.570> good<00:05:27.750> seal<00:05:28.170> with<00:05:28.950> this<00:05:29.760> silicon<00:05:30.450> tip

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
a very good seal with this silicon tip

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.130 
a very good seal with this silicon tip
followed<00:05:31.620> by<00:05:31.860> this<00:05:32.490> well<00:05:33.180> seal<00:05:33.630> kind<00:05:33.900> of<00:05:33.960> thing

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
followed by this well seal kind of thing

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.320 
followed by this well seal kind of thing
and<00:05:34.830> basically<00:05:35.190> what<00:05:35.370> that<00:05:35.400> does<00:05:35.550> is<00:05:35.850> ice<00:05:36.030> its

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
and basically what that does is ice its

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.720 
and basically what that does is ice its
noise<00:05:36.510> very<00:05:36.900> well<00:05:37.140> indeed<00:05:37.500> it's<00:05:38.370> equivalent

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
noise very well indeed it's equivalent

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.860 
noise very well indeed it's equivalent
to<00:05:40.070> if<00:05:41.070> you<00:05:41.340> tried<00:05:41.610> the<00:05:41.760> Bose<00:05:41.940> QuietComfort

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
to if you tried the Bose QuietComfort

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.990 
to if you tried the Bose QuietComfort
headphones<00:05:43.290> over<00:05:44.010> a<00:05:44.190> headphones<00:05:44.670> and<00:05:44.850> it's

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
headphones over a headphones and it's

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.400 
headphones over a headphones and it's
difficult<00:05:45.150> to<00:05:45.390> compare<00:05:45.660> any<00:05:45.870> as<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.110> over<00:05:46.320> is

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
difficult to compare any as and over is

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.380 
difficult to compare any as and over is
but<00:05:46.620> I'd<00:05:47.100> say<00:05:47.310> it<00:05:47.400> canceled<00:05:47.850> about<00:05:48.060> a<00:05:48.090> similar

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
but I'd say it canceled about a similar

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.150 
but I'd say it canceled about a similar
amount<00:05:48.780> of<00:05:48.840> noise<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.320> that<00:05:49.500> which<00:05:49.740> is<00:05:49.860> very

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
amount of noise to that which is very

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.080 
amount of noise to that which is very
impressive<00:05:50.580> considering<00:05:51.030> there's<00:05:51.300> no<00:05:51.420> actual

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
impressive considering there's no actual

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.280 
impressive considering there's no actual
technology<00:05:54.090> being<00:05:54.450> used<00:05:54.540> well<00:05:55.080> there's<00:05:55.200> no

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
technology being used well there's no

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.290 
technology being used well there's no
such<00:05:55.500> technology<00:05:56.010> being<00:05:56.160> used<00:05:56.430> here<00:05:56.670> this<00:05:57.120> is

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
such technology being used here this is

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.120 
such technology being used here this is
just<00:05:57.480> passive<00:05:57.960> noise<00:05:58.110> cancelling<00:05:58.680> compared

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
just passive noise cancelling compared

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.280 
just passive noise cancelling compared
to<00:05:59.250> active<00:05:59.580> and<00:05:59.700> does<00:05:59.850> a<00:05:59.880> very<00:06:00.060> good<00:06:00.210> job<00:06:00.290> then

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
to active and does a very good job then

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.290 
to active and does a very good job then
the<00:06:01.380> actual<00:06:01.500> sound<00:06:02.280> quality<00:06:02.700> I'd<00:06:02.760> say<00:06:02.880> is<00:06:02.970> also

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
the actual sound quality I'd say is also

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.000 
the actual sound quality I'd say is also
enhanced<00:06:03.750> by<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:03.930> noise<00:06:04.320> cancelling<00:06:04.830> so<00:06:04.920> you

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
enhanced by the noise cancelling so you

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.500 
enhanced by the noise cancelling so you
put<00:06:05.190> these<00:06:05.280> in<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:05.640> literally<00:06:05.850> all<00:06:06.000> you<00:06:06.300> hear

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
put these in and literally all you hear

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.570 
put these in and literally all you hear
is<00:06:06.660> the<00:06:06.690> music<00:06:07.140> and<00:06:07.380> that's<00:06:07.980> it's<00:06:08.340> quite

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
is the music and that's it's quite

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.570 
is the music and that's it's quite
profound<00:06:08.940> really<00:06:09.270> I<00:06:09.300> mean<00:06:09.510> some<00:06:10.340> earphones<00:06:11.340> do

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
profound really I mean some earphones do

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.950 
profound really I mean some earphones do
something<00:06:11.970> similar<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.390> that<00:06:12.510> but<00:06:12.810> this

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
something similar to that but this

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.480 
something similar to that but this
really<00:06:13.200> is<00:06:13.410> this<00:06:13.560> on<00:06:13.680> a<00:06:13.710> whole<00:06:13.890> new<00:06:14.070> level<00:06:14.220> to

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
really is this on a whole new level to

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.270 
really is this on a whole new level to
anything<00:06:14.790> I've<00:06:14.940> tried<00:06:15.410> the<00:06:16.410> fit<00:06:16.620> is<00:06:16.800> so<00:06:17.010> good

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
anything I've tried the fit is so good

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.030 
anything I've tried the fit is so good
and<00:06:17.460> the<00:06:17.520> seal<00:06:17.760> is<00:06:17.910> so<00:06:18.120> good<00:06:18.360> that<00:06:18.390> you<00:06:18.600> just

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
and the seal is so good that you just

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.180 
and the seal is so good that you just
you<00:06:20.040> become<00:06:20.340> totally<00:06:20.490> immersed<00:06:20.940> in<00:06:21.090> the<00:06:21.180> music

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
you become totally immersed in the music

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.770 
you become totally immersed in the music
so<00:06:23.190> it<00:06:23.490> really<00:06:23.730> is<00:06:23.820> this<00:06:23.970> pretty<00:06:24.210> special<00:06:24.720> in

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
so it really is this pretty special in

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.140 
so it really is this pretty special in
terms<00:06:24.930> of<00:06:25.110> sound<00:06:25.350> quality<00:06:25.430> now<00:06:26.430> I<00:06:26.460> really<00:06:27.000> I

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
terms of sound quality now I really I

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.910 
terms of sound quality now I really I
would<00:06:27.360> demo<00:06:27.600> it<00:06:27.840> to<00:06:28.020> you<00:06:28.140> but<00:06:28.350> YouTube<00:06:28.740> no

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
would demo it to you but YouTube no

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.470 
would demo it to you but YouTube no
longer<00:06:29.160> lets<00:06:29.310> me<00:06:29.460> do<00:06:29.610> that<00:06:29.760> so<00:06:30.300> you'll<00:06:30.420> just

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
longer lets me do that so you'll just

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.060 
longer lets me do that so you'll just
have<00:06:30.630> to<00:06:30.780> take<00:06:30.900> my<00:06:30.960> word<00:06:31.230> for<00:06:31.290> it<00:06:31.560> and<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:31.860> fact

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
have to take my word for it and the fact

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.110 
have to take my word for it and the fact
that<00:06:32.100> these<00:06:32.340> things<00:06:32.550> sound<00:06:32.790> absolutely

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
that these things sound absolutely

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.270 
that these things sound absolutely
amazing<00:06:33.810> as<00:06:34.620> to<00:06:34.800> how<00:06:34.890> long<00:06:34.950> they're<00:06:35.220> gonna

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
amazing as to how long they're gonna

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.610 
amazing as to how long they're gonna
last<00:06:35.610> I've<00:06:35.880> got<00:06:35.910> no<00:06:36.180> idea<00:06:36.210> to<00:06:36.600> be<00:06:36.690> honest<00:06:36.960> I've

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
last I've got no idea to be honest I've

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.640 
last I've got no idea to be honest I've
only<00:06:37.800> had<00:06:37.950> these<00:06:38.130> for<00:06:38.280> about<00:06:38.370> two<00:06:38.610> weeks

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
only had these for about two weeks

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.340 
only had these for about two weeks
and<00:06:39.740> I<00:06:40.250> mean<00:06:40.400> so<00:06:40.550> far<00:06:40.729> they've<00:06:40.880> been<00:06:41.030> fine<00:06:41.350> no

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
and I mean so far they've been fine no

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.219 
and I mean so far they've been fine no
problems<00:06:43.030> no<00:06:44.030> sort<00:06:44.389> of<00:06:44.479> breaking<00:06:44.720> up<00:06:45.020> in<00:06:45.199> the

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
problems no sort of breaking up in the

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.790 
problems no sort of breaking up in the
cable<00:06:45.500> or<00:06:45.770> anything<00:06:45.979> like<00:06:46.190> that<00:06:47.259> but<00:06:48.259> time

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
cable or anything like that but time

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.420 
cable or anything like that but time
will<00:06:48.949> tell

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
will tell

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.920 
will tell
I<00:06:49.460> made<00:06:49.850> your<00:06:49.940> follow<00:06:50.210> up<00:06:50.330> review<00:06:50.509> in<00:06:50.690> six

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
I made your follow up review in six

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.240 
I made your follow up review in six
months<00:06:51.199> or<00:06:51.289> so<00:06:51.440> to<00:06:51.500> see<00:06:51.650> how<00:06:51.740> they're<00:06:51.949> holding

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
months or so to see how they're holding

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.040 
months or so to see how they're holding
up<00:06:52.370> but<00:06:52.639> for<00:06:53.270> now<00:06:53.360> all<00:06:53.509> I<00:06:53.539> can<00:06:53.630> say<00:06:53.840> as<00:06:53.930> they

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
up but for now all I can say as they

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.439 
up but for now all I can say as they
sound<00:06:54.320> absolutely<00:06:54.860> incredible<00:06:55.520> you<00:06:56.210> should

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
sound absolutely incredible you should

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.659 
sound absolutely incredible you should
probably<00:06:56.750> just<00:06:56.990> go<00:06:57.320> out<00:06:57.440> and<00:06:57.470> buy<00:06:57.770> them<00:06:58.039> if<00:06:58.220> you

00:06:58.659 --> 00:06:58.669 
probably just go out and buy them if you

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.310 
probably just go out and buy them if you
can<00:06:58.850> find<00:06:59.060> them<00:06:59.180> for<00:06:59.330> anywhere<00:06:59.690> less<00:06:59.900> than<00:07:00.139> two

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
can find them for anywhere less than two

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.870 
can find them for anywhere less than two
hundred<00:07:00.350> pounds<00:07:00.979> I'd<00:07:01.100> say<00:07:01.280> it's<00:07:01.430> a<00:07:01.490> good<00:07:01.669> deal

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
hundred pounds I'd say it's a good deal

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.930 
hundred pounds I'd say it's a good deal
you<00:07:02.199> got<00:07:03.199> a<00:07:03.229> really<00:07:03.500> nice<00:07:03.740> swish<00:07:04.100> case<00:07:04.460> with<00:07:04.910> a

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 
you got a really nice swish case with a

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.100 
you got a really nice swish case with a
holder<00:07:05.419> and<00:07:06.850> more<00:07:07.850> things<00:07:08.180> in<00:07:08.479> there<00:07:08.660> you<00:07:08.870> can

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
holder and more things in there you can

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.279 
holder and more things in there you can
get<00:07:09.229> a<00:07:09.289> six<00:07:09.590> point<00:07:09.800> five<00:07:09.919> millimeter

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:11.289 
get a six point five millimeter

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:14.320 
get a six point five millimeter
appliance<00:07:12.289> jack<00:07:12.610> and<00:07:13.610> it's<00:07:13.820> just<00:07:14.030> you<00:07:14.240> know

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
appliance jack and it's just you know

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.900 
appliance jack and it's just you know
it's<00:07:14.510> a<00:07:14.690> really<00:07:15.020> really<00:07:15.139> good<00:07:15.350> package<00:07:15.910> way

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:16.910 
it's a really really good package way
