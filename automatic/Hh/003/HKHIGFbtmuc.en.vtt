00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.210
 people said john doe young people we get 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.710
 found for a little video about 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.359
 stricken waiting for you that it 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.470
 is fine for as you say it will 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.330
 nickel I have the potato and so we are 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.630
 gone for a little video on destiny 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.970
 tutorial in cropped 33 hard levels 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.580
 how to kill this moment is wearing a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.590
 bastide in just two swords and 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.059
 only be careful two fallen by and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 peace because I know a lot who 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.190
 know how to bring croque wrong in two 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.059
 ep but three fell by ep there i'm going 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.190
 you only learn it 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.210
 started with two fallen by ep there 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.460
 who knows how to do it I know 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.539
 because I've already seen but it's 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.829
 rather rhin and I'm going to you 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.820
 learn how to do it then I will you 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.010
 say right before we start 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.539
 it's a fairly complex technique or to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.980
 you have to have a beast clips 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.210
 with whom you are used to playing 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.559
 you will not do it with anyone 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.120
 because you have to know your allies 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.340
 to know how often they are going 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.180
 to fall when etc is to talk to each other it's a 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.670
 nice work of equipped 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.019
 but finally when you control her this 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.610
 technique you go a lot less 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.619
 galley for Copts to 33 at least in 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.840
 time term though if you are 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.010
 very very well did she if you are very 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.630
 comfortable with the technique and you 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.220
 use already, ie pass them 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.030
 ogres and kills him after continue this 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.049
 technical because I can you 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.850
 guarantee that this one is a little bit more 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.080
 complicated you have to master it you have to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.150
 someone with the blade who knows a little 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.770
 little mastered his character and they know 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.640
 down who's already used to managing the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.479
 blade because you will not do it 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.920
 like this overnight 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.820
 at least for those who have never 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.750
 hit a blade so this tutorial does not 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.920
 not for everyone I know 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.880
 already I already see the prints them which 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.040
 will say yes but I know how to do it 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.659
 me since before even cropped 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.979
 isort javel shut up my mouth so here 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.630
 we'll calm down right now 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.189
 is really for someone concerned 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.810
 okay so if you know how to do it 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.060
 jealous to leave the video we have on 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.500
 stop there okay so here is already a 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.490
 big big up with the people who is for 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.810
 people who were with me so there 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.189
 had had mortals and arms neither with 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.079
 tanks that is big big albatross up 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.509
 we were five sailboats so there is 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.710
 really easy to do six there 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.869
 had immortal who was in charge of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.939
 put the bubble right side for me for 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.259
 charge to occupy the boomers during 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.369
 that others shoot and on kraft has 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.140
 himself even that I assure Coptic 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.329
 also bigard not everyone 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.439
 worried it's a nice job of equipped 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.520
 happened is that I had just 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.450
 put two or three work for the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.099
 to succeed is the first time 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.120
 I was trying in d3 trail west and 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.920
 it was not bad 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.200
 so here we go right away 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.519
 started as I get on the wear to 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.989
 tell you a little bit what it takes 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.400
 make 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.110
 during this work though so here 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.400
 already you have 30 seconds top chrono 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.659
 once you have the sword in your hand 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.580
 serves to make the bed wearing 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.060
 more possible closer to possible 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.010
 this stele 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.500
 once it's done it'll have to 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.000
 really going inflicted the squatting 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.250
 same damage session ie a 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.900
 combo r1 r2 small sword shots wholesale 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.549
 sword shots that will have to make three 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.989
 times ie small shot to make a 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.370
 big shot tunes of little blow of 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.659
 akin to big shot of r2 like at home 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.370
 do a little bit of here a 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.019
 big shot of sea ​​three times by 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.680
 fall and you saw that it goes to 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.720
 millimeter 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.269
 you also saw that my first 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.920
 shot of r1 did not pass he was 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.359
 marked in immune because I have too much 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.599
 scared fell a little bit too much 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.790
 late 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.690
 it's not serious and I'm just 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.609
 speak a little bit during that time 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.040
 of this margin of error you have a 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.629
 margin of error you can knock down 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.950
 to cropped in the core 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.170
 if you do this technique and an air 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.409
 RR of the Rhine and two each fallen 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.620
 the soul twice but to the only 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:15.120
 condition that you have only one r12 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.319
 of error is to say that if you do not 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.180
 do not pass a field that is a small 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.620
 rat that does not go well agree 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.389
 it does not matter if you do not 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.829
 will not it's not 2 it's fucking you 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.840
 see that in the end I just have 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.730
 made this small mistake of typing a 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.940
 little bit too soon and you go 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.840
 see that in the end I just kill him 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.970
 while I had done the job 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.680
 perfect way ie if 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.510
 you make a little air 1 that pass 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.859
 disagree there by thuram years and over 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.260
 you can already start 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.790
 or so stopped before the fury for the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.959
 kill after others okay what 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.400
 otherwise it's dead you and I tell you 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.319
 right now you'll see from any 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.180
 way by your own eyes only if 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.560
 I put a little by little one more 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.109
 who did not pass he would never fall 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.519
 So that was the little girl 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.019
 technique to make it fall like that 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.190
 you will see we will go back and that 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.319
 will be gone to put him his 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.489
 last session here so I'd like to 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.049
 same time pass a little message like 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.519
 I have more or less fine is that 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.079
 I had to tell you about this on this tutorial 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.609
 to tell you that the links 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.260
 missing I still have masses that 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.269
 ask me to go there to tell you I have 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.829
 335 messages waiting on the on the 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.510
 but I can not accept 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.669
 people in the missing links the 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.419
 ch the clan is full so what I you 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.829
 request is to be a little bit 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.260
 patient because we eat enough 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.190
 busy as I sort through the clan 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.900
 links to see if there are any 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.540
 inactive and that is to accept the most 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.220
 active in 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.330
 you are here so I ask you for a 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.700
 little short time please what 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.930
 it's not easy here and so it's 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.580
 gone for the fallout you saw I 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.050
 am still not in a rage so that wants 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.330
 to say that this is where it's going to be at the 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.770
 limit to the limit and so look good 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.320
 the movements of the character I want to 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.940
 also specify small precision that 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.070
 if you want to inflict all this damage 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.540
 with croupons it is necessary that at the same time 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.190
 that you're typing with your clam that 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.840
 you push your joystick towards 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.640
 croupons if you do not touch 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.410
 your joystick your perso is going to be great 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.700
 slow in his blade maneuverability and 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.930
 so you really will not be able to 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.520
 you do not have the time I have 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.050
 inflicted this damage there so when you 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.550
 type hop you push your joystick 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.410
 towards crotone as if you were advancing 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.870
 on it and that will make your character 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.030
 much faster and I do not know anymore 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.050
 believe that the agility that makes up that 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.610
 raise the speed of your 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.600
 handling of the blade it seems to me that if 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.280
 you have more agility 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.390
 you have more speed in your 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.860
 handling the personal self she is at 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.210
 magic cleat and so I advise you 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.290
 even if you put your age there 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.970
 attack when you are a hunter 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.800
 because in addition to allowing you to 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.910
 typing faster you are more agile and 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.040
 it allows you to climb a lot more 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.690
 easily and so that's it in 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.970
 waiting I hope this little tutorial 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.520
 you liked it and that you arrived that you 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.900
 will come sorry for making it to your 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.920
 turn and me for my part I tell you to 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.240
 next time for a next 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.240
 video using on gaubert
