00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
right before it came over us so there's

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.689 
right before it came over us so there's
a<00:00:42.589> lot<00:00:42.769> of<00:00:42.800> cracking<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.400> stuff<00:00:43.550> in<00:00:43.640> the

lights<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.300> don't<00:02:20.450> see<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.020> actual<00:02:21.290> bulb<00:02:21.680> you

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
lights you don't see the actual bulb you

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.570 
lights you don't see the actual bulb you
see<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.790> ball<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.590> outside<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.459> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
see the ball on the outside of the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.140 
see the ball on the outside of the
headlight<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:27.709> projects<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.879> light

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
headlight and it projects the light

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.210 
headlight and it projects the light
which<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:30.049> why<00:02:30.200> it's<00:02:30.349> called<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.620> projector

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
which is why it's called the projector

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.060 
which is why it's called the projector
it<00:02:32.550> gives<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.780> brighter<00:02:34.530> look<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.980> a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
it gives it a brighter look in a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.430 
it gives it a brighter look in a
magnified<00:02:35.730> look<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:36.870> them<00:02:37.050> focused

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
magnified look and I have them focused

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.230 
magnified look and I have them focused
in<00:02:37.590> at<00:02:37.770> about<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.160> same<00:02:38.340> level<00:02:38.760> as<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.970> grill

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
in at about the same level as the grill

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.930 
in at about the same level as the grill
so<00:02:39.630> we<00:02:39.900> all<00:02:40.290> know<00:02:40.530> those<00:02:40.680> people<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.280> focus

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
so we all know those people that focus

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.150 
so we all know those people that focus
them<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.510> lot<00:02:42.780> higher<00:02:43.470> than<00:02:43.740> that<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.100> we

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
them in a lot higher than that and we

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.260 
them in a lot higher than that and we
always<00:02:44.250> think<00:02:44.490> they<00:02:44.580> have<00:02:44.670> their<00:02:44.820> brights<00:02:45.060> on

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
always think they have their brights on

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.030 
always think they have their brights on
they're<00:02:45.570> just<00:02:45.750> rude<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.290> focused<00:02:46.890> their

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
they're just rude and focused their

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.370 
they're just rude and focused their
light<00:02:47.190> bulbs<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.550> way<00:02:47.960> but<00:02:48.960> I<00:02:48.990> really<00:02:49.230> like

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
light bulbs that way but I really like

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.140 
light bulbs that way but I really like
the<00:02:49.500> look<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:49.890> there's<00:02:50.130> four<00:02:50.190> LEDs<00:02:50.880> at<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
the look of it there's four LEDs at the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.060 
the look of it there's four LEDs at the
bottom<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.660> will<00:02:51.780> do<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.020> more<00:02:52.260> I'll<00:02:52.650> do<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.860> more

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
bottom it will do a more I'll do a more

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.000 
bottom it will do a more I'll do a more
focused<00:02:54.170> part<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.290> video<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.740> will<00:02:55.830> come

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
focused part of the video that will come

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.200 
focused part of the video that will come
about<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.940> 30<00:02:57.240> seconds<00:02:57.690> maybe<00:02:58.640> but<00:02:59.640> there<00:02:59.970> are

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
about in 30 seconds maybe but there are

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.200 
about in 30 seconds maybe but there are
two<00:03:00.720> halos<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.680> each<00:03:01.860> light<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.340> four<00:03:02.580> LEDs<00:03:03.030> at

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
two halos on each light and four LEDs at

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.940 
two halos on each light and four LEDs at
the<00:03:03.300> bottom<00:03:03.630> of<00:03:03.780> each<00:03:03.900> light<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.440> what<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.680> did

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
the bottom of each light and what I did

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.160 
the bottom of each light and what I did
is<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.160> wired<00:03:05.580> those<00:03:05.940> into<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.570> parking<00:03:06.960> light

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
is I wired those into the parking light

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.990 
is I wired those into the parking light
which<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.710> orange<00:03:07.980> light<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.430> side<00:03:08.670> as

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
which is the orange light on the side as

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.970 
which is the orange light on the side as
you<00:03:09.900> can<00:03:10.020> see<00:03:10.110> they're<00:03:10.260> pretty<00:03:10.290> bright<00:03:10.620> as<00:03:10.860> it

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
you can see they're pretty bright as it

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.620 
you can see they're pretty bright as it
is<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.310> they<00:03:11.400> look<00:03:11.610> really<00:03:12.000> good<00:03:12.180> with<00:03:12.390> the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
is and they look really good with the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.920 
is and they look really good with the
white<00:03:12.870> LED<00:03:13.170> grill<00:03:13.800> lights<00:03:14.360> should<00:03:15.360> focus<00:03:15.750> in

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
white LED grill lights should focus in

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.050 
white LED grill lights should focus in
here<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.910> there<00:03:18.240> goes<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:19.730> starts<00:03:20.730> from<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
here and there goes it starts from the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.340 
here and there goes it starts from the
bottom<00:03:21.210> of<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.510> circle<00:03:21.810> which<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.020> can<00:03:22.170> see

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
bottom of the circle which you can see

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.930 
bottom of the circle which you can see
and<00:03:22.590> then<00:03:22.710> it<00:03:22.860> just<00:03:23.070> goes<00:03:23.310> around<00:03:23.550> that's

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
and then it just goes around that's

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.580 
and then it just goes around that's
where<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.240> light<00:03:24.420> originates<00:03:24.900> from<00:03:24.990> there

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
where the light originates from there

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.620 
where the light originates from there
the<00:03:25.920> four<00:03:26.130> LEDs<00:03:26.520> that<00:03:26.550> show<00:03:26.940> really<00:03:27.300> well

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
the four LEDs that show really well

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.200 
the four LEDs that show really well
during<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.170> daytime<00:03:28.590> even<00:03:28.980> when<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:29.970> really

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
during the daytime even when it's really

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.140 
during the daytime even when it's really
bright<00:03:30.390> outside<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.900> summertime<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.620> it's

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
bright outside it's summertime so it's

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.850 
bright outside it's summertime so it's
extremely<00:03:33.150> bright<00:03:33.270> here<00:03:33.510> right<00:03:33.660> now<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.140> when

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
extremely bright here right now and when

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.199 
extremely bright here right now and when
I<00:03:34.920> put<00:03:35.130> these<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.490> was<00:03:35.610> just<00:03:35.730> shocked<00:03:36.000> about

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
I put these in I was just shocked about

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.260 
I put these in I was just shocked about
how<00:03:36.770> bright<00:03:37.770> they<00:03:37.980> are<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.340> during<00:03:39.150> the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
how bright they are and during the

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.930 
how bright they are and during the
daytime<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.780> gives<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.320> cars<00:03:40.590> such<00:03:41.550> a<00:03:41.580> better

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
daytime it gives the cars such a better

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.670 
daytime it gives the cars such a better
look<00:03:42.300> than<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:43.050> would<00:03:43.200> think

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680
