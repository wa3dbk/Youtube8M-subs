it<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:24.180> mod<00:00:24.510> we're<00:00:24.779> actually<00:00:24.990> looking<00:00:25.230> at<00:00:25.470> is

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
it this mod we're actually looking at is

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.920 
it this mod we're actually looking at is
the<00:00:25.890> volcano<00:00:26.310> mod<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> cool<00:00:27.510> little<00:00:27.660> mod

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
the volcano mod a cool little mod

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.429 
the volcano mod a cool little mod
there's<00:00:28.800> been<00:00:28.980> around<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.400> long<00:00:29.460> but

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
there's been around for that long but

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.080 
there's been around for that long but
yeah<00:00:31.439> basically<00:00:31.679> incorporates<00:00:32.520> volcanoes

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
yeah basically incorporates volcanoes

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.479 
yeah basically incorporates volcanoes
now<00:00:33.329> there<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.290> two<00:00:34.590> versions<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.190> have

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
now there is two versions you can have

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.979 
now there is two versions you can have
there's<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:36.000> version<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.570> has<00:00:36.600> them

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
there's one version that has them

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.389 
there's one version that has them
naturally<00:00:37.200> spawning<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.010> world<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
naturally spawning in the world and

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.069 
naturally spawning in the world and
there<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.090> another<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:39.510> which<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> one<00:00:39.930> I'm

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
there is another one which the one I'm

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.830 
there is another one which the one I'm
using<00:00:40.110> which<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.520> craft<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.329> volcano

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
using which you can craft a volcano

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.229 
using which you can craft a volcano
supporter<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.129> obviously<00:00:44.910> I'm<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.120> doing

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
supporter and obviously I'm just doing

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.400 
supporter and obviously I'm just doing
this<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.390> more<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.960> sake<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.170> just

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
this one more for the sake of just

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.830 
this one more for the sake of just
showing<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> looks<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.780> do

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
showing you what it looks like so how do

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.819 
showing you what it looks like so how do
you<00:00:48.930> create<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.200> born<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.590> because

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you create this born up because

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.779 
you create this born up because
obviously<00:00:49.980> you're<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> create<00:00:50.670> this

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
obviously you're going to create this

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.000 
obviously you're going to create this
point<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.390> all<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.620> simply<00:00:52.800> get

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
point and all you do is you simply get

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.720 
point and all you do is you simply get
some<00:00:53.219> sit<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:54.559> CN<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.980> say<00:00:56.129> properly<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
some sit in CN if I say properly and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.180 
some sit in CN if I say properly and
place<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.239> corners<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
place it in the corners like that and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.060 
place it in the corners like that and
you<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.850> T&amp;T<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.930> felt<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> out<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
you get to for T&amp;T you felt the out the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.100 
you get to for T&amp;T you felt the out the
four<00:01:02.430> slots<00:01:02.579> outside<00:01:03.149> then<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
four slots outside then you get a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.780 
four slots outside then you get a
diamond<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> plunk<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> middle

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
diamond and you plunk it in the middle

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.550 
diamond and you plunk it in the middle
and<00:01:05.939> there<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.689> bucket<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.080> lava<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.409> it

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and there is what a bucket of lava up it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.420 
and there is what a bucket of lava up it
is<00:01:07.650> easy<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.850> volcano<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.600> spawn<00:01:10.110> up

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
is easy but it is a volcano to spawn up

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.880 
is easy but it is a volcano to spawn up
so<00:01:11.430> yeah<00:01:11.820> we'll<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.510> leave<00:01:13.200> them<00:01:13.439> there<00:01:13.650> will
