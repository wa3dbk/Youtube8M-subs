00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
as I was a kid growing up and how trails

as I was a kid growing up and how trails
have<00:02:53.280> kind<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.580> been<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.820> focal<00:02:54.209> point

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320

have kind of been a focal point
throughout<00:02:55.320> my<00:02:55.470> life<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:56.070> little<00:02:56.400> thread<00:02:56.700> is

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
throughout my life this little thread is

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.180 
throughout my life this little thread is
woven<00:02:57.630> through<00:02:58.019> things<00:02:58.290> but<00:02:58.590> not<00:02:58.799> only<00:02:58.950> were

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
woven through things but not only were

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.090 
woven through things but not only were
trails<00:02:59.820> a<00:03:00.209> part<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.810> my<00:03:01.410> childhood

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
trails a part of my childhood

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.070 
trails a part of my childhood
but<00:03:02.430> motorcycling<00:03:03.030> was<00:03:03.180> also<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> part<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.930> it

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
but motorcycling was also a part of it

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.970 
but motorcycling was also a part of it
my<00:03:04.890> dad<00:03:05.070> used<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.400> race<00:03:05.610> motocross<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:07.470> used

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
my dad used to race motocross and I used

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.920 
my dad used to race motocross and I used
to<00:03:08.130> beg<00:03:08.430> my<00:03:08.700> mom<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:09.090> go<00:03:09.209> with<00:03:09.390> him<00:03:09.540> every

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
to beg my mom to go with him every

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.630 
to beg my mom to go with him every
weekend<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.560> races<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.489> was

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
weekend to the races and that was

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.160 
weekend to the races and that was
probably<00:03:11.820> about<00:03:12.269> five<00:03:12.540> years<00:03:12.690> old<00:03:12.870> at<00:03:13.049> the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
probably about five years old at the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.090 
probably about five years old at the
time<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:14.459> race<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:14.940> didn't<00:03:15.269> go<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.420> though

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
time the race that I didn't go to though

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.890 
time the race that I didn't go to though
was<00:03:17.100> his<00:03:17.220> last<00:03:17.430> race<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.090> that's<00:03:18.420> because<00:03:18.780> he

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
was his last race and that's because he

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.560 
was his last race and that's because he
got<00:03:19.049> hit<00:03:19.260> by<00:03:19.290> another<00:03:19.799> bike<00:03:20.519> coming<00:03:21.120> out<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.480> a
