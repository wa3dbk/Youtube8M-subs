00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.060 

hello<00:00:00.450> everyone<00:00:00.870> and<00:00:00.900> welcome<00:00:01.199> in<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:01.920> video

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hello everyone and welcome in this video

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.260 
hello everyone and welcome in this video
we're<00:00:02.280> going<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.429> be<00:00:02.520> talking<00:00:02.669> about<00:00:02.909> soft

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
we're going to be talking about soft

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.630 
we're going to be talking about soft
versus<00:00:03.750> hard<00:00:04.020> Springs<00:00:04.470> on<00:00:04.799> which<00:00:05.250> one<00:00:05.490> is

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
versus hard Springs on which one is

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.579 
versus hard Springs on which one is
better<00:00:05.940> so<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:06.629> may<00:00:06.930> think<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.259> because

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
better so you may think that because

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.440 
better so you may think that because
sports<00:00:07.890> cars<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.309> race<00:00:08.639> cars<00:00:08.970> use<00:00:09.179> really

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
sports cars and race cars use really

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.600 
sports cars and race cars use really
stiff<00:00:09.750> Springs<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.740> that's<00:00:10.950> what's<00:00:11.219> best

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
stiff Springs that that's what's best

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.339 
stiff Springs that that's what's best
but<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:12.179> reality<00:00:12.389> if<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.929> want<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.200> most

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
but in reality if you want the most

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.279 
but in reality if you want the most
maximum<00:00:13.950> grip<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.759> want<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.030> softer<00:00:15.480> spring<00:00:15.630> so

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
maximum grip you want a softer spring so

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.200 
maximum grip you want a softer spring so
why<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.590> there<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.100> differentiation<00:00:17.789> let's

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
why is there this differentiation let's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.240 
why is there this differentiation let's
talk<00:00:18.390> about<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:19.859> we've<00:00:20.010> got

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
talk about that and so what we've got

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.080 
talk about that and so what we've got
here<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:21.199> a<00:00:22.369> depression<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.640> roads<00:00:23.850> we've

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
here is a depression in the roads we've

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.939 
here is a depression in the roads we've
got<00:00:24.240> two<00:00:24.480> cars<00:00:24.720> driving<00:00:25.170> they're<00:00:25.619> about<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
got two cars driving they're about to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.679 
got two cars driving they're about to
collide<00:00:26.340> which<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.730> unfortunate<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:27.510> that's

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
collide which is unfortunate but that's

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.480 
collide which is unfortunate but that's
irrelevant<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.890> these<00:00:29.010> two<00:00:29.250> wheels

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
irrelevant so we have these two wheels

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.070 
irrelevant so we have these two wheels
and<00:00:30.240> they're<00:00:30.390> traveling<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:30.900> one's

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and they're traveling this one's

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.240 
and they're traveling this one's
traveling<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.529> direction<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:32.070> one's

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
traveling this direction this one's

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.830 
traveling this direction this one's
traveling<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.759> direction<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.719> have

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
traveling this direction and we have

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.540 
traveling this direction and we have
this<00:00:33.989> twenty<00:00:34.380> millimeter<00:00:34.770> depression<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
this twenty millimeter depression in the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.160 
this twenty millimeter depression in the
road<00:00:35.730> now<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.329> only<00:00:36.630> difference<00:00:37.020> between

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
road now the only difference between

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.350 
road now the only difference between
these<00:00:37.530> two<00:00:37.770> vehicles<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.820> spring<00:00:39.149> rate

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
these two vehicles is the spring rate

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.780 
these two vehicles is the spring rate
and<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> left<00:00:41.219> side<00:00:41.460> is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
and so what we have on the left side is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.360 
and so what we have on the left side is
a<00:00:41.870> spring<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.350> placed<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.890> thousand

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
a spring and we placed a thousand

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
a spring and we placed a thousand
kilograms<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.360> about<00:00:45.750> 10,000<00:00:46.530> Newton's

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
kilograms on it or about 10,000 Newton's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.069 
kilograms on it or about 10,000 Newton's
of<00:00:47.100> force<00:00:47.180> down<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.480> spring<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
of force down on this spring and that

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.049 
of force down on this spring and that
compressed<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> hundred<00:00:50.010> millimeters<00:00:50.579> so

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
compressed it a hundred millimeters so

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.910 
compressed it a hundred millimeters so
that<00:00:51.210> gives<00:00:51.449> us<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.809> spring<00:00:52.140> rate<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.770> hundred

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that gives us a spring rate of a hundred

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.830 
that gives us a spring rate of a hundred
Newton's<00:00:53.460> per<00:00:53.610> millimeter<00:00:53.730> ten<00:00:54.420> thousand

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
Newton's per millimeter ten thousand

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.150 
Newton's per millimeter ten thousand
divided<00:00:55.020> by<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> hundred<00:00:55.379> hundred<00:00:55.920> Newton's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
divided by a hundred hundred Newton's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.779 
divided by a hundred hundred Newton's
per<00:00:56.280> millimeter<00:00:56.570> this<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> right

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
per millimeter this one on the right

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.369 
per millimeter this one on the right
spring<00:00:59.789> be<00:01:00.120> basically<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.350> is

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
spring be basically what we have is

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.380 
spring be basically what we have is
we've<00:01:01.680> placed<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.129> same<00:01:02.399> load<00:01:02.670> ten<00:01:02.969> thousand

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
we've placed that same load ten thousand

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
we've placed that same load ten thousand
Newtons<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.290> spring<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:04.949> only

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
Newtons on this spring but it's only

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.820 
Newtons on this spring but it's only
compressed<00:01:05.760> ten<00:01:06.090> millimeters<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> thousand

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
compressed ten millimeters so a thousand

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 
compressed ten millimeters so a thousand
Newton's<00:01:08.130> per<00:01:08.340> millimeter<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.360> what's<00:01:09.900> going

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
Newton's per millimeter so what's going

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
Newton's per millimeter so what's going
to<00:01:10.229> happen<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.920> these<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> travel

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
to happen is these are going to travel

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.420 
to happen is these are going to travel
over<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.479> depression<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:14.130> want<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
over this depression and we want to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.429 
over this depression and we want to
maintain<00:01:14.880> contact<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> ground<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
maintain contact with the ground the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.590 
maintain contact with the ground the
whole<00:01:16.590> point<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.250> suspension<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.420> keep

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
whole point of a suspension is to keep

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
whole point of a suspension is to keep
the<00:01:18.750> tires<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.770> ground<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.250> hopefully

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the tires on the ground so hopefully

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.670 
the tires on the ground so hopefully
that<00:01:20.790> much<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> understood<00:01:21.500> seems<00:01:22.500> pretty

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
that much is understood seems pretty

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.920 
that much is understood seems pretty
obvious<00:01:22.799> cars<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:24.000> only<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> things<00:01:24.509> that

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
obvious cars can only do the things that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.390 
obvious cars can only do the things that
they<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.770> tires<00:01:26.040> are<00:01:26.310> actually

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
they do if the tires are actually

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.240 
they do if the tires are actually
touching<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.119> ground<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:29.070> we've<00:01:29.220> got

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
touching the ground so what we've got

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.039 
touching the ground so what we've got
here<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.939> car<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.299> about<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.509> leave<00:01:30.810> over

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
here is this car is about to leave over

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.020 
here is this car is about to leave over
this<00:01:31.560> ledge<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.400> then<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:32.850> got<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
this ledge here and then it's got a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
this ledge here and then it's got a
twenty<00:01:33.390> millimeter<00:01:33.750> gap<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.170> fill<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.619> it's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
twenty millimeter gap to fill and it's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.350 
twenty millimeter gap to fill and it's
got<00:01:35.100> 100<00:01:35.430> millimetres<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.880> spring

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
got 100 millimetres of spring

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.210 
got 100 millimetres of spring
compression<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.979> look<00:01:38.130> at

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
compression to do it so if you look at

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.950 
compression to do it so if you look at
this<00:01:38.340> little<00:01:38.579> graph<00:01:38.820> right<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.150> we've<00:01:39.780> got

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
this little graph right here we've got

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.300 
this little graph right here we've got
our<00:01:40.020> amount<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.470> spring<00:01:40.710> compression<00:01:41.189> which

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
our amount of spring compression which

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.249 
our amount of spring compression which
is<00:01:41.340> 100<00:01:41.759> millimeters<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.899> force

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
is 100 millimeters and then the force

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.160 
is 100 millimeters and then the force
which<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.130> spring<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.170> 10,000

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
which is on that spring so 10,000

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
Newton's at this point in time so as it

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.530 
Newton's at this point in time so as it
goes<00:01:49.590> over<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.250> gap<00:01:50.640> you're<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> have

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
goes over this gap you're going to have

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.800 
goes over this gap you're going to have
10,000<00:01:52.259> Newton's<00:01:52.590> pressing<00:01:53.340> down<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.119> this

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
10,000 Newton's pressing down on this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.810 
10,000 Newton's pressing down on this
wheel<00:01:55.140> which<00:01:55.619> will<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:55.950> say<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> wheel<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
wheel which will just say the wheel is a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.840 
wheel which will just say the wheel is a
hundred<00:01:57.509> kilograms<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.490> will<00:01:59.610> press

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
hundred kilograms and so it will press

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.330 
hundred kilograms and so it will press
down<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.450> wheel<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.530> try<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.040> get<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
down on that wheel and try and get it to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.399 
down on that wheel and try and get it to
contact<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.000> ground<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.869> got<00:02:04.049> 100

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
contact this ground and it's got 100

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.260 
contact this ground and it's got 100
millimeters<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.950> compression<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.820> push<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
millimeters of compression to push that

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.479 
millimeters of compression to push that
wheel<00:02:06.540> down<00:02:06.899> because<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:07.890> been<00:02:08.069> compressed

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
wheel down because it's been compressed

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.880 
wheel down because it's been compressed
that<00:02:08.729> much<00:02:08.910> from<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.300> weight<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> car<00:02:09.929> so

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
that much from the weight of the car so

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.920 
that much from the weight of the car so
as<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.400> travels<00:02:11.760> over<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.150> you've<00:02:12.390> got<00:02:12.629> 20

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
as it travels over it you've got 20

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.830 
as it travels over it you've got 20
millimeters<00:02:13.349> so<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.560> going<00:02:13.680> to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
millimeters so it's going to

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.260 
millimeters so it's going to
from<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.200> hundred<00:02:14.620> down<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.220> eighty<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.790> so

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
from a hundred down to eighty and so

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.240 
from a hundred down to eighty and so
when<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.569> at<00:02:16.750> eighty<00:02:17.020> now<00:02:17.590> because<00:02:18.069> we've

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
when it's at eighty now because we've

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.800 
when it's at eighty now because we've
got<00:02:18.430> eighty<00:02:18.670> millimeters<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.270> compression<00:02:19.720> in

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
got eighty millimeters of compression in

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.630 
got eighty millimeters of compression in
the<00:02:19.840> spring<00:02:19.930> we've<00:02:20.590> got<00:02:20.800> an<00:02:20.890> 8,000

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
the spring we've got an 8,000

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.270 
the spring we've got an 8,000
kilonewtons<00:02:22.630> force<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.650> if<00:02:23.890> we<00:02:24.010> take<00:02:24.130> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
kilonewtons force so if we take the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.160 
kilonewtons force so if we take the
average<00:02:24.400> of<00:02:24.670> those<00:02:24.819> ten<00:02:25.360> thousand<00:02:25.840> Newtons<00:02:26.080> at

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
average of those ten thousand Newtons at

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.660 
average of those ten thousand Newtons at
the<00:02:26.290> start<00:02:26.560> eight<00:02:26.950> thousand<00:02:27.400> Newtons

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
the start eight thousand Newtons

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.460 
the start eight thousand Newtons
pressing<00:02:28.000> down<00:02:28.150> at<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.420> end<00:02:28.599> right<00:02:29.200> when<00:02:29.380> it

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
pressing down at the end right when it

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.710 
pressing down at the end right when it
hits<00:02:29.650> contact<00:02:30.220> we've<00:02:31.180> got<00:02:31.330> an<00:02:31.390> average<00:02:31.480> of

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
hits contact we've got an average of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.080 
hits contact we've got an average of
about<00:02:31.810> nine<00:02:32.200> kilonewtons<00:02:32.950> nine<00:02:33.640> thousand

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
about nine kilonewtons nine thousand

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.790 
about nine kilonewtons nine thousand
Newtons<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.840> we<00:02:34.989> know<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.110> force<00:02:35.470> equals

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
Newtons so we know that force equals

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.530 
Newtons so we know that force equals
mass<00:02:35.980> times<00:02:36.280> acceleration

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
mass times acceleration

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.180 
mass times acceleration
acceleration<00:02:38.140> equals<00:02:38.319> force<00:02:38.560> divided<00:02:39.069> by

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
acceleration equals force divided by

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.949 
acceleration equals force divided by
mass<00:02:39.280> nine<00:02:39.970> thousand<00:02:40.390> five<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.599> buy<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.720> hundred

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
mass nine thousand five to buy a hundred

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.920 
mass nine thousand five to buy a hundred
kilograms<00:02:41.200> that's<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.430> mass<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.750> wheel

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
kilograms that's the mass of the wheel

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.530 
kilograms that's the mass of the wheel
we'll<00:02:44.410> have<00:02:44.560> about<00:02:44.650> nine<00:02:45.069> GS<00:02:45.459> pushing<00:02:46.060> down<00:02:46.330> on

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
we'll have about nine GS pushing down on

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.830 
we'll have about nine GS pushing down on
that<00:02:46.630> wheel<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:48.250> if<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.819> add<00:02:49.000> gravity<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.660> that

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
that wheel so if you add gravity to that

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.259 
that wheel so if you add gravity to that
once<00:02:50.380> this<00:02:50.680> tire<00:02:50.920> goes<00:02:51.190> over<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.549> gap<00:02:51.819> it's

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
once this tire goes over this gap it's

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.050 
once this tire goes over this gap it's
got<00:02:52.480> ten<00:02:52.810> GS<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.350> acceleration<00:02:53.680> acting<00:02:54.549> on<00:02:54.880> it

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
got ten GS of acceleration acting on it

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.759 
got ten GS of acceleration acting on it
pressing<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.840> down<00:02:55.870> towards<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.440> ground<00:02:56.470> so

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
pressing it down towards the ground so

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.229 
pressing it down towards the ground so
it's<00:02:56.890> going<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.040> hit<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.430> ground<00:02:57.610> very

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
it's going to hit that ground very

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.720 
it's going to hit that ground very
quickly<00:02:58.709> now<00:02:59.709> this<00:02:59.950> spring<00:03:00.160> on<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.489> right

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
quickly now this spring on the right

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.850 
quickly now this spring on the right
what<00:03:01.299> we've<00:03:01.420> got<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.840> ten<00:03:02.170> millimeters<00:03:02.680> of

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
what we've got is ten millimeters of

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.740 
what we've got is ten millimeters of
compression<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.819> so<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.090> can<00:03:04.239> see<00:03:04.420> here<00:03:04.630> it's

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
compression and so you can see here it's

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.440 
compression and so you can see here it's
got<00:03:04.780> ten<00:03:05.560> millimeters<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.160> compression<00:03:06.760> and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
got ten millimeters of compression and

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.470 
got ten millimeters of compression and
it's<00:03:07.810> got<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.319> ten<00:03:08.739> thousand<00:03:09.450> kilonewton<00:03:10.450> force

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
it's got a ten thousand kilonewton force

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.199 
it's got a ten thousand kilonewton force
at<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.349> so<00:03:11.680> we<00:03:11.799> want<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.160> fill<00:03:12.610> this<00:03:12.910> 20

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
at that and so we want to fill this 20

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.940 
at that and so we want to fill this 20
millimeter<00:03:13.540> gap<00:03:13.750> well<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.290> only<00:03:14.410> has<00:03:14.680> ten

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
millimeter gap well it only has ten

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.830 
millimeter gap well it only has ten
millimeters<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.549> compression<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.450> after<00:03:16.720> that

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
millimeters of compression so after that

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.410 
millimeters of compression so after that
initial<00:03:17.110> ten<00:03:17.560> millimeters<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.190> pushing<00:03:18.910> that

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
initial ten millimeters of pushing that

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.810 
initial ten millimeters of pushing that
wheel<00:03:19.959> down<00:03:20.410> it<00:03:20.709> can't<00:03:21.160> push<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.489> down<00:03:21.640> any

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
wheel down it can't push it down any

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.160 
wheel down it can't push it down any
more<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.209> it<00:03:22.299> just<00:03:22.329> falls<00:03:22.720> at<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.989> rate<00:03:23.140> of

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
more and it just falls at the rate of

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.530 
more and it just falls at the rate of
gravity<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.130> for<00:03:24.340> those<00:03:24.459> last<00:03:24.730> 10<00:03:25.000> millimeters

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
gravity so for those last 10 millimeters

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.810 
gravity so for those last 10 millimeters
you've<00:03:25.900> only<00:03:26.049> got<00:03:26.230> one<00:03:26.260> G<00:03:26.829> acting<00:03:27.400> on<00:03:27.609> that

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
you've only got one G acting on that

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.759 
you've only got one G acting on that
tire<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.690> bring<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:28.989> down<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.319> hopefully<00:03:29.500> it

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
tire to bring it down and hopefully it

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.890 
tire to bring it down and hopefully it
does<00:03:29.920> maintain<00:03:30.400> contact<00:03:30.910> at<00:03:31.060> some<00:03:31.239> point<00:03:31.450> or

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
does maintain contact at some point or

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.509 
does maintain contact at some point or
you<00:03:32.049> just<00:03:32.230> skip<00:03:32.440> over<00:03:32.590> this<00:03:32.799> bump<00:03:33.040> entirely

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
you just skip over this bump entirely

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.640 
you just skip over this bump entirely
but<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.239> point<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:34.750> won't<00:03:34.959> have<00:03:35.109> contact

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
but the point is you won't have contact

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.800 
but the point is you won't have contact
so<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:36.160> wheel<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.640> tire<00:03:37.090> can't<00:03:37.510> be<00:03:37.600> doing

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
so the wheel and tire can't be doing

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.270 
so the wheel and tire can't be doing
what<00:03:37.930> they're<00:03:38.049> supposed<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.440> be<00:03:38.500> doing<00:03:38.920> which

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
what they're supposed to be doing which

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.280 
what they're supposed to be doing which
is<00:03:39.459> maintaining<00:03:40.209> contact<00:03:40.690> allowing<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.140> car

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
is maintaining contact allowing the car

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.840 
is maintaining contact allowing the car
to<00:03:41.380> accelerate<00:03:41.590> turn<00:03:42.040> whatever<00:03:42.280> it's<00:03:42.489> doing

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
to accelerate turn whatever it's doing

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.080 
to accelerate turn whatever it's doing
and<00:03:43.720> so<00:03:44.079> because<00:03:45.010> this<00:03:45.280> softer<00:03:45.730> spring

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
and so because this softer spring

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.509 
and so because this softer spring
presses<00:03:46.569> it<00:03:46.690> down<00:03:46.870> faster<00:03:47.560> you're<00:03:48.130> going<00:03:48.370> to

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
presses it down faster you're going to

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.400 
presses it down faster you're going to
have<00:03:48.700> more<00:03:49.030> contact<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.810> you're<00:03:50.230> going<00:03:50.350> to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
have more contact and you're going to

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.920 
have more contact and you're going to
have<00:03:50.590> better<00:03:50.799> contact<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:51.940> therefore<00:03:52.780> you're

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
have better contact so therefore you're

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.990 
have better contact so therefore you're
going<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.109> have<00:03:53.319> you<00:03:53.799> know<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.280> car<00:03:54.489> reacting

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
going to have you know the car reacting

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.120 
going to have you know the car reacting
the<00:03:55.090> way<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:55.480> want<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:56.130> same

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
the way that you want it to same

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.150 
the way that you want it to same
scenario<00:03:57.790> if<00:03:58.600> we<00:03:58.660> move<00:03:59.049> over<00:03:59.139> here<00:03:59.350> to<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.739> bump

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
scenario if we move over here to a bump

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.970 
scenario if we move over here to a bump
so<00:04:00.700> if<00:04:00.819> we<00:04:00.970> have<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.180> tire<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.440> that's<00:04:02.739> about

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
so if we have a tire a and that's about

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.890 
so if we have a tire a and that's about
to<00:04:03.190> hit<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.340> 10<00:04:03.639> millimeter<00:04:03.910> bump<00:04:04.359> well<00:04:04.810> to

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
to hit a 10 millimeter bump well to

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.259 
to hit a 10 millimeter bump well to
compress<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.560> spring<00:04:05.590> 10<00:04:06.160> millimeters<00:04:06.730> 10

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
compress the spring 10 millimeters 10

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.910 
compress the spring 10 millimeters 10
times<00:04:07.540> 100<00:04:07.750> Newton's<00:04:08.139> per<00:04:08.260> millimeter<00:04:08.380> it

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
times 100 Newton's per millimeter it

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.729 
times 100 Newton's per millimeter it
requires<00:04:09.370> 1,000<00:04:10.209> Newton<00:04:10.450> force<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:11.440> travel

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
requires 1,000 Newton force to travel

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.590 
requires 1,000 Newton force to travel
through<00:04:11.859> that<00:04:11.980> spring<00:04:12.489> so<00:04:13.030> this<00:04:13.359> will<00:04:13.480> be<00:04:13.569> a

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
through that spring so this will be a

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.330 
through that spring so this will be a
minor<00:04:13.870> bump<00:04:14.139> in<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.620> wheel<00:04:14.859> will<00:04:15.130> maintain

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
minor bump in the wheel will maintain

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.640 
minor bump in the wheel will maintain
contact<00:04:16.150> tire<00:04:16.419> maintains<00:04:16.870> contact<00:04:17.380> with<00:04:17.530> the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
contact tire maintains contact with the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.460 
contact tire maintains contact with the
ground<00:04:17.889> now<00:04:18.579> for<00:04:18.880> B<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.810> compress<00:04:20.229> that<00:04:20.410> spring

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
ground now for B to compress that spring

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.730 
ground now for B to compress that spring
10<00:04:21.039> millimeters<00:04:21.549> it<00:04:22.300> requires<00:04:22.720> a<00:04:22.780> 10,000

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
10 millimeters it requires a 10,000

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.469 
10 millimeters it requires a 10,000
Newton<00:04:24.039> force<00:04:24.340> because<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.360> higher

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
Newton force because of the higher

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.750 
Newton force because of the higher
spring<00:04:25.930> rate<00:04:26.110> so<00:04:26.470> the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
spring rate so the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.820 
spring rate so the
your<00:04:26.970> force<00:04:27.270> could<00:04:27.510> lift<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.990> car<00:04:28.200> physically

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
your force could lift the car physically

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.890 
your force could lift the car physically
into<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.160> air<00:04:29.280> or<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.970> could<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.150> unsettle

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
into the air or it could just unsettle

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.300 
into the air or it could just unsettle
it<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.470> could<00:04:31.590> have<00:04:31.710> some<00:04:31.890> load<00:04:32.040> transfer

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
it you could have some load transfer

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.640 
it you could have some load transfer
occur<00:04:32.760> and<00:04:32.970> so<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.210> might<00:04:33.330> slide<00:04:33.750> out<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.200> so

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
occur and so it might slide out and so

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.250 
occur and so it might slide out and so
obviously<00:04:35.010> that's<00:04:35.190> not<00:04:35.340> ideal<00:04:35.930> so<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.080> kind

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
obviously that's not ideal so that kind

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.290 
obviously that's not ideal so that kind
of<00:04:37.290> explains<00:04:37.650> why<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.040> softer<00:04:38.670> spring<00:04:39.030> makes

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
of explains why a softer spring makes

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.630 
of explains why a softer spring makes
more<00:04:39.540> sense<00:04:39.870> because<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.590> keeps<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.160> tire<00:04:41.400> in

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
more sense because it keeps the tire in

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.240 
more sense because it keeps the tire in
contact<00:04:42.450> with<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.960> ground<00:04:43.140> so<00:04:43.920> why<00:04:44.190> do

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
contact with the ground so why do

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.550 
contact with the ground so why do
racecars<00:04:45.030> have<00:04:45.300> such<00:04:45.570> stiff<00:04:45.900> suspensions

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
racecars have such stiff suspensions

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.930 
racecars have such stiff suspensions
well<00:04:47.040> there's<00:04:47.250> actually<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.610> lot<00:04:47.730> of<00:04:47.760> really

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
well there's actually a lot of really

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.420 
well there's actually a lot of really
good<00:04:48.120> reasons<00:04:48.440> they<00:04:49.440> don't<00:04:49.560> exactly<00:04:49.920> apply<00:04:50.310> to

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
good reasons they don't exactly apply to

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.430 
good reasons they don't exactly apply to
road<00:04:50.820> cars<00:04:51.090> though<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:51.930> want<00:04:52.290> to<00:04:52.350> reduce

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
road cars though so you want to reduce

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.500 
road cars though so you want to reduce
body<00:04:52.860> roll<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.160> body<00:04:53.460> lean<00:04:53.670> that<00:04:53.910> maintains<00:04:54.360> a

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
body roll and body lean that maintains a

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.210 
body roll and body lean that maintains a
certain<00:04:54.630> suspension<00:04:55.260> geometry<00:04:55.440> that's

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
certain suspension geometry that's

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.190 
certain suspension geometry that's
obvious<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:56.850> you<00:04:56.940> can<00:04:57.090> do<00:04:57.330> that<00:04:57.570> by

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
obvious and you can do that by

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.980 
obvious and you can do that by
stiffening<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.830> suspension<00:04:59.490> you<00:05:00.360> also<00:05:00.540> want

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
stiffening the suspension you also want

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.010 
stiffening the suspension you also want
to<00:05:01.050> maintain<00:05:01.580> low<00:05:02.580> ground<00:05:02.940> clearance<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.870> low

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
to maintain low ground clearance so low

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.570 
to maintain low ground clearance so low
ground<00:05:04.320> clearance<00:05:04.470> because<00:05:05.130> you<00:05:05.220> want<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.460> low

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
ground clearance because you want a low

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.460 
ground clearance because you want a low
center<00:05:05.850> of<00:05:05.880> gravity<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.540> so<00:05:06.960> by<00:05:07.110> doing<00:05:07.170> that

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
center of gravity and so by doing that

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.250 
center of gravity and so by doing that
you<00:05:08.160> have<00:05:08.670> low<00:05:08.910> suspension<00:05:09.120> travel<00:05:09.690> because

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
you have low suspension travel because

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.800 
you have low suspension travel because
if<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:10.650> only<00:05:10.830> have<00:05:11.270> if<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.450> have<00:05:12.540> a<00:05:12.570> large

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
if you only have if you have a large

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.450 
if you only have if you have a large
amount<00:05:12.960> of<00:05:13.110> suspension<00:05:13.590> travel<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:14.100> you<00:05:14.340> have

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
amount of suspension travel and you have

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.920 
amount of suspension travel and you have
a<00:05:14.490> little<00:05:14.640> bit<00:05:14.850> of<00:05:15.000> ground<00:05:15.480> clearance<00:05:15.690> and

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
a little bit of ground clearance and

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
a little bit of ground clearance and
you're<00:05:16.050> just<00:05:16.170> going<00:05:16.290> to<00:05:16.320> be<00:05:16.410> bottoming<00:05:16.800> out

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
you're just going to be bottoming out

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.710 
you're just going to be bottoming out
and<00:05:17.310> obviously<00:05:17.580> you<00:05:17.910> want<00:05:18.000> your<00:05:18.090> tires<00:05:18.390> to<00:05:18.540> be

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
and obviously you want your tires to be

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.630 
and obviously you want your tires to be
contacting<00:05:19.260> the<00:05:19.320> ground<00:05:19.530> not<00:05:20.010> your<00:05:20.190> vehicle

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
contacting the ground not your vehicle

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.260 
contacting the ground not your vehicle
the<00:05:21.540> aerodynamic<00:05:22.080> efficiency<00:05:22.700> is<00:05:23.700> at<00:05:24.240> a

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
the aerodynamic efficiency is at a

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.090 
the aerodynamic efficiency is at a
specific<00:05:24.600> ride<00:05:25.020> height<00:05:25.230> so<00:05:25.410> cars<00:05:25.620> are<00:05:25.770> set<00:05:26.010> up

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
specific ride height so cars are set up

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.740 
specific ride height so cars are set up
for<00:05:26.220> a<00:05:26.280> very<00:05:26.400> specific<00:05:26.700> ride<00:05:27.060> height<00:05:27.300> you<00:05:27.660> want

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
for a very specific ride height you want

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.540 
for a very specific ride height you want
to<00:05:27.870> maintain<00:05:27.990> that<00:05:28.230> ride<00:05:28.590> height<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:29.040> so

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
to maintain that ride height and so

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.160 
to maintain that ride height and so
you're<00:05:29.700> going<00:05:29.820> to<00:05:29.850> have<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.630> know<00:05:30.660> forces

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
you're going to have you know forces

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.480 
you're going to have you know forces
acting<00:05:31.470> on<00:05:31.560> this<00:05:31.710> car<00:05:31.980> that<00:05:32.190> are<00:05:32.250> going<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.430> be

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
acting on this car that are going to be

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.740 
acting on this car that are going to be
changing<00:05:32.850> that<00:05:32.940> so<00:05:33.000> with<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.270> stiff<00:05:33.540> spring

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
changing that so with the stiff spring

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.050 
changing that so with the stiff spring
you<00:05:34.260> can<00:05:34.440> maintain<00:05:34.620> somewhat<00:05:35.310> of<00:05:35.520> an<00:05:35.670> ideal

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
you can maintain somewhat of an ideal

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.600 
you can maintain somewhat of an ideal
ride<00:05:36.780> height<00:05:37.050> same<00:05:37.680> goes<00:05:37.890> for<00:05:37.920> down<00:05:38.280> four<00:05:38.520> so

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
ride height same goes for down four so

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.590 
ride height same goes for down four so
you're<00:05:38.670> going<00:05:38.820> to<00:05:38.850> have<00:05:38.970> down<00:05:39.090> force<00:05:39.390> pressing

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
you're going to have down force pressing

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.540 
you're going to have down force pressing
down<00:05:39.930> on<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:40.230> car<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.920> don't<00:05:41.100> want<00:05:41.280> it<00:05:41.370> to

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
down on that car you don't want it to

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.490 
down on that car you don't want it to
actually<00:05:41.910> press<00:05:42.450> down<00:05:42.660> too<00:05:42.930> much<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.200> want<00:05:43.350> to

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
actually press down too much you want to

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.260 
actually press down too much you want to
stay<00:05:43.710> at<00:05:43.800> a<00:05:43.860> relatively<00:05:44.280> similar<00:05:44.760> ride<00:05:45.000> height

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
stay at a relatively similar ride height

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.510 
stay at a relatively similar ride height
and<00:05:45.450> so<00:05:46.080> by<00:05:46.200> using<00:05:46.350> stiffer<00:05:46.800> Springs<00:05:47.160> it<00:05:47.340> won't

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
and so by using stiffer Springs it won't

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.850 
and so by using stiffer Springs it won't
press<00:05:47.760> down<00:05:48.000> as<00:05:48.180> much<00:05:48.390> and<00:05:48.630> then<00:05:49.200> also<00:05:49.380> driving

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
press down as much and then also driving

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.890 
press down as much and then also driving
on<00:05:50.040> tracks<00:05:50.340> tracks<00:05:50.700> are<00:05:50.820> often<00:05:51.150> smooth<00:05:51.480> not

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
on tracks tracks are often smooth not

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.140 
on tracks tracks are often smooth not
all<00:05:52.110> of<00:05:52.260> them<00:05:52.410> granted<00:05:52.920> but<00:05:53.430> tracks<00:05:53.700> are<00:05:53.820> often

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
all of them granted but tracks are often

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.820 
all of them granted but tracks are often
smooth<00:05:54.420> and<00:05:54.630> so<00:05:54.780> this<00:05:54.960> allows<00:05:55.230> for<00:05:55.260> compliance

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
smooth and so this allows for compliance

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.370 
smooth and so this allows for compliance
with<00:05:56.310> very<00:05:56.550> stiff<00:05:56.850> suspensions<00:05:57.450> whereas<00:05:58.170> if

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
with very stiff suspensions whereas if

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.320 
with very stiff suspensions whereas if
the<00:05:58.500> track<00:05:58.710> was<00:05:58.860> really<00:05:59.130> rough<00:05:59.400> you'd<00:06:00.090> see

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
the track was really rough you'd see

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.180 
the track was really rough you'd see
very<00:06:00.570> different<00:06:00.780> changes<00:06:01.560> in<00:06:01.590> the<00:06:01.830> suspension

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
very different changes in the suspension

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.240 
very different changes in the suspension
