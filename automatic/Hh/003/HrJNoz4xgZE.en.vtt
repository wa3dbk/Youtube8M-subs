00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.740
 hello girls to today's video would be 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.830
 had to be a video outfit though 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.050
 bad weather did not allow me to be able to 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.840
 so record nothing 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.109
 I will try to retrieve the next month 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.110
 doing in the two since obviously the 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:35.320
 contouring is not the same for everyone because 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.460
 however, it depends on the form of ours 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.089
 rice videos will be more than one this 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.870
 it will be the first one where I will show you how 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:50.140
 a contouring for those with an oval face 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.960
 the face later stretched away 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.699
 I will publish a video for each type 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.970
 of face and and you will also find a video 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.619
 dedicated to fine nose contouring 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.110
 so at this point I leave you to the video 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:09.220
 because I will explain everything there but there 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.799
 See you soon then this 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.170
 first with touring is indicated to those who have a 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.329
 oval face in this case being 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.030
 quite regular it will have an effect 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:22.539
 a little more sculpted but there won't be a 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.060
 a really radical change a good one 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.299
 contouring can improve the appearance of the 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.240
 your face but before you make it 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.359
 you will still need a base of 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.149
 usually a foundation and after the powder 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:39.729
 to make our product flow 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.619
 perfectly but remember that the 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.219
 The secret of a good contouring is in the 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.799
 being able to blend it very well in order to 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:53.740
 make the end result is beautiful e 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:57.189
 homogeneous some of you will recognize each other 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.130
 in this type of face I to make you 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:05.009
 an example I wanted to mention the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.009
 beautiful megan fox and julia roberts 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.340
 you will need two brushes for 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.190
 contouring in this case one a 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.370
 snow fan cosmetics and the other 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.090
 109 of the half if you don't have them at home 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.950
 and you don't want to buy them anyway 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.440
 use a blush brush and this is it 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.220
 a touring palette that I have 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.220
 purchased on light in the box the colors 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:42.510
 to use will be indicative depending 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:45.600
 of your type of complexion the colors 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.960
 darker ones are used to create shadows 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.680
 which in this case will go into this one 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:57.390
 position at ear level 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.940
 without getting too close to the nose for 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.240
 this type of face therefore like 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.250
 contouring you can also use blush 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.710
 dark 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.240
 at this point your face will have a 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.240
 more harmonious appearance 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.060
 in this example the face is oval but 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.750
 extended as an example to get an idea 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.330
 We have Liv Tyler and Sarah Jessica Parker 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.750
 two beautiful and famous actresses of the 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.750
 cinema 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.050
 in this case the shadow zone goes 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:38.410
 created on the cheeks in a circular shape 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:43.180
 on the chin and on the whole upper part of the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.550
 forehead fade well and this is the effect 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.440
 final is also in this example the 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:52.540
 your face will look more harmonious well 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.810

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.130
