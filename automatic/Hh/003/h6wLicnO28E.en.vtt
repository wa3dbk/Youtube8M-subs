you panted out their ideas moving around
and<00:00:27.510> turn<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.230> hit<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> head<00:00:29.310> area<00:00:29.550> let<00:00:30.119> me

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and turn and hit to the head area let me

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.460 
and turn and hit to the head area let me
show<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.390> how<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.779> they<00:00:31.140> bother<00:00:31.320> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
decide we find difficult because the arm

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
decide we find difficult because the arm
here<00:00:57.149> will<00:00:57.300> support<00:00:57.710> stop<00:00:58.710> everything

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
here will support stop everything

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:10.359 
here will support stop everything
happening<00:00:59.460> ok<00:00:59.910> coming<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:03.860> carry<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:07.159> gone

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.749 

gone<00:01:11.369> gone<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:16.290> ideas<00:01:16.770> need<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.189> know<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
gone gone the ideas need to know the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.060 
gone gone the ideas need to know the
hand<00:01:18.110> when<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> coming<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.890> how<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
hand when the coming in and how to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.550 
hand when the coming in and how to
borrow<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.640> energy<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> bring<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.720> that's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
borrow that energy to bring it in that's

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.310 
borrow that energy to bring it in that's
it<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.430> wait<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> making<00:01:24.060> work

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
it so they can wait with the making work

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:36.230 
it so they can wait with the making work
con<00:01:29.240> all<00:01:30.240> right<00:01:34.250> ok<00:01:35.250> that's<00:01:35.520> good<00:01:35.670> that's<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
con all right ok that's good that's the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.539 
con all right ok that's good that's the
whole<00:01:36.270> idea<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.770> learning<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.220> moving

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
whole idea of it it's learning to moving

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.950 
whole idea of it it's learning to moving
around<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.030> able<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> walk<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.659> first

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
around to able to walk like that first

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
around to able to walk like that first
when<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.680> understanding<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
when you understanding that then it

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.850 
when you understanding that then it
easier<00:01:42.360> that's<00:01:42.899> where<00:01:43.110> energy<00:01:43.259> chose<00:01:43.680> so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
easier that's where energy chose so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.800 
easier that's where energy chose so
important<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.759> make<00:01:44.970> sure<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.420> you

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
important to make sure that you

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.810 
important to make sure that you
manipulate<00:01:46.799> your<00:01:46.890> hand<00:01:47.130> where<00:01:47.340> wind<00:01:47.520> up<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
manipulate your hand where wind up in a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.899 
manipulate your hand where wind up in a
very<00:01:48.450> stress<00:01:49.350> environment<00:01:50.220> then<00:01:50.610> when<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
very stress environment then when it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.609 
very stress environment then when it
comes<00:01:50.939> out<00:01:51.329> really<00:01:51.570> freely<00:01:51.990> when<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> hand

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
comes out really freely when the hand

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.020 
comes out really freely when the hand
become<00:01:52.920> more<00:01:53.070> easy<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.729> work<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
become more easy for you to work of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.760 
become more easy for you to work of
course<00:01:54.600> when<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> work<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> very

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
course when you work in this on a very

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.920 
course when you work in this on a very
basic<00:01:56.100> level<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:57.060> learning<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.780> many

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
basic level it's learning and for many

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.719 
basic level it's learning and for many
with<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.469> person<00:01:58.920> first<00:01:59.130> when<00:01:59.610> you're

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
with the person first when you're

with the person first when you're
understanding<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.509> become<00:02:00.930> more<00:02:01.049> easier

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
understanding that is become more easier

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.080 
understanding that is become more easier
for<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.740> when<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.250> come<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.579> put<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.820> lot<00:02:03.030> of

for you when you come in to put a lot of

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270 
for you when you come in to put a lot of
more<00:02:03.329> movement<00:02:03.750> into<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> in

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
more movement into it and for the in

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.210 
more movement into it and for the in
control<00:02:06.200> what<00:02:07.200> didn't<00:02:07.469> fork<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.890> even<00:02:08.099> need

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
control what didn't fork and even need
