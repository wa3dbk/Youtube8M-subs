can<00:01:54.360> YY<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.869> stuff<00:01:55.049> easy<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.210> it's

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
can YY and stuff easy like this and it's

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.780 
can YY and stuff easy like this and it's
just<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.740> whole<00:01:58.860> point<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.430> pretty

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
just the whole point of this is pretty

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.620 
just the whole point of this is pretty
much<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.420> don't<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.380> take<00:02:02.630> your

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
much so you don't have to take your

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.480 
much so you don't have to take your
finger<00:02:04.049> off<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.350> aim<00:02:04.740> stick<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.369> you're

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
finger off the aim stick so if you're

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.190 
finger off the aim stick so if you're
trying<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.880> play<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> competitive<00:02:06.750> match

your<00:02:11.790> finger<00:02:12.090> off<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.690> hit<00:02:12.900> jump

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
your finger off to hit jump

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.619 
your finger off to hit jump
and<00:02:14.129> just<00:02:14.310> letting<00:02:14.520> your<00:02:14.730> aim<00:02:14.849> go<00:02:15.120> free

and just letting your aim go free

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.839 
and just letting your aim go free

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
aiming at the same time so that's a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.830 
aiming at the same time so that's a
pretty<00:02:22.860> effective<00:02:23.099> way<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.519> play<00:02:23.790> I've<00:02:24.660> been

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
pretty effective way to play I've been

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.910 
pretty effective way to play I've been
playing<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:27.290> well<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.319> don't<00:02:28.560> know

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
playing like this for well I don't know

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.630 
playing like this for well I don't know
a<00:02:28.950> decent<00:02:29.670> amount<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:30.060> time<00:02:30.209> now<00:02:30.980> but<00:02:31.980> here<00:02:32.519> let

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
a decent amount of time now but here let

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.160 
a decent amount of time now but here let
me<00:02:32.730> show<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:32.970> guys<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.569> looks<00:02:33.599> like<00:02:33.930> with

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
me show you guys what it looks like with

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.589 
me show you guys what it looks like with
a<00:02:34.200> 360<00:02:35.010> controller<00:02:35.040> cuz<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:36.000> little<00:02:36.450> bit

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
a 360 controller cuz it's a little bit

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.880 
a 360 controller cuz it's a little bit
different

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.640 

all<00:02:40.890> right<00:02:41.040> here's<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.459> 360<00:02:42.030> controller<00:02:42.650> umm

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
all right here's the 360 controller umm

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.589 
all right here's the 360 controller umm
this<00:02:43.950> since<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.489> has<00:02:44.700> different<00:02:44.940> arches<00:02:45.480> on

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
this since it has different arches on

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.330 
this since it has different arches on
the<00:02:45.690> back<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.049> actually<00:02:46.170> tends<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.220> work

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
the back it actually tends to work

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.000 
the back it actually tends to work
better<00:02:48.049> needs<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.170> be<00:02:49.260> really<00:02:49.530> nice<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.890> play

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
better needs to be really nice to play

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.559 
better needs to be really nice to play
with<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.459> could<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.880> fits<00:02:51.180> your<00:02:51.360> hands

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
with this you could it fits your hands

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.180 
with this you could it fits your hands
really<00:02:51.840> well<00:02:51.989> when<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.530> play<00:02:52.620> claw<00:02:52.860> now<00:02:53.160> I

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
really well when you play claw now I

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.640 
really well when you play claw now I
know<00:02:53.340> people<00:02:53.430> didn't<00:02:53.910> like<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.299> this

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
know people didn't like it like this

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.490 
know people didn't like it like this
when<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.739> play<00:02:55.890> claw<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.430> fits<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.730> really<00:02:57.060> nice

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
when you play claw it fits a really nice

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.319 
when you play claw it fits a really nice
so<00:02:58.500> um<00:02:58.829> if<00:02:59.069> you<00:02:59.190> have<00:02:59.280> an<00:02:59.370> adapter<00:02:59.849> sometimes

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
so um if you have an adapter sometimes

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.759 
so um if you have an adapter sometimes
these<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.930> could<00:03:01.049> use<00:03:01.200> these<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.590> play

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
these you could use these to play

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.430 
these you could use these to play
because<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.819> one<00:03:03.030> feels<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.959> little<00:03:04.079> bit<00:03:04.290> odd

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
because this one feels a little bit odd

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.410 
because this one feels a little bit odd
like<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:04.980> not<00:03:05.130> have<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.519> donut<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.209> best

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
like you not have the donut the best

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.509 
like you not have the donut the best
grip<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.959> but<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.829> just<00:03:07.950> have<00:03:08.099> to<00:03:08.220> find<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
grip on it but you just have to find the

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.009 
grip on it but you just have to find the
sweet<00:03:08.730> spot<00:03:08.760> sort<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.329> and<00:03:09.450> go<00:03:09.540> back<00:03:09.750> there

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
sweet spot sort of and go back there

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.059 
sweet spot sort of and go back there
every<00:03:10.319> time<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.560> pretty<00:03:13.769> much<00:03:13.890> just

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
every time and this is pretty much just

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.280 
every time and this is pretty much just
the<00:03:14.130> same<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:15.360> one<00:03:15.540> I've<00:03:15.630> noticed<00:03:15.959> though<00:03:16.079> I

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
the same this one I've noticed though I

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.840 
the same this one I've noticed though I
can<00:03:16.530> pretty<00:03:16.709> much<00:03:16.799> rest<00:03:17.130> my<00:03:19.160> finger<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.519> here

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
can pretty much rest my finger on a here

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.949 
can pretty much rest my finger on a here
and<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.630> can<00:03:21.959> use<00:03:22.230> my<00:03:22.739> knuckle<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.459> head<00:03:23.609> B<00:03:23.959> but

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
and I can use my knuckle the head B but

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.349 
and I can use my knuckle the head B but
here<00:03:25.799> on<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.790> buttons<00:03:27.180> are

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
here on this one the buttons are

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.710 
here on this one the buttons are
slightly<00:03:27.660> different<00:03:27.930> positioned<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:30.120> like

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
slightly different positioned and like

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.830 
slightly different positioned and like
it's<00:03:31.170> kind<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:31.650> hard<00:03:32.340> because<00:03:32.609> you<00:03:32.850> IND<00:03:33.239> why

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
it's kind of hard because you IND why

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.020 
it's kind of hard because you IND why
for<00:03:34.650> some<00:03:34.799> reason<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:35.130> because<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.910> way<00:03:36.000> my

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
for some reason just because the way my

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.390 
for some reason just because the way my
hands<00:03:36.420> are<00:03:36.569> positioned<00:03:36.989> on<00:03:37.109> this<00:03:37.319> they<00:03:38.190> get<00:03:38.340> a

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
hands are positioned on this they get a

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.970 
hands are positioned on this they get a
good<00:03:38.549> grip<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.329> have<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.600> lift<00:03:39.989> up<00:03:40.230> or<00:03:40.650> just

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
good grip so you have to lift up or just

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.660 
good grip so you have to lift up or just
drag<00:03:41.190> over<00:03:41.519> like<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:43.280> yeah<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:44.519> is

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
drag over like this and yeah this is

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.879 
drag over like this and yeah this is
pretty<00:03:44.819> much<00:03:44.940> all<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.269> same<00:03:45.480> by<00:03:46.260> different

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
pretty much all the same by different

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.970 
pretty much all the same by different
sticks<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.400> course<00:03:48.109> this<00:03:49.109> is<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.290> lot<00:03:49.500> looser<00:03:49.680> so

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
sticks of course this is a lot looser so
