00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
that it's just boring like it's just not

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.010 
that it's just boring like it's just not
enough<00:01:34.860> action<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.360> origin<00:01:36.720> story

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
enough action and just the origin story

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.080 
enough action and just the origin story
just<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> taking<00:01:37.890> take<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.430> long<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.880> kick

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
just is taking take so long the kick

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.870 
just is taking take so long the kick
into<00:01:39.240> gear<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.900> my<00:01:40.439> theory<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.340> i<00:01:41.850> think

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
into gear in my theory is and i think

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.340 
into gear in my theory is and i think
this<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> deadpool<00:01:43.020> movie<00:01:43.049> is

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
this is what the deadpool movie is

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.469 
this is what the deadpool movie is
really<00:01:43.439> doing<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.490> when<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.299> comes
