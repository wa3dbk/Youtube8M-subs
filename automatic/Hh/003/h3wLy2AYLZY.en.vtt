waste our time and let us start I'm

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.640 
waste our time and let us start I'm
going<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.540> start<00:00:15.750> by<00:00:15.929> showing<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.350> how<00:00:16.470> to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
going to start by showing you how to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.779 
going to start by showing you how to
make<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> square<00:00:17.430> one

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
make a square one

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.880 
make a square one
you<00:00:18.090> will<00:00:18.240> need<00:00:18.390> flat<00:00:18.720> pliers<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
you will need flat pliers for this and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.710 
you will need flat pliers for this and
you're<00:00:20.430> going<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.609> need<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.910> split<00:00:21.180> visually

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
you're going to need to split visually

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.870 
you're going to need to split visually
your<00:00:21.900> circle<00:00:22.320> into<00:00:22.560> four<00:00:22.800> sides<00:00:23.100> into<00:00:23.519> four

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
your circle into four sides into four

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.870 
your circle into four sides into four
parts

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
parts

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.220 
parts
now<00:00:26.880> take<00:00:27.269> your<00:00:27.449> flat<00:00:27.720> pliers<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.470> squeeze<00:00:29.400> in

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
now take your flat pliers and squeeze in

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.900 
now take your flat pliers and squeeze in
these<00:00:31.230> four<00:00:31.590> directions<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.430> these<00:00:32.610> four

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
these four directions on these four

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.240 
these four directions on these four
sides<00:00:33.239> basically<00:00:33.840> we're<00:00:34.290> creating<00:00:34.890> four

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
sides basically we're creating four

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.319 
sides basically we're creating four
different

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
different

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.670 
different
flat<00:00:36.690> surfaces<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:38.250> two<00:00:38.579> that's<00:00:39.680> three

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
flat surfaces that's two that's three

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.479 
flat surfaces that's two that's three
and<00:00:41.300> four<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:43.290> edges<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> angles<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.370> not

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and four the edges the angles are not

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.889 
and four the edges the angles are not
very<00:00:44.760> sharp<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.360> we're<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
very sharp so we're going to have to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.930 
very sharp so we're going to have to
repeat<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> procedure<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.070> come<00:00:47.340> close<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
repeat the procedure and come close to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.229 
repeat the procedure and come close to
the<00:00:48.059> actual<00:00:48.989> corners<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.550> make<00:00:50.670> them<00:00:50.850> sharper

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the actual corners to make them sharper

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.740 
the actual corners to make them sharper
like<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:54.059> now<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> looks<00:00:54.360> quite

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
like this so now it looks quite

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.740 
like this so now it looks quite
symmetrical<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.350> think

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.139 

the<00:00:59.750> next<00:01:00.050> shape<00:01:00.290> could<00:01:00.770> be<00:01:01.010> this<00:01:01.250> drop<00:01:01.879> light

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
the next shape could be this drop light

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.240 
the next shape could be this drop light
shape<00:01:02.480> Soto<00:01:02.960> but<00:01:03.440> you<00:01:03.620> know<00:01:03.739> you<00:01:03.800> already<00:01:04.129> know

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
shape Soto but you know you already know

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.760 
shape Soto but you know you already know
how<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:04.460> make<00:01:04.729> it<00:01:05.020> now<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.049> triangle<00:01:06.560> triangle

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
how to make it now a triangle triangle

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.170 
how to make it now a triangle triangle
is<00:01:07.009> the<00:01:07.130> same<00:01:07.310> as<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> square<00:01:07.880> but<00:01:08.060> you

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
is the same as a square but you

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.390 
is the same as a square but you
obviously<00:01:08.330> separate<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.470> circle<00:01:09.860> in<00:01:10.040> three

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
obviously separate the circle in three

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.880 
obviously separate the circle in three
same<00:01:11.390> width<00:01:11.509> hexagons<00:01:12.110> Pentagon's<00:01:12.710> or

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
same width hexagons Pentagon's or

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.620 
same width hexagons Pentagon's or
diamond<00:01:13.369> shapes<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.909> just<00:01:14.090> experiment<00:01:14.540> with

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
diamond shapes you just experiment with

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.740 
diamond shapes you just experiment with
that<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.020> same<00:01:15.259> type<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.500> Flyers<00:01:16.690> now<00:01:17.690> the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
that the same type of Flyers now the

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.780 
that the same type of Flyers now the
drop<00:01:18.170> shape<00:01:18.440> drop<00:01:18.770> shape<00:01:18.979> is<00:01:19.100> really<00:01:19.340> cool<00:01:19.550> so

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
drop shape drop shape is really cool so

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.370 
drop shape drop shape is really cool so
you<00:01:19.850> start<00:01:20.210> making<00:01:20.570> it<00:01:20.690> same<00:01:20.869> as<00:01:20.899> you<00:01:21.110> start

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
you start making it same as you start

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.040 
you start making it same as you start
doing<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:21.860> corner<00:01:22.280> you<00:01:22.790> do<00:01:22.970> two<00:01:23.270> sides<00:01:23.600> and

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
doing this corner you do two sides and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.560 
doing this corner you do two sides and
then<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:24.979> take<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.369> rounded<00:01:25.850> pliers<00:01:26.119> and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
then you take the rounded pliers and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.050 
then you take the rounded pliers and
where<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:27.649> need<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.979> roundness<00:01:28.369> for<00:01:28.910> them

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
where you need the roundness for them

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.010 
where you need the roundness for them
for<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.509> smooth<00:01:30.170> shape<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:31.220> just<00:01:31.250> make<00:01:31.729> a

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
for the smooth shape you just make a

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.669 
for the smooth shape you just make a
rounding<00:01:34.720> this<00:01:35.720> is<00:01:35.899> so<00:01:36.020> easy<00:01:36.229> I<00:01:36.350> don't<00:01:36.560> even

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
rounding this is so easy I don't even

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.120 
rounding this is so easy I don't even
have<00:01:36.890> words<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.310> explain<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:39.440> if<00:01:40.039> you

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
have words to explain that and if you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.380 
have words to explain that and if you
think<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.369> your<00:01:40.550> drop<00:01:40.759> shape<00:01:40.970> is<00:01:41.119> a<00:01:41.149> little

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
think that your drop shape is a little

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.330 
think that your drop shape is a little
bit<00:01:41.479> too<00:01:41.690> wide<00:01:42.050> then<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.560> take<00:01:42.770> flat<00:01:43.100> pliers

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
bit too wide then you take flat pliers

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.480 
bit too wide then you take flat pliers
again<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.110> just<00:01:45.110> squash<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.950> squeeze<00:01:46.220> it

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
again and just squash it and squeeze it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.160 
again and just squash it and squeeze it
until<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.270> know<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.420> get<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.840> shape<00:01:48.020> you

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
until it you know you get the shape you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.919 
until it you know you get the shape you
want<00:01:51.220> great<00:01:52.220> what's<00:01:52.550> next<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.179> hexagon<00:01:53.720> you

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
want great what's next the hexagon you

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.139 
want great what's next the hexagon you
know<00:01:54.080> how<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.319> do<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.679> oval<00:01:55.100> oval<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:55.850> just<00:01:56.060> a

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
know how to do it oval oval is just a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.210 
know how to do it oval oval is just a
circle<00:01:56.390> which<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:56.990> squeeze<00:01:57.409> with<00:01:57.440> your<00:01:57.800> flat

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
circle which you squeeze with your flat

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:08.210 
circle which you squeeze with your flat
pliers<00:01:58.460> like<00:01:58.819> this<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.890> just<00:02:01.130> works

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.540 

now<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:08.850> next<00:02:09.300> shape<00:02:09.540> is<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.290> squashed<00:02:10.979> oval

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
now the next shape is the squashed oval
