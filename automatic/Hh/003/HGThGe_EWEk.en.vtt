00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.310
 reports that he returned home pretty 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.379
 early 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.680
 found his dying father on the floor with 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.659
 stabbed in the back 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.900

 pulled out a knife and spun his father 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.219
 probably it was 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.090
 where the knife might have come from 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:37.459
 his prints father being dying 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.549
 could just give something in a safe and 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.139
 contracted and then passed away on this 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.150
 suspect version ends 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:46.010
 Commissioner Gordon immediately begin to torment 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.120
 the question of who could be interested 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.370
 business pawnshop during the dialogue turns out 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.639
 a3 business partners deceased steven 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.470
 craine paul rodgers and alfred striker but 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.329
 suddenly the bell rings and on the other 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.609
 the end of the wire is none other than 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.129
 one of the partners lambert steven crane 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.989
 he reports that on the eve of the crime 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.909
 lambert told him about the threat of his 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.400
 life and now he himself got 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.650
 threat message 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.780
 he is afraid that he will be the next commissioner 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.629
 gordon gives instructions not to go anywhere 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.280
 promises to come soon Bruce 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.169
 wayne is watching all this with 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.540
 parties suddenly say that will go 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:27.650
 home under the pretext that he does not want to interfere 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.599
 the work of detectives we are transported to the house 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.299
 steven outskirts where it unexpected 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.609
 rather banal criminal attack 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.709
 killing Krajina taking paper safe 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.419
 the killer pops out the window here and there 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.790
 it turns out that he has an accomplice 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:44.780
 who was waiting for him on the roof helping him 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.549
 climb during the process they are both not 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.099
 notice a figure standing behind 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.379
 Batman figure and here it is not clear 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.060
 either batman was late and couldn't save 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.620
 poor fellow Ukraine either all this time 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.389
 expected criminals on the roof 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.629
 nevertheless he is pretty clever 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:01.340
 cracks down on them takes paper in 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.590
 this time comes commissioner gordon and 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.239
 so the commissioner has to hide 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.250
 proud to know about the killing of the crane 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.709
 decides to move immediately 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.220
 to the next partner lambert floor 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.220
 rogers 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.220
 at the same time we see batman 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.290
 and not in the batmobile as we used to 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.780
 the usual red car he thinks 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.800
 documents that took from the killers and for 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.120
 his picture is clearly becoming clear 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.440
 meanwhile rogers who found out about death 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.180
 lambert on the radio 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.639
 goes to his lab 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.620
 former partner alfred striker and but 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.639
 don't get the last talk at home with his 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.950
 assistant jennings he offers 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.740
 him in and as soon as this happens he 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.389
 stuns him with a blow to the head 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.190
 tying rogers jennings laughs and 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.320
 says that soon everything would be his 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.860
 control this guy clearly their 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.360
 interests in the process of all this he 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.700
 tells rogers that he will cover him 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.639
 a glass cap and let the gas which 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.260
 will inevitably lead to his death 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.860
 activating the mechanism of lowering the cap he 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.900
 goes off to turn on the gas later 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.389
 moments through the roof window jumps off 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.910
 batman penetrated under the glass dome not 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.940
 bagging cuts off gas supply and powerful 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.979
 blow breaks the glass 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.510
 hearing all this come back jennings he 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.479
 trying to shoot batman but 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.979
 turns out to be knocked down by a dark knight 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.650
 which then without hesitation sends 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.539
 his knockout 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.669
 meanwhile, the lab owner appears 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.390
 alfred striker and asks what 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.370
 It happened 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.620
 clearly annoyed by his 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.430
 i mean tried to kill rogers 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.200
 he decides to take things into his own hands but not 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.479
 bc notices that easily 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.520
 neutralizes the striker from further 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.880
 monologue bc it becomes clear that they are 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.650
 the stryker was behind all the killings he had 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.850
 With my partners I organized Alex 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.250
 chemical corporation 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.690
 but not having a due share in the company on 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.200
 Based on the agreement was 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.960
 pay them every year a certain amount but 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.860
 precisely unwillingness to pay money 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.680
 pushed him to eliminate all 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.840
 business partners rogers speaks to it 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.820
 that's a pretty smart move and about these 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.660
 no one knew the arrangements 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.060
 four 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.280
 a clearly bored striker 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.710
 trying to escape from the hands of batman but 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.240
 gets hit in the face then falls into 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.790
 acid tank 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.030
 here it is really unexpected we all 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.520
 know about the principles of batman namely not 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.620
 kill criminals twice 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.740
 unexpectedly hear the cue of batman that 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.560
 this is quite suitable teaches for such 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.480
 scum then not having time to hear the words 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.300
 thanks batman slipping through 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.820
 the window the next day we will see those 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.550
 same people talking to each other namely 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.400
 Commissioner Gordon and Bruce Wayne Speech 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.900
 talking about the latest successes of batman after 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.850
 care bruce we see as commissioner 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.210
 says that bruce would not hurt 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:58.090
 be more socially active god where 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.640
 Bole so the end of the comic book says 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.120
 bruce wayne's true identity as a fighter 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.830
 with crime gotham batman 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.420
 Well, Well, so we finished considering 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.570
 first appearance of batman 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.190
 feeling quite mixed but i 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.050
 it goes without saying to the dark story 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.690
 knight same in the first major release 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:20.170

 will have to face the prince 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:29.620
 the underworld joker from you 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:33.540
