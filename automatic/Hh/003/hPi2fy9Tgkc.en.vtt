or<00:03:42.590> something<00:03:42.950> then<00:03:43.280> it's<00:03:43.459> worth<00:03:43.610> going<00:03:43.849> to<00:03:44.030> 71

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
or something then it's worth going to 71

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.240 
or something then it's worth going to 71
I<00:03:45.079> think<00:03:45.950> people<00:03:46.280> set<00:03:46.549> themselves<00:03:46.730> limits

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
I think people set themselves limits

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.309 
I think people set themselves limits
probably<00:03:49.250> even<00:03:50.150> nor<00:03:50.360> odd<00:03:50.390> numbers<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.200> know

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
probably even nor odd numbers you know

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.250 
probably even nor odd numbers you know
to<00:03:51.379> 70<00:03:52.040> or<00:03:52.129> to<00:03:52.370> 75<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.629> it's<00:03:53.780> always<00:03:53.930> worth

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
to 70 or to 75 so it's always worth

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.680 
to 70 or to 75 so it's always worth
going

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
going

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.420
