00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
messed up the edges but it actually

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.269 
messed up the edges but it actually
comes<00:00:15.150> off<00:00:15.360> rather<00:00:15.780> easy<00:00:16.080> all<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.890> have<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.130> do

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
comes off rather easy all you have to do

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:25.839 
comes off rather easy all you have to do
is<00:00:17.430> rub<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.090> back<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.949> that<00:00:19.949> kind<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:21.260> rolls<00:00:22.260> up

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.259 

and<00:00:26.300> then<00:00:26.419> just<00:00:26.660> kind<00:00:26.869> of<00:00:27.730> find<00:00:28.730> a<00:00:28.849> good<00:00:29.060> edge

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
and then just kind of find a good edge

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:37.920 
and then just kind of find a good edge
to<00:00:29.720> start<00:00:30.140> on<00:00:33.040> get<00:00:34.040> a<00:00:34.070> good<00:00:34.309> piece<00:00:34.550> going<00:00:35.000> here

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.110 

and<00:00:38.930> it'll<00:00:39.940> actually<00:00:40.940> just<00:00:41.480> pull<00:00:41.719> right<00:00:41.750> off

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120
