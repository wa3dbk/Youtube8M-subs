this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.650> an<00:00:01.770> introductory<00:00:02.220> tutorial<00:00:02.850> for<00:00:03.060> new

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
this is an introductory tutorial for new

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.050 
this is an introductory tutorial for new
blender<00:00:03.600> users<00:00:03.990> I'm<00:00:04.500> using<00:00:04.710> version<00:00:05.100> 2.6<00:00:05.730> 3a

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
blender users I'm using version 2.6 3a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.089 
blender users I'm using version 2.6 3a
and<00:00:06.480> what<00:00:06.899> we'll<00:00:07.020> do<00:00:07.140> in<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.350> tutorial<00:00:07.980> is

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
and what we'll do in this tutorial is

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.860 
and what we'll do in this tutorial is
we'll<00:00:08.280> set<00:00:08.580> up<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.730> basic<00:00:08.910> scene<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.630> some

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
we'll set up a basic scene with some

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.259 
we'll set up a basic scene with some
nice<00:00:10.050> lights<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.969> fractal<00:00:11.969> terrain

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
nice lights and a fractal terrain

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.640 
nice lights and a fractal terrain
surface<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.080> should<00:00:13.320> really<00:00:13.500> help

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
surface and that should really help

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.829 
surface and that should really help
bring<00:00:13.920> your<00:00:14.040> designs<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.610> life<00:00:14.849> instead<00:00:15.750> of

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
bring your designs to life instead of

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.359 
bring your designs to life instead of
just<00:00:15.990> using<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.320> flat<00:00:16.529> plane<00:00:16.800> which<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.190> pretty

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
just using a flat plane which is pretty

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.580 
just using a flat plane which is pretty
common<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.029> when<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.240> blender<00:00:19.140> first<00:00:19.260> pops

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
common so when this blender first pops

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.109 
common so when this blender first pops
up<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> cube<00:00:20.520> there<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:20.910> I'm<00:00:21.000> going

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
up we have the cube there so I'm going

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.140 
up we have the cube there so I'm going
to<00:00:21.180> click<00:00:21.480> X<00:00:21.689> maybe<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.650> I'm<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.609> delete

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
to click X maybe and I'm going to delete

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.390 
to click X maybe and I'm going to delete
that<00:00:24.210> I'm<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.019> hit<00:00:25.109> shift<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.560> now<00:00:26.130> to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
that I'm going to hit shift a now to

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.679 
that I'm going to hit shift a now to
play<00:00:26.609> into<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> scene<00:00:27.170> hit<00:00:28.170> s<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.830> then<00:00:29.820> scale

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
play into the scene hit s and then scale

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.720 
play into the scene hit s and then scale
it<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.369> then<00:00:32.369> I'll<00:00:32.520> come<00:00:32.640> over

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it out like this then I'll come over

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.209 
it out like this then I'll come over
here<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.890> I'll<00:00:34.890> get<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:37.040> right<00:00:38.040> here

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
here and I'll get the right here

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.180 
here and I'll get the right here
materials<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.239> new<00:00:39.690> material<00:00:39.989> I'll<00:00:40.890> make<00:00:41.070> it

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
materials a new material I'll make it

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.740 
materials a new material I'll make it
like<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.370> yellowish<00:00:42.000> green<00:00:42.620> like<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
like a yellowish green like this and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.930 
like a yellowish green like this and
then<00:00:45.750> turn<00:00:46.440> down<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.860> specularity<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> so

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
then turn down the specularity of it so

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.770 
then turn down the specularity of it so
it's<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.360> shiny

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
it's not so shiny

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.619 
it's not so shiny
alright<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.920> still<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.489> know<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.539> know

alright so still you know it's you know

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.119 
alright so still you know it's you know
from<00:00:51.780> our<00:00:51.899> perspective<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.710> kind<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.949> boring

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
still you have a light in the scene but

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.939 
still you have a light in the scene but
what's<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.899> light<00:00:55.050> doing<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.829> instance

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
what's the light doing like for instance

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.920 
what's the light doing like for instance
if<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.219> move<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> light<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.780> like

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
if I move the light like that it's like

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.540 
if I move the light like that it's like

us more space to see I'll get rid of the
timeline<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> moment<00:01:16.049> because<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> don't

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
timeline for the moment because I don't

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.080 
timeline for the moment because I don't
need<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.619> I'll<00:01:16.770> grab<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.250> piece<00:01:17.490> drag<00:01:17.939> it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
need it I'll grab this piece drag it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.820 
need it I'll grab this piece drag it
down<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.770> then<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:21.229> here<00:01:22.229> I'll<00:01:22.470> already

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
down and then this here I'll already

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.260 
down and then this here I'll already
click<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.490> I'll<00:01:23.640> flip<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
click in here and I'll flip it up to the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.219 
click in here and I'll flip it up to the
top<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.780> out<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> way<00:01:25.200> all<00:01:25.650> right<00:01:25.860> so

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
top so it's out of the way all right so

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.120 
top so it's out of the way all right so
first<00:01:28.229> thing<00:01:28.380> we're<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> make

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
first thing we're to do is going to make

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.850 
first thing we're to do is going to make
this<00:01:29.280> light<00:01:29.700> really<00:01:30.140> activate<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> scenes<00:01:31.560> so

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
this light really activate the scenes so

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.109 
this light really activate the scenes so
what<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.520> there's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.939> couple

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
what we have to do is there's a couple

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
what we have to do is there's a couple
ways<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.619> click<00:01:34.920> flip

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
ways to do it but we can just click flip

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.190

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
other lights as well but for the moment

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.720 
other lights as well but for the moment
we'll<00:03:15.660> just<00:03:15.870> use<00:03:15.989> this<00:03:16.200> spotlight<00:03:16.580> I'll<00:03:17.580> move

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
we'll just use this spotlight I'll move

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:26.350 
we'll just use this spotlight I'll move
it<00:03:17.850> down<00:03:18.799> like<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:20.420> just<00:03:21.420> moving<00:03:21.720> around

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.640 

it's<00:03:27.360> kind<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.600> hard<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.810> control<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:28.200> unless

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
it's kind of hard to control that unless

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.410 
it's kind of hard to control that unless
you're<00:03:28.799> looking<00:03:28.860> at<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.220> from<00:03:29.310> above<00:03:29.459> our<00:03:29.820> Z

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
you're looking at it from above our Z

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.800 
you're looking at it from above our Z
I'll<00:03:31.200> rotate<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.100> around<00:03:32.190> like<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.810> alright

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
I'll rotate it around like that alright

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.289 
I'll rotate it around like that alright
so<00:03:34.220> we<00:03:35.220> have<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.370> spotlight<00:03:35.610> in<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:36.030> scene<00:03:36.180> as

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
so we have a spotlight in this scene as

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.970 
so we have a spotlight in this scene as
well<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.110> now<00:03:37.200> let's<00:03:37.380> do<00:03:37.530> something<00:03:37.830> with<00:03:37.890> the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
well so now let's do something with the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.190 
well so now let's do something with the
surface<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.880> we're<00:03:39.450> going<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.660> subdivide<00:03:39.900> the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
surface so we're going to subdivide the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.530 
surface so we're going to subdivide the
surface<00:03:40.620> I'll<00:03:41.010> hit<00:03:41.160> go<00:03:41.549> into<00:03:41.730> edit<00:03:42.209> mode<00:03:42.239> we're

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
surface I'll hit go into edit mode we're

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.330 
surface I'll hit go into edit mode we're
going<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:42.720> right-click<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.230> plane<00:03:43.769> go<00:03:44.310> to

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
going to right-click the plane go to

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.340 
going to right-click the plane go to
edit<00:03:44.670> mode<00:03:44.790> with<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.000> tab<00:03:45.209> key<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.810> then

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
edit mode with the tab key and then

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.949 
edit mode with the tab key and then
everything<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.310> automatically<00:03:48.120> selected<00:03:48.420> in

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
everything is automatically selected in

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.420 
everything is automatically selected in
this<00:03:49.140> case<00:03:49.380> I'll<00:03:49.680> hit<00:03:49.799> W<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.400> subdivide<00:03:50.780> so

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
this case I'll hit W to subdivide so

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.600 
this case I'll hit W to subdivide so
subdivide<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.519> one's<00:03:53.959> subdivided<00:03:54.959> twice

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
subdivide it one's subdivided twice

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.940 
subdivide it one's subdivided twice
subdivided<00:03:56.610> three<00:03:56.790> times<00:03:57.200> I'll<00:03:58.200> tap<00:03:58.440> out<00:03:58.680> well

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
subdivided three times I'll tap out well

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.229 
subdivided three times I'll tap out well
it's<00:03:59.070> still<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.489> same<00:03:59.670> thing<00:03:59.850> really<00:04:00.000> doesn't

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
it's still the same thing really doesn't

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.820 
it's still the same thing really doesn't
do<00:04:00.360> much<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:00.720> tap<00:04:00.959> back<00:04:01.170> into<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:02.150> but<00:04:03.440> in<00:04:04.440> this

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
do much so tap back into it but in this

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.100 
do much so tap back into it but in this
case<00:04:05.100> I'll<00:04:05.370> hit<00:04:05.700> W<00:04:06.000> again<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.600> I'll<00:04:06.750> subdivide

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
case I'll hit W again and I'll subdivide

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.039 
case I'll hit W again and I'll subdivide
but<00:04:07.620> also<00:04:07.830> I'm<00:04:08.640> going<00:04:08.820> to<00:04:08.880> hit<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.209> f6<00:04:09.959> key

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
but also I'm going to hit the f6 key

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.130 
but also I'm going to hit the f6 key
this<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.590> really<00:04:10.980> cool<00:04:11.430> key<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.030> what<00:04:12.870> if<00:04:12.989> this

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
this is really cool key and what if this

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.289 
this is really cool key and what if this
does<00:04:13.320> it<00:04:13.440> brings<00:04:13.620> up<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.860> subdivide<00:04:14.280> menu<00:04:14.760> that

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
does it brings up a subdivide menu that

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.319 
does it brings up a subdivide menu that
allows<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.810> use<00:04:15.930> this<00:04:16.200> fractal<00:04:17.150> type<00:04:18.150> of

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
allows you to use this fractal type of

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.659 
allows you to use this fractal type of
noise<00:04:18.600> adds<00:04:19.260> fractal<00:04:19.709> noise<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.280> surface

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
noise adds fractal noise to the surface

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.700 
noise adds fractal noise to the surface
so<00:04:21.209> we'll<00:04:21.419> do<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.599> couple<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:21.959> cuts<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:22.470> need<00:04:22.680> a

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
so we'll do a couple of cuts you need a

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.960 
so we'll do a couple of cuts you need a
pretty<00:04:22.950> fast<00:04:23.310> computer<00:04:23.760> for<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.900> then

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
pretty fast computer for this and then

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.660 
pretty fast computer for this and then
you<00:04:26.300> can<00:04:26.480> just<00:04:26.780> suddenly<00:04:27.680> warp<00:04:28.130> desert

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
you can just suddenly warp desert

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.910 
you can just suddenly warp desert
surface<00:04:29.150> let's<00:04:29.480> cut<00:04:29.780> it<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.960> few<00:04:30.170> more<00:04:30.320> I<00:04:30.590> mean

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
surface let's cut it a few more I mean

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.130 
surface let's cut it a few more I mean
you<00:04:31.070> really<00:04:31.280> crank<00:04:31.610> up<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.940> amount<00:04:32.180> of<00:04:32.300> faces

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
you really crank up the amount of faces

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.730 
you really crank up the amount of faces
in<00:04:33.460> here<00:04:34.460> there's<00:04:35.330> four<00:04:35.450> thousand<00:04:36.200> faces<00:04:36.560> like

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
in here there's four thousand faces like

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.790 
in here there's four thousand faces like
that<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.020> can<00:04:39.140> see<00:04:39.290> how<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.530> really

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
that and you can see how it really

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.900 
that and you can see how it really
starts<00:04:41.380> modifying<00:04:42.380> it<00:04:42.590> like<00:04:42.770> this<00:04:42.980> now<00:04:43.760> let's

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
starts modifying it like this now let's

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.600 
starts modifying it like this now let's
see<00:04:44.000> what<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.180> smoothness<00:04:44.690> does<00:04:44.930> here<00:04:45.610> mmm

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
see what the smoothness does here mmm

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.130 
see what the smoothness does here mmm
that<00:04:47.120> might<00:04:47.270> be<00:04:47.390> a<00:04:47.420> little<00:04:47.510> bit<00:04:47.690> tough<00:04:47.870> all

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
that might be a little bit tough all

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.970 
that might be a little bit tough all
right<00:04:48.260> well<00:04:48.380> that's<00:04:48.470> good<00:04:48.650> enough<00:04:48.710> at<00:04:48.920> the

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
right well that's good enough at the

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.270 
right well that's good enough at the
moment<00:04:49.040> and<00:04:49.810> then<00:04:50.810> I'll<00:04:51.020> hit<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.470> and<00:04:51.950> then<00:04:52.190> I'll

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
moment and then I'll hit a and then I'll

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.330 
moment and then I'll hit a and then I'll
hit<00:04:52.430> tab<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:53.450> now<00:04:53.570> we<00:04:53.630> have<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.840> surface

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
hit tab and so now we have a surface

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.480 
hit tab and so now we have a surface
with<00:04:55.340> a<00:04:55.370> bunch<00:04:55.820> of<00:04:56.380> nice<00:04:57.380> ridges<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:58.040> stuff<00:04:58.310> to

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
with a bunch of nice ridges and stuff to

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.700 
with a bunch of nice ridges and stuff to
it<00:04:58.640> so<00:04:59.180> for<00:04:59.600> whatever<00:04:59.840> you<00:04:59.990> might<00:05:00.110> be<00:05:00.170> using

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
it so for whatever you might be using

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.430 
it so for whatever you might be using
for<00:05:01.340> so<00:05:01.580> now<00:05:01.760> let's<00:05:02.000> see<00:05:02.270> what<00:05:03.020> we<00:05:03.110> can<00:05:03.230> do<00:05:03.320> with

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
for so now let's see what we can do with

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.930 
for so now let's see what we can do with
these<00:05:03.530> lights<00:05:03.890> when<00:05:04.460> we<00:05:04.520> bring<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:04.820> lights

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
these lights when we bring the lights

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
these lights when we bring the lights
down<00:05:05.200> suddenly<00:05:06.200> lights<00:05:07.510> can<00:05:08.510> give<00:05:08.720> a<00:05:08.750> whole

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
down suddenly lights can give a whole

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.510 
down suddenly lights can give a whole
different<00:05:09.320> effect<00:05:09.650> because<00:05:09.950> you<00:05:10.070> have<00:05:10.250> the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
different effect because you have the

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.340 
different effect because you have the
surface<00:05:10.910> interferes<00:05:11.360> with<00:05:11.630> it<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:15.230> even

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
this light here let's see and then do

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.940 
this light here let's see and then do
you<00:05:56.660> know<00:05:56.780> you<00:05:56.840> could<00:05:57.020> do<00:05:57.169> like<00:05:57.410> you<00:05:57.830> could

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
you know you could do like you could

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.770 
you know you could do like you could
simulate<00:05:58.190> you<00:05:58.580> know<00:05:58.669> like<00:05:58.940> sunlight<00:05:59.300> effects

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780

I<00:06:02.060> mean<00:06:02.390> that<00:06:02.750> just<00:06:02.780> kind<00:06:03.229> of<00:06:03.320> gives<00:06:03.470> you<00:06:03.560> an

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
I mean that just kind of gives you an

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.800 
I mean that just kind of gives you an
idea<00:06:03.979> how<00:06:04.550> a<00:06:04.580> lot<00:06:04.820> of<00:06:04.850> times<00:06:04.970> I<00:06:05.270> like<00:06:05.300> to<00:06:05.540> start

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
idea how a lot of times I like to start

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.740 
idea how a lot of times I like to start
is<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:06.169> basic<00:06:06.650> scene<00:06:06.890> and<00:06:07.450> you<00:06:08.450> could<00:06:08.600> put<00:06:08.720> a

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
is a basic scene and you could put a

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.659 
is a basic scene and you could put a
secondary<00:06:09.140> light<00:06:09.440> to<00:06:09.620> offset<00:06:09.979> your<00:06:10.070> your

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
secondary light to offset your your

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.159 
secondary light to offset your your
shadows<00:06:11.120> and<00:06:11.419> things<00:06:11.479> like<00:06:11.690> that<00:06:11.870> but<00:06:11.990> as

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
shadows and things like that but as

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:13.930 
shadows and things like that but as
artists<00:06:12.560> I'll<00:06:12.650> let<00:06:12.770> you<00:06:12.890> guys<00:06:13.040> take<00:06:13.669> care<00:06:13.820> of

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
artists I'll let you guys take care of

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.010 
artists I'll let you guys take care of
your<00:06:14.030> own<00:06:14.120> colors<00:06:14.450> and<00:06:14.479> things<00:06:14.840> of<00:06:14.990> that

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
your own colors and things of that

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
idea how to set up the scene and make it

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.990 
idea how to set up the scene and make it
a<00:06:18.320> little<00:06:18.440> simpler<00:06:18.830> for<00:06:19.070> you<00:06:19.220> and<00:06:19.400> one<00:06:19.880> other

here and I'll go to use of the
proportional<00:06:37.220> editing<00:06:37.340> tools<00:06:37.849> so<00:06:38.510> I'll<00:06:38.750> hit<00:06:38.840> a

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
proportional editing tools so I'll hit a

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.879 
proportional editing tools so I'll hit a
twice<00:06:39.440> make<00:06:39.740> sure

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:39.889 
twice make sure

to crank it out like that you can see me
really<00:07:16.969> changing<00:07:17.599> the<00:07:17.629> surface<00:07:18.050> but<00:07:18.800> you

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 
really changing the surface but you

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:20.769 
really changing the surface but you
could<00:07:19.069> might<00:07:19.219> not<00:07:19.340> be<00:07:19.460> able<00:07:19.580> to<00:07:19.669> so<00:07:20.000> I'm<00:07:20.629> just

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:24.529 
going to really quickly add a Hangul

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:27.909 
going to really quickly add a Hangul
butter<00:07:24.919> tap<00:07:25.189> out<00:07:25.370> of<00:07:25.490> that<00:07:26.650> I'll<00:07:27.650> add<00:07:27.889> a

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 
butter tap out of that I'll add a

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:29.679 
butter tap out of that I'll add a
hemisphere<00:07:28.879> lamp<00:07:29.180> to<00:07:29.270> the<00:07:29.300> scene<00:07:29.539> really

00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:29.689 
hemisphere lamp to the scene really

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:31.689 
hemisphere lamp to the scene really
quick<00:07:30.020> and<00:07:30.529> just<00:07:30.770> crank<00:07:30.949> down<00:07:31.129> the<00:07:31.250> energy<00:07:31.400> so

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:31.699 
quick and just crank down the energy so

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:35.260 
quick and just crank down the energy so
you<00:07:31.729> can<00:07:31.909> see<00:07:32.060> more<00:07:32.240> the<00:07:32.360> whole<00:07:32.509> thing<00:07:34.270> like

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
you can see more the whole thing like

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.670 
you can see more the whole thing like
that<00:07:35.300> suddenly<00:07:36.050> we<00:07:36.110> have<00:07:36.229> a<00:07:36.259> terrible

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 
that suddenly we have a terrible

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.950 
that suddenly we have a terrible
lighting<00:07:36.889> scene<00:07:37.189> don't<00:07:37.400> we<00:07:38.860> is<00:07:39.860> that<00:07:40.749> light

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 
lighting scene don't we is that light

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.749 
lighting scene don't we is that light
well<00:07:42.379> I<00:07:42.409> think<00:07:42.589> you<00:07:42.650> get<00:07:42.800> the<00:07:42.919> idea<00:07:43.279> all<00:07:43.610> right

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 
well I think you get the idea all right

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:46.719 
well I think you get the idea all right
so<00:07:44.349> basically<00:07:45.349> I'm<00:07:45.830> raising<00:07:46.069> it<00:07:46.339> up<00:07:46.430> and<00:07:46.669> you

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:46.729 
so basically I'm raising it up and you

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:51.249 
so basically I'm raising it up and you
can<00:07:46.879> change<00:07:47.089> the<00:07:49.060> view<00:07:50.060> the<00:07:50.300> influence<00:07:51.020> with

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:51.259 
can change the view the influence with

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:53.950 
can change the view the influence with
that<00:07:51.439> circle<00:07:51.889> as<00:07:52.099> you're<00:07:53.000> moving<00:07:53.330> it<00:07:53.479> hit<00:07:53.810> the

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 
that circle as you're moving it hit the

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.709 
that circle as you're moving it hit the
G<00:07:54.199> and<00:07:54.529> just<00:07:55.039> changing<00:07:55.580> it<00:07:55.669> there<00:07:55.849> or<00:07:56.300> changing

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:56.719 
G and just changing it there or changing

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:57.399 
G and just changing it there or changing
it<00:07:56.810> like<00:07:56.990> that

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:57.409 
it like that

00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:59.230 
it like that
