00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.670
 good day 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.740
 the high fuel price forces drivers to other variants 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.780
 Soul's debating a review on gasoline prices and testing 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.589
 End pollutant emissions finally 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.609
 whether that will succeed who knows 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.050
 whether this is the super at the prices while the motorists place 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.679
 one euro after another swallow the gas pump and still is the tank 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.270
 not people, therefore, without reports about the interior 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.830
 I should probably too 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.220
 we have to live 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.850
 so i can the little one was around at the annual one 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.020
 in the long work I have 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.780
 and here as burdened a financially very strong 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.070
 So the two years on a full day called that is madness 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.019
 but for the 37 there is now a new text fuel 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.340
 she Paul 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.310
 the production of Sipa Hold which distance is actually quite 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.560
 easy 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.940
 Here is a large container though and smoothness will be filled 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.420
 After about thirty hours, they become too small due to a machine 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 Processed particles and mixed with the groundwater 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.520
 After another hour, the fuel is ready and can be pumped there 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.390
 become 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.310
 practically it looks like this 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.120
 that is a 30 cubic meter tank under the ground fully rival leaves 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.250
 In the fall, many bring their leaves to get rid of it 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.330
 this amount then has to last for one year then it will be evaluated 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.660
 and filled with fresh leaves 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.640
 After the underground processing point you get the finished one up 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.030
 where is filled by a hose in the almost 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.180
 these 2000 watt points brought a clip of 8ku with 2 4 seconds 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.280
 At the park one brings about a thousand 500 liters to light 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.810
 this gas station has therefore 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.810
 every day only three point five hours open 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.580
 The iPad is not refilled and easy to make 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.630
 For every hundred kilometers only zero comma a milligram 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.059
 pollutants 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.100
 after the discovery half a year ago 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.800
 the fuel of the hand was filled in canisters 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.949
 and sold at petrol stations 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.170
 but that was after a time because of the head 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.869
 big demand anymore 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.109
 and so it was sold off value 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.010
 Sipa it behaves like water 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.159
 you could even take it to watering 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.539
 although it is difficult to ignite 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:35.089
 you better not get too close with open fire 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.799
 or is under pressure 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.799
 there is still still flammable 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.229
 Of course, Principal can be won as only one place 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.179
 that is record breaking 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:54.149
 one uses thereby almost 99% of the sheet out for the comparison of rape becomes only 50 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:55.749
 Percent used 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:59.569
 This use is only possible due to the lack of leadership methods 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.569
 But how exactly does it work 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.539
 First, let's take a closer look at the sheet 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.449
 the leaf consists of many small and large circles 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.589
 in the middle sits the plasma around the outside 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:20.279
 Plasma and water together make Paul 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.629
 Already the new fuel is in love 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.629
 for only 50 cents and in addition so unobtrusive Klich 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.919
 Shit and gas stations have loud sources already up to 20 trillion euros 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.299
 for which they offered Pauli manufacture 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.199
 whether the owner will sell or not 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.199
 that will turn out in the coming months 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.729
 and wish a nice evening protects
