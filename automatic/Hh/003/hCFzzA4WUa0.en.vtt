00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.779
 hello today we're going to see how to install from 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.969
 correct way a micrometer when poking 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:17.220
 a probe to the same heated of 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.470
 four cables the movements that we're going 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.390
 to use are these are very few and 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.130
 let's show each of them 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.449
 first to start here we have a cable 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.830
 that if the ignition cable does not 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.460
 the one who has the equals when 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.429
 we put scratched in auto contact 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.210
 a couple of fuses one of 15 and another of 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:39.019
 days in Persian Air 160 import the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.790
 aic the mix metro two cables one black 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.900
 and a red one that pretend to be the possible and 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.590
 the negative of the battery 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.020
 and four wires one gray one black and two 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.320
 targets that pretend to be the cables of the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.210
 heated lambda probe 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.820
 let's go see each one of these 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.280
 elements to start the king the king is 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.690
 five-legged but as we already know from 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.900
 the five legs are always used 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.290
 four because the 87 repeats that is 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.240
 It is four different legs 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.800
 and to rule behaves and what 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.510
 I recommend you do is to fixate on 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.920
 what color of cable corresponds to each 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.370
 one of the legs to then not have 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.870
 complications in this case is 85 the 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.900
 black 30 red 86 yellow and 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.580
 the 87 the gray and the brown today we're going to 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.430
 use the brown wire but we could 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.090
 transpire 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.090
 we connect this out 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.460
 Now what we are going to do is connect 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.380
 the yellow wire that would be 86 to 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.630
 they were in 4 different things for 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.630
 start the negative battery 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.500
 one of the white wires of the probe 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.720
 that the white wires are the ones that 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.580
 they will give the heating to the probe not 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.350
 they have polarity that is indistinct 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.350
 the cable that we are going to put in this terminal 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.720
 white the gray cable of the probe 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.540
 and the negative of the carmen as 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.050
 we identify is the black that does not have 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.050
 red band 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.840
 there would be the four cables 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.390
 connected to our 86th clock terminal 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.170
 now we go to see what we installed in the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.170
 87 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.940
 here we put the other cable directly 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.530
 white probe 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.720
 if in the other we had put the cable 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.970
 the negative battery cable fits 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.280
 deduce that by this one to come the 12 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.700
 volts when you activate the real there's the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.650
 power we continue now with the cable 85 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.319
 of the black regulation and this one we are going to 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.810
 connect him the positive of the calmette the 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.410
 which is the one with the red band at 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.200
 hands and we grab the rifle 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.220
 of 10 integers 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.220
 we connect 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.150
 now we continue on the red wire that is 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.980
 the number 30 and we connect it to 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.980
 through the reverse 15 fuse 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.240
 directly to the battery 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.530
 we finally have the signal cable 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.069
 let put in the signal of the probe that 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.069
 it's the black 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.469
 well that would be everything and there we would have 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.299
 our really ready from our probe 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.829
 connected obviously this is not a 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.719
 definitive installation but that is a 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.730
 show with all cables 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.409
 peeled but that when we take it to the 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.540
 practice we have to cover all the 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.939
 cables if possible soldier place 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.739
 the corresponding files and if we can 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.299
 also place him tube against 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.400
 free to all cables would be ideal 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.870
 to avoid any kind of friction and 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.639
 possible short to an evil 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.290
 operation in the vehicle them 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.209
 I appreciate seeing the video and I hope 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.530
 that they can do it in their homes and that 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.680
 serve them 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.680
 yes
