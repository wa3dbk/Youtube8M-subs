00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.679
 I am planning to run for a limited time for investigation 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:15.149
 It is Suzuki Akira 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:16.739
 Project leader for cable 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:17.679
 I'm doing 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:18.900
 Hello 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.169
 This year 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.569
 As you say service chewlip to the rain for several hundred thousand yen 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:23.940
 is 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.749
 I will 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.749
 Regarding player's realism 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.050
 I have been looking at that much based on the interval 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.060
 Until that 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.930
 Determination of famous players- 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.330
 Never captured 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.350
 This is my first time to capture poet 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.700
 It will be done dramatically after this is lost 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.720
 I think the call put from 9 to 3.5 over 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.430
 To all 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.699
 Are you in business 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.170
 We are strengthening the part especially of electric beginning 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170
 Yes part of the player's face and talk about that 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.500
 Evaluate the texture points of the front skin 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.239
 And for the api 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.290
 In particular, users are required to think strategically 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.510
 I think 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.910
 As for air and online, we are completely recreating that 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.750
 After I think that part of the game is very stable 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.550
 We plan to upgrade the version to succeed 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.800
 I'm personal about mastering, but that too 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.430
 Management elements are included and later 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.280
 As we can play the Champions League, let's go at once 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.260
 To everyone of the previous edition 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.920
 I think that I can meet my expectations. 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.960
 It is the size of penguins 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.370
 Leak We are that 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.050
 I have come to think that I want a big angama 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.330
 I'm sorry but the public is behind the Internet 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.460
 Let's listen to the opinion of f1 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.610
 It was in the form of listening to an opinion 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.180
 Obtained from accurate information exchange by listening to opinions 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.970
 Because 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.810
 I can do something good even if I can meet the fans' expectations 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.439
 I think
