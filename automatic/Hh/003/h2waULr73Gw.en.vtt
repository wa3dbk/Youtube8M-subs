00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
being like no there's just a bunch of

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.700 
being like no there's just a bunch of
guys<00:02:06.450> trying<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.990> no<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.200> else<00:02:07.320> does<00:02:07.500> this

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
guys trying it no one else does this

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.070 
guys trying it no one else does this
then<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.160> sound<00:02:08.310> crazy<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
then you just sound crazy so that the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.330 
then you just sound crazy so that the
second<00:02:10.410> one<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.950> will<00:02:11.069> elevate

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
second one is that it will elevate

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.720 
second one is that it will elevate
obviously<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.180> skill<00:02:12.450> levels<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.050> player

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
obviously the skill levels of the player

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.280 
obviously the skill levels of the player
so<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.910> will<00:02:15.120> be<00:02:15.300> hugely<00:02:15.630> beneficial<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:16.200> the
