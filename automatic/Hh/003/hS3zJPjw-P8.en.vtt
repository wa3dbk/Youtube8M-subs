00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.080 
it depends on what coverage looking for
but<00:02:16.320> this<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.590> also<00:02:16.890> quite<00:02:17.310> an<00:02:17.520> affordable<00:02:18.000> one

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
but this is also quite an affordable one

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.790 
but this is also quite an affordable one
this<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.420> June<00:02:18.660> smoothness<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.440> think<00:02:19.680> it's

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
this is the June smoothness I think it's

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.050 
this is the June smoothness I think it's
like<00:02:19.920> rinds<00:02:20.160> for<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:20.460> eight<00:02:20.610> dollars<00:02:20.940> or

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
like rinds for like eight dollars or

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.300 
like rinds for like eight dollars or
something<00:02:21.270> like<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.380> mean<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:23.160> get

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
something like that but I mean to get

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.920 
something like that but I mean to get
your<00:02:23.430> makeup<00:02:23.520> started<00:02:24.210> it's<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.750> guys

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
your makeup started it's just you guys

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.600 
your makeup started it's just you guys
spend<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> few<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.890> know<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.010> few<00:02:26.190> dollars<00:02:26.310> to

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
spend a few you know a few dollars to

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.100 
spend a few you know a few dollars to
get<00:02:26.730> unless<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.570> just<00:02:27.660> want<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.870> get<00:02:27.990> it

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
get unless you just want to get it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.200 
get unless you just want to get it
slowly<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.500> gradually<00:02:28.770> over<00:02:29.100> time<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:29.940> I'd

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
slowly and gradually over time so I'd

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.640 
slowly and gradually over time so I'd
recommend<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.840> foundation<00:02:31.410> I'm

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
recommend like a foundation I'm

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.970 
recommend like a foundation I'm
obviously<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.340> your<00:02:32.520> color<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.860> are

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
obviously of your color if you are

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.200 
obviously of your color if you are
looking<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.550> try<00:02:35.760> different<00:02:36.090> eyeshadows

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
looking to like try different eyeshadows

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.210 
looking to like try different eyeshadows
and<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:36.720> with<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.440> one's<00:02:37.650> broken<00:02:37.920> but

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
and so with this this one's broken but

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.410 
and so with this this one's broken but
it<00:02:38.250> does<00:02:38.460> have<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.640> cover<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.090> think<00:02:39.300> this

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
it does have a cover and I think this

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.120 
it does have a cover and I think this
but<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.320> coastal<00:02:40.650> scents<00:02:40.830> 88

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130
