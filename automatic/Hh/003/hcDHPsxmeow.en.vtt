picture<00:02:16.710> right<00:02:17.040> here<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.580> device<00:02:17.970> was<00:02:18.320> 99.95

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
picture right here this device was 99.95

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.990 
picture right here this device was 99.95
so<00:02:20.420> basically<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> hundred<00:02:21.600> dollars<00:02:22.050> plus<00:02:22.410> tax

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
so basically a hundred dollars plus tax

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.550 
so basically a hundred dollars plus tax
so<00:02:24.170> let's<00:02:25.170> get<00:02:25.350> into<00:02:25.740> this<00:02:25.830> device<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:27.600> open<00:02:28.470> up

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
so let's get into this device so open up

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.060 
so let's get into this device so open up
the<00:02:28.740> little<00:02:29.010> tab<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:34.410> have<00:02:34.620> some

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
the little tab here you have some

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.800 
the little tab here you have some
literature<00:02:35.880> right<00:02:36.330> here<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.140> user<00:02:37.530> manual

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
literature right here the user manual

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:55.340 
literature right here the user manual
which<00:02:39.810> known<00:02:40.260> reads<00:02:47.060> pull<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.270> out<00:02:54.200> put<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
which known reads pull this out put the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.570 
which known reads pull this out put the
box<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.190> side<00:03:00.560> right<00:03:01.560> here<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:02.070> looks<00:03:02.280> like

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
box to the side right here it looks like

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:11.979 
box to the side right here it looks like
you<00:03:02.820> have<00:03:03.060> your<00:03:03.950> remote<00:03:04.950> control<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:09.530> your

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
you have your remote control and your

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.100 
you have your remote control and your
power<00:03:12.989> cable<00:03:13.290> as<00:03:13.709> well<00:03:13.980> as<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.940> small<00:03:15.840> battery

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
power cable as well as a small battery

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.490 
power cable as well as a small battery
now<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.040> battery<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:19.640> three<00:03:20.640> volts<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.510> just

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
now the battery is three volts so just

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.229 
now the battery is three volts so just
in<00:03:22.620> case<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.070> power<00:03:23.280> goes<00:03:23.400> out<00:03:23.700> or<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.030> can

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
in case the power goes out or you can

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.160 
in case the power goes out or you can
move<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.510> really<00:03:24.750> fast

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
move it really fast

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:32.979 
move it really fast
it<00:03:25.290> keeps<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.860> time<00:03:26.690> so<00:03:30.380> here<00:03:31.380> is<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.650> charger

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
it keeps the time so here is the charger

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.030 
it keeps the time so here is the charger
so<00:03:35.030> pretty<00:03:36.030> sturdy<00:03:36.650> let's<00:03:37.650> look<00:03:37.860> at<00:03:37.950> the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
so pretty sturdy let's look at the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.360 
so pretty sturdy let's look at the
remote<00:03:38.280> control<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.790> see<00:03:39.120> what<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.360> has

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.530 

actually<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.430> looks<00:03:44.610> like<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.940> battery<00:03:45.360> is

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
actually it looks like that battery is

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.650 
actually it looks like that battery is
for<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.680> remote<00:03:47.400> control<00:03:47.850> unless<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.450> has<00:03:48.630> a

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
for the remote control unless it has a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.920 
for the remote control unless it has a
battery<00:03:49.730> inside<00:03:50.730> because<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:51.630> had<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.780> little

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
battery inside because I had a little

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.660 
battery inside because I had a little
pull<00:03:52.230> tab<00:03:54.560> make<00:03:55.560> these<00:03:55.739> things<00:03:55.980> impossible<00:03:56.280> to

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
pull tab make these things impossible to

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.850 
pull tab make these things impossible to
open<00:03:56.730> up

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.370 

it's<00:04:04.310> a<00:04:04.400> little<00:04:04.610> tab<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:05.420> have<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.720> push

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
it's a little tab that you have to push

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.410 
it's a little tab that you have to push
sideways<00:04:06.890> and<00:04:07.040> then<00:04:07.160> pull<00:04:07.400> out<00:04:10.240> there<00:04:11.240> we<00:04:11.330> go

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
sideways and then pull out there we go

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.570 
sideways and then pull out there we go
yeah<00:04:11.780> so<00:04:12.020> this<00:04:12.140> has<00:04:12.320> a<00:04:12.350> battery<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.980> comes

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
yeah so this has a battery that comes

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.640 
yeah so this has a battery that comes
pre-installed<00:04:14.830> so<00:04:15.830> it<00:04:16.010> has<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.220> mode<00:04:16.790> button

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
pre-installed so it has a mode button

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.870 
pre-installed so it has a mode button
zze<00:04:18.650> which<00:04:18.890> I'm<00:04:19.070> guessing<00:04:19.220> means<00:04:19.550> snooze

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
zze which I'm guessing means snooze

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.490 
zze which I'm guessing means snooze
power<00:04:20.600> button<00:04:21.880> lower<00:04:22.880> volume<00:04:23.500> increase

I'm<00:04:38.150> guessing<00:04:38.570> dim<00:04:39.050> button<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:40.130> see<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.400> to

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
I'm guessing dim button to see the to

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.840 
I'm guessing dim button to see the to
control<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.810> LCD<00:04:42.590> display<00:04:43.010> and<00:04:43.190> an<00:04:43.550> alarm

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
control the LCD display and an alarm

00:04:43.850 --> 00:05:02.370

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:30.830 

it's<00:05:03.380> like<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.620> entire<00:05:03.710> devices<00:05:04.370> shrink

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.180 

it's<00:05:31.840> like<00:05:32.020> somehow<00:05:32.500> you're<00:05:32.680> supposed<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:33.070> get

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
it's like somehow you're supposed to get

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.490 
it's like somehow you're supposed to get
this<00:05:33.690> people<00:05:34.690> out<00:05:36.900> there<00:05:37.900> we<00:05:37.960> go<00:05:38.080> that's<00:05:38.320> for

the FM radio

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.630 
the FM radio
so<00:05:40.690> looks<00:05:41.440> like<00:05:41.530> they're<00:05:41.740> really<00:05:42.070> pushing<00:05:42.310> the

so looks like they're really pushing the

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.060 
so looks like they're really pushing the
app<00:05:42.850> enhanced<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:45.010> get<00:05:45.220> the<00:05:45.400> free<00:05:45.850> application

really big you have the aux-in which it

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.460 
really big you have the aux-in which it
did<00:06:46.180> not<00:06:46.210> come<00:06:46.660> with<00:06:46.840> an<00:06:46.960> aux<00:06:47.260> cable<00:06:49.200> you<00:06:50.200> have

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
did not come with an aux cable you have

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.750 
did not come with an aux cable you have
the<00:06:50.740> DC<00:06:51.310> in<00:06:51.580> and<00:06:51.850> you<00:06:52.660> have<00:06:52.930> the<00:06:53.350> FM<00:06:54.010> radio<00:06:54.220> cord

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.200 
so overall this seems like definitely it

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.610 
so overall this seems like definitely it
shouldn't<00:06:59.620> be<00:06:59.800> a<00:06:59.830> hundred<00:07:00.160> dollars<00:07:00.610> but<00:07:01.620> high

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
shouldn't be a hundred dollars but high

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.659 
shouldn't be a hundred dollars but high
quality<00:07:04.470> you'd<00:07:05.470> think<00:07:05.710> for<00:07:05.919> $100<00:07:06.460> you<00:07:06.640> would

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669
