teachers<00:01:55.409> anybody<00:01:56.310> who's<00:01:56.610> taught<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> lot<00:01:57.030> also

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
teachers anybody who's taught a lot also

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.590 
teachers anybody who's taught a lot also
provides<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.439> also<00:01:59.210> deal<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.420> same

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
provides that we also deal with the same

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.130 
provides that we also deal with the same
problems<00:02:01.079> when<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.460> dealing<00:02:02.759> with

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
problems when we are dealing with

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.700 
problems when we are dealing with
certain<00:02:04.610> organization<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:06.350> elements<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.469> time

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
certain organization of elements in time

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.800 
certain organization of elements in time
and<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.610> very<00:02:08.819> common<00:02:09.270> for

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and so it's very common for

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.640 
and so it's very common for
saying<00:02:10.170> problems<00:02:11.039> from<00:02:12.030> students<00:02:12.540> dude<00:02:12.720> okay

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
saying problems from students dude okay

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.790 
saying problems from students dude okay
so<00:02:14.240> let<00:02:15.240> me<00:02:15.330> get<00:02:15.450> into<00:02:15.569> this<00:02:15.780> I'm<00:02:15.959> getting<00:02:16.709> away

so let me get into this I'm getting away

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.380 
so let me get into this I'm getting away
from<00:02:16.950> my<00:02:17.190> thing<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:19.130> not<00:02:20.130> long<00:02:20.370> ago<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.850> started

from my thing so not long ago I started

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.240 
from my thing so not long ago I started
taping<00:02:21.720> myself<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.470> putting<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.740> against<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
taping myself and putting it against the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.890 
taping myself and putting it against the
metronome<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:23.760> take<00:02:24.120> without<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.420> metronome

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
metronome so take without the metronome

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.570 
metronome so take without the metronome
and<00:02:24.930> then<00:02:25.470> play<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.740> metronome<00:02:26.100> forgets<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
and then play the metronome forgets to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.500 
and then play the metronome forgets to
click<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:28.350> course<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.950> found<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:30.120> I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
click and of course I found that I

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.740 
click and of course I found that I
wasn't<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.440> wasn't<00:02:31.739> metronomic<00:02:32.130> ly<00:02:32.370> perfect<00:02:32.819> I

amount of technique we want to use it

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.220 
amount of technique we want to use it
we<00:02:41.130> don't<00:02:41.310> jump<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.060> Corvette<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.660> go<00:02:42.750> 25

we don't jump in a Corvette and go 25
you<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:43.650> once<00:02:43.860> you've<00:02:44.010> got<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.400> want<00:02:44.610> to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
you know once you've got it you want to

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.370 
you know once you've got it you want to
you<00:02:44.790> know<00:02:44.850> if<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.030> want<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.239> go<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.690> know<00:02:45.810> so

you know if you want to go you know so

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.160 
you know if you want to go you know so
but<00:02:47.070> that's<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.580> doesn't<00:02:47.970> help<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.450> for

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
but that's that doesn't help you to for

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.720 
but that's that doesn't help you to for
other<00:02:49.350> people<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.769> hear<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.370> say<00:02:50.519> I

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
other people to hear that and say I

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.580 
other people to hear that and say I
could<00:02:50.910> play<00:02:51.090> with<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.510> which<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.200> what<00:02:52.530> I

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
could play with that which is what I

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.380 
could play with that which is what I
found<00:02:52.860> most<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.400> lot<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:53.760> committee<00:02:54.030> members

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
found most a lot of committee members

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.059 
found most a lot of committee members
when<00:02:54.540> I'm<00:02:54.630> sitting<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.080> auditions<00:02:55.560> that's

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
when I'm sitting in on auditions that's

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.680 
when I'm sitting in on auditions that's
the<00:02:56.250> way<00:02:56.370> they<00:02:56.550> gauge<00:02:56.790> how<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.330> could<00:02:57.540> play<00:02:57.660> with

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
the way they gauge how I could play with

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.600 
the way they gauge how I could play with
that<00:02:57.959> yeah<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:58.980> going<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.280> see<00:02:59.370> if<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.519> can

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
that yeah and just going to see if I can

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.970 
that yeah and just going to see if I can
play<00:02:59.700> this<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.510> that's<00:03:01.200> that's<00:03:01.620> where<00:03:01.860> you're

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
play this so that's that's where you're

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.550 
play this so that's that's where you're
going<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:03.060> integrating<00:03:03.660> with<00:03:03.690> enough<00:03:03.959> reps<00:03:04.230> I

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
going and integrating with enough reps I

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.229 
going and integrating with enough reps I
got<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.100> where<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.280> could<00:03:05.550> pretty<00:03:05.700> much<00:03:05.880> lay

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
got to where I could pretty much lay

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.030 
got to where I could pretty much lay
something<00:03:06.690> out<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.050> then<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.350> would<00:03:07.440> be<00:03:07.560> fine

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
something out and then it would be fine

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.740 
something out and then it would be fine
on<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.370> click<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.239> was<00:03:09.480> kind<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.660> my

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
on the click so that was kind of my

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.449 
on the click so that was kind of my
click<00:03:10.019> off<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.560> listen<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.160> again<00:03:11.250> and

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
click off and listen to it again and

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.180 
click off and listen to it again and
realize<00:03:11.940> okay<00:03:12.450> well<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.709> doesn't<00:03:13.920> sound

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
realize okay well that doesn't sound

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.560 
realize okay well that doesn't sound
human<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:14.940> sounds<00:03:15.269> completely

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
human and that sounds completely

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.170 
human and that sounds completely
controlled<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.530> now<00:03:17.430> I've<00:03:17.730> got<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.060> figure

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
controlled and now I've got to figure

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.880 
controlled and now I've got to figure
out<00:03:18.450> how<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.630> make<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:18.989> attractive<00:03:19.620> again

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
out how to make this attractive again

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.850 
out how to make this attractive again
now<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.640> I've<00:03:20.760> been<00:03:21.360> able<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.690> do<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.530> so

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
now that I've been able to do that so

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.650 
now that I've been able to do that so
what<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.459> would<00:03:23.579> start<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.000> do<00:03:24.150> which<00:03:24.329> anyone

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
what I would start to do which anyone

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.449 
what I would start to do which anyone
start<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.989> do<00:03:25.079> is<00:03:25.200> start<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.709> manipulate<00:03:25.860> but

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
start to do is start to manipulate but

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.860 
start to do is start to manipulate but
at<00:03:26.549> least<00:03:26.670> I'm<00:03:26.880> manipulating<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.570> rhythm

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
at least I'm manipulating the rhythm

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.600 
at least I'm manipulating the rhythm
from<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.170> spot<00:03:28.440> where<00:03:28.709> it's<00:03:29.190> control

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
from the spot where it's control

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.250 
from the spot where it's control
manipulation<00:03:30.120> instead<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.750> accidental

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
manipulation instead of accidental

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
I'm trying to do with it instead of

I'm trying to do with it instead of
playing<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.130> without<00:03:35.400> any<00:03:35.549> knowledge<00:03:35.730> I'm

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
of thinking about that to the off ease

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
of thinking about that to the off ease
in<00:06:01.230> your<00:06:01.320> left<00:06:01.500> hand<00:06:01.620> there

in your left hand there
so<00:06:02.460> you<00:06:02.580> think<00:06:02.730> about<00:06:02.940> how<00:06:03.150> a<00:06:03.180> sax<00:06:03.570> player<00:06:03.660> is

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.020 
so you think about how a sax player is
going<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:04.710> play<00:06:04.890> a<00:06:04.920> line<00:06:05.310> like<00:06:05.490> that<00:06:05.520> you<00:06:05.910> gotta

going to play a line like that you gotta
go<00:06:07.220> they<00:06:08.220> actually<00:06:08.550> are<00:06:08.730> kind<00:06:09.090> of<00:06:09.180> leaning

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
go they actually are kind of leaning

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.940 
go they actually are kind of leaning
heavy<00:06:09.810> on<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.290> offbeat's

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
heavy on the offbeat's

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.070 
heavy on the offbeat's
which<00:06:11.550> you<00:06:11.760> know<00:06:11.850> we<00:06:12.000> as<00:06:12.450> percussionist<00:06:13.020> we

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
which you know we as percussionist we

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.080 
which you know we as percussionist we
don't<00:06:13.230> necessarily<00:06:13.460> put<00:06:14.460> that<00:06:14.610> together<00:06:14.820> but

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
don't necessarily put that together but

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.370 
don't necessarily put that together but
I<00:06:15.240> think<00:06:15.300> that's<00:06:15.630> another<00:06:15.870> reason<00:06:16.080> why<00:06:16.320> you

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
I think that's another reason why you

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.840 
I think that's another reason why you
like<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.740> left<00:06:16.980> hand<00:06:17.190> heavy<00:06:17.400> on<00:06:17.550> that<00:06:17.760> because

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
like the left hand heavy on that because

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.850 
like the left hand heavy on that because
it<00:06:18.030> kind<00:06:18.180> of<00:06:18.270> swings<00:06:18.570> the<00:06:19.080> way<00:06:19.260> of<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.590> wind

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
it kind of swings the way of a wind

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.100 
it kind of swings the way of a wind
flare<00:06:20.130> sax<00:06:20.700> player<00:06:21.030> you<00:06:21.630> know<00:06:21.690> might<00:06:21.900> play

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
flare sax player you know might play

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.580 
flare sax player you know might play
that<00:06:22.320> yeah<00:06:22.650> and<00:06:23.520> so<00:06:24.450> that's<00:06:24.960> that's<00:06:25.260> an

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
that yeah and so that's that's an

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.290 
that yeah and so that's that's an
example<00:06:25.890> probably<00:06:26.370> the<00:06:26.610> best<00:06:26.790> example<00:06:27.210> I<00:06:27.270> can

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
example probably the best example I can

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.750 
example probably the best example I can
think<00:06:27.480> of<00:06:27.780> a<00:06:27.870> tank<00:06:28.140> a<00:06:28.200> written<00:06:28.950> thing<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:29.520> even

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
think of a tank a written thing and even

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.860 
think of a tank a written thing and even
taking<00:06:30.060> the<00:06:30.150> rhythm<00:06:30.420> that<00:06:30.510> we<00:06:30.630> all<00:06:30.750> know

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
taking the rhythm that we all know

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.210 
taking the rhythm that we all know
supposed<00:06:31.110> to<00:06:31.170> be<00:06:31.260> and<00:06:31.410> manipulating<00:06:32.100> it<00:06:32.130> to

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
supposed to be and manipulating it to

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.010 
supposed to be and manipulating it to
where<00:06:32.400> it's<00:06:32.520> more<00:06:32.550> attractive<00:06:32.880> to<00:06:33.540> your

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
where it's more attractive to your

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.600 
where it's more attractive to your
listener<00:06:34.350> yeah<00:06:34.650> we've<00:06:34.830> got<00:06:35.010> it<00:06:35.130> we<00:06:35.340> kind<00:06:35.550> of

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
listener yeah we've got it we kind of

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.330 
listener yeah we've got it we kind of
talked<00:06:36.000> about
