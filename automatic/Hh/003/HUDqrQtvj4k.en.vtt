00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.910
 tutorial of origins on this occasion les 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.529
 I'm going to teach how to get 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.480
 special grenades the new grenades 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.160
 tactics on this new map which 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.960
 I have no idea what people are called 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.180
 he says aerial monkeys or good I'll 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.500
 I call mortar attacks in many desires 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.849
 what I do is act like a monk 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.919
 attracted all the zombies and after that 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.050
 an air attack on the place of 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.190
 attraction is one is something pretty good 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.180
 it's quite useful and so it 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.920
 they get in a relatively 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.900
 easy the first thing they have to do 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.280
 gentlemen is to get what would be the 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.230
 fists has to get the fists of 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.220
 kung-fu females download a link in the 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.900
 description in case you do not know how 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.890
 get these fists then well a 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.900
 once they have got the fists 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.850
 they have to give generator 2 to the station 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.920
 of the tank and above this table they will see 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.390
 that there are 44 pebbles with a symbol of 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.190
 fist on top of them have to grab 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.600
 one that can be neither individual or 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.190
 cooperative is actually a stone 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.060
 per player but you can actually 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.280
 say that it is individual 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.260
 it's not that if there are four players the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.030
 four have to do it is taken out as 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.380
 that alone then then since 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.790
 they had this stone gentlemen have it that 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.020
 carry what would be on top of the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.490
 good church is actually in the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.829
 church is going to have to see what 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.720
 like a pedestal type a guy with a 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.670
 kind of structure something like that in the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.140
 which if they press x van habana 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.790
 and the piera and they will see that the stone goes 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.200
 to be there on top of what would be the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.939
 water now what they have to do is 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.770
 purify this stone gentlemen with weapons 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.509
 of zombies and they have to kill zombies 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.729
 with fists near this stone 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.649
 then of each each that kill some 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.149
 sonic with the barmer fist that the soul is going 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.530
 to be going towards the stone and 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.390
 eventually it will be cleaned after 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.729
 about 20 or 30 zombies the stone goes to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.229
 move from a black color to a color 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.700
 blanquito now means that it is 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.930
 clean then what they have to do 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.820
 gentlemen is now that I am cleaning the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.439
 they have to take and they will have it in their 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.020
 inventory and then here comes it say 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.520
 the not so easy part seems similar because 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.810
 it is not difficult what they have to do is 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.890
 now that they have it clean in their 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.140
 inventory have to follow this 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.630
 wooden path have to lower the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.770
 church and keep changing so by 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.270
 the left and only for the wood 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.940
 gentlemen because if they touch in the mud 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.740
 even if it's a little bit the stone gets dirty 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.140
 and they're going to have to go back to what 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.850
 would be in this place with water and nothing else 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.440
 put him back out and actually 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.819
 you do not have to refill with 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.560
 zombie trees nothing simply have 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.850
 to return without cleaning it but 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.799
 better do not do it just do the 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.780
 way well continue to follow the path 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.000
 because outside the church I arrived from the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.950
 dig up come after what 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.970
 let it be the workshop and then it will be 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.770
 the generator 2 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.840
 and they come back to where they took this 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.880
 stone then put it and they will see that 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.890
 the stone will be ready with it going to 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.720
 be clean and now they have to go back to 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.580
 kill again zombies about 20 and 30 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.800
 zombies and wallyson less in what would be 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.180
 this area then they're going to start 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.860
 absorb the weapons and eventually 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.290
 after a certain amount of zombies 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.700
 that is fulfilled that they kill there nearby they go to 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.590
 see that the grenades are going to appear there 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.940
 floating in a yellow white flash 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.530
 and all they have to do is 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.510
 press x to take them then 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.220
 would be all gentlemen that's a way 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.870
 pretty easy to get them but they 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.340
 I recommend that they do it in a round 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.630
 low if they want to do it so they do not 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.250
 make it difficult for them to kill zombies with 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.860
 fists and good as I told you, sir 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.240
 this desire serve as a monkey because 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.530
 nothing is also for the district and 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.780
 I hope you like this video gentlemen 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.780
 take care, see you later, goodbye
