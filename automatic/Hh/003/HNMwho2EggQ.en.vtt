00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
can't move either now you can try to

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.430 
can't move either now you can try to
come<00:03:50.770> over<00:03:50.890> here<00:03:51.569> do<00:03:52.569> that<00:03:52.780> whole<00:03:52.959> parkour

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
come over here do that whole parkour

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.380 
come over here do that whole parkour
thing<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:54.310> doesn't<00:03:54.580> really<00:03:54.730> work<00:03:54.970> out<00:03:55.120> very

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
thing that doesn't really work out very

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.380 
thing that doesn't really work out very
well<00:03:55.480> because<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:57.100> distance<00:03:57.580> is<00:03:57.790> really<00:03:58.060> hard

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
well because the distance is really hard

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.360 
well because the distance is really hard
to<00:03:58.480> achieve<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:59.230> we<00:03:59.410> since<00:03:59.680> he<00:03:59.800> moves<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.130> he

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
to achieve and we since he moves it he

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.920 
to achieve and we since he moves it he
moves<00:04:00.880> around<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:01.150> actively<00:04:01.690> when<00:04:01.810> you're

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
moves around so actively when you're

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.280 
moves around so actively when you're
over<00:04:02.110> there

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
over there

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.800 
over there
um<00:04:02.880> it's<00:04:03.880> really<00:04:04.120> hard<00:04:04.269> to<00:04:04.330> kill<00:04:04.450> on<00:04:04.570> with<00:04:04.690> that

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
um it's really hard to kill on with that

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.229 
um it's really hard to kill on with that
so<00:04:05.040> right<00:04:06.040> here<00:04:06.340> is<00:04:06.489> really<00:04:06.670> perfect<00:04:06.970> too

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
so right here is really perfect too

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.810 
so right here is really perfect too
because<00:04:07.600> um<00:04:08.140> it's<00:04:08.830> also<00:04:09.130> in<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.280> distance<00:04:09.640> where

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
because um it's also in a distance where

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.440 
because um it's also in a distance where
if<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.269> leave<00:04:10.540> his<00:04:10.870> lair<00:04:11.110> or<00:04:12.239> when<00:04:13.239> you<00:04:13.330> leave

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
if you leave his lair or when you leave

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.180 
if you leave his lair or when you leave
his<00:04:13.600> lair<00:04:13.810> after<00:04:14.470> two<00:04:14.590> EPs<00:04:14.769> tempting<00:04:15.070> to

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
his lair after two EPs tempting to

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.460 
his lair after two EPs tempting to
battle<00:04:15.459> him<00:04:15.640> his<00:04:16.480> health<00:04:16.720> will<00:04:16.959> automatically

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
battle him his health will automatically

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.810 
battle him his health will automatically
do<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.590> chain<00:04:17.829> right<00:04:18.010> here<00:04:18.370> that's<00:04:18.609> not<00:04:18.700> an

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
do a chain right here that's not an

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.280 
do a chain right here that's not an
issue<00:04:19.000> because<00:04:19.329> you're<00:04:19.570> already<00:04:19.810> added<00:04:20.230> a

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
issue because you're already added a

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.060 
issue because you're already added a
layer<00:04:20.760> so<00:04:22.080> his<00:04:23.080> health<00:04:23.350> doesn't<00:04:23.890> have<00:04:24.040> a

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
layer so his health doesn't have a

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.719 
layer so his health doesn't have a
chance<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.550> regenerate<00:04:25.080> now<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:27.340> can<00:04:27.460> see<00:04:27.610> you

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
chance to regenerate now you can see you

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.570 
chance to regenerate now you can see you
still<00:04:28.000> doing<00:04:28.240> zel<00:04:28.450> animations<00:04:29.370> not<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.400> big

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
deal right here yeah and now he's dead

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.659 
deal right here yeah and now he's dead
now<00:04:38.410> at<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:38.710> point<00:04:38.979> you<00:04:39.160> kind<00:04:39.400> of<00:04:39.430> have<00:04:39.550> to

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
now at this point you kind of have to

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.920 
now at this point you kind of have to
hurry<00:04:40.000> because<00:04:40.530> um<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:42.060> think<00:04:43.060> stuff<00:04:43.690> in

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
hurry because um I think stuff in

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.659 
hurry because um I think stuff in
Borderlands<00:04:44.260> does<00:04:44.680> have<00:04:44.890> a<00:04:44.919> key<00:04:45.160> spawn<00:04:45.460> right

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
Borderlands does have a key spawn right

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.300 
Borderlands does have a key spawn right
but<00:04:46.600> it's<00:04:46.840> usually<00:04:47.080> pretty<00:04:47.470> long<00:04:47.710> time<00:04:48.010> so<00:04:48.250> you

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
but it's usually pretty long time so you

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.840 
but it's usually pretty long time so you
can<00:04:49.590> think<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.800> walk<00:04:51.040> but<00:04:51.430> I<00:04:51.460> wouldn't<00:04:51.700> risk

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
can think and walk but I wouldn't risk

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.760 
can think and walk but I wouldn't risk
it

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.280 

stuff<00:04:56.460> over<00:04:56.580> here<00:04:56.700> is<00:04:56.910> pretty<00:04:57.090> low<00:04:57.570> level<00:04:57.600> so

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
stuff over here is pretty low level so

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.290 
stuff over here is pretty low level so
I'm<00:04:58.410> not<00:04:58.560> having<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.920> huge<00:04:59.490> difficulty<00:05:00.030> with<00:05:00.180> it

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
I'm not having a huge difficulty with it

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.080 
I'm not having a huge difficulty with it
but<00:05:00.920> as<00:05:02.660> one<00:05:03.660> in<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.470> beginning<00:05:04.590> levels<00:05:05.160> under

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
but as one in the beginning levels under

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.330 
but as one in the beginning levels under
level<00:05:06.330> 10<00:05:06.480> basically<00:05:06.990> or<00:05:07.200> above

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
level 10 basically or above
