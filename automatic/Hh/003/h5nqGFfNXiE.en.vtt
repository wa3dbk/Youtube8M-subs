00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.560
 taken mixes in recent weeks so 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.360
 of course I have not got to eat 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.219
 Everything rejected because you repeated that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.290

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.400
 Lunch for lunch with colleagues 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.070
 and I did not want the camera now 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.170
 Take with you some ideas 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.439

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.050
 Delicious or if you still others 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.360
 Ideas for me are left to everyone 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.780
 turn off and check out the food choice 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.120

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.550
 I 'll take help from tomorrow 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.460
 Yesterday with me I often make myself easy 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.050
 evening before more 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.539
 and then I'm not in the morning 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.800
 Just stress the lunch for me 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.829
 prepare 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.110
 yes, here it is with one 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.309
 Vegetable pan so paprika zucchini 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.250
 tomato then a little carrot 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.140
 and garnished with garlic 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.240
 white wine quenched a bit 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.850
 tomato paste to it and then it was actually 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.250
 even the first banner finished it is 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.460
 very simple and also tastes cold to 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.640
 take along as mediterranean cold 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.979
 pour salad with us that is already 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.560
 in the evening and I have now easy 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.880
 already my lunch for tomorrow 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.979
 I prepared what I just then 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.119
 take it to work and that is 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.770
 these two are totally well 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.140
 You can already find the recipe for it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.020
 a channel in there are synonymous then 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.150
 ocado salad and the homemade ones 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.780
 bean sauce , I also go a video 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.670
 show 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.140
 and that is really a great dish for 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.180
 take it with me and I already have it 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.649
 half-wrapped in aluminum foil while the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.750
 other half now too 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.090
 and then I'll just do it 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.120
 a great tour do tomorrow take 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.940
 I take 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.950
 Tomorrow just produces so small 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.580
 kisses with her thinks now appears 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.010
 it's minced and so we see 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.550
 could they be vegetarian kisses 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.890
 they are available in our computer and not at all 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.260
 at least that's how bad it is 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.230
 on it looks short probably read 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:25.270
 but I read you 18 grams of protein 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:32.500
 carbohydrates 10.56 grams and in the 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:33.690
 all pack are 200 grams of churches 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.410
 in it I have now thrown in there 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.030
 and still had whole grain rice and I have 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.280
 now simply cut in paprika and 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.600
 would be a very little bit of this switch 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.130
 just purely make their songs because I 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.840
 now my own things right away 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.790
 make this morning and another one 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.760
 little sauce rhine and the sauce is yes 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.230
 was not the healthiest in the world though 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.690
 so it is not all too dry 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.120
 Today I take a few grapes 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.820
 strengthen with 1 8 pm in between 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.560
 have I find we are quite well because 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.780
 so they are pretty clean victory 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.570
 ridiculous and you can treat yourself 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.680
 to cool down and for lunch there is 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.270
 rice but not quite normal this time 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.920
 reached but we had sushi yesterday 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.110
 made and there was still too difficult and 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.820
 I still have this Japanese order 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.080
 nice so done with so special 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.390
 soy sauce and a few more sushi spice 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.720
 ingredient 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.459
 and yes I want to get out of the cold because 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.110
 So much is one salary because of it 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.550
 I think it is also a very good one 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.870
 thing to take away you can do it now 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.850
 also make a sushi roll 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.550
 but out of it last night, too 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.890
 Women roll on more sushi 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.230
 to prepare and again you see 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.690
 my tupperware i will take for tomorrow 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.850
 again 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.650
 for leftover food from evening 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.000
 do with and it's different, I know 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.820
 then often just a lot of things 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.130
 More we know in the evening 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.600
 do not eat because I already know 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.180
 The next morning I need absolutely 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.650
 what about lunch and this is enough 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.030
 namely now with and then just the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.280
 had sauce of the curry which hears evening 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.860
 not vegetables just left what was left 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.900
 in and will do that in the night 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.500
 fridge and laggenbeck do that to me 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.720
 to eat 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.290
 if I make it warm again then 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.210
 I usually do not make office but rather 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.920
 I just cold it may be 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.250
 not everyone's thing but I eat 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.240
 Also very much like the things gold 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.440
 This morning , I'll take me to the office 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.090
 something sweet should I kind of relish 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.080
 it did and now had no desire 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.940
 just to cook something 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.470
 it is already the sun 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.040
 So it did not work out that way anymore 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.230
 early as usual but I thought so 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.910
 Yes, I'll show you something 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.220
 take this morning with you 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:59.340
 So that's a small bowl with low fat 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.800
 yogurt and a few purely datteln 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.750
 and at least this time would be 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.480
 very good and can not recommend here 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.240
 dark ones are super healthy and 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.370
 A few thick flakes with almonds 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.890
 in there and I have now separated so separately 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.290
 that the trend with do not take that 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.790
 lull all over until noon 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.050
 it's not that muddy 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.860
 and then I will just have lunch 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.280
 together people 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:27.540
 we stand again in front of a tuba and 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:31.560
 Although today I take with this mission 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:35.400
 phobos and success against most 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.960
 songs are so sticky if they are 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.650
 at night, when I have the recipe on one 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.419
 channel that you do not win 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.919
 quite simple and instead of 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.570
 You can also do traditional stuffing 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.360
 I had a lot to replace, for example 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.150
 no freckles right now 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.070
 the wall bars tab will simply be the 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.320
 leave level and tomato on 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.350
 but what should be missing mint 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.289
 and basil track distances very well 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.960
 and now have it again and so 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.639
 do not stick them together like that 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.840
 The masses are relatively low and 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.630
 if I take you with me now 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.330
 in the end it is a big role on the 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.300
 dearest basquiats vision that does not work 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.010
 and you can take out their debut 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.940
 and then I have the sauce 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:22.850
 I have also ever 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:24.440
 filmed so only the sauce so 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.850
 that was the way they are now 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.260
 I like lunch 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.750
 of course, there are the 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.039
 prefer one or the other price in there 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.139
 Often that is often when that is of course a lot 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:37.180
 like to eat rice and rice of course 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:40.039
 super cork are not eating yes he has and 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.810
 am also someone who is also very good circle 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.259
 Of course, that's not for everyone 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.210
 Thing 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.099
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.289
 Write me the comments if we like 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:49.610
 would want to see more such videos 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:51.500
 maybe for me too in the 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.330
 coming time again as a video from 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.460
 and maybe with others 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.510
 I would definitely go to court 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.510
 look forward to see you soon
