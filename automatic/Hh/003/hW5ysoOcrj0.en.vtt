 sd-card slot you can see here 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.440
 First, I'll do it all with one 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.780
 Perform sd card that means I take 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.879

 external medium read that is in the 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.950
 a movie like siri on the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.899
 iphone 4 can install the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.000
 public once and you can see 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.729
 that the whole thing is loaded immediately ton 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.220
 it works quite fluently and works 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.319
 you can in the video without problems before and 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.429
 rewind without the any 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.429
 turn up the distortion 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.870
 second, I'll take it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.600
 small usb-stick has the faith now 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.100
 I'm only about the 200 mb I take myself 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.840
 again the adapter of my connexion kids 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.210
 and puts the usb stick in there once 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.760
 and you see again he will be without 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.970
 Problems with the ipad I assumed open 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.430
 then go back to a usb stick and 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.340
 can then read it in there again and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.040
 then you can see the thumbnail from here 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.660
 the video series so if I am the whole 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.970
 now with my external hard drive 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.800
 want to do and put this once 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.770
 my adapter and then in my ipad 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.840
 then this warning will be on 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.489
 appear on your ipad and that 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.050
 not enough or that the 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.120
 power supply of the external hard disk 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.400
 is not guaranteed 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.709
 because it consumes too much energy 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.250
 we can handle the whole thing by ourselves 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.430
 us an usb hub take an external 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.470
 Power supply then shows stuck 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.410
 we just put our external hard drive in 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.840
 we stick the usb hub to the usb hub 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.570
 into a socket and thus becomes the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.630
 external hard drive now with power of 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.970
 usb hubs again provides the usb hub 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.660
 we put our discount adapter and 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.420
 then the adapter in turn in our ipad 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.190
 when we reopen then see 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.049
 we already know that the ipad is the external one 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.989
 hard disk has recognized there I go 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.430
 then now on music videos and there would like 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.560
 I once show that the whole thing too 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.390
 works smoothly and take it 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.440

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:14.489
 tumor land 2012 the movie is off players and 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.019
 then have the whole video plays once 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.680
 from an external hard drive to yours 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.120
 ipad 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.340
 it works without it 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.680
 Problems can be smooth before and 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.380
 rewind without time delays 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.489
 any problems of performance 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.079
