00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
go with the Spot Healing Brush in do you

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.400 
go with the Spot Healing Brush in do you
make<00:00:26.070> really<00:00:26.550> tiny<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.660> go<00:00:27.840> through<00:00:28.170> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
make really tiny and you go through and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.580 
make really tiny and you go through and
try<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.160> fix<00:00:29.400> every<00:00:30.060> single<00:00:30.420> one<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.599> them<00:00:30.779> of

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
try to fix every single one of them of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.990 
try to fix every single one of them of
course<00:00:31.890> not<00:00:32.040> there<00:00:32.279> there's<00:00:32.550> obviously<00:00:32.910> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
course not there there's obviously a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.209 
course not there there's obviously a
better<00:00:33.420> way<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.739> wouldn't<00:00:35.130> be

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
better way to do this or I wouldn't be

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.220 
better way to do this or I wouldn't be
doing<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.489> video<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.570> here's<00:00:36.960> what<00:00:37.140> you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
do photo shops actually got a filter

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.299 
do photo shops actually got a filter
that<00:00:39.270> will<00:00:39.690> take<00:00:40.020> care<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.590> all<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:41.280> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
I'm just going to give you a little tip

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.139 
I'm just going to give you a little tip
when<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.379> comes<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.739> using<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.160> filter<00:00:44.579> we're

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
when it comes to using that filter we're

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.880 
when it comes to using that filter we're
going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.360> press<00:00:45.570> command<00:00:46.020> J<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.410> Mac<00:00:46.500> or

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
going to press command J on the Mac or

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.660 
going to press command J on the Mac or
ctrl<00:00:47.640> J<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.600> pc<00:00:49.340> what<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.489> does<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
ctrl J on the pc what that does is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.880 
ctrl J on the pc what that does is
duplicate<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> layer<00:00:51.500> then<00:00:52.500> we're<00:00:52.739> going<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
duplicate the layer then we're going to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.680 
duplicate the layer then we're going to
come<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> filter<00:00:54.090> menu<00:00:54.239> you're

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
come up here to the filter menu you're

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.080 
come up here to the filter menu you're
going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> go<00:00:55.050> down<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.590> noise<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
going to go down to noise and it's the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.790 
going to go down to noise and it's the
last<00:00:57.300> place<00:00:57.510> you'd<00:00:57.840> expect<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.410> filter<00:00:58.770> that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
last place you'd expect a filter that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.639 
last place you'd expect a filter that
actually<00:00:59.309> fixed<00:00:59.879> these<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:01.020> speckles<00:01:01.500> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
actually fixed these little speckles to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.850 
actually fixed these little speckles to
be<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.100> go<00:01:02.250> down<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.430> noise<00:01:02.820> and

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
be but you go down to noise and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.410 
be but you go down to noise and
sometimes<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.580> way<00:01:05.700> filters<00:01:06.119> are<00:01:06.299> in

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
sometimes the way filters are in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
sometimes the way filters are in
Photoshop<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.590> look<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.010> it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
Photoshop because if you look at this it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
Photoshop because if you look at this it
is<00:01:08.280> kinda<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.299> bits<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.720> noise

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
is kinda it's like little bits of noise

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.020 
is kinda it's like little bits of noise
inside<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.830> sometimes<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> way<00:01:11.670> filters

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
inside of here sometimes the way filters

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550 
inside of here sometimes the way filters
are<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.299> Photoshop<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> very<00:01:13.229> thing<00:01:13.290> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
are in Photoshop is the very thing you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.109 
are in Photoshop is the very thing you
want<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> take<00:01:14.010> away<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.460> where<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
want to take away is where you have to

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.780 
want to take away is where you have to
go<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.049> know<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.770> think<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.310> store<00:01:17.640> is

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
go like you know I think this store is

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.370 
go like you know I think this store is
where<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> want<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.330> distort<00:01:18.689> things<00:01:18.990> but

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
where I want to distort things but

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.929 
where I want to distort things but
honestly<00:01:19.740> there's<00:01:20.310> ways<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.759> remove

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
honestly there's ways to remove

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.969 
honestly there's ways to remove
distortion<00:01:21.840> inside<00:01:22.200> here<00:01:22.409> same<00:01:22.619> thing<00:01:22.830> with

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
distortion inside here same thing with

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.100 
distortion inside here same thing with
this<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> noise<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:25.080> course

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
this so you go to noise and of course

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.840 
this so you go to noise and of course
you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.560> add<00:01:25.710> noise<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.220> there's<00:01:26.369> one<00:01:26.610> called

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you can add noise but there's one called

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.880 
you can add noise but there's one called
dust<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.720> scratches<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> when<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> choose<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
dust and scratches so when I choose that

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.380 
dust and scratches so when I choose that
magically<00:01:31.890> all<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.700> my<00:01:32.850> little<00:01:33.000> spots

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
magically all of my little spots

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.080 
magically all of my little spots
disappear<00:01:33.720> all<00:01:34.530> right<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.829> all<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.220> did<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.790> have

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
disappear all right and all I did I have

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.690 
disappear all right and all I did I have
the<00:01:36.119> radius<00:01:36.689> as<00:01:36.869> low<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.560> go<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.280> pixel

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the radius as low as it can go one pixel

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.969 
the radius as low as it can go one pixel
I<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> threshold<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.079> low<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.770> go

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
I have the threshold as low as it can go

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.249 
I have the threshold as low as it can go
20<00:01:41.400> levels<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.090> take<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> look<00:01:42.899> I'm<00:01:43.049> going<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
20 levels and take a look I'm going to

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
the things you can do is add a layer

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500 
the things you can do is add a layer
mask<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.219> layer<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.939> you<00:02:26.090> added<00:02:26.299> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
mask to the layer that you added the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.830 
mask to the layer that you added the
filter<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:27.079> take<00:02:28.069> your<00:02:28.250> brush<00:02:28.459> tool<00:02:28.659> set<00:02:29.659> your

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
filter to take your brush tool set your

foreground color to black all right and
then<00:02:33.139> just<00:02:33.439> make<00:02:33.829> your<00:02:33.980> brush<00:02:34.159> small<00:02:34.489> enough

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
then just make your brush small enough

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.580 
then just make your brush small enough
and<00:02:34.939> all<00:02:35.239> we're<00:02:35.450> going<00:02:35.569> to<00:02:35.629> do<00:02:35.780> here<00:02:36.049> is<00:02:36.170> just

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
and all we're going to do here is just

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.580 
and all we're going to do here is just
go<00:02:37.010> in<00:02:37.159> here<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.400> paint<00:02:38.000> back<00:02:38.389> in<00:02:38.750> some<00:02:39.469> of

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
go in here and paint back in some of

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.530 
go in here and paint back in some of
these<00:02:39.680> areas<00:02:39.889> like<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.579> eyes<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.209> eyes<00:02:41.239> are

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
these areas like the eyes the eyes are

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.569 
these areas like the eyes the eyes are
probably<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.019> main<00:02:42.230> part<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.769> just<00:02:43.219> paint<00:02:43.459> them

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
probably the main part I just paint them

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.099 
probably the main part I just paint them
back<00:02:43.790> in<00:02:44.709> maybe<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.889> mouth<00:02:46.389> hop<00:02:47.389> over<00:02:47.599> here<00:02:47.930> to

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
back in maybe the mouth hop over here to

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
above his eyes all right just a little

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.429 
above his eyes all right just a little
bit<00:02:56.419> down<00:02:56.540> here<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:56.900> can<00:02:57.019> see<00:02:57.200> we<00:02:57.319> add<00:02:57.409> a

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
bit down here and you can see we add a

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.929 
bit down here and you can see we add a
little<00:02:57.680> bit<00:02:57.859> of<00:02:57.919> that<00:02:58.040> noise<00:02:58.370> back<00:02:58.669> in<00:02:58.849> a

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
little bit of that noise back in a

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.490 
little bit of that noise back in a
little<00:02:59.060> bit<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.329> texture<00:02:59.719> but<00:02:59.959> it's<00:03:00.079> okay<00:03:00.349> we

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
little bit of texture but it's okay we

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.860 
little bit of texture but it's okay we
can<00:03:00.530> get<00:03:00.829> rid<00:03:01.040> we<00:03:01.310> can<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:02.150> can<00:03:02.299> accept<00:03:02.719> it

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
can get rid we can we can accept it

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.479 
can get rid we can we can accept it
there<00:03:03.079> because<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.530> will<00:03:03.620> actually<00:03:03.829> give<00:03:04.280> the

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
there because it will actually give the

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.449 
there because it will actually give the
impression<00:03:04.819> of<00:03:05.319> detail<00:03:06.319> inside<00:03:06.620> some<00:03:07.430> of

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
impression of detail inside some of

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.580 
impression of detail inside some of
those<00:03:07.669> key<00:03:07.969> areas<00:03:08.049> all<00:03:09.049> right<00:03:09.169> and<00:03:09.319> you<00:03:09.439> can

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
those key areas all right and you can

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.050 
those key areas all right and you can
maybe<00:03:09.799> even<00:03:10.040> paint<00:03:10.340> around<00:03:10.579> some<00:03:10.879> of<00:03:11.000> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
maybe even paint around some of the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.199 
maybe even paint around some of the
edges<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.480> things<00:03:11.780> like<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.760> it'll

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
edges and things like that and it'll

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.580 
edges and things like that and it'll
just<00:03:14.269> make<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.569> look<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.900> little<00:03:15.019> bit<00:03:15.230> sharper

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
just make it look a little bit sharper

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.890 
just make it look a little bit sharper
so<00:03:15.739> as<00:03:15.889> I<00:03:16.069> back<00:03:16.280> out<00:03:16.519> when<00:03:17.150> we<00:03:17.239> take<00:03:17.419> a<00:03:17.450> look<00:03:17.719> if
