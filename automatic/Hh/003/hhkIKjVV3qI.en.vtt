00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
not as big of a range like last night we

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.360 
not as big of a range like last night we

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
were in the single digits the 30s but

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.069 
were in the single digits the 30s but
they'll<00:00:38.940> probably<00:00:39.149> be<00:00:39.360> some<00:00:39.570> 20s<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.050> 30s

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
they'll probably be some 20s and 30s

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.400 
they'll probably be some 20s and 30s
likely<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.370> key<00:00:41.520> mantra<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.120> well<00:00:42.629> above

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
likely and the key mantra is well above

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.600 
likely and the key mantra is well above
average<00:00:44.960> did<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.610> mid-january

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
average did you know that mid-january

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.540 
average did you know that mid-january
roughly<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.660> about<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.559> coldest<00:00:49.980> time<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.280> the

roughly is about the coldest time of the

roughly is about the coldest time of the
year<00:00:50.910> where<00:00:51.629> normally<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> high<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.680> 32<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.789> a

morning<00:00:54.840> low<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.020> 16<00:00:55.739> would<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.309> be

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
morning low of 16 would just be

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.490 
morning low of 16 would just be
considered<00:00:56.969> normal<00:00:57.300> we're<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.109> even<00:00:58.230> talking

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
considered normal we're not even talking

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.869 
considered normal we're not even talking
something<00:00:58.949> below<00:00:59.219> normal<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.730> just

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
something below normal that's just

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.860 
something below normal that's just
average<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.829> when<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.129> compare<00:01:02.430> 32<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.030> 16<00:01:03.359> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
average so when you compare 32 and 16 to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.729 
average so when you compare 32 and 16 to
what<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> seven-day<00:01:04.710> forecast

the<00:02:24.120> weekend<00:02:24.770> stepping<00:02:25.770> out<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.040> way<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
the weekend stepping out of the way the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.720 
the weekend stepping out of the way the
jet<00:02:27.180> stream<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.600> moving<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:27.990> like<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:29.700> it

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
jet stream is moving in like this so it

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.670 
jet stream is moving in like this so it
goes<00:02:30.330> down<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.900> then<00:02:30.990> comes<00:02:31.140> straight<00:02:31.650> up

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
goes down and then comes straight up

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.520 
goes down and then comes straight up
like<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.250> which<00:02:32.730> takes<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.630> storm<00:02:34.080> tracks

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
like this which takes the storm tracks

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.230 
like this which takes the storm tracks
to<00:02:35.430> our<00:02:35.580> West<00:02:35.990> so<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.590> means<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.370> cold<00:02:39.000> air

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
to our West so that means that cold air

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.600 
to our West so that means that cold air
cannot<00:02:39.720> be<00:02:39.870> locked<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:41.040> can<00:02:41.190> see<00:02:41.400> this

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
cannot be locked in you can see this

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.070 
cannot be locked in you can see this

it in the Rockies by the time it gets

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.400 
it in the Rockies by the time it gets
here<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:54.090> following<00:02:54.570> this<00:02:54.690> kind<00:02:54.990> of<00:02:55.080> same

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
here it's following this kind of same

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.040 
here it's following this kind of same

path so that when it does come in and
around<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:59.130> will<00:02:59.400> also<00:02:59.640> give<00:03:00.360> us<00:03:00.650> rain<00:03:01.650> on
