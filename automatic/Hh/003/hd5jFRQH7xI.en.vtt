00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.450
 good afternoon yourself i mean 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.450
 tank 103 in a starvation battle on the sand map 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.389
 as you can see the composition of our team 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.809
 better statistics are more green those 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.570
 less adversary and power is evil that is for 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.560
 Kirsh 2 account 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.529
 one of them with a small percentage 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.259
 wins 50 in total 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.909
 so most likely you will be prompted more 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:25.250
 according to fellow 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.520
 where to go and these bets will play 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.520
 together pestel from purchases is the main 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.410
 tuba problem 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.220
 fight honestly not really so severe 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.580
 we are very simple 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.280
 but honestly deliver not particularly 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.470
 managed 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.910
 very interesting precisely here in the image and 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.110
 one means where we went as we 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.490
 tried the rule of law texans 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.930
 I'll try to tell you about it 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.550
 that is the main problem names place 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.800
 mentor antony is not so critical here 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.340
 it's not very convenient for us to 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.060
 get a loan of 50 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.360
 it is clear that 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.970
 whether the experience which bowls 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.780
 the atmosphere of these funds and look 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.670
 go somewhere 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.840
 as you can see our main top 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.410
 haste not confirmed 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.370
 these two 1000 to 3000 dollars 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.380
 and I almost did not go 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.070
 essentially your actions are going to go 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.310
 upstairs 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.180
 now you can decide where to go up 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.350
 however find or down 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.200
 we don't go then he 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.460
 and that there the board is too passive 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 there is even if we guessed activity 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.190
 due to project meetings 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.420
 long distinguished mother just be 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.680
 stand and hold 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.510
 our quartet meeting 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.420
 downturn state support this time base on their 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.900
 support 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.560
 but they make up more there will be 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.970
 play iran allies down 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.620
 vat customer do not drag them not 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.160
 maybe maybe they can be long there 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.479
 was 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.370
 besides 394 2 5 times 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.950
 nobody knows 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.549
 on the other hand, the ascent itself can 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.500
 Grace to the current Peck 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.229
 remember 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.969
 along with their own theaters and just have 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.490
 those roll 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.049
 this is also a big problem as they 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.939
 imported to become spying from the point not 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.250
 it was mean you all would be no better 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.290
 general interaction 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.689
 so 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.019
 if so the commander of the table Otunbayeva 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.430
 they had our platoon platoons like this 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.579
 way 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.129
 I'm on my not very fast run 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.079
 with main field group 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.519
 in case of these meetings with the most 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.069
 and 50 years on the basis of reserves 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.370
 that is, it is she firstly to meetings 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.449
 Templar users 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.369
 and secondly, it can abruptly drive up to 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.549
 moment quickly goes faster 50 rights if we 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.609
 will meet if we met standing here 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.589
 50 can quickly dislike therefore 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:39.679
 you understand 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.799
 at the same time advanced in advance 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.659
 without waiting with the light 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.659
 and more quickly became winners this basis 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.499
 but such fights 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.979
 vehicles with different speeds 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:53.449
 however, we see that their ancestors arrived 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.489
 top and h 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.219
 in general projects force plan b 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.119
 and 50 stands on the base trying 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:03.679
 trying on the 6th floor 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:05.859
 and I added so little 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.819
 with a group in this car they 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.799
 I think that if only to shoot 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.989
 which only will act on the sea 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.109
 speaker slightest threat breakthrough top 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.889
 so the decree Moscow time the director will lose 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.769
 advisor map 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.699
 we have only one very small tank 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.409
 i will go back about square 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:25.839
 osvar 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.369
 atomic ships himself calmly elder 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:29.709
 bases 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.939
 so and so I despite the fact that I have it 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.179
 very fast new suits did not come 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:35.979
 go here back to back 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.809
 what should from this square just need 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:39.879
 two squares return italians 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.789
 I will be able to play the Canadian base 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.319
 and 50 is also small then to the last 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.109
 budget 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.849
 but under threat 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.049
 their morning 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.739
 if they are assigned to the lapis lap 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.109
 will try to draw clean 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.509
 also in this square formed by 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.619
 and our quiciani attack began smoothly 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:59.609
 downward movement 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.139
 I asked her to leave too 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.299
 so that she can score 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.239
 so we move away the tablet of these 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.509
 no sources 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.619
 it's like that 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:12.739
 ha I would help push a little news but very 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.839
 strong growth on the street 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:16.590
 our arthur focus alan 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.699
 she stood forgiven moan attempts 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:19.769
 namaz 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.239
 and we took the men together 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.239
 single object 704 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.520
 but also how would you come back 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.979
 arthur plays together we calmly atheros volume 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:31.770
 our base 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.599
 and in principle we can even for money 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:34.800
 kapitoshka have 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.139
 money for me 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.919
 on the way, we understand that for cards 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:38.949
 will fall 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.050
 that is, something like this 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.669
 notice much more 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.949
 effectively than if we went from the start 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.870
 together new items square somewhere 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.870
 c6 stages just sat around 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.430
 here it is like a little bit of war here and 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.099
 this is Moscow 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.330
 could safely save 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.539
 that is, we see that this reading is unknown 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.229
 to which this reception on base time became 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.830
 fight the whole crowd 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.720
 the duty of putting it on is just that 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.050
 table gold 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.919
 low stone command 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.029
 right to say 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:13.330
 so 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.080
 here the third church plan already happens 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.879
 option I continue 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.759
 push on the chances of our main groups 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.469
 flow 6 power 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:26.960
 and she sharpe calm 4 assists with 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.960
 will soon support us 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:33.969
 so here are all the options 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.619
 which they told were four 

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:38.220
 physically later 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.390
 the battle was pretty ordinary 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.390
 early in Kiev and very interesting nose 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.699
 but nonetheless 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.960
 I decided to withdraw and drain to 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.389
 he 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.180
 introduce you to that and some 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.860
 the thoughts of which he arise in his 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.240
 german head 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.880
 water moves away from such ordinary ordinary 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.710
 she added that china 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.240
 and such third-party options 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.870
 alternatives they of course too 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.110
 consider and calculate 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.259
 and I'm not trying at all to say that 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:09.500
 I say now I thought it 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.740
 only 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.629
 option is possible 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:13.819
 action 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:15.069
 version 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:16.779
 them 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.089
 nothing else at some point more than 100 you 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:20.830
 the player could guess here 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.310
 what else can be different feel 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.960
 myself and some other levels 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.469
 understanding of 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.699
 now investigating 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.879
 thank you for the attention he started fighting
