00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.089
 well I'm not going to leave it painted he 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.730
 go up alone he has everything ready and I 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.830
 while you are going to show the molds the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.950
 molds that this army has 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.389
 take today is a size 54 approximately 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.340
 permission I'll go find here to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.130
 note that I leave it here close 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.980
 It has two front parts 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.269
 and the back and it has good some 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.340
 little secrets in the theme of the pocket 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.640
 notice the part of the front has 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.309
 a total height of 34 centimeters and what 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.260
 what is special about it is that it has this 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.480
 sector that is what will form that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.020
 vara that is false and all this sector 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 that is cut that is to perform that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.940
 deep pocket the back part does not 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.920
 has nothing special also has 34 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.050
 centimeters high and here if we go to 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.809
 find then on the one hand the background 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.280
 pocket that is all this piece that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.079
 is what is going to appear of course in 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.000
 the clipping of the front and on the other 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.980
 side the pocket itself said that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.410
 now I will show them clearly 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.080
 so they can see how the waist is made 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.100
 that part the waist is a rectangle 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.619
 totally separated from 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.110
 from the rest of the molds, good look at me 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.850
 that I have already placed the front as 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.650
 let's make the pocket we're going to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.060
 do well quiet to this whole subject 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.280
 The first thing to do is 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.220
 face rights with your pocket 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.350
 properly sewing and here is 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.780
 very good and recommended to make several 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.850
 pickets, it's always convenient for them to execute 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.680
 pickets all along this to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.390
 that is as good as the pledge because 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.920
 I tell you this because when you turn this 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.770
 pocket of course look at you 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.470
 they have to start in this sector to 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.869
 baste so that this part fits 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.460
 is not going to see the pocket so 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.229
 they can do it in some other color 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.759
 that there is no problem always 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.340
 of course trying to make it the tone 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.259
 once they have all this already given 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.050
 return it suits them to make two 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.670
 stitches two straight stitch stitches 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.679
 to give you a good detail of 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.539
 completion once we have this 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.520
 we have to place the pocket bottom 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.950
 look, let's go around and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.720
 we also face the rights look 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.720
 that we got the right out of pocket 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.720
 up with 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.460
 the right of the pocket fund that is 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.100
 what I have to sew all the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.640
 free sectors from the waist I give 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.230
 all the way back to where would the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.750
 Pocket opening proper 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:28.700
 look at a more advanced step as we 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.170
 it stays this way if you take it and what 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.360
 nice is showing me how are you doing 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.240
 leaving very good prices here 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.530
 we have then the pocket in this 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.020
 moment if you want to perform 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.150
 some pocket apply here this is the 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.370
 right time to do it now 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.610
 let's go with the fly is that fly 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.959
 that is false is so simple that some 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.930
 people are complicated enough that 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.600
 I want to show them right place right 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.209
 of the front with the right of the other 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.500
 front matching well and 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.060
 let's go to the sewing machine and 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.400
 look at the route you are going to take 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.920
 the machine the whole straight part of the 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.540
 double fly here and this sector here 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.930
 lower see me accompany me to the 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.930
 machine 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.110
 I already have it ready in a seam 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.990
 straight and that's what I'm going to do first 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.850
 low in the cloth press I already have it 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.310
 we put them told them in a long 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.470
 stitch approximately 5 because I already 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.120
 I tried and because it always suits me 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.560
 Topping and notice I'm going to one side 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.590
 towards the tip when they reach the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.560
 corner nail the needle lifted the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.470
 press fabric twist the garment went down 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.690
 again the press to fabric and advanced what 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.490
 same I will perform in this part this 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.930
 part of the shot I hope they are 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.450
 placing well from what sector we are 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.810
 talking down again the cloth press 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.670
 and I sew the shot all this of course what 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.920
 I have to reinforce with a good surf 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.200
 spinning and if they want the right side 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.959
 which is very good also give you a 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.959
 seam reinforcement look then 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.980
 now once I 've stayed 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.769
 sewn I will separate the garment 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.680
 notice that it has been formed to see if 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.090
 they see it the false fly that is what 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.060
 I have to do here we have the shot 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.609
 cooked is in the adornment part I will 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.829
 make one or two seams so that 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.650
 more canchero when he arrived at the 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.610
 opening can fly this false 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.830
 make a small seam in shape 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.600
 half oval and I'm still imitating the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.130
 close note that it is ready 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.500
 then it will be known that it is false I am going to 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.150
 hold here because then I'm going to 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.100
 have to unite everything that would come 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.650
 being the waist with respect to the 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.510
 back I'm not going to stop much 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.820
 just face the rights 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.800
 notice, the only thing I did is sew if 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.600
 you want in this sector can 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.910
 place pockets and I'll tell you a 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.949
 little secret that helps me a lot has 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.070
 I liked notice how they can make 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.770
 an ordinary pocket notice 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.470
 here in this second step I surf and I 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.979
 all around I made a seam in 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.940
 this sector can empty this corner and 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:11.670
 to give back to them is already notice 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.500
 very beautiful all orange is painting 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.660
 there the drawing 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.820
 removing that end with a pin 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.100
 see how nice it looks 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.600
 all that sector to be able to apply the 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.460
 pocket that out there one has a lot 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.990
 problem with this sector once you already 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.090
 we have the pockets applied 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.920
 we face lateral stitching rights 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.230
 between legs that we have already done 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.810
 and look here I have it in another color that 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.020
 is what is missing the waist 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.790
 you simply cut a rectangle 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.530
 they divide it into four how to paste the 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.940
 Elastic is what we're going to see because 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.950
 it is also very simple this of course 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.180
 see what you are going to sew this 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.270
 part of always what I want is 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.220
 show him the elastic realize look at 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.100
 that I have exactly divided into 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.710
 four marked there in color and 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.050
 the same perform also that it divides into 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.960
 four everything that would be the 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.170
 elastic as it suits me to place this 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.860
 Elastic can hold a red mark 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:10.890
 with one from here and so on 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.110
 notice another place this center that I know 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.940
 what is with this and after having done 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.970
 the four sides 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:21.810
 just there you stretch and you 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.370
 waist is perfectly fine not 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.740
 has more produced on one side than on 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.660
 another but they are perfect so 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.120
 they already have the secret of the pocket of the 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.530
 false fly and also how to place 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.680
 the elastic at the waist 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.650
 the materials a minimum of half a meter 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.230
 Fabric that are 50 centimeters and elastic 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.880
 for the waist only so good 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.880
 very good I'm going with us 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:58.040
 but if he throws the duster he leaves 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.040
 misfortunes and gymnastics 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:14.610
 cans of tomato country 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:17.780
 antrum and top can of tomato under and one 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.780
 up the petista 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.820
 d
