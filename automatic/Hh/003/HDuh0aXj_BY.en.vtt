we're<00:04:53.660> gonna<00:04:53.960> use<00:04:54.169> a<00:04:54.199> rudder<00:04:56.199> 34%

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
we're gonna use a rudder 34%

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.460 
we're gonna use a rudder 34%
3.8<00:04:59.440> story<00:05:00.440> come<00:05:00.590> on<00:05:00.970> yeah<00:05:02.229> that's<00:05:03.229> pretty

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470

good
he's<00:05:04.190> down<00:05:05.080> so<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:07.570> probably<00:05:08.570> get<00:05:08.870> three

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
he's down so you probably get three

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.250 
he's down so you probably get three
minutes<00:05:09.949> out<00:05:10.039> of<00:05:10.160> this
