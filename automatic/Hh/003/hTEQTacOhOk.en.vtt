00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.289
 today we are going to make these cornets pops 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.300
 because they really are neither cake pops nor 

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:12.480
 nothing what we 're going to use chocolate in 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.010
 this case is chocolate and if we 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.710
 It costs days inn although the best would be 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.210
 put on cream and then we have decorated it with 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.269
 chocolate and confetti let's see how we 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.339
 we make to put the chocolate we have 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.519
 done these contests with baking paper 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:29.130
 how do we do them, we start from a 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.300
 square that square what we do is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.940
 throw it on itself forming a cone 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.579
 once we have the liner we put 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.280
 a small staple to hold 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.840
 because if they would not be done then once 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.680
 that we already have the staple what we do 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.440
 is to put a stick inside 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.240
 and push it down we leave only a 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.680
 tidy inside our color so that 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.530
 is filled with chocolate and then we do not know 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.110
 drop we tighten carefully down and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.530
 we put a zeal that 'binds the cone with the 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.829
 little stick 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.290
 I do not know if it looks like a centimeter or a 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.600
 centimeter and a half to the good stick 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.900
 Well, now we're always going to put them 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.460
 with chocolate we have heated chocolate 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.470
 in this case it happens year and you already know that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.330
 for this type of decorations we like 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.790
 make chocolate happens a year and we have 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.229
 put in a bottle this bottle 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.720
 we are going to use it now to fill 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.070
 our paper cones 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.470
 now we are filling with care 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.280
 for as far as we want 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.280
 Occupy high 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.300
 and we are always careful to hold a 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.600
 little we are filling the different 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.000
 cones we are filling the different cones 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.560
 Sometimes there until you see here escapes 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.360
 molded but good in general are 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.940
 well and then what we do is 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.580
 Wait for it to dry a little and empty 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.530
 that remain hollow 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.820
 to cut a little bit of time we have 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.040
 stuck in our cones in the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.960
 freezer what we do now wait 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.940
 like the base outside is cold 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.160
 and we emptied well you see we emptied the 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.800
 we have left it hollow now with 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.010
 be careful we are going to remove the paper we remove 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.830
 the paper and we have our pretty 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.380
 of hollow chocolate we can fill it 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.670
 we want on the side of what 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.690
 We want the kids to like it 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.690
 anywhere 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.880
 us so how are we going to want 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.220
 so that it is cool we put a little 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.560
 of alishing or we put another coverage 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.650
 of chocolate and good confetti 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.849
 filling with racing 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.849
 we do not have a mouthpiece 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.270
 of tube and now we are going to put 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.990
 above a little chocolate of 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:50.440
 liquid chocolate 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.440

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.360
 of ice cream we have put fondant and 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.730
 we have been clicking our different 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.830
 nice now to avoid seeing the 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.390
