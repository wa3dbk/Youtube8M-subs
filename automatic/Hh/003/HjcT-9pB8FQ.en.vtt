00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.940
 After a week break, I want you 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.160
 Today's and a fresh video 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.480
 I've been thinking about providing for the moment 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.889
 I do not really have that where 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.139
 I would say that I have to now 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.970
 necessarily show and thought of that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.310
 I'll just show you my current one 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.400
 Case for the iphone I bought myself 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.230
 have is used by school originals 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.630
 Such show is a real leather cover 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.099
 inside with fleece so I'm really from 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.869
 That's why the product is very enthusiastic about it 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.910
 So gets a very own review 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.890
 wish you much fun and see you 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.480
 then come back shortly afterwards 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.399
 So we slimcase it respectively 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.250
 rather the sleeve is called too 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.789
 iphones ran for the iphone 5 there is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.480
 also for the 4 or 4 it is real 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.719
 leather 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.160
 we see here outside is hand worked 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.100
 and is produced in Holland 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.949
 inside there is a fleece me 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.960
 just have it out and do it for you 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.460
 show that beautiful martin really 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.620
 different color combinations can 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.660
 between three different leather colors 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.489
 select outside and had still various 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.439
 Driving possibilities for the fleece them 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.240
 I think very nice set very nice 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.680
 accent here only side and bottom 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.180
 then with the colored and i put everything in 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.890
 black is really very much 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.840
 They are high quality processed 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.119
 no one somehow sewed the iphone 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.640
 That would really scratch the frame 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.590
 everything flows beautifully lined outside 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.939
 is the processing you are watching 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.920
 Stitches really good here on the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.380
 back you can see how they end up 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.400
 somehow soldered firmly or I know 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.200
 not how it was done 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.049
 So I use now has a week 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.189
 has now really very very satisfied 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.930
 not the super duper now 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.420
 cleaning effect on iphone 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.130
 you can see it here anyway or ever 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.210
 after how good you can see some fingers 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.020
 but tapsen so stay out of my 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.610
 The prerequisite was that I did that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.409
 if I did not use it nicely 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.540
 surely I think so too 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.759
 fall that there really reasonably 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.880
 well protected is sitting really nice 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.960
 tight but not too tight and I do 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.670
 It just so of course the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.750
 speakers up here look out of the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.490
 should i get the call and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.930
 similar that one hears that well because 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.209
 down here we have no holes or 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.530
 So you want to take out the whole thing 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.300
 actually quite classic as in the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.280
 all 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.870
 hollow and sleeves that one from thumb 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.790
 down light against pushes then comes 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.860
 Top bit out and must then draws 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.160
 out of here, which is still pretty good for me 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.090
 Like the school lettering easily and 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.710
 Decent from the front of me 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.470
 really a very clear recommendation for 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.180
 price is 34 euros is certainly not 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.530
 without, however, as I said hand 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.840
 made and I am full of quality 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.730
 So I can really get excited 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.550
 really only recommend you too 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.440
 you now iphone 4 or for shk website 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.480
 I also choose I grab the link 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.040
 Of course, just a description 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.710
 drop by and see his own 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.240
 assemble color combination 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.160
 So that's about iphones ran by djuric 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.890
 is like saying my opinion, the 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.390
 best help me it was just one 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.920
 I wanted that to happen when I did 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.140
 used to hold naked in hand 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.430
 not a clip case or so outside 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.740
 Do that most of the time 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.050
 Damage leaves the price 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.740
 certainly not without 34 euros 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.940
 but as said is handmade and 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.100
 comes from Holland and once upon a time 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.750
 therefore really worth the money at night 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.489
 is really very well processed 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.060
 and from me a very clear 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.680
 recommendation 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.790
 if you liked the video 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.190
 Of course, as always, I'm talking about one 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.840
 thumbs up and euro will be happy 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.230
 Have a nice day and see you 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.230
 next time 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.739
 Yes
