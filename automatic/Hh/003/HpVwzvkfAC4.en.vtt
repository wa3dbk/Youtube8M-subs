now if you watched the first part of
this<00:00:04.380> little<00:00:04.710> single<00:00:05.190> leg<00:00:05.640> standing<00:00:06.480> thing

this little single leg standing thing

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.410 
this little single leg standing thing
we're<00:00:07.109> headed<00:00:07.470> towards<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.420> biomechanical

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
we're headed towards a biomechanical

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.959 
we're headed towards a biomechanical
reality<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.440> an<00:00:10.530> awful<00:00:10.889> lot<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.099> your<00:00:11.340> clients

reality and an awful lot of your clients
which<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.630> valgus<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:14.099> associated<00:00:14.730> thing

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
which is valgus and the associated thing

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.700 
which is valgus and the associated thing
called<00:00:15.120> cue<00:00:15.360> angle<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.809> no<00:00:15.960> valgus<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.590> cue

called cue angle and no valgus and cue
angle<00:00:16.920> are<00:00:17.039> not<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.580> same<00:00:17.789> thing<00:00:18.180> why<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.869> all

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
angle are not the same thing why is all

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.380 
angle are not the same thing why is all
this<00:00:19.350> going<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.680> important<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.939> really

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this going to be important a it's really

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.140 
this going to be important a it's really
really<00:00:21.630> common<00:00:22.050> these<00:00:22.500> issues<00:00:22.920> B<00:00:23.250> we're

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
really common these issues B we're

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.390 
really common these issues B we're
leading<00:00:24.510> up<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.289> third<00:00:25.590> part<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.099> we're

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
leading up to a third part in this we're

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.099 
leading up to a third part in this we're
talking<00:00:26.730> about<00:00:26.880> why<00:00:27.060> single<00:00:27.510> leg<00:00:27.630> squats<00:00:27.960> are

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
talking about why single leg squats are

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.189 
talking about why single leg squats are
a<00:00:28.140> terrible<00:00:28.470> assessment<00:00:29.810> they're<00:00:30.810> not<00:00:30.960> part

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
a terrible assessment they're not part

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.870 
a terrible assessment they're not part
of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> biomechanical<00:00:31.980> reality<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.669> you're

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
of the biomechanical reality that you're

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.310 
of the biomechanical reality that you're
built<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.329> don't<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.690> me<00:00:33.780> wrong<00:00:33.840> lots<00:00:34.200> of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
built to do don't get me wrong lots of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.720 
built to do don't get me wrong lots of
people<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.770> do<00:00:35.010> them<00:00:35.160> doesn't<00:00:35.520> mean<00:00:35.610> it's

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
people can do them doesn't mean it's

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.310 
people can do them doesn't mean it's
good<00:00:35.880> form<00:00:36.149> doesn't<00:00:36.480> mean<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.719> viable<00:00:36.960> after

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
good form doesn't mean it's viable after

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889 
good form doesn't mean it's viable after
a<00:00:37.590> certain<00:00:37.950> degree<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.790> motion<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.719> here's

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
a certain degree of motion but here's

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.150 
a certain degree of motion but here's
where<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.110> must<00:00:40.320> start<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.680> must<00:00:40.890> start<00:00:41.070> with

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
where we must start we must start with

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
where we must start we must start with
this<00:00:41.879> idea<00:00:42.530> of<00:00:43.530> valgus<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:45.090> here's<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.079> line<00:00:46.379> I

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
this idea of valgus so here's a line I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.080 
this idea of valgus so here's a line I
mean<00:00:46.710> I've<00:00:46.920> got<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.309> line<00:00:47.820> right<00:00:48.030> here

that separation in there is creates a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749 
that separation in there is creates a
normal<00:01:22.140> valgus<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:23.250> other<00:01:23.430> words<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> looks

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
normal valgus in other words it looks

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.120 
normal valgus in other words it looks
like<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> knee<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.840> bent<00:01:25.110> inward<00:01:25.470> headed

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130

towards a knock kneed kind of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.080 
towards a knock kneed kind of
relationship<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.520> normal<00:01:29.970> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
relationship but it's a normal so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.700 
relationship but it's a normal so
there's<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.299> normal<00:01:30.659> amount<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.900> algis<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.470> any

there's a normal amount of algis in any

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.200 
there's a normal amount of algis in any
human<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.130> has<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> neck<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.640> their<00:01:32.759> femur

okay<00:01:33.920> now<00:01:35.329> what<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.479> happen<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> variety<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
okay now what can happen do a variety of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.600 
okay now what can happen do a variety of
things<00:01:38.900> can<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:40.020> an<00:01:40.110> increase<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.710> Vegas<00:01:41.130> where

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
things can be an increase in Vegas where

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.760 
things can be an increase in Vegas where
this<00:01:41.759> foot<00:01:42.450> appears<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.140> tibia<00:01:43.470> appears<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
this foot appears the tibia appears to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.200 
this foot appears the tibia appears to
be<00:01:43.829> more<00:01:44.009> lateral<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:44.759> happens<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
be more lateral and what happens to the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.859 
be more lateral and what happens to the
process<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:47.030> if<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.270> made<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
process is this if we made this the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.429 
process is this if we made this the
quadricep<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.750> bring<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.930> down<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
quadricep and bring this down here and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.899 
quadricep and bring this down here and
now<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.799> line<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.040> representing<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
now this line is representing the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.929 
now this line is representing the
quadriceps<00:01:54.540> attachment<00:01:55.140> along<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.619> femur

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
quadriceps attachment along the femur

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.270 
quadriceps attachment along the femur
stops<00:01:56.939> off<00:01:57.210> at<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.659> patella<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:59.070> goes

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
stops off at the patella and then goes

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.280 
stops off at the patella and then goes
over<00:01:59.610> to<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> tibial<00:02:00.479> tuberosity<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.110> see

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
over to the tibial tuberosity you see

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.100 
over to the tibial tuberosity you see
this<00:02:01.409> blue<00:02:01.799> angle<00:02:02.310> would<00:02:03.180> represent<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.810> cue

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
this blue angle would represent the cue

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.910 
this blue angle would represent the cue
angle<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> cue<00:02:05.549> angle<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> function<00:02:06.750> of

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
angle so the cue angle is a function of

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.010 
angle so the cue angle is a function of
influenced<00:02:07.920> by<00:02:08.069> if<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.759> will<00:02:08.940> though<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:09.989> a

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
influenced by if you will though not a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.809 
influenced by if you will though not a
valgus<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.770> exists<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.190> someone<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.700> can

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
valgus that exists in someone you can

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.870 
valgus that exists in someone you can
also<00:02:11.970> imagine<00:02:12.360> that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
also imagine that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.760 
also imagine that
August<00:02:13.180> would<00:02:13.690> change<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:14.050> lot<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.320> things<00:02:14.530> like

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
August would change a lot of things like

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.980 
August would change a lot of things like
potential<00:02:15.190> wear<00:02:15.370> on<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.610> knee<00:02:15.990> potential

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
potential wear on the knee potential

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.870 
potential wear on the knee potential
influence<00:02:17.350> on<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.500> medial<00:02:17.710> collateral

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
influence on the medial collateral

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.870 
influence on the medial collateral
ligament<00:02:18.880> but<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:20.470> also<00:02:20.680> influences<00:02:21.520> this

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
ligament but it also influences this

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.750 
ligament but it also influences this
degree<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.540> bend<00:02:23.020> of<00:02:23.230> forces<00:02:23.980> because<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
degree of bend of forces because the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.400 
degree of bend of forces because the
muscle<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.090> all<00:02:25.210> about<00:02:25.420> force<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.050> force<00:02:26.200> of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
muscle is all about force the force of

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.910 
muscle is all about force the force of
tension<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:28.720> angle<00:02:28.990> here<00:02:29.440> creates<00:02:29.860> a

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
tension so this angle here creates a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.530 
tension so this angle here creates a
resultant<00:02:30.490> by<00:02:31.330> which<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:32.100> patella<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:33.540> skewed

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
resultant by which the patella is skewed

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.540 
resultant by which the patella is skewed
or<00:02:34.750> forced<00:02:35.320> laterally<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.040> some<00:02:36.250> people<00:02:36.460> call

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
or forced laterally and some people call

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.980 
or forced laterally and some people call
that<00:02:36.580> lateral<00:02:37.000> tracking<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.630> can<00:02:37.810> have

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
that lateral tracking and that can have

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.720 
that lateral tracking and that can have
a<00:02:38.020> variety<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.560> influences<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.430> as<00:02:39.550> well

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
a variety of influences in that as well

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.960 
a variety of influences in that as well
but<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.960> more<00:02:41.230> valgus<00:02:41.920> someone<00:02:42.280> has<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.790> more

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
but the more valgus someone has the more

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.840 
but the more valgus someone has the more
the<00:02:43.060> patella<00:02:43.390> is<00:02:43.650> asked<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.920> ride<00:02:45.190> outward

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
the patella is asked to ride outward

the cue angle is also influenced by not

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.050 
the cue angle is also influenced by not
only<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.950> amount<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.400> valgus<00:02:57.820> in<00:02:57.970> the

need to take into consideration before

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.200 
need to take into consideration before
we<00:03:08.650> start<00:03:08.950> exercising<00:03:09.730> someone<00:03:10.060> with<00:03:10.180> a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
considerable valgus and i see it on all

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.980 
considerable valgus and i see it on all

intolerant<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.930> those<00:03:44.470> forces<00:03:44.740> and<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.820> to

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
intolerant of those forces and that to

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.300 
intolerant of those forces and that to
me<00:03:46.180> honestly<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.690> malpractice<00:03:47.080> not<00:03:48.070> under

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
me honestly is malpractice not under

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.710 
me honestly is malpractice not under
thinking<00:03:48.730> it's<00:03:48.850> all<00:03:48.970> about<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.300> exercises

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
thinking it's all about the exercises

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.860 
thinking it's all about the exercises
you<00:03:49.930> do<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.650> cart<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.160> cardio<00:03:51.550> you<00:03:51.670> get<00:03:52.030> the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
you do the cart the cardio you get the

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.840 
you do the cart the cardio you get the
calories<00:03:53.709> you<00:03:53.740> burn<00:03:54.010> at<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.280> expense<00:03:54.700> of

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
calories you burn at the expense of

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.090 
calories you burn at the expense of
these<00:03:54.940> joints<00:03:55.450> guys<00:03:56.440> when<00:03:56.680> your<00:03:56.800> joints<00:03:57.040> are

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
these joints guys when your joints are

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.320 
these joints guys when your joints are
gone<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.370> don't<00:03:57.520> get<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:57.700> do<00:03:57.790> any<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.090> fun

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
gone you don't get to do any of that fun

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.220 
gone you don't get to do any of that fun
stuff<00:03:58.540> anymore

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
stuff anymore

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.050 
stuff anymore
there<00:03:59.830> are<00:03:59.950> things<00:04:00.190> to<00:04:00.280> take<00:04:00.520> care<00:04:00.550> of<00:04:00.730> first

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
there are things to take care of first

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.020 
there are things to take care of first
and<00:04:01.510> those<00:04:02.110> things<00:04:02.380> include<00:04:02.800> intra<00:04:03.370> joint

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
and those things include intra joint

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.720 
and those things include intra joint
integrity<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:05.140> understanding<00:04:06.070> joint<00:04:06.280> forces

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
integrity and understanding joint forces

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.430 
integrity and understanding joint forces
so<00:04:07.330> there's<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.840> biggest<00:04:08.170> thing<00:04:08.320> to

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
so there's the biggest thing to

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.110 
so there's the biggest thing to
understand<00:04:08.890> right<00:04:09.070> here<00:04:09.250> from<00:04:09.370> this<00:04:09.520> valgus

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
understand right here from this valgus

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.870 
understand right here from this valgus
and<00:04:10.330> how<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:10.930> can<00:04:11.020> progressively<00:04:11.230> change<00:04:11.950> the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
and how it can progressively change the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.490 
and how it can progressively change the
forces<00:04:13.330> that<00:04:13.360> creates<00:04:13.810> in<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.020> knee<00:04:14.110> itself

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
forces that creates in the knee itself

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.560 
forces that creates in the knee itself
but<00:04:14.680> also<00:04:14.890> how<00:04:15.700> that<00:04:15.880> affects<00:04:16.150> this<00:04:16.299> thing

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
but also how that affects this thing

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.360 
but also how that affects this thing
that<00:04:17.080> we've<00:04:17.260> come<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.500> know<00:04:17.650> as<00:04:17.770> a<00:04:17.799> cute<00:04:18.160> angle

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
that we've come to know as a cute angle

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.300 
that we've come to know as a cute angle
q<00:04:18.940> for<00:04:19.120> quadricep<00:04:19.420> and<00:04:19.750> how<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.560> changes<00:04:21.130> the

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
q for quadricep and how that changes the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.300 
q for quadricep and how that changes the
influence<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:22.030> alters<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.140> forces<00:04:23.560> on<00:04:24.010> the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
influence the alters the forces on the

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.810 
influence the alters the forces on the
patella<00:04:24.550> femoral<00:04:24.729> joint<00:04:25.000> and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
patella femoral joint and

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.210 
patella femoral joint and
of<00:04:25.910> itself
