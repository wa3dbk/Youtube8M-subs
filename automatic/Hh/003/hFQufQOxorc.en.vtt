00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
towards the second last cut in the young

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000 
towards the second last cut in the young
in<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.880> the<00:00:14.880> young<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.800> case

in this I the young but this is the case

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.759 
in this I the young but this is the case
of<00:00:17.250> course<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.539> cranky<00:00:18.960> arm<00:00:20.330> which<00:00:21.330> were

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
of course of the cranky arm which were

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.820 
of course of the cranky arm which were
replicating<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.580> one<00:00:23.850> here<00:00:24.210> which<00:00:24.420> has

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
replicating this one here which has

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.740 
replicating this one here which has
edges<00:00:25.830> all<00:00:25.980> flogged<00:00:26.340> out<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.880> holes<00:00:27.119> broken

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
edges all flogged out the holes broken

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.530 
edges all flogged out the holes broken
through<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:30.119> that's<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.539> we're<00:00:30.750> now<00:00:32.420> this<00:00:33.420> is

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
through and that's so we're now this is

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.940 
through and that's so we're now this is
number<00:00:33.660> two<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.230> series<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.649> we're

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
number two of that series and we're

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.010 
number two of that series and we're
machining<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:35.760> once<00:00:36.660> we're<00:00:36.870> finished

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
machining this up once we're finished

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.979 
machining this up once we're finished
boring<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.129> size<00:00:38.700> we're<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> make

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
boring this to size we're going to make

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.330 
boring this to size we're going to make
a<00:00:40.050> plug<00:00:40.550> bolted<00:00:41.550> onto<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.379> table<00:00:43.379> we're<00:00:44.219> going

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
a plug bolted onto the table we're going

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.799 
a plug bolted onto the table we're going
to<00:00:44.430> set<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> eye<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
to set the eye on it and then we go to

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.940 
to set the eye on it and then we go to
rotate<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.590> until<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:49.170> correct

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
rotate it until we get it to the correct

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.580 
rotate it until we get it to the correct
direction<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.239> run<00:00:51.449> through<00:00:51.899> I

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
direction so that we can run through I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.110 
direction so that we can run through I
do<00:00:53.780> do<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> groove<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> holes<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
do do the groove do all the holes and to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.569 
do do the groove do all the holes and to
do<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> big<00:00:57.629> big<00:00:58.170> hole<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.590> well<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.430> once

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
do the big big hole as well and once

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.310 
do the big big hole as well and once
we've<00:00:59.730> got<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.940> will<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.570> pivoted<00:01:01.199> on

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
we've got that will be up to pivoted on

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.969 
we've got that will be up to pivoted on
that<00:01:01.559> point<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.449> zero<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:04.739> from

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
that point and zero it in and then from

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.590 
that point and zero it in and then from
there<00:01:05.040> everything<00:01:05.489> will<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:06.030> according<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
there everything will go according to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.570 
there everything will go according to
the<00:01:06.720> drawings<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.260> I've<00:01:07.380> made<00:01:07.560> we're<00:01:08.400> just

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580

the drawings that I've made we're just
heading<00:01:08.880> down<00:01:09.060> towards<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> last<00:01:09.900> one<00:01:10.250> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
heading down towards the last one and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.480 
heading down towards the last one and
while<00:01:11.790> we're<00:01:11.970> at<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.510> course<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:14.159> added

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
while we're at this of course the added

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.890 
while we're at this of course the added
value<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:16.820> is<00:01:17.820> producing<00:01:18.390> some<00:01:18.630> steel

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
value here is is producing some steel

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.950 
value here is is producing some steel
wool<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.970> we've<00:01:20.970> got<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> fair<00:01:21.360> bit<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.750> here

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
wool and we've got a fair bit of it here

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.480 
wool and we've got a fair bit of it here

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
well so that's the added value of this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.800 
well so that's the added value of this
job<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.470> about<00:01:28.710> finished<00:01:29.159> now

I made when I was at school at trade
school<00:04:35.070> this<00:04:36.070> is<00:04:36.250> another<00:04:36.490> another<00:04:37.150> little

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
school this is another another little

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.790 
school this is another another little
fellow<00:04:37.750> here<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:39.370> I'm<00:04:39.490> not<00:04:39.640> quite<00:04:39.880> sure<00:04:40.800> what

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
fellow here that I'm not quite sure what

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.330 
fellow here that I'm not quite sure what
it<00:04:41.920> is<00:04:41.950> it's<00:04:42.310> at<00:04:42.460> T<00:04:42.790> in<00:04:43.410> g<00:04:45.240> or<00:04:46.240> t<00:04:46.300> ng<00:04:47.020> one<00:04:47.320> not<00:04:47.500> 155

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
it is it's at T in g or t ng one not 155

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.670 
it is it's at T in g or t ng one not 155
and<00:04:49.180> this<00:04:49.360> little<00:04:49.570> bloke<00:04:49.870> here<00:04:50.110> instead<00:04:50.530> of

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
and this little bloke here instead of

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.770 
and this little bloke here instead of
what<00:04:50.800> he<00:04:50.950> is<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.400> so<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.330> can<00:04:52.450> see<00:04:52.510> the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
what he is and so you can see the

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.350 
what he is and so you can see the
proportion<00:04:53.350> Thea<00:04:53.590> answer<00:04:54.550> them<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.850> smallest

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
proportion Thea answer them the smallest

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.150 
proportion Thea answer them the smallest
to<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.960> largest<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:58.150> yeah<00:04:59.140> that's<00:04:59.320> about<00:04:59.500> all

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
to the largest and yeah that's about all

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.790 
to the largest and yeah that's about all
for<00:05:00.520> this<00:05:00.610> corner<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.210> then<00:05:01.300> we've<00:05:01.450> got<00:05:01.800> this

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
for this corner and then we've got this

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.060 
for this corner and then we've got this
bearing<00:05:03.580> housing<00:05:04.060> here<00:05:04.590> that<00:05:05.590> needs<00:05:05.830> some

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
bearing housing here that needs some

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.070 
bearing housing here that needs some
work<00:05:06.280> done<00:05:06.520> on<00:05:06.580> it<00:05:06.730> and<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.480> few<00:05:07.810> other<00:05:07.960> things

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
work done on it and a few other things

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.650 
work done on it and a few other things
over<00:05:08.650> in<00:05:08.770> there<00:05:08.980> in<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.670> lathe<00:05:09.850> area<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.540> be

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
over in there in the lathe area to be

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.800 
over in there in the lathe area to be
machined<00:05:11.110> up<00:05:11.760> so<00:05:12.760> there<00:05:12.910> we<00:05:13.000> go<00:05:13.030> so<00:05:13.390> that<00:05:13.540> says
