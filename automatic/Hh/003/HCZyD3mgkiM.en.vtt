 sensations 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.990
 is renting a rollover starring the power of force 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:12.839
 the story of this sequel revolves around the uprising of 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.759
 starkiller against country 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.759
 everything starts to have the vision that beautiful will end with us 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.380
 the plot plays give us fantasized I know whether or not we are a clone of the apprentice 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.439
 says the force still follow us 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.630
 our added worry will be finding fasting who has been captured 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.850
 by the bounty hunter following the orders of life 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.610
 in order to have them again to face us with spin and tibán 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.510
 but the plans to sell go beyond 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.710
 perfect a training system to create the warrior yes definitive 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.220
 the game tells a lesser rich story than the first 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.180
 too simple in comparison 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.090
 it shows in the locations of the game 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.850
 In fact, we will move from the town, from the physical facilities to 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.780
 air facilities and another planet 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.060
 We will do a super quick help to ask who we are 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.000
 and we will return to the ship to contribute 20 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.820
 as far as gameplay is concerned the game follows the same bases could 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.490
 attack with two lightsabers 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.480
 laughter 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.000
 electrocutar with rays in for long distances detach from enemies that 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.090
 they surround us pousá the mental power 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.380
 as of august caesar power 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.840
 all these movements can be improved 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.780
 but only in power and scope missing greater purchase parity 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.530
 as in the first game we can find it only promises that we 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.610
 they will allow to change of suit and to crystallize 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.040
 each color jose own functions 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.320
 how to gather more life from undermining friends doors power 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.500
 the graphic section is more remarkable 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.080
 now like minutes in which it shows a greater use of criticisms of 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.850
 space design projects 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.900
 and above all the elevation of people 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.550
 we found new enemies in addition 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.980
 of the imperial troop 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.909
 the expo is habitual of the saga 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:05.750
 and the dubbing 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.909
 it's pretty good 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.629
 the power of the force to two is a good game but that nevertheless take advantage 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.329
 little all its potential 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.199
 It is less original than the first and above all it is very short 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.029
