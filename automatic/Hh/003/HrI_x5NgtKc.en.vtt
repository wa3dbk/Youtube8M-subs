unstable<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.890> card<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.869> maybe<00:01:22.049> my

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
unstable for this card I think maybe my

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.480 
unstable for this card I think maybe my
video<00:01:22.619> might<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.009> had<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.369> an

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
video might have had a bit of an

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.850 
video might have had a bit of an
influence<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.659> don't<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.290> think<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> i

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
influence on it but I don't I think it i

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.539 
influence on it but I don't I think it i
sold<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> completely<00:01:27.000> right<00:01:27.270> time<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
sold it at the completely right time and

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.399 
sold it at the completely right time and
you<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.700> i<00:01:29.729> think<00:01:29.820> i<00:01:30.150> made<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.509> really<00:01:31.140> really

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you know i think i made a really really

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
you know i think i made a really really
nice<00:01:31.650> profit<00:01:32.159> which<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.880> lucky<00:01:33.060> as

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
nice profit which was kind of lucky as

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.109 
nice profit which was kind of lucky as
well<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:35.490> know<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.700> don't<00:01:35.909> often

20-30 k over its average price which is
kind<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> insane<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
kind of insane because they I think the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.340 
kind of insane because they I think the
maximum<00:01:44.220> by<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.390> lowest<00:01:45.750> by<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.079> when<00:01:46.320> I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
maximum by so the lowest by now when I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
maximum by so the lowest by now when I
was<00:01:46.530> selling<00:01:46.799> was<00:01:46.950> 90<00:01:47.310> k<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.240> obviously

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
was selling was 90 k so obviously

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.870 
was selling was 90 k so obviously
someone<00:01:48.810> sort<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.079> certainly<00:01:49.430> 4500<00:01:50.430> been<00:01:50.610> and

I think he just got to get over it and
relist<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.620> for<00:02:23.799> oversea<00:02:24.099> cheaper<00:02:24.689> you<00:02:25.689> know

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
lot as well with these cards like I I

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.020 
lot as well with these cards like I I
think<00:02:32.019> I've<00:02:32.109> reposted<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.739> Edgar<00:02:33.040> about<00:02:33.370> two

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
think I've reposted that Edgar about two

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.030 
think I've reposted that Edgar about two
times<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.540> three<00:02:34.750> times<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.260> he<00:02:35.829> eventually

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
times of three times and he eventually

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.440 
times of three times and he eventually
sold<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:36.909> you<00:02:37.359> know<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.510> think<00:02:37.599> it's<00:02:37.870> all<00:02:37.989> about

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.780 
I think that you know the silver marker
has<00:03:17.650> become<00:03:18.239> almost<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.840> know<00:03:20.370> quite<00:03:21.370> easy<00:03:21.609> to

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
has become almost you know quite easy to

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.270 
has become almost you know quite easy to
make<00:03:22.090> profit<00:03:22.449> in<00:03:22.569> its<00:03:23.530> kind<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:23.949> a<00:03:24.010> lot<00:03:24.159> more

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
make profit in its kind of a lot more

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.189 
make profit in its kind of a lot more
harder<00:03:24.609> to<00:03:24.729> find<00:03:24.909> the<00:03:25.030> deals<00:03:25.269> I<00:03:25.540> must<00:03:26.049> admit

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:26.199 
harder to find the deals I must admit

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.699 
harder to find the deals I must admit
that<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:28.209> know<00:03:28.329> them<00:03:28.479> the<00:03:28.599> Gold's<00:03:28.989> but<00:03:29.229> I<00:03:29.409> just

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
that you know them the Gold's but I just

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.869 
that you know them the Gold's but I just
think<00:03:29.799> there's<00:03:30.129> a<00:03:30.220> lot<00:03:30.340> more<00:03:30.400> profit<00:03:30.729> to<00:03:30.790> be

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
think there's a lot more profit to be

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.879 
think there's a lot more profit to be
made<00:03:30.909> in<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.269> server<00:03:31.479> market<00:03:31.540> because<00:03:32.139> it's

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
made in the server market because it's

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.270 
made in the server market because it's
not<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.129> most<00:03:33.280> often<00:03:33.790> market<00:03:35.099> you<00:03:36.099> know<00:03:36.220> you

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
could probably like that infrared glow

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.259 
could probably like that infrared glow
that<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:39.280> know<00:03:39.400> if<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.729> was<00:03:39.819> a<00:03:39.849> goal<00:03:40.060> play

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
that you know if that was a goal play

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.420 
that you know if that was a goal play
that<00:03:40.419> would<00:03:40.479> be<00:03:40.599> going<00:03:40.900> for<00:03:41.169> you<00:03:41.739> know<00:03:41.829> ATK

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
about 200 k which kind of ridiculous

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.439
