00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.689
 aerodynamics is the science that studies 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.119
 the air flow that invests the 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.940
 car is on its outer surface 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.440
 that you are all the internal components 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.430
 snorkel cooling vents 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 radiators 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.010
 the hard dynamics for a car of 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.570
 formula 1 is essentially the element 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.460
 most important by keeping well 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.610
 performance this importance that is 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.059
 grown in the last probably 20 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.440
 30 years for various reasons both for 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.019
 technological reasons they have seen 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.150
 the evolution of software such as cfd i 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.610
 tools like the wind tunnel either 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.130
 due to limitations they have seen 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.509
 to control and regulate development 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.670
 of other components of the car such as 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.619
 for example the engine has been frozen e 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.539
 on which the interventions can be made 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.380
 like the electronics that have been frozen 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.880
 and on which the sole supplier or 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.920
 provides a product applies to all 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.479
 team or for example also the change that is 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.470
 frozen for a number of races 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.710
 so the aerodynamics saw ground 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.380
 fertile to develop all parts 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.259
 the car was also science 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.970
 which allowed us to refine components 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.600
 like discharges also different fronts 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.600
 regulatory changes 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.690
 by importance it is defined as the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.420
 vertical load 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.590
 that the elements transmit towards the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.960
 low to the car 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.610
 lift is the opposite of downforce 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.420
 then the vertical load of elements 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.290
 transmit cars upwards 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.580
 the formula 1 let's live thanks to the 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.560
 downforce that all the components 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.630
 transmit airplanes and the opposite 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.849
 in their thanks to the importance that 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.849
 allows you to stay 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.670
 the resistance to advancement also 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.680
 defined drag and set aside 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.880
 resultant of the forces he opposes 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.900
 to the advancement of the car 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.730
 typically cars of formula 1 year 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.810
 the efficiency value they can 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.170
 go from the old 3.5 to the four or even 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.970
 more we say and express the relationship 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.860
 between the downforce that the load 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.329
 vertical than resistance 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.019
 at the advancement then load that yes 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.019
 opposes the car 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.180
 downforce basically 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.000
 equivalent to 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.030
 therefore, the sum of all 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.730
 resulting pressure applied to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.209
 body of the car that allow it 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.920
 general of the grip with the ground 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.310
 having little ordinary charge with means 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.200
 have a vertical load on the ground 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.050
 reduced in curve 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.760
 this is a limit because it reduces 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.400
 the forces that the pneumatic ticket can 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.170
 exchange with the land and then of 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.740
 done reduces travel speeds 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.980
 in the curve 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.870
 hand in hand with little downforce e 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.310
 generally copied has a low 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.660
 resistance to advancement and therefore 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.600
 then brings the car to have some 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.930
 finally very straight speed 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.280
 we have seen in these years for example 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.170
 car like the red bull have a 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.690
 high or dynamic load and therefore 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.940
 high speed cornering but have 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.820
 the two top speeds contained compared to 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.500
 other TVs we have also seen other teams 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.750
 such as the force india avere 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.430
 of the high top speeds clearly 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.430
 paid by a small load in the ass 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.610
 for us technicians the dynamic is 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.380
 mainly one of the tools 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.410
 main to generate performance for 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.540
 but a formula 1 for Ferrari is 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.850
 one is an important vehicle of 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.650
 technology transfer from cars 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.450
 racing to road cars that 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.370
 happens on different fronts on a front 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.830
 of methods transfer methodologies 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.260
 work then tools on a 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.170
 transfer of know-how and transfer 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.640
 of technical solutions as they can 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.880
 be for example that of mobile wings 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.930
 that you can see in road cars 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.470
 the aerodynamics the cars are important 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.000
 street has grown up I would say hand in hand 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.830
 along with the importance of dynamics 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.440
 in the formula 1 cars and saw the 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.340
 its climax in the recent f12 berlinetta 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.340
 and the ferrari
