00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
 today bbva and her family are going to spend the day 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.639
 in the countryside 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.900
 let's see trees birds flowers 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.900
 bees 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:23.850
 that we can see no dinosaur here 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.150
 start the forest center we have arrived 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.080
 dad pitt you forget to fuck her with me or 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.080
 not going 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.530
 very easy on the map he says he has to 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.410
 have a signal that indicates the beginning 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.330
 of the path so well for you and yours 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.750
 in the end he has forgotten to take the 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.750
 food 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.579
 the pad tells us you see something interesting 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:02.109
 the trees that he ran to the best is 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.960
 that you do not pay attention to well man and I'm going to 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:09.490
 fix many things clear and I continue 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.330
 without seeing anything that have been found 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.270
 traces who has left those traces 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.549
 rogue dinosaurs 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.250
 how are they going to be dinosaur footprints 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.490
 we could follow them and discover from whom 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.490
 are 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.290
 but we must speak softly so as not to 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.450
 scare the animals 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.450
 my mommy church 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:40.090
 those who are following the footsteps 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.110
 traces are from a little bird 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.260

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.150
