00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.050
 hi Guys 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.300
 Today I show you something like her 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.570
 can prepare if you're in 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.669
 a diet phase since or lose weight 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.739
 you want it then so that you in the evening 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:36.610
 do not eat carbohydrates should you 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:39.250
 shall Atens resort to protein and there 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.530
 there is a recipe that I have too 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.410
 only found today it's called kilo 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.410
 kick that means so much that you're there 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.620
 stay overnight and the evening is the 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.929
 cranking up fat burning and I'll show 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.789
 you guys today how that works 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.219
 I do, however, in duplicate 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.609
 because I need more because we are too 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:03.249
 meanwhile, and also know more 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.980
 I had a lot left now 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:08.890
 protein we just go in one 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.580
 bowl and she does please stiff 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.710
 beat 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.510
 I 'll do it now with my kitchenaid 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.610
 And you could be craftsman too 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.990
 your kitchen machines make you one 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.110
 of the struck stiff then I'll get 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.110
 you 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.760
 I've already said that's right 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.600
 yes it looks very whole right now 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.080
 nice solid with snow that is 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.570
 Perfect 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:52.290
 next you need that you do that 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.970
 just see it once on the page 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.360
 Hoppe as you can see now you can see that 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.190
 now well used lean quark and indeed 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.830
 I'm so big again 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.290
 bought knife when you are half 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:13.170
 only picks also makes a 250 grams 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:15.360
 but I have now just so and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:22.680
 this lean quark comes one 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:25.590
 squeezed lemons and if you 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.290
 then you want to be able to do all that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.030
 sweet and you know from mine 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.560
 other videos I'm taking at the moment 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.180
 this super six and that is with me 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.160
 already so very fine that is how 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.590
 already like dust on it was therefore not 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.170
 roughly granite or so and there I try 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.760
 now with two tablespoons and see 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.769
 you then later the revealing enough 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.769
 is so the whole thing is being touched now 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:07.450
 I try the easy times I do 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.920
 a little sweet and indeed take 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.180
 I eat again 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.130
 So those are three tablespoon 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.410
 sugar then does not need to have fear 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:24.780
 So he has a lot less 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.780
 kilocalories the correctness sugar so 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.440
 Now the whole thing is just going to be over 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.440
 assembled 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:58.849
 Now you lift those snow or 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.849
 the chips goes down this shell 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.410
 Loose easily under the quark mass 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.410
 elevated 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:40.419
 then it will be flowery dessert if 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:42.470
 her that evening is before you develop 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.830
 and then there are the consequences 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:51.350
 melt away and it is now 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:54.590
 same evening and is with all 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.229
 quite easy airy memory first 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:02.600
 it already hurts is that is a 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:03.770
 eternal dream and right now we all 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.080
 still know that 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.410
 We are very strict 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.050
 our the edlinger and yet have 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.930
 sometimes you want something extraordinary 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.080
 and sweet and it has me here 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.550
 easy and I still do it here 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.220
 I have quite a bit of the neighbor 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.990
 got great tables and I do 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.289
 then such a layer and glass and 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:32.210
 be honest and always glass 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:37.160
 fruits and quark this foam 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:41.210
 layers so to speak to each other with 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:46.669
 I try everything I am myself 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:52.240
 curious how it tastes and I say 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.240
 I know that's really a dream 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:03.289
 the name karima the logic that is 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:07.639
 actually that foam or that 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:10.129
 that you are not worthy of this 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:15.529
 would have to screw heavenly quark or 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:18.169
 So I think it's a bit cool 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:21.559
 lemony it has a sweetness through this 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.539
 sugar and it's easy and with 

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:25.039
 safety makes it really full 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.769
 and that should be eaten in style right away 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:29.419
 and if you decorate it nicely 

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:32.079
 look that I can handle this now 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:35.179
 give yourself a nice conclusion to it 

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:39.079
 and I hope in all the tumble 

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:42.699
 I'm almost imitating pounds 

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:42.699
 bye euro martina
