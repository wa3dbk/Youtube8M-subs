00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.780
 Yes 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.800
 winter is coming remember the constraints pass 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.230
 first frost 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.030
 Well, but the lion but mbi sheets in particular 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.550
 diesel drivers this mile 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.100
 run into problems run 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.519
 do steady work believe at low 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.619
 temperatures it has to do with yourself 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.660
 features and quality of diesel 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.670
 fuel 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.000
 the presence of initialing favors 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.510
 formation in the fuel system 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.120
 impassable places 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.210
 due to blockage certain for centuries in 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.020
 features this grid appears 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.270
 fuel filter fuel attach 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.780
 paraffin stick to each other and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.629
 thus creating an obstruction from 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.690
 fuel paraffin diz formation 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.140
 fuel 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.019
 occurs mainly at a temperature of -5 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.690
 degrees lower therefore during this period 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.119
 appropriate to use for 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.950
 prevent such phenomena here this 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.229
 heater 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.060
 production of Belarus which 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.240
 ensures smooth operation 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.070
 believe or as heating 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.600
 element is used by the device 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.950
 diaper avaya ceramics 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:37.509
 rts posistor heating device 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.509
 Ashman Church 014 look still it consists 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.640
 physical easter 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.640
 advance clouds 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.420
 heater your bullets on aluminum 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.420
 housing 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:26.900
 u have two pairs of unions 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.600
 by 8 10 millimeters and fittings 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.870
 can connect 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.960
 both on top and on the side there is somewhere 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:44.870
 apply stub somewhere that is not 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:47.410
 Like on car safety 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.410
 block 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.660
 wires 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:10.490
 great mount honestly included 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:20.390
 additional choke effect 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:23.390
 see two switches clamps size 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.390
 the size 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.840
 heating 0 then I would now 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.840
 we'll see 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.219
 a few words about the heater mean he 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:04.099
 has 2 heating elements i.e. 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:06.170
 it turns out that operates in can 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:11.480
 work in stand up mode and in mode 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.319
 turbo accommodation car owners if 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.389
 strong 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.539
 low temperature can turn on mode 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.269
 turbo 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.560
 that is, you are included in the work 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.560
 heating elements 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.340
 bottom of the heater 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.050
 there is a drain plug 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.130
 precipitation which formed dice 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.460
 fuel and 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.620
 different foreign matter 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.550
 that is, it can be periodically produced 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.550
 cleaning up 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:54.250
 thermal heater Severs csh-001 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.440
 can be used for both cars 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.950
 cars for trucks and 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.940

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.120
 connection diagram 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.490
 available in the hold instruction 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:12.970
 see if it means a century 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:18.870
 plus connects to standard mode 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.870
 second mode turbo mass body 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.559
 if you have any questions about 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:31.379
 use and purpose flow

 contact info in description 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:49.469
 there are several flow models 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:52.259
 Satsivi heaters with chain page 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:55.289
 so you can subscribe to the channel 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:57.919
