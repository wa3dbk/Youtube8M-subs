00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
Pelin and I've always worried that the

Pelin and I've always worried that the
weight<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> poem<00:00:59.280> actually<00:00:59.430> sort<00:00:59.850> of

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
weight of the poem actually sort of

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:09.080 
weight of the poem actually sort of
pulls<00:01:00.120> down<00:01:00.329> behind<00:01:00.570> his<00:01:00.899> ears<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:08.090> one

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
pulls down behind his ears so that's one

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.399 
pulls down behind his ears so that's one
of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> things<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> think<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.080> really

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of the things that I think is really

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.350 
of the things that I think is really
really<00:01:10.650> lovely<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.729> other<00:01:11.880> thing<00:01:12.180> is

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
really lovely but the other thing is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.359 
really lovely but the other thing is
bits<00:01:12.990> are<00:01:13.229> always<00:01:13.500> made<00:01:13.770> out<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.189> stainless

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.450 
bits are always made out of stainless
steel<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.330> most<00:01:16.020> endurance<00:01:16.799> bridles<00:01:17.250> have

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.589 
I've got a different bit hanger for each
one<00:02:38.069> which<00:02:38.400> works<00:02:38.610> really<00:02:38.940> well<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.450> him<00:02:41.599> and

gray and the colour works on all of them
so<00:02:54.780> maybe<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:55.500> shouldn't<00:02:55.709> say<00:02:55.890> that

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120

horses went well in those because they

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.300

are<00:03:06.959> look<00:03:07.230> comfortable<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.010> think<00:03:08.040> it's

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
are look comfortable and I think it's

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.369 
are look comfortable and I think it's
quite<00:03:08.430> an<00:03:08.580> amazing<00:03:08.760> thing<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.300> there<00:03:10.290> was

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
quite an amazing thing that there was

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.559 
quite an amazing thing that there was
such<00:03:10.530> an<00:03:10.650> important<00:03:11.129> ride<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.730> just<00:03:12.330> about

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
such an important ride that just about

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.390 
such an important ride that just about
every<00:03:13.110> one<00:03:13.260> apartment<00:03:13.650> between<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:14.069> went<00:03:14.280> out

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
every one apartment between I went out

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.040 
every one apartment between I went out
and<00:03:14.610> actually<00:03:14.730> rode<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.420> ride<00:03:15.569> in<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
and actually rode the ride in the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.839 
and actually rode the ride in the
bridles<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:17.220> think<00:03:17.430> it's<00:03:17.550> just<00:03:17.700> their

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
bridles and I think it's just their

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.119 
bridles and I think it's just their
confidence<00:03:18.360> in<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.569> quality<00:03:18.980> confidence<00:03:19.980> in

reactor panel I can't remember when I
first<00:03:35.159> started<00:03:35.459> having<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.760> rectifier<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.330> must

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
first started having a rectifier it must

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.990 
first started having a rectifier it must
be<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.900> long<00:03:37.290> time<00:03:37.560> ago<00:03:40.400> got<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> collection<00:03:41.909> of

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
be a long time ago got a collection of

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.750 
be a long time ago got a collection of
of<00:03:42.420> three<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:43.500> I'm<00:03:44.250> about<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.519> have<00:03:44.700> a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
of three and I'm about to have a

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.140 
of three and I'm about to have a
collection<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:45.330> four<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:46.760> wouldn't<00:03:47.760> use

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
collection of four I wouldn't use

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:56.800 
collection of four I wouldn't use
anything<00:03:48.420> else<00:03:48.720> they<00:03:49.049> think<00:03:49.260> they've<00:03:49.769> changed

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.539 

change<00:03:57.810> horses<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.349> that's<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.769> think<00:03:59.010> saved

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
change horses and that's I think saved

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.520 
change horses and that's I think saved
me<00:03:59.760> an<00:03:59.970> absolute<00:04:00.150> fortune<00:04:00.659> so<00:04:01.140> though<00:04:01.290> they're

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
me an absolute fortune so though they're

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.610 
me an absolute fortune so though they're
expensive<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.129> buy<00:04:02.370> in<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.700> beginning<00:04:03.180> I

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
expensive to buy in the beginning I

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.110 
expensive to buy in the beginning I
think<00:04:04.620> I've<00:04:04.980> more<00:04:05.189> than<00:04:05.220> had<00:04:05.489> my<00:04:05.610> money<00:04:05.819> said<00:04:05.970> I

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
think I've more than had my money said I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.690 
think I've more than had my money said I
mean<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.330> was<00:04:06.450> given<00:04:06.750> one<00:04:06.930> horse<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:07.700> my

husband didn't want me to have it

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.780 
husband didn't want me to have it
