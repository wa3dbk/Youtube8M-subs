00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.889 

hey<00:00:01.170> guys<00:00:01.380> we<00:00:01.680> are<00:00:02.240> checking<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.419> IROC<00:00:03.720> out

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hey guys we are checking the IROC out

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.010 
hey guys we are checking the IROC out
here<00:00:04.110> today<00:00:04.850> let<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:05.970> cool<00:00:06.089> off<00:00:06.240> overnight<00:00:06.480> and

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
here today let it cool off overnight and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.830 
here today let it cool off overnight and
sure<00:00:07.890> enough<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.189> water<00:00:08.309> level<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.700> low<00:00:08.840> which

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
sure enough the water level is low which

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.600 
sure enough the water level is low which
is<00:00:09.870> not<00:00:10.170> surprising<00:00:10.830> considering<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.400> it

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
is not surprising considering that it

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.379 
is not surprising considering that it
was<00:00:11.790> dumping<00:00:12.420> water<00:00:12.599> out<00:00:13.880> and<00:00:14.880> with<00:00:15.179> this

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
was dumping water out and with this

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.880 
was dumping water out and with this
returned<00:00:15.990> one<00:00:16.230> or<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.760> this<00:00:17.760> line<00:00:18.000> got<00:00:18.210> melted

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
returned one or the this line got melted

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.109 
returned one or the this line got melted
where<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:19.949> comes<00:00:20.130> out<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.369> instead<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.880> going

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
where it comes out so instead of going

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.550 
where it comes out so instead of going
to<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> overflow<00:00:21.449> tank<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.199> something

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
to the overflow tank it's just something

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.640 
to the overflow tank it's just something
to<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:24.060> atmosphere<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.109> mean<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.410> may<00:00:25.560> have

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
to the atmosphere so I mean it may have

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.710 
to the atmosphere so I mean it may have
been<00:00:25.849> you<00:00:26.849> know<00:00:26.970> getting<00:00:27.240> lower<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.570> lower

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
been you know getting lower and lower

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.849 
been you know getting lower and lower
but<00:00:29.480> it<00:00:30.480> looks<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.960> me<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.560> may<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
but it looks like to me we may have a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.100 
but it looks like to me we may have a
problem<00:00:32.279> because<00:00:33.120> I'm<00:00:33.600> looking<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
problem because I'm looking at the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.130 
problem because I'm looking at the
surface<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> water<00:00:34.950> down<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.020> if

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
surface of the water down in here and if

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
surface of the water down in here and if
you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.380> able<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> see<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.829> or<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:38.210> then

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
you can be able to see it or not then

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.100 
you can be able to see it or not then
there's<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> layer<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.440> brown<00:00:41.420> sudsy<00:00:42.420> sludge<00:00:42.840> on

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
there's a layer of brown sudsy sludge on

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.569 
there's a layer of brown sudsy sludge on
the<00:00:43.260> top<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.710> water<00:00:43.920> that's<00:00:44.219> never<00:00:44.399> been

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the top of the water that's never been

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.990 
the top of the water that's never been
there<00:00:44.730> before<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:46.879> I<00:00:48.050> guess<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.230> question<00:00:49.410> is

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
there before so I guess the question is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.600 
there before so I guess the question is
is<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.090> oil<00:00:53.149> does<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> look<00:00:54.480> good<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.719> bad<00:00:54.960> I

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
is that oil does that look good or bad I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.490 
is that oil does that look good or bad I
don't<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.760> what<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.030> seeing<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:58.309> sure<00:00:59.309> don't

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
don't like what I'm seeing I sure don't

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.250 
don't like what I'm seeing I sure don't
also<00:01:01.500> notice<00:01:02.449> just<00:01:03.449> whatever<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.199> is

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
also notice just whatever this is

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:14.830 
also notice just whatever this is
appears<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:06.799> on<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.950> lid<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:13.549> rust

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
appears to be on on the lid just rust

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.590 
appears to be on on the lid just rust
but<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.960> doesn't<00:01:16.259> look<00:01:16.409> good<00:01:17.390> how<00:01:18.390> would<00:01:18.450> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
but it doesn't look good how would I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.570 
but it doesn't look good how would I
know<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.560> feels<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:19.979> rust<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.490> this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
know know it feels like rust of it this

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.870 
know know it feels like rust of it this
has<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:22.759> can't<00:01:23.759> explain<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:25.530> smells

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
has kind of a I can't explain it smells

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.109 
has kind of a I can't explain it smells
more<00:01:26.880> metallic<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.960> smells<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.470> rust

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
more metallic it smells like rust

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.319 
more metallic it smells like rust
so<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.340> all<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.399> can<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.850> fill<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.179> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
so then all I can do is fill it up and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.749 
so then all I can do is fill it up and
go<00:01:33.479> drive<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.899> suppose<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.399> can<00:01:35.579> check

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
go drive it I suppose and I can check

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.190 
go drive it I suppose and I can check
the<00:01:35.880> oil<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.509> there's<00:01:36.689> any<00:01:36.840> water<00:01:36.990> in

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the oil and see if there's any water in

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.219 
the oil and see if there's any water in
the<00:01:37.289> oil<00:01:38.420> looking<00:01:39.420> down<00:01:39.600> inside<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.049> valve

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the oil looking down inside the valve

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.679 
the oil looking down inside the valve
cover<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.649> see<00:01:40.979> no<00:01:41.189> signs<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.759> moisture<00:01:41.939> at<00:01:42.479> all

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
cover I see no signs of moisture at all

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.649 
cover I see no signs of moisture at all
so<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.460> very<00:01:44.670> good<00:01:44.969> to<00:01:45.090> see<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.799> let's

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
so that is very good to see so let's

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.160 
so that is very good to see so let's
just<00:01:48.659> hope<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.020> works<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:50.179> so<00:01:51.179> far<00:01:51.420> women<00:01:51.929> guys

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
just hope it works out so far women guys

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.130 
just hope it works out so far women guys
but<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.119> don't<00:01:54.119> want<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.569> amount<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.899> steam

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
but I don't want the amount of steam

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.919 
but I don't want the amount of steam
that<00:01:55.289> I'm<00:01:55.380> seeing<00:01:55.590> back<00:01:55.829> here<00:01:56.840> it's<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
that I'm seeing back here it's a

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.130 
that I'm seeing back here it's a
combination<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.500> steam<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.920> smoke<00:01:59.009> I<00:02:00.140> think

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
combination of steam and smoke I think

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.449 
combination of steam and smoke I think
there's<00:02:01.319> too<00:02:01.469> much<00:02:01.619> steam<00:02:01.890> though<00:02:02.099> it's<00:02:02.250> not

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
there's too much steam though it's not

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.420 
there's too much steam though it's not
that<00:02:02.700> cold

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.969 

I<00:02:06.460> know<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:07.210> smoking<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:07.900> I<00:02:07.960> see<00:02:08.259> see<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
I know it's smoking so I see see the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.820 
I know it's smoking so I see see the
food<00:02:09.160> smoke<00:02:09.430> and<00:02:09.640> I'll<00:02:09.790> do

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
food smoke and I'll do

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.110 
food smoke and I'll do
what's<00:02:11.400> looking<00:02:11.640> at<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> way<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.060> that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
what's looking at the way that that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.980 
what's looking at the way that that
looks<00:02:12.480> coming<00:02:12.780> out

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.560 

I'm<00:02:17.410> pretty<00:02:17.650> sure<00:02:17.860> we<00:02:18.070> got<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:19.180> engine<00:02:19.450> pretty

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
I'm pretty sure we got the engine pretty

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.540 
I'm pretty sure we got the engine pretty
good<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.960> time<00:02:20.430> thanks<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.640> fuel<00:02:21.850> system

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
good this time thanks to the fuel system

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.630

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
now there's four miles of driving it's

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.060 
now there's four miles of driving it's
over<00:02:50.220> with<00:02:50.720> head<00:02:51.720> gaskets<00:02:52.200> gone<00:02:53.600> or<00:02:54.600> worse

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
over with head gaskets gone or worse

over with head gaskets gone or worse
whatever<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.310> case<00:02:56.460> is<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.940> engines<00:02:57.210> got<00:02:57.360> to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
whatever the case is the engines got to

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.780 
whatever the case is the engines got to
come<00:02:57.600> out<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:58.860> know<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.430> doesn't<00:02:59.610> even

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
begin to address the complications of

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.380 
begin to address the complications of
the<00:03:02.520> fuel<00:03:02.730> system<00:03:02.940> issue<00:03:04.550> so<00:03:05.550> I<00:03:05.880> don't<00:03:06.330> know

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
the fuel system issue so I don't know

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:23.300 
the fuel system issue so I don't know
what'd<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.750> guys

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.880 

as<00:03:24.270> they<00:03:24.720> say<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.260> lean<00:03:25.500> too<00:03:26.010> long<00:03:26.780> too<00:03:27.780> bad<00:03:27.989> I

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.160 

don't<00:03:31.890> know<00:03:31.980> what<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.190> say<00:03:32.220> guys<00:03:32.989> we've<00:03:33.989> got

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
don't know what to say guys we've got

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.949 
don't know what to say guys we've got
three<00:03:34.500> major<00:03:34.890> problems<00:03:35.250> right<00:03:35.580> now<00:03:35.750> we<00:03:36.750> have

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
three major problems right now we have

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.910 
three major problems right now we have
the<00:03:37.140> smoke<00:03:37.670> we<00:03:38.670> have<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.000> fuelling<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.920> now

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
the smoke we have the fuelling and now

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.089 
the smoke we have the fuelling and now
we've<00:03:41.160> got<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:42.440> violated<00:03:43.440> cooling<00:03:43.739> system

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
we've got a violated cooling system

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.130 
we've got a violated cooling system
probably<00:03:44.340> maybe<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.120> head<00:03:45.300> gasket<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:45.810> could<00:03:46.019> be

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
probably maybe a head gasket it could be

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.729 
probably maybe a head gasket it could be
a<00:03:46.170> head

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
a head

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.520 
a head
these<00:03:47.580> are<00:03:47.760> commit<00:03:48.090> ik<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.540> MLS<00:03:48.840> gaskets<00:03:49.380> are

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
these are commit ik and MLS gaskets are

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.940 
these are commit ik and MLS gaskets are
about<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.769> hundred<00:03:49.950> bucks<00:03:50.220> each<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:51.950> the

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
about a hundred bucks each so the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.770 
about a hundred bucks each so the
chances<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.430> those<00:03:53.640> head<00:03:53.910> gaskets<00:03:54.360> failing

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
chances of those head gaskets failing

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.830 
chances of those head gaskets failing
are<00:03:54.900> pretty<00:03:55.140> low<00:03:55.790> I<00:03:56.790> believe<00:03:57.360> they<00:03:57.540> are<00:03:57.569> known

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
are pretty low I believe they are known

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.630 
are pretty low I believe they are known
to<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:57.989> stronger<00:03:58.530> than<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.799> factory<00:03:59.130> all<00:03:59.280> 98

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
to be stronger than the factory all 98

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.740 
to be stronger than the factory all 98
heads<00:04:00.170> so<00:04:01.170> we<00:04:01.500> may<00:04:01.650> have<00:04:02.450> damaged<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.540> head<00:04:03.720> I

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
heads so we may have damaged a head I

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.380 
heads so we may have damaged a head I
don't<00:04:04.019> know<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:05.459> block<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:06.120> could<00:04:06.299> be

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
don't know the block it could be

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.360 
don't know the block it could be
anything<00:04:06.590> whatever<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.860> is<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:08.099> going<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.280> be

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
anything whatever it is it's going to be

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.009 
anything whatever it is it's going to be
expensive<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:09.090> it's<00:04:09.239> not<00:04:09.330> going<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.660> fix<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
expensive and it's not going to fix the

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.229 
expensive and it's not going to fix the
other<00:04:10.110> two<00:04:10.349> problems<00:04:10.739> unless<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.760> smoking<00:04:12.150> is

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
other two problems unless the smoking is

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.120 
other two problems unless the smoking is
from<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.480> Rings<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:13.049> I<00:04:13.380> have<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.650> replace<00:04:13.890> the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
from the Rings and I have to replace the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.849 
from the Rings and I have to replace the
engine<00:04:14.870> my<00:04:15.870> guess<00:04:16.079> right<00:04:16.320> now<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.620> I'm<00:04:16.769> gonna

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
engine my guess right now is I'm gonna

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.069 
engine my guess right now is I'm gonna
go<00:04:16.979> back<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.310> factory<00:04:17.609> engine<00:04:17.910> in<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:21.079> well

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
go back to the factory engine in it well

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.120 
go back to the factory engine in it well
I'm<00:04:22.169> not<00:04:22.290> gonna<00:04:22.470> do<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.740> I'm<00:04:22.830> gonna<00:04:22.979> pay

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
I'm not gonna do it I'm gonna pay

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.520 
I'm not gonna do it I'm gonna pay
somebody<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.520> do<00:04:23.639> it<00:04:23.960> I'm<00:04:24.960> done<00:04:25.169> working<00:04:25.380> on

now especially when I need to fix the

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:32.810 
now especially when I need to fix the
fuel<00:04:31.500> system<00:04:31.740> any<00:04:32.039> others<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:32.490> I'm<00:04:32.610> really
