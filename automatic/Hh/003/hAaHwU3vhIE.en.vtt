00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.600 

okay<00:00:01.079> let's<00:00:01.680> have<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.829> think<00:00:02.070> about<00:00:02.159> how<00:00:02.340> River

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay let's have a think about how River

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.640 
okay let's have a think about how River
erosion<00:00:02.760> processes<00:00:03.360> work<00:00:03.629> here<00:00:04.410> we've<00:00:04.560> got

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
erosion processes work here we've got

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.780 
erosion processes work here we've got
the<00:00:04.770> cross-section<00:00:05.339> through<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.580> river

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
the cross-section through a river

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.519 
the cross-section through a river
channel<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.480> we've<00:00:06.750> got<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:06.990> four<00:00:07.290> main

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
channel and we've got the four main

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.400 
channel and we've got the four main
methods<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.010> erosion<00:00:08.360> highlighted<00:00:09.360> on<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
methods of erosion highlighted on the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.930 
methods of erosion highlighted on the
diagram<00:00:10.740> let's<00:00:11.190> talk<00:00:11.340> about<00:00:11.460> each<00:00:11.639> one<00:00:11.700> in

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
diagram let's talk about each one in

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.290 
diagram let's talk about each one in
turn

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
turn

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.350 
turn
first<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.080> all<00:00:13.170> hydraulic<00:00:13.920> action<00:00:14.219> as<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.240> can

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
first of all hydraulic action as you can

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.849 
first of all hydraulic action as you can
see<00:00:15.540> hydraulic<00:00:15.929> action<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.289> pointing<00:00:16.710> to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
see hydraulic action is pointing to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.040 
see hydraulic action is pointing to
these<00:00:16.980> cracks<00:00:17.369> on<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.789> riverbank<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
these cracks on the riverbank and the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.920 
these cracks on the riverbank and the
riverbed<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.310> see<00:00:20.460> what<00:00:21.300> happens<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.779> as

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
riverbed you can see what happens is as

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.870 
riverbed you can see what happens is as
the<00:00:22.230> water<00:00:22.439> moves<00:00:22.619> over<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.279> crack<00:00:23.609> or

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the water moves over this crack or

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.700 
the water moves over this crack or
especially<00:00:24.539> as<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.720> river<00:00:24.900> flow<00:00:25.170> if<00:00:25.529> it's

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
especially as the river flow if it's

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.560 
especially as the river flow if it's
quite<00:00:25.920> high<00:00:26.160> or<00:00:26.340> quite<00:00:26.519> fast<00:00:26.760> then<00:00:27.330> the

pressure inside this void inside this
cracks<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.210> increased<00:00:30.689> over<00:00:31.500> time<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
cracks is increased over time as the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.190 
cracks is increased over time as the
pressure<00:00:32.940> increases<00:00:33.450> again<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.780> again<00:00:33.960> these

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
pressure increases again and again these

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.920 
pressure increases again and again these
cracks<00:00:34.559> start<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.950> widen<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.579> start<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.690> break

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
cracks start to widen and start to break

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.720

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380 
riverbed and these fall into the river
and<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.620> become<00:00:40.890> sediment<00:00:41.430> or<00:00:41.610> load<00:00:41.940> for<00:00:42.329> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
the river and as they do they might wear

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.410 
the river and as they do they might wear
it<00:01:00.120> away<00:01:00.390> physically<00:01:00.840> break<00:01:01.109> off<00:01:01.320> chunks<00:01:01.710> a

third one is attrition and you can see a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.649 
third one is attrition and you can see a
little<00:01:05.760> bump<00:01:06.000> at<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.210> bottom<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.600> this

little bump at the bottom of this

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.240 
little bump at the bottom of this
diagram<00:01:06.930> quite<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> few<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.710> these<00:01:07.799> rocks<00:01:08.070> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
diagram quite a few of these rocks and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.100 
diagram quite a few of these rocks and
stones<00:01:08.460> they're<00:01:08.670> quite<00:01:08.880> rounded<00:01:09.360> now<00:01:09.930> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
stones they're quite rounded now that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
stones they're quite rounded now that
might<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.500> because<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.330> rocks

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
might be because the the rocks

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.910 
might be because the the rocks
themselves<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:13.320> been<00:01:13.500> subject<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
themselves have been subject to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.070 
themselves have been subject to
attrition<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> process<00:01:15.210> where<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
attrition which is the process where the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.770 
attrition which is the process where the
stones<00:01:16.380> themselves<00:01:16.759> roll<00:01:17.759> against<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
stones themselves roll against the the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.359 
stones themselves roll against the the
banks<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> river<00:01:19.560> bed<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.070> river<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
banks of the river bed of the river and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.670 
banks of the river bed of the river and
against<00:01:20.670> each<00:01:20.820> other<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.420> therefore<00:01:22.290> they

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
against each other and therefore they

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
against each other and therefore they
become<00:01:22.830> rounded<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:23.820> become<00:01:24.030> smaller

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
become rounded and then become smaller

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.020 
become rounded and then become smaller
so<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.259> example<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.159> here<00:01:26.189> has

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
so you see for example this one here has

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.060 
so you see for example this one here has
become<00:01:27.270> more<00:01:27.900> rounded<00:01:28.380> than<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.040> here

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
become more rounded than this one here

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.560 
become more rounded than this one here
and<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.400> smaller<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.880> means<00:01:29.939> attrition

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and it's smaller that means attrition

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.999 
and it's smaller that means attrition
might<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.780> worked<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> more<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
might have worked on it more so

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.800 
might have worked on it more so
attrition<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> process<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.390> works<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
attrition is a process that works on the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.990 
attrition is a process that works on the
actual<00:01:34.020> sediment<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.369> actual<00:01:35.670> banks

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
actual sediment and not the actual banks

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.740 
actual sediment and not the actual banks

next<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> word<00:01:43.350> solution<00:01:43.710> that's<00:01:43.890> because

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
next to the word solution that's because

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.639 
next to the word solution that's because
it's<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> chemical<00:01:45.420> action<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.990> water<00:01:46.229> on

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it's the chemical action of the water on

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.620 
it's the chemical action of the water on
the<00:01:47.310> rocks<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> minerals<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> banks

means that solution is the one of the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.380 
means that solution is the one of the
four<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.100> will<00:02:05.189> work<00:02:05.369> no<00:02:05.759> matter<00:02:06.000> what<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
four that will work no matter what the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.270 
four that will work no matter what the
conditions<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.960> river<00:02:07.110> are<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:08.009> in

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
conditions of the river are if it's in

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.729 
conditions of the river are if it's in
flood<00:02:08.729> or<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.390> if<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> very<00:02:10.440> low

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
flood or if it's in if it's a very low

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.960 
flood or if it's in if it's a very low
flow<00:02:10.979> solution<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.520> work<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.940> time

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
flow solution we work all the time

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.430 
flow solution we work all the time
whereas<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.390> others

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
whereas the others

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.040 
whereas the others
abrasion<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.580> ralick<00:02:14.850> action<00:02:15.180> all<00:02:15.360> work<00:02:15.750> more

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
abrasion and ralick action all work more

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.630 
abrasion and ralick action all work more
when<00:02:16.290> there<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.500> much<00:02:16.800> more<00:02:17.100> water<00:02:17.340> and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
when there is much more water and

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.220 
when there is much more water and
therefore<00:02:17.790> more<00:02:18.030> energy<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.780> river<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
therefore more energy in the river I

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.220 
therefore more energy in the river I
