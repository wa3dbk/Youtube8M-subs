00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.200
 and what's up my few and dear ones 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.510
 YouTube subscribers as they are 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.469
 I hope you are very well I 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.570
 I'm very happy 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.660
 we have barely reached 20 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.590
 subscribers along these 34 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.120
 months what the hell I already know but well 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.030
 we are going to grow from little to little 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.000
 but good here on this occasion 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.310
 I bring a small tutorial good standard 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.149
 as a tutorial if no more than a small 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.000
 tip advice I do not know how you want to call him 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.220
 I do not know if you already know it but you know 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.579
 I want to share the trick with you 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.920
 when you follow a blow the character does 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.230
 like it's coming out as well as that of 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.540
 group then what you have to 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.320
 to do is press the button before 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.450
 jump or stand or start 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.140
 walk go running press the button 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.280
 jump and then the hit button what 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.730
 I'm going to do here in the pool to not 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.770
 kill me there you go running and 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.890
 the monkey is fired as if it were to 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.659
 type American football style to me 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.360
 It seems very funny because if you do it 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.090
 this among other things and fanning ted to 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.450
 people are not oriented dowry to the 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.159
 cars, it's very funny to see how 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.090
 part the mother 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.840
 here is a small demonstration of what 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.630
 what is that concept what one wants 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:37.289
 do parkour again 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:40.920
 and good good good you liked it 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:46.860
 this mini trick for when you get bored 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.110
 without omissions and good here I leave a 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.610
 small compilation that I made of jumps 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.299
 covers and others see you in the next 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.299

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.060
 then 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.850
