however<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> wings<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.790> swept<00:01:36.060> back<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
however the wings are swept back at a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.969 
however the wings are swept back at a
very<00:01:36.659> cool-looking<00:01:36.930> angle<00:01:37.530> you've<00:01:37.680> got<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
very cool-looking angle you've got the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.740 
very cool-looking angle you've got the
Boosters<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> blasters<00:01:38.939> everything

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
Boosters and the blasters everything

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.060 
Boosters and the blasters everything
there<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.020> looking<00:01:40.350> great<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> fact<00:01:41.009> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
there is looking great the fact that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.039 
there is looking great the fact that
it's<00:01:41.250> included<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> huge<00:01:42.390> plus<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it's included is just a huge plus and

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.270 
it's included is just a huge plus and
you're<00:01:43.140> not<00:01:43.259> gonna<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> go<00:01:43.680> scrambling

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you're not gonna have to go scrambling

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.160 
you're not gonna have to go scrambling
for<00:01:44.430> things<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.270> head<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.570> gonna<00:01:45.689> come<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.049> at

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
for things the head is gonna come up at

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.510 
for things the head is gonna come up at
a<00:01:46.200> cool<00:01:46.409> angle<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> fact<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.340> it's

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
a cool angle and the fact that it's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.310 
a cool angle and the fact that it's
actually<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.360> very<00:01:48.659> skinny<00:01:49.079> is

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
actually not just a very skinny is

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.260 
actually not just a very skinny is
actually<00:01:50.040> gonna<00:01:50.159> help<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.880> set<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.210> apart

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
actually gonna help really set it apart

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.450 
actually gonna help really set it apart
and<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.930> legs<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.590> purchased<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.040> various

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and the legs can be purchased at various

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.200 
and the legs can be purchased at various
angles<00:01:53.780> underneath<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.640> articulation

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
angles underneath so for articulation

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.399 
angles underneath so for articulation
here<00:01:57.630> you're<00:01:57.750> gonna<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:58.020> able<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.259> bring

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
here you're gonna be able to bring

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.679 
here you're gonna be able to bring
laserbeak's<00:01:58.950> head<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.790> down<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.360> it's

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
laserbeak's head up and down and it's

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.480 
laserbeak's head up and down and it's
actually<00:02:00.990> gonna<00:02:01.110> bend<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.250> saw

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
actually gonna bend here and if you saw

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.679 
actually gonna bend here and if you saw
it<00:02:02.549> there<00:02:02.729> i<00:02:02.759> had<00:02:03.060> pulled<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.420> out<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
it there i had pulled it out that

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.959 
it there i had pulled it out that
there's<00:02:03.810> gonna<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> secret<00:02:04.619> camera<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.430> spy

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
there's gonna be a secret camera a spy

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.459 
there's gonna be a secret camera a spy
crime<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.420> there<00:02:06.600> may<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.810> worth<00:02:07.110> putting<00:02:07.320> a

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
crime in there may be worth putting a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.740 
crime in there may be worth putting a
dollop<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.890> paint<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.369> there<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.119> want<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
dollop of paint on there if you want to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.390 
dollop of paint on there if you want to
and<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.530> terms<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.920> wings<00:02:11.069> they're<00:02:11.280> not

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and in terms of the wings they're not

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.790 
and in terms of the wings they're not
going<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.670> up<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.090> down<00:02:12.270> here<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:13.170> because

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
going to go up and down here but because

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.440 
going to go up and down here but because
can<00:02:13.950> take<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.250> legs<00:02:14.460> here<00:02:14.730> which<00:02:15.210> are<00:02:15.330> gonna

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
can take the legs here which are gonna

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.720 
can take the legs here which are gonna
rotate<00:02:15.660> very<00:02:16.110> very<00:02:16.470> well<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.890> way<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.310> you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
rotate very very well this way and you

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.640 
rotate very very well this way and you
can<00:02:17.880> set<00:02:18.090> them<00:02:18.210> like<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.780> then<00:02:19.290> because<00:02:19.620> of

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
can set them like this then because of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.990 
can set them like this then because of
that<00:02:19.800> even<00:02:20.250> though<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.460> is<00:02:20.520> used<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
that even though this is used in the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.730 
that even though this is used in the
transformation<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.230> have<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.560> wings

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
transformation you can have the wings

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.470 
transformation you can have the wings
come<00:02:22.980> down<00:02:23.190> here<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.610> already<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.180> setting

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
come down here so already it's setting

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.200 
come down here so already it's setting
itself<00:02:24.750> apart<00:02:25.140> from<00:02:25.800> its<00:02:26.010> g1<00:02:26.400> predecessor<00:02:27.030> in

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
itself apart from its g1 predecessor in

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:38.620 
itself apart from its g1 predecessor in
a<00:02:27.420> very<00:02:27.840> cool<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.710> stylish<00:02:29.190> way

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.780 

and<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.380> course<00:02:39.620> it's<00:02:39.830> all<00:02:39.950> important<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.550> see

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
and of course it's all important to see

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.030 
and of course it's all important to see
how<00:02:41.120> it's<00:02:41.390> going<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.840> look<00:02:42.080> with<00:02:42.500> an<00:02:42.710> actual

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
how it's going to look with an actual

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.030 
how it's going to look with an actual
cassette<00:02:43.490> inside<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:44.570> just<00:02:44.600> take<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.350> drop<00:02:45.890> it

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
cassette inside you just take it drop it

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.190 
cassette inside you just take it drop it
in<00:02:46.190> down<00:02:46.370> there<00:02:46.610> plug<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.930> there<00:02:48.050> you

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
in down there plug it in and there you

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.720 
in down there plug it in and there you
can<00:02:48.350> see<00:02:48.530> some<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.980> details<00:02:49.340> there<00:02:49.520> from

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
can see some of the details there from

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.400 
can see some of the details there from
Laserbeak<00:02:50.180> then<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.840> cool<00:02:50.990> part<00:02:51.230> about

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
Laserbeak then the cool part about

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.930 
Laserbeak then the cool part about
having<00:02:51.620> more<00:02:52.040> than<00:02:52.070> one<00:02:52.250> cassette<00:02:52.700> on<00:02:52.760> the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
having more than one cassette on the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.970 
having more than one cassette on the
inside<00:02:53.270> is<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.990> even<00:02:54.230> if<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.410> do<00:02:54.560> launch<00:02:54.800> out

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
inside is that even if you do launch out

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.590 
inside is that even if you do launch out
the<00:02:55.070> first<00:02:55.280> one<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.580> put<00:02:55.730> Laserbeak<00:02:56.180> up<00:02:56.390> on

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
the first one and put Laserbeak up on

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.390 
the first one and put Laserbeak up on
the<00:02:56.690> shoulder<00:02:57.050> or<00:02:57.230> on<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.530> arm<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:58.220> you'd

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
the shoulder or on the arm that you'd

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.220 
the shoulder or on the arm that you'd
still<00:02:58.670> have<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.000> internals<00:02:59.480> being<00:02:59.720> shown<00:03:00.050> off

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
still have the internals being shown off

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.960 
still have the internals being shown off
and<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:00.920> not<00:03:01.070> just<00:03:01.340> gonna<00:03:01.460> be<00:03:01.610> an<00:03:01.760> empty

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
and it's not just gonna be an empty

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.480 
and it's not just gonna be an empty
cavity<00:03:02.450> when<00:03:03.080> his<00:03:03.290> one<00:03:03.500> cassette<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.070> out<00:03:04.220> like

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
cavity when his one cassette is out like

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.450 
cavity when his one cassette is out like
it<00:03:04.700> was<00:03:04.850> on<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.210> old<00:03:05.360> school<00:03:05.690> toy<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:07.340> when

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
it was on the old school toy and when

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.890 
it was on the old school toy and when
they're<00:03:07.610> both<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:07.910> robot<00:03:08.300> mode<00:03:08.330> if<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:08.660> take<00:03:08.870> a

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
they're both in robot mode if you take a

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
gonna offset it so you're probably

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.090 
gonna offset it so you're probably
better<00:05:52.930> off<00:05:52.990> keeping<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.560> trigger<00:05:53.800> finger

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
not really going to help it and you can

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.969 
not really going to help it and you can
see<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:07.780> insides<00:06:08.139> of<00:06:08.320> the<00:06:08.410> three<00:06:08.650> fingers

see the insides of the three fingers
down<00:06:09.160> they're<00:06:09.340> going<00:06:09.580> to<00:06:09.639> look<00:06:09.789> a<00:06:09.849> little<00:06:10.000> bit

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
ugly when you actually bring the finger

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.469 
ugly when you actually bring the finger
up<00:06:11.710> which<00:06:12.220> is<00:06:12.370> the<00:06:12.460> only<00:06:12.580> real<00:06:12.910> point<00:06:13.300> of
