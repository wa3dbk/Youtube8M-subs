00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
here's what you can do check out shield

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.789

wall requires defensive stance and a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.280 
wall requires defensive stance and a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
go back into berserker stands and you're

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.649 
go back into berserker stands and you're
gonna<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> shield<00:01:24.000> blah<00:01:24.150> blah<00:01:24.360> stay<00:01:25.020> on

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
gonna see the shield blah blah stay on

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.130 
gonna see the shield blah blah stay on
there<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.460> while<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> buff<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
there it is and while the buff is on it

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.109 
there it is and while the buff is on it
doesn't<00:01:31.409> prevent<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.710> from<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:32.549> offensive

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
doesn't prevent you from going offensive

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.499 
doesn't prevent you from going offensive
you<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.630> still<00:01:34.290> go<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.970> do<00:01:35.970> your<00:01:36.150> regular

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you can still go and do your regular

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.240 
you can still go and do your regular
deal<00:01:37.909> but<00:01:38.909> that's<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.780> glitch<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
deal but that's the glitch so the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.060 
deal but that's the glitch so the
question<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> glitch<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.920> this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
question is is this a glitch or is this

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.410 
question is is this a glitch or is this
the<00:01:44.220> way<00:01:44.340> things<00:01:44.399> are<00:01:44.790> supposed<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.390> down

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the way things are supposed to go down

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.920 
the way things are supposed to go down
now<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.170> tested<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> make<00:01:48.060> sure<00:01:48.090> that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
now I tested this just to make sure that

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.520 
now I tested this just to make sure that
maybe<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> was<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.100> some<00:01:50.850> sort<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.270> bug<00:01:51.840> where

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
maybe it was just some sort of bug where

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.350 
maybe it was just some sort of bug where
it<00:01:52.590> was<00:01:52.710> showing<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.729> know<00:01:53.820> having<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it was showing you you know having a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.240 
it was showing you you know having a
damage<00:01:54.720> reduction<00:01:54.960> buff<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.040> actually

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
damage reduction buff but you actually

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.090 
damage reduction buff but you actually
don't<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.509> damage<00:01:57.810> reduction<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.409> tested

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
don't have the damage reduction I tested

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.859 
don't have the damage reduction I tested
it<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.399> BG<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> couple<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.210> times<00:02:00.450> took<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> look

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
it in a BG a couple of times took a look

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.870 
it in a BG a couple of times took a look
at<00:02:01.020> my<00:02:01.049> combat<00:02:01.500> log<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.829> am<00:02:01.979> actually<00:02:02.250> reducing
