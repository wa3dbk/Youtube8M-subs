or seventh-day adventists ISM but my
guess<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.490> most<00:01:47.670> people<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.149> America<00:01:48.570> who

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
guess is that most people in America who

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.300 
guess is that most people in America who
are<00:01:48.720> vegetarians<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.619> out<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> conscience

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
are vegetarians do it out of conscience

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.800 
are vegetarians do it out of conscience
because<00:01:50.759> they<00:01:50.880> can't<00:01:51.149> stand<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.540> sight<00:01:51.750> of
