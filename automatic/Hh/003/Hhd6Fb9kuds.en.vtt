00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:03.637
for coming in today.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.140
Uh, group therapy, I know it can
make men a little uncomfortable.

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:08.575
But I guarantee you

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.378
your communication
skills will improve.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.447
Well, why don't we
start with you, David.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.482
Um, okay.

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:18.385
So I know Lisa--
that's my wife.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:22.122
Um... she thinks we just
hit a bump in our marriage

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.591
but the thing
is, um...

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.059
for the last
few years

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:29.296
I've had a secret
family in Tampa.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.330
It sounds bad.

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.299
David, there are
no judgments here.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.800
That must be
very painful

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.602
for you to have
a secret from your wife.

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:36.803
It's the worst.

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.572
Have you given any
thought to a remedy?

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:40.807
Well, yeah, I was
thinking, um...

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:44.077
maybe going on a sunset boat
ride for our anniversary?

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.946
Take her out in
the open ocean,

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.481
drug her,

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.517
throw her in the
water so she drowns.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.491
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:00.460
How do we-- uh, what do--
how 'bout we say for now

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:01.662
that you do nothing?

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:02.763
Well, it's not for
a couple months.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.431
Okay, good, so...

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:05.966
So don't do anything--
do nothing.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.202
Uh, and, uh, Ben.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.103
Do you have a share?

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:13.507
My deal is a few months
ago I told my wife

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.576
I was going on
a business trip.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.544
But in truth,

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:22.950
I went on a two-month sex
tour of sub-Sahara Africa.

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:25.752
So that.

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:27.387
How do you feel?

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.224
How do you feel about
that, how do you feel?

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:32.559
Honestly... great.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:35.295
That was the best trip I ever
took in my life, hands down.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.964
If you ever get
the chance to go...

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:38.365
Really?
Go.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:39.366
Is it expensive?

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.601
Yeah, it's crazy
expensive...

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.970
Okay, okay, well,
that'll be interesting

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.272
for us to research
on our own.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.840
Oh, yeah, all right, so,

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:48.542
as a result of
my trip now

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.177
I'm in a ton of debt.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.778
I'm hiding it
from Karen

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:54.681
and I just don't even know
how to bring it up to her.

00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:56.116
That's a difficult
conversation to have.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.918
Maybe we could
all brainstorm

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.686
some solutions
together.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.357
Oh, well, I was kinda more
thinking, you know,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.158
probably just chop her
up in little pieces

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:06.960
and drain her
bank account.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.497
Okay, uh, you
know what,

00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:12.566
I wanna just pause
here, uh...

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.535
Um, first of all,

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:18.672
no one feel any pressure to
unload everything... today.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:19.940
It's the first day.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.709
And then also, um, maybe
as a group we can...

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:24.545
we can come up
with, uh...

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:27.948
with a solution
to Ben's issues

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:32.085
that don't involve
him murdering Karen.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.555
Um... he can hire
somebody to kill Karen?

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:35.556
Oh.

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:36.557
Great, okay.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.624
I didn't even
think of that.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:39.860
Um, you know what--
how about...

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.295
Let's all work
together here

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:43.931
and come up with
some solutions,

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:47.134
uh... where we
can keep Karen

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.470
alive.

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.439
Alive...
Alive.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:56.243
Oh, what if
I bury her alive?

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.811
Okay, that-- no.

00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.746
Just kind of like
meeting halfway.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.549
At the end of that,
she would still be dead.

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:03.817
Sebastian...

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.253
Sebastian, we haven't
heard from you, yet.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.789
So, I've been playing
fantasy football

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:12.192
with this same group of
guys for years now.

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:15.395
But, uh, my wife,
Darflin, she nags me

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.197
for spending so
much time on it.

00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:20.167
I just wish she could
understand that that's just

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.237
time I'm using to
like zone out.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.838
Have you tried
expressing to your wife

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:27.074
that's just time that you
need to decompress?

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:28.175
I don't know.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.676
But, and the other
part of it is

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.980
last weekend I fucked all the
guys in the fantasy league

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.816
and I never used
any protection

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.186
like... at all.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.756
And... we did
everything.

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:46.827
Um, you are, uh,
I think you're putting

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.128
Darfla's health
at stake.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.830
It's Darflin.

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:51.765
Darflin's health
at stake.

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:54.501
You're kind of obligated
to tell her.

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:56.803
I know that on paper, that--
that's the right thing to do

00:03:56.837 --> 00:04:00.507
but you just have no idea
how high-strung she is.

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:01.909
I really think the
best thing to do

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:04.344
is just sneak up behind
her and break her neck.

00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:06.446
Okay, okay.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.116
Is it really easier
to kill her

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.784
than it would be
to just talk to her?

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:11.852
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:13.086
Well, yeah, 'cause
I think, if I, if I,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.622
if I told her it would
probably kill her anyway.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.126
Babe, are you
ready or what?

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.627
I told you 8:00.

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:21.795
Yeah, but I'm
hungry now.

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:22.863
Ten minutes.

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:24.131
Can't we just
wrap it up?

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:25.766
Go to the car.

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:26.900
How much longer
can these guys

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:28.135
talk about
their feelings.

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:29.870
Get in the
fucking car.
Let's go.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.071
You get in the car.

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:32.606
Chop, chop,
come on.
Close the door.

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:33.640
Close the door.

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:35.876
( door shuts )

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:38.111
I'm so sorry about
that everyone.

00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:40.514
Sometimes, I don't
know what to do.

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:43.150
Well, you could slowly poison
him over time or something.

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:46.286
Yeah, it'll just look
like he got sick.
Yeah.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.322
Or-- off of what
David just said,

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:50.624
uh, you go on a
hiking trip, right?

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:52.526
Then when he
falls asleep,

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:53.727
you shoot him
with a gun

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.096
that you got off
the Mexican internet.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.331
They have their
own internet?

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:59.266
Yeah, it's mostly
just for guns.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.870
But, uh... it's
untraceable.

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:05.038
It's not hard, I got the
number if you want it.

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:06.273
Yeah, I'd love
the number.
