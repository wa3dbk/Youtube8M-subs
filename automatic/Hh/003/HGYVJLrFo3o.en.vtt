00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and that's just embarrassing so I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.600 
and that's just embarrassing so I
figured<00:00:39.930> I'm<00:00:40.110> gonna<00:00:40.290> shut<00:00:40.559> up<00:00:40.649> take<00:00:41.370> off<00:00:41.489> the

headphones and actually focus on the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.690 
headphones and actually focus on the
game<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.989> this<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.260> result<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.430> just

it's actually it didn't take me very
many<00:00:55.949> tries<00:00:56.160> actually<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.969> was<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.750> worked<00:00:57.989> at

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
many tries actually I was I worked at

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.130 
many tries actually I was I worked at
this<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.739> 16<00:00:59.160> minutes<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.090> last<00:01:00.239> four<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
this for 16 minutes in the last four of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.039 
this for 16 minutes in the last four of
it<00:01:01.260> was<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.859> last<00:01:02.039> place<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.520> belong<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.120> not

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
it was the last place I belong so not

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.200 
it was the last place I belong so not
not<00:01:04.350> too<00:01:04.559> bad<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.610> think<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.850> already<00:01:05.970> can

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
not too bad so I think you already can

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.780 
not too bad so I think you already can
tell<00:01:06.240> how<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.080> ending<00:01:07.439> here

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
tell how this is going to be ending here

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.570 
tell how this is going to be ending here
this<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> good<00:01:09.150> run<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.600> abyss<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:11.250> final

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
this is a good run on abyss the final

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.500 
this is a good run on abyss the final
time<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.119> think<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.390> pretty

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
time we get I think it's pretty

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.039 
time we get I think it's pretty
impressive

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
impressive

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.109 
impressive
just<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.799> some<00:01:13.890> perspectives<00:01:14.460> sake<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:14.909> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
just for some perspectives sake if you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.200 
just for some perspectives sake if you
remember<00:01:15.770> when<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.799> beat<00:01:17.130> when<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.759> lost<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
remember when we beat when we lost a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.330 
remember when we beat when we lost a
body<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.630> first<00:01:18.780> time<00:01:19.140> he<00:01:19.740> was<00:01:19.860> consistently

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
body the first time he was consistently

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.789 
body the first time he was consistently
clocking<00:01:20.820> four<00:01:21.570> minutes<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.080> five<00:01:22.290> seconds

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
clocking four minutes and five seconds

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.710 
clocking four minutes and five seconds
so<00:01:23.040> we'll<00:01:23.580> compare<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> our<00:01:24.299> time<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
so we'll compare that to our time at the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.170 
so we'll compare that to our time at the
end<00:01:25.040> but<00:01:26.040> yeah<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.729> actually<00:01:27.030> isn't

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
end but yeah I was it's actually isn't

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.819 
end but yeah I was it's actually isn't
that<00:01:27.360> bad<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> race<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.500> guys<00:01:28.619> were

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that bad of a race and you guys were

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.490 
that bad of a race and you guys were
definitely<00:01:29.040> right<00:01:29.750> bull's-eyes<00:01:30.750> pod<00:01:31.020> turns

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
definitely right bull's-eyes pod turns

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.390 
definitely right bull's-eyes pod turns
way<00:01:32.189> way<00:01:33.090> too<00:01:33.150> much<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:34.229> be<00:01:34.409> good<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.280> this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
way way too much to be good for this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.300 
way way too much to be good for this
track<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.590> true<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> LP<00:01:38.280> I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
track but you know true to the LP I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.730 
track but you know true to the LP I
wanted<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.060> bull's<00:01:39.270> eye<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.750> so

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
wanted to do it with bull's eye and so

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.870 
wanted to do it with bull's eye and so
that's<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.189> about<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.549> was<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.759> real

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that's not about what that was the real

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.060 
that's not about what that was the real
challenge<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:42.329> was<00:01:42.630> slowing<00:01:43.530> down<00:01:43.560> enough

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
challenge here was slowing down enough

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.649 
challenge here was slowing down enough
to<00:01:44.130> take<00:01:44.399> these<00:01:44.549> corners<00:01:45.030> at<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> reasonable

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
to take these corners at a reasonable

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.810 
to take these corners at a reasonable
speed<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.619> able<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.070> stay<00:01:47.310> near<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
speed and be able to stay near the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.219 
speed and be able to stay near the
middle<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> track<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.960> even

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
middle of the track as you can see even

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.649 
middle of the track as you can see even
there<00:01:49.530> I'm<00:01:50.009> having<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.579> tiny<00:01:50.820> lots<00:01:51.540> of

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
there I'm having to do tiny lots of

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.210 
there I'm having to do tiny lots of
little<00:01:52.200> adjustments<00:01:52.710> because<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> pod

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
little adjustments because the pod

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.560 
little adjustments because the pod
doesn't<00:01:53.460> turn<00:01:53.909> smoothly<00:01:54.420> enough<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.500> its<00:01:55.710> own

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
doesn't turn smoothly enough on its own

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.639 
doesn't turn smoothly enough on its own
and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:57.689> here<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> start<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> repair<00:01:58.469> and

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and then here I start to repair and

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.870 
and then here I start to repair and
overturn<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.310> feel<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.549> actually<00:01:59.670> have

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
overturn as I feel like I actually have

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.789 
overturn as I feel like I actually have
more<00:02:00.030> speed<00:02:00.329> he's<00:02:01.110> weird<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.530> post

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
more speed he's weird to do post

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.100 
more speed he's weird to do post
commentary<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.399> game<00:02:02.579> italia<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.630> uh<00:02:03.659> I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
commentary in this game italia but uh I

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.380 
commentary in this game italia but uh I
think<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
think the

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.310 
think the
the<00:02:06.080> vid<00:02:06.320> sort<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.650> speaks<00:02:06.860> for<00:02:07.040> itself<00:02:08.320> it

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
the vid sort of speaks for itself it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.870 
the vid sort of speaks for itself it
wasn't<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.649> bad<00:02:09.770> like<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.039> say<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:10.490> took

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
wasn't that bad like I say it just took

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.930 
wasn't that bad like I say it just took
me<00:02:11.090> not<00:02:11.720> commentating<00:02:12.560> because<00:02:12.890> it's<00:02:13.520> I've

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
me not commentating because it's I've

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.610 
me not commentating because it's I've
talked<00:02:14.180> about<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.390> before<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.690> lp's<00:02:15.020> when

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
talked about it before and lp's when

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.350 
talked about it before and lp's when
you're<00:02:15.770> speaking<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.730> say<00:02:16.910> there<00:02:17.090> look<00:02:17.270> how

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
you're speaking you say there look how

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.450 
you're speaking you say there look how
sensitive<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.840> pot<00:02:18.020> is<00:02:18.200> either<00:02:18.620> goes<00:02:19.250> or

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
sensitive the pot is either goes or

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.400 
sensitive the pot is either goes or
doesn't<00:02:19.820> is<00:02:19.910> like<00:02:20.390> jumping<00:02:20.840> like<00:02:20.990> that<00:02:21.170> that's

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
doesn't is like jumping like that that's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.350 
doesn't is like jumping like that that's
me<00:02:21.560> trying<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.130> get<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.520> go<00:02:22.610> gradually<00:02:23.030> when

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
me trying to get it to go gradually when

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.540 
me trying to get it to go gradually when
it<00:02:23.450> doesn't<00:02:23.600> want<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.050> it's<00:02:24.770> like<00:02:24.950> all<00:02:25.160> or

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
it doesn't want to it's like all or

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.660 
it doesn't want to it's like all or
nothing<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:27.620> there's<00:02:27.830> no<00:02:27.950> gentleness<00:02:28.430> on

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
nothing it is there's no gentleness on

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.070 
nothing it is there's no gentleness on
the<00:02:28.760> accelerator<00:02:29.300> either<00:02:29.630> you're<00:02:29.750> hitting<00:02:29.990> it

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
the accelerator either you're hitting it

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.600 
the accelerator either you're hitting it
and<00:02:30.200> you're<00:02:30.320> fully<00:02:30.590> accelerating<00:02:31.190> or<00:02:31.370> you're

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
and you're fully accelerating or you're

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.060 
and you're fully accelerating or you're
not<00:02:31.730> hitting<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.209> you're<00:02:32.300> not<00:02:32.330> moving

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
not hitting it and you're not moving

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.560 
not hitting it and you're not moving
yeah<00:02:34.100> so<00:02:34.550> I've<00:02:34.670> mentioned<00:02:34.760> before<00:02:34.940> no<00:02:35.330> peas

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
yeah so I've mentioned before no peas

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.900 
yeah so I've mentioned before no peas
but<00:02:35.720> talking<00:02:36.230> while<00:02:36.920> you're<00:02:37.130> making<00:02:37.400> an<00:02:37.640> LP

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
but talking while you're making an LP

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.250 
but talking while you're making an LP
takes<00:02:38.300> up<00:02:38.450> about<00:02:38.570> half<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.959> your<00:02:39.050> praying

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
takes up about half of your praying

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.410 
takes up about half of your praying
power<00:02:39.500> while<00:02:39.740> you're<00:02:39.860> playing<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:41.150> you're

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
power while you're playing and so you're

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.640 
power while you're playing and so you're
trying<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.660> come<00:02:41.750> up<00:02:41.780> with<00:02:41.840> interesting<00:02:42.380> or

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
trying to come up with interesting or

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.620 
trying to come up with interesting or
consistent<00:02:43.430> things<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.880> say<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.150> here<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.540> is

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
consistent things to say so here it is

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.260 
consistent things to say so here it is
third<00:02:44.959> time<00:02:45.290> we're<00:02:46.100> gonna<00:02:46.190> go<00:02:46.430> on<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.910> top<00:02:47.120> of

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
third time we're gonna go on the top of

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.600 
third time we're gonna go on the top of
the<00:02:47.330> track<00:02:47.570> I<00:02:47.870> made<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.560> around<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:49.130> think<00:02:49.370> I

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
the track I made it around I think I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.030 
the track I made it around I think I
made<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.030> second<00:02:50.510> part<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:50.870> top<00:02:51.140> once<00:02:51.709> out<00:02:51.950> of

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
made the second part on top once out of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.520 
made the second part on top once out of
the<00:02:52.130> three<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:53.090> made<00:02:53.270> this<00:02:53.510> one<00:02:53.780> all<00:02:54.110> three

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
the three and I made this one all three

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.780 
the three and I made this one all three
times<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.040> one<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.400> matters<00:02:55.670> this

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
times and this is one that matters this

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.400 
times and this is one that matters this
is<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.030> one<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.270> cuts<00:02:56.480> off<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.110> much<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.350> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
is the one that cuts off so much of the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.260 
is the one that cuts off so much of the
track<00:02:57.620> if<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:57.830> do<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.070> right<00:02:58.250> it's<00:02:58.970> tricky

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
track if you do it right it's tricky

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.150 
track if you do it right it's tricky
because<00:02:59.420> you<00:03:00.140> may<00:03:00.380> have<00:03:00.470> noticed<00:03:00.800> on<00:03:01.130> that

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
because you may have noticed on that

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.100 
because you may have noticed on that
first<00:03:01.489> lap<00:03:01.610> I<00:03:01.730> blew<00:03:01.970> up<00:03:02.000> on<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:02.420> jump<00:03:02.660> you

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
first lap I blew up on that jump you

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.840 
first lap I blew up on that jump you
have<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.440> slow<00:03:03.800> down<00:03:03.830> for<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.250> corners<00:03:04.610> and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
have to slow down for the corners and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.990 
have to slow down for the corners and
then<00:03:05.090> get<00:03:05.390> up<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.750> like<00:03:05.870> five<00:03:06.170> six<00:03:06.410> hundred

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
then get up to like five six hundred

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.640 
then get up to like five six hundred
someone<00:03:08.000> told<00:03:08.150> me<00:03:08.300> that<00:03:08.330> them<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:09.110> think<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.530> was

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
someone told me that them I think it was

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.320 
someone told me that them I think it was
obi-wan<00:03:10.220> Kenobi<00:03:10.640> thanks<00:03:10.880> for<00:03:11.000> telling<00:03:11.299> me

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
obi-wan Kenobi thanks for telling me

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.509 
obi-wan Kenobi thanks for telling me
that<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:12.110> Star<00:03:12.890> Wars<00:03:12.920> universe<00:03:13.100> actually

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
that the Star Wars universe actually

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.710 
that the Star Wars universe actually
uses<00:03:13.970> SI<00:03:14.360> units<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:16.100> would<00:03:16.220> be<00:03:16.720> kilometres

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
uses SI units so it would be kilometres

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.539 
uses SI units so it would be kilometres
per<00:03:17.750> hour<00:03:17.959> which<00:03:18.320> makes<00:03:18.560> sense<00:03:18.709> actually<00:03:18.980> 600

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
per hour which makes sense actually 600

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.039 
per hour which makes sense actually 600
kilometres<00:03:19.880> an<00:03:19.970> hour<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.239> good<00:03:20.630> speed<00:03:20.870> for<00:03:20.900> a

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
kilometres an hour is a good speed for a

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.190 
kilometres an hour is a good speed for a
pod<00:03:21.230> racer<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.620> be<00:03:21.709> going<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.430> makes<00:03:22.610> sense<00:03:23.200> so

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
pod racer to be going it makes sense so

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.140 
pod racer to be going it makes sense so
yeah<00:03:24.350> so<00:03:24.860> you<00:03:24.920> basically<00:03:25.100> you<00:03:25.459> have<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:25.790> gif

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
yeah so you basically you have this gif

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.250 
yeah so you basically you have this gif
of<00:03:26.269> two<00:03:26.450> turns<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.989> then<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:27.140> have<00:03:27.230> a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
of two turns and then you have a

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.360 
of two turns and then you have a
straightaway<00:03:27.620> in<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.769> middle<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.100> jump

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
straightaway in the middle of the jump

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.310 
straightaway in the middle of the jump
you<00:03:28.790> have<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.000> slow<00:03:29.239> down<00:03:29.480> enough<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.019> make

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
you have to slow down enough to make

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.620 
you have to slow down enough to make
those<00:03:30.500> turns<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:31.220> then<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:32.000> have<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.269> speed

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
those turns and then you have to speed

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.570 
those turns and then you have to speed
up<00:03:32.780> in<00:03:32.930> between<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.440> two<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:34.220> we're<00:03:34.430> going<00:03:34.549> to

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
up in between the two and we're going to

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.130 
up in between the two and we're going to
have<00:03:34.730> enough<00:03:35.000> speed<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.299> make<00:03:35.600> that<00:03:35.750> jump<00:03:35.989> you

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
have enough speed to make that jump you

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.050 
have enough speed to make that jump you
can<00:03:36.260> do<00:03:36.410> it<00:03:36.530> at<00:03:36.620> about<00:03:36.739> 4<00:03:37.130> or<00:03:37.160> 500<00:03:37.730> if<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:37.850> pull

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
can do it at about 4 or 500 if you pull

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.970 
can do it at about 4 or 500 if you pull
back<00:03:38.150> on<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.390> joystick<00:03:38.570> 5<00:03:39.290> or<00:03:39.410> 600<00:03:39.590> or<00:03:39.830> blog

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
back on the joystick 5 or 600 or blog

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.340 
back on the joystick 5 or 600 or blog
right<00:03:40.160> over<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:41.450> that's<00:03:41.630> my<00:03:41.750> advice<00:03:41.870> is<00:03:42.200> try

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
right over so that's my advice is try

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.100 
right over so that's my advice is try
and<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.769> for<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.400> turns<00:03:43.700> if<00:03:44.450> you're<00:03:44.600> taking<00:03:45.019> a

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
and and for the turns if you're taking a

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.020 
and and for the turns if you're taking a
you're<00:03:45.410> driving<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.100> pod<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.519> has<00:03:46.580> a

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
you're driving a pod that has a

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.520 
you're driving a pod that has a
reasonable<00:03:47.600> amount<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.840> turning<00:03:48.200> but<00:03:48.350> not

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
reasonable amount of turning but not

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.810 
reasonable amount of turning but not
overly<00:03:50.650> upgraded<00:03:51.650> like<00:03:51.799> bull's-eyes<00:03:52.190> is<00:03:52.519> for

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
overly upgraded like bull's-eyes is for

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.660 
overly upgraded like bull's-eyes is for
this<00:03:52.940> well<00:03:53.150> P<00:03:53.299> I<00:03:53.950> would<00:03:54.950> say<00:03:55.130> take<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:55.459> in<00:03:55.640> like

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
this well P I would say take it in like

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.080 
this well P I would say take it in like
300<00:03:56.769> kilometers<00:03:57.769> but<00:03:58.010> yeah<00:03:58.730> here<00:03:58.880> we<00:03:58.910> are

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
300 kilometers but yeah here we are

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.400 
300 kilometers but yeah here we are
victory

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
victory

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.410 
victory
pretty<00:04:00.980> good<00:04:01.130> but<00:04:01.550> if<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:01.700> kept<00:04:01.880> taking<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.150> pod

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
pretty good but if it kept taking a pod

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.180 
pretty good but if it kept taking a pod
like<00:04:02.630> bullseye<00:04:03.080> de<00:04:03.140> as<00:04:03.410> you've<00:04:03.950> really

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
like bullseye de as you've really

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.280 
like bullseye de as you've really
operated<00:04:04.490> the<00:04:04.580> turning<00:04:04.880> on<00:04:05.000> take<00:04:05.960> it<00:04:06.080> it<00:04:06.170> like

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
operated the turning on take it it like

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.480 
operated the turning on take it it like
200-250

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
200-250

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.250 
200-250
no<00:04:08.060> more<00:04:08.240> than<00:04:08.390> that<00:04:08.540> otherwise<00:04:09.050> it<00:04:09.170> gets

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
no more than that otherwise it gets

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.800 
no more than that otherwise it gets
impossible<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.830> control<00:04:10.240> yeah<00:04:11.240> so<00:04:11.480> there<00:04:11.720> it

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
impossible to control yeah so there it

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.220 
impossible to control yeah so there it
is

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
is

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.120 
is
total<00:04:13.070> time<00:04:13.250> three<00:04:14.030> minutes<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.570> fifty<00:04:15.130> 58

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
total time three minutes and fifty 58

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.300 
total time three minutes and fifty 58
seconds<00:04:17.170> so<00:04:18.170> seven<00:04:18.590> seconds<00:04:18.920> fast<00:04:19.100> when<00:04:19.250> a

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
seconds so seven seconds fast when a

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.520 
seconds so seven seconds fast when a
body's<00:04:19.670> best<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:20.120> we<00:04:20.209> saw<00:04:20.420> that's<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.320> true

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
body's best that we saw that's a true

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.590 
body's best that we saw that's a true
victory<00:04:21.950> on<00:04:22.070> abyss<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.670> that's<00:04:22.940> a<00:04:23.180> that's<00:04:23.450> a

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
victory on abyss and that's a that's a

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.300 
victory on abyss and that's a that's a
victory<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:24.200> can<00:04:24.380> be<00:04:24.710> proud<00:04:24.890> up<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.160> show
