00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
but you'll see it's a little bit like

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.750 
but you'll see it's a little bit like
the<00:03:30.319> seaside<00:03:30.769> I<00:03:30.799> think<00:03:31.250> if<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.459> live<00:03:31.610> in<00:03:31.640> the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
the seaside I think if you live in the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.069 
the seaside I think if you live in the
middle<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.120> country's<00:03:32.569> probably<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
middle of the country's probably the

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.860 
middle of the country's probably the
easiest<00:03:33.439> place<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.709> get<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.090> rather<00:03:35.090> than<00:03:35.359> go

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
easiest place to get to rather than go

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.559 
easiest place to get to rather than go
to<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.140> seaside<00:03:36.609> it's<00:03:37.609> got<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.849> usual<00:03:38.030> fish

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
to the seaside it's got the usual fish

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.910 
to the seaside it's got the usual fish
and<00:03:38.750> chips<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:39.469> ice<00:03:40.459> creams<00:03:40.969> arcades<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.709> it

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
and chips and ice creams arcades so it

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.660 
and chips and ice creams arcades so it
certainly<00:03:43.159> has<00:03:43.489> that<00:03:43.519> kind<00:03:43.819> of<00:03:43.939> feel<00:03:44.180> about<00:03:44.420> it

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
certainly has that kind of feel about it

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.089 
certainly has that kind of feel about it
you're<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.330> a<00:03:46.390> car<00:03:46.630> it<00:03:47.440> can<00:03:47.620> be<00:03:47.709> very<00:03:47.740> busy

particularly where a lot of the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.509 
particularly where a lot of the
motorbikes<00:04:14.340> tend<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.700> congregate

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.240 

step<00:04:19.519> behind<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.849> big<00:04:19.970> lorry<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:21.680> may<00:04:21.889> well<00:04:22.129> be

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
step behind a big lorry you may well be

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.070 
step behind a big lorry you may well be
going<00:04:22.520> off<00:04:22.639> to<00:04:22.789> the<00:04:22.879> vidalia<00:04:24.879> because<00:04:25.879> it<00:04:26.840> down

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
going off to the vidalia because it down

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.869 
going off to the vidalia because it down

there as P builders merchants and

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.439 
there as P builders merchants and
quarries<00:04:29.319> so<00:04:30.319> it<00:04:30.710> tends<00:04:30.949> to<00:04:31.009> be<00:04:31.099> a<00:04:31.190> lot<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.449> very

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
quarries so it tends to be a lot of very

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.050 
quarries so it tends to be a lot of very
large

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
large

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.010 
large
commercial<00:04:34.810> vehicles<00:04:35.260> down<00:04:35.440> there

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.240 

we're<00:04:40.020> coming<00:04:40.260> onto<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.560> light<00:04:40.710> so<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:41.040> can

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
we're coming onto the light so we can

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.590 
we're coming onto the light so we can
filter<00:04:41.610> see<00:04:41.790> in<00:04:41.850> any<00:04:42.120> event<00:04:42.270> so<00:04:44.270> be<00:04:45.270> able<00:04:45.450> to

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
filter see in any event so be able to

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.170 
filter see in any event so be able to
get<00:04:45.750> past<00:04:45.960> them

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
get past them

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.559 
get past them
standing<00:04:47.509> in<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.750> event

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
standing in the event

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:55.690
