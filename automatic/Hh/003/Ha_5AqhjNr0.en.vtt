zuhr vs irk but this was supposed to be
a<00:00:12.240> good<00:00:12.389> game<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.929> decided<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.650> go<00:00:13.740> with<00:00:13.860> it

and Dark Elf on hitchhiker which is an
interesting<00:00:21.960> map<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.529> has<00:00:22.650> made<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.070> some

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
interesting map and has made for some

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.830 
interesting map and has made for some
interesting<00:00:23.220> games<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.359> symmetrical

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
interesting games it is a symmetrical

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.920 
interesting games it is a symmetrical
map<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> fairly<00:00:25.980> narrow<00:00:26.099> pathway<00:00:26.930> and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
map with a fairly narrow pathway and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.359 
map with a fairly narrow pathway and
direct<00:00:28.260> pathway<00:00:28.560> between<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.920> two<00:00:29.039> bases

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
direct pathway between the two bases

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.319 
direct pathway between the two bases
there<00:00:29.640> are<00:00:29.760> only<00:00:29.970> two<00:00:30.269> spawn<00:00:30.510> locations<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:32.329> it

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
there are only two spawn locations so it

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.450 
there are only two spawn locations so it
does<00:00:33.570> reduce<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.260> necessary<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.860> early<00:00:35.280> game

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
does reduce the necessary of early game

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.069 
does reduce the necessary of early game
scouting<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:36.180> terms<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.510> finding<00:00:36.780> out<00:00:36.960> exactly

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
scouting in terms of finding out exactly

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.319 
scouting in terms of finding out exactly
where<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.739> opponent<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.250> though<00:00:39.210> obviously

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
where your opponent is though obviously

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.790 
where your opponent is though obviously
you<00:00:39.629> still<00:00:39.690> need<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.960> scout<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.680> know

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you still need to scout to to know

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.229 
you still need to scout to to know
exactly<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.340> build<00:00:41.670> order<00:00:41.879> they're<00:00:42.030> going

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
exactly what build order they're going

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.880 
exactly what build order they're going
for<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.860> swing<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:45.200> pretty<00:00:46.200> solid<00:00:46.559> player

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
for the swing is a pretty solid player

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.279 
for the swing is a pretty solid player
all<00:00:47.160> around<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.670> don't<00:00:47.879> think<00:00:48.120> he<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.629> very<00:00:49.050> weak

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
all around I don't think he is very weak

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.049 
all around I don't think he is very weak
at<00:00:49.440> any<00:00:49.620> given<00:00:49.950> matchup<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:50.940> gave

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
at any given matchup he really gave

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.119 
at any given matchup he really gave
Savior<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.690> run<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.320> his<00:00:52.410> money<00:00:52.469> last<00:00:52.890> time

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
Savior a run for his money last time

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
players who took Savior all the way in

players who took Savior all the way in
the<00:00:57.420> best-of-five<00:00:57.780> matchups<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.340> I<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:01.170> he's

started at the top left corner of the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.710 
started at the top left corner of the
map<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.200> dark<00:01:29.189> elf<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.970> bottom<00:01:30.570> right

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
map and dark elf is in the bottom right

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.370 
map and dark elf is in the bottom right
corner<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> map<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:32.600> think<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
corner of the map I think that the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380 
corner of the map I think that the
nature<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.920> map<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.460> think<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> first

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
nature of this map I think the first

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.480 
nature of this map I think the first
thing<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> cheese<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.500> less<00:01:37.979> likely

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
thing is that the cheese is less likely

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.580 
thing is that the cheese is less likely
it's<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:39.150> difficult<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> proxy<00:01:40.380> build

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it's very difficult to do a proxy build

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.330 
it's very difficult to do a proxy build
on<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.829> map<00:01:41.360> because<00:01:42.360> again<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
on this map because again of the of the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.219 
on this map because again of the of the
structure<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> map<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> same

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
structure of the map but at the same

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.139 
structure of the map but at the same
time<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.460> those<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
time you know you do have those kind of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.760 
time you know you do have those kind of
floating<00:01:48.600> current<00:01:48.960> factories<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.619> can

floating current factories that you can
you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.040> float<00:01:50.250> over<00:01:50.610> 44<00:01:51.119> cut<00:01:51.390> her<00:01:51.540> ass<00:01:51.720> with

you can float over 44 cut her ass with
your<00:01:52.079> vultures<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> wouldn't<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.610> surprised

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
your vultures so I wouldn't be surprised

this really is a mirror match up for for
all<00:02:13.160> intents<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.670> purposes<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:16.190> know<00:02:16.280> we<00:02:16.430> can

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
all intents and purposes you know we can

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.010 
all intents and purposes you know we can
expect<00:02:16.850> both<00:02:17.000> players<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.480> put<00:02:17.630> up<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.810> factory

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
expect both players to put up a factory

expect both players to put up a factory
based<00:02:18.350> on<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.800> you<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:19.010> see<00:02:19.130> that<00:02:19.160> there

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
based on that and you can see that there

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.010 
based on that and you can see that there
there's<00:02:19.730> dark<00:02:20.030> elf<00:02:20.210> going<00:02:20.480> for<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:20.750> oh<00:02:20.780> no

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
there's dark elf going for that oh no

he's not he's not he's putting up supply
depots<00:02:22.910> there<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:24.190> he's<00:02:25.190> actually<00:02:25.370> blocking

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
depots there so he's actually blocking

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.800 
depots there so he's actually blocking
off<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.510> those<00:02:27.110> neutral<00:02:27.470> buildings<00:02:27.800> I

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
off that those neutral buildings I

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.390 
off that those neutral buildings I
thought<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:29.960> know<00:02:30.080> if<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.620> game<00:02:30.800> goes<00:02:31.130> goes

thought you know if this game goes goes
longer<00:02:31.820> on<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.150> goes<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.570> late<00:02:32.750> game<00:02:32.990> then

longer on it goes to a late game then

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.410 
longer on it goes to a late game then
that<00:02:33.530> might<00:02:33.890> prove<00:02:34.130> beneficial<00:02:34.340> later<00:02:35.000> on<00:02:35.240> to

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that might prove beneficial later on to

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.380

to get that SCD through those neutral
buildings<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.810> was<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.050> purpose<00:02:54.260> of

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.430 
buildings and that was the purpose of
building<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.800> supply<00:02:55.070> depot<00:02:55.400> there<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:56.660> even

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
building that supply depot there so even

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.920

the neutral buildings and he's going to
come<00:03:03.500> around<00:03:03.590> from<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.950> side<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:05.320> his<00:03:06.320> side<00:03:06.800> of

to scout exactly what her Swain is

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.710 
to scout exactly what her Swain is
building<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:10.760> was<00:03:10.970> very<00:03:11.000> clever<00:03:11.300> by<00:03:11.510> dark

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
those neutral buildings so dark I'll

works<00:03:29.870> out<00:03:30.050> for<00:03:30.290> him<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:31.000> he's<00:03:32.000> actually

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
works out for him and he's actually

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.850 
works out for him and he's actually
actually<00:03:32.510> making<00:03:32.780> double<00:03:33.080> factories<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:33.709> his

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
actually making double factories so his

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.250 
actually making double factories so his
fan<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.130> making<00:03:34.400> two<00:03:34.610> factories<00:03:35.090> there<00:03:35.330> you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
fan is making two factories there you

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.949 
fan is making two factories there you
know<00:03:36.380> he's<00:03:36.800> gonna<00:03:36.950> flow<00:03:37.220> one<00:03:37.459> over<00:03:37.700> and

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
know he's gonna flow one over and

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.690 
know he's gonna flow one over and
presumably<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.739> know<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.070> fact<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:40.550> he's

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
presumably you know the fact that he's

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.830 
presumably you know the fact that he's
making<00:03:40.970> two<00:03:41.060> factories<00:03:41.450> leads<00:03:41.600> me<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.810> believe

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
making two factories leads me to believe

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.540 
making two factories leads me to believe
he<00:03:42.110> might<00:03:42.350> be<00:03:42.590> going<00:03:42.709> for<00:03:42.980> kind<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.220> vulture

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
he might be going for kind of a vulture

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.090 
he might be going for kind of a vulture
