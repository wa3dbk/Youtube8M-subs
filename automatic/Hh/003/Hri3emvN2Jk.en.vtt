okay<00:00:02.010> this<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.399> replication<00:00:03.330> of<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.750> I

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
okay this is a replication of the I

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.309 
okay this is a replication of the I
motif<00:00:04.770> radiant<00:00:05.400> oscillator<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.750> people

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
motif radiant oscillator that people

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.780 
motif radiant oscillator that people
have<00:00:07.410> been<00:00:07.500> waiting<00:00:07.529> for<00:00:07.980> for<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.280> long<00:00:08.309> time

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
have been waiting for for a long time

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.360 
have been waiting for for a long time
and<00:00:09.230> perhaps<00:00:10.230> on<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.830> first<00:00:11.130> of

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
and perhaps on one of the first of

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.330 
and perhaps on one of the first of
replications<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.599> but<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.110> does<00:00:13.320> work<00:00:13.349> and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
replications of it but it does work and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.820 
replications of it but it does work and
follow<00:00:14.790> his<00:00:15.030> instructions<00:00:15.420> exactly<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.740> you

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
follow his instructions exactly and you

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.210 
follow his instructions exactly and you
have<00:00:17.400> an<00:00:17.520> amazing<00:00:17.789> machine<00:00:18.240> here<00:00:18.980> is<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
have an amazing machine here is the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.160 
have an amazing machine here is the
drive<00:00:20.490> battery<00:00:21.029> right<00:00:21.210> there<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.900> actually

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
drive battery right there so actually

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.750 
drive battery right there so actually
plugged<00:00:22.380> into<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> wall<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.189> charge<00:00:23.460> right

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
plugged into the wall to charge right

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.609 
plugged into the wall to charge right
now<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.210> there's<00:00:24.420> voltage<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.380> drive

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
now but there's voltage on the drive

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.150 
now but there's voltage on the drive
battery<00:00:26.099> I'm<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.510> rheostat<00:00:28.470> here

coil making a light go and at the same
time<00:00:40.620> charging<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.489> battery<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.290> does

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
time charging a battery and this does

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.850 
time charging a battery and this does
work<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:44.270> encourage<00:00:45.270> everybody<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
work I encourage everybody out there to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.630 
work I encourage everybody out there to
try<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.870> winner<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
try this this is a this is a winner and

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.459 
try this this is a this is a winner and
this<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:50.910> does<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.629> what<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.440> supposed

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
this actually does do what it's supposed

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
this actually does do what it's supposed
to<00:00:52.770> do<00:00:53.010> now<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.570> use<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> adjust<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
to do now I can use this to adjust the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.619 
to do now I can use this to adjust the
light<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.820> make<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> brighter<00:01:00.390> or

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
light and I can make it brighter or

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.630 
light and I can make it brighter or
dimmer<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:02.129> what<00:01:02.460> i'm<00:01:02.579> doing<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> i'm

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
dimmer and what i'm doing here is i'm

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.330 
dimmer and what i'm doing here is i'm
increasing<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:05.790> decreasing<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:07.380> drive<00:01:07.710> on

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
increasing or decreasing the drive on

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.450 
increasing or decreasing the drive on
this<00:01:08.909> thing<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.540> turn<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> down<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.070> drive

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
this thing and turn it down the drive

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.300 
this thing and turn it down the drive
voltage<00:01:11.490> goes<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.450> i<00:01:12.720> turn<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.159> force

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
voltage goes up i turn it up and force

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.429 
voltage goes up i turn it up and force
the<00:01:14.490> drive<00:01:14.700> voltage<00:01:14.729> goes<00:01:15.360> down<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.020> battery

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the drive voltage goes down this battery

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.330 
the drive voltage goes down this battery
is<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:16.680> very<00:01:16.950> good<00:01:17.250> right<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:17.630> but<00:01:18.630> it's

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
is not very good right now but it's

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.999 
is not very good right now but it's
charging<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.610> battery<00:01:21.200> while<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.560> lighting

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
charging a battery while it's lighting

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.390 
charging a battery while it's lighting
that<00:01:23.159> light<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.200> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.409> amazing<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.189> only

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that light and this is amazing the only

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.370 
that light and this is amazing the only
thing<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> don't<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.110> this

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
thing that I don't really like is this

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.350 
thing that I don't really like is this
does<00:01:28.680> make<00:01:28.890> noise<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> you'd<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:32.360> use

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
does make noise and so you'd have to use

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.870 
does make noise and so you'd have to use
a<00:01:33.390> 55<00:01:33.960> timer<00:01:34.350> or<00:01:34.740> insulate<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.759> do

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
a 55 timer or insulate that or do

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.480 
a 55 timer or insulate that or do
something<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.540> cause<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.259> oscillation<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.280> i

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
something to cause the oscillation but i

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.240 
something to cause the oscillation but i
was<00:01:39.000> amazed<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.689> self<00:01:39.960> oscillates<00:01:40.560> it's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
was amazed to think self oscillates it's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.289 
was amazed to think self oscillates it's
just<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.840> 9<00:01:42.840> volt<00:01:42.869> relay<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.549> capacitor

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
just a 9 volt relay with that capacitor

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.830 
just a 9 volt relay with that capacitor
and<00:01:45.450> resistor<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:47.549> coil<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and resistor and the coil this is the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.490 
and resistor and the coil this is the
drive<00:01:49.079> coil<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.829> he<00:01:50.549> recommended<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.960> this

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
drive coil that he recommended and this

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.910 
drive coil that he recommended and this
is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
is

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.710 
is
Chevy<00:01:53.720> coil<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.400> say<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:57.000> recommend<00:01:57.570> it

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
Chevy coil and like I say I recommend it

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.710 
Chevy coil and like I say I recommend it
call<00:01:57.900> it<00:01:57.930> instructions<00:01:58.500> exactly<00:01:59.509> before<00:02:00.509> you

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
call it instructions exactly before you

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.560 
call it instructions exactly before you
modify<00:02:01.290> anything<00:02:01.649> get<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.909> work<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.390> go

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
modify anything get it to work and go

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.469 
modify anything get it to work and go
from<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.430> amazing<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
from there but this is amazing this is a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.809 
from there but this is amazing this is a
fluorescent<00:02:07.200> light<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:08.130> didn't<00:02:08.520> put<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.729> all

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
fluorescent light I I didn't put it all

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.050 
fluorescent light I I didn't put it all
back<00:02:09.000> together<00:02:09.179> again<00:02:09.479> but<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:11.160> does<00:02:12.030> work

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
back together again but it does work

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.949 
back together again but it does work
quite<00:02:12.690> well<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:15.530> thank<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:18.540> I'm<00:02:18.750> sure

quite well and thank you and I'm sure

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:19.729 
quite well and thank you and I'm sure
there's<00:02:19.200> going<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.380> be<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.470> lot<00:02:19.709> of

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
there's going to be a lot of

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.630 
there's going to be a lot of
replications<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.580> this<00:02:21.319> but<00:02:22.319> it's<00:02:22.640> targeting

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
replications of this but it's targeting

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.540 
replications of this but it's targeting
a<00:02:23.849> battery<00:02:24.920> while<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.880> driving<00:02:27.480> at<00:02:27.630> light

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
a battery while it's driving at light

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.580 
a battery while it's driving at light
here's<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.640> amperage<00:02:30.150> by<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.480> way<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:31.019> can

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
here's the amperage by the way I can

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.520 
here's the amperage by the way I can
turn<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.010> down<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.549> about<00:02:32.730> half<00:02:33.120> an<00:02:33.360> amp<00:02:33.540> or

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
turn this down to about half an amp or

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.180 
turn this down to about half an amp or
less<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:36.120> crank<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.600> up<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.049> goes<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.500> to

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
less and I crank it up and it goes up to

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.199 
less and I crank it up and it goes up to
about<00:02:38.220> an<00:02:38.549> ampere<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:40.310> higher<00:02:41.310> voltages<00:02:42.000> this

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
about an ampere so higher voltages this

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.600 
about an ampere so higher voltages this
went<00:02:42.450> on<00:02:42.569> up<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.440> higher<00:02:43.650> amperage<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.430> course

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
went on up to higher amperage of course

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.480 
went on up to higher amperage of course
you<00:02:44.670> got<00:02:44.819> more<00:02:44.970> light<00:02:45.209> out<00:02:45.239> of
