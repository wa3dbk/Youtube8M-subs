like<00:02:31.060> so<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.480> pretty<00:02:32.660> easy<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.200> install

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.539

how the Apple logo looks like on the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.050 
how the Apple logo looks like on the
back<00:02:45.269> as<00:02:46.269> you<00:02:46.510> guys<00:02:46.629> can<00:02:46.870> see<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:48.640> camera<00:02:48.970> and

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
the flood shots it's a really deep

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.759 
the flood shots it's a really deep
inside<00:02:51.549> of<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.760> case<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.299> I<00:02:52.569> mean<00:02:53.200> your<00:02:53.409> camera

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
and the flash is probably protected and

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.979 
and the flash is probably protected and
