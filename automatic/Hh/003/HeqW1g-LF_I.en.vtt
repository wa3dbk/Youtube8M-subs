00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 or the girl after the day of avilés I wanted 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.210
 make this video I will do this 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.460
 makeup that is super fast with the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.929
 palette miguelín of clouds that asked me 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.740
 much from the past video where the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.470
 review and I'll show you how it looks 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.080
 with four different lipsticks is 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.280
 killing a thousand birds with one stone because 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.830
 Buy these lipsticks 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.520
 maybelline also with the caps 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.290
 lilac and they are very spring-summer 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.470
 so I wanted to show you a little 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.760
 how it looks with this same makeup 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.150
 then at the end they will see all the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.460
 bumps and good if you like how it looks 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.559
 they are served the first ones I will do my 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.020
 face i'm going to use this quick base 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.940
 maybelline makeup teach them snap the 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.350
 first day that I used it 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.809
 he was quite surprised because despite 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.970
 It rubs cream be super good not 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.760
 It covers a lot, but it lasted for a long time 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.800
 and I liked it as well 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.140
 it's like when you want to use a bible 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.670
 kind that is how very light it is not 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.399
 there's nothing more to be covered 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.229
 necessary then you're problem of the 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.369
 weather I think and well I will use this seen 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.369
 new golden space 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.900
 and this abuse with my sponge or with a 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.900
 Normal brush 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.820
 I'm going to look a little bit right 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.530
 and if I'm just going to comb those 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.150
 now we're going with the eyes I'm going to use 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.150
 give me knot violin 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.829
 and they asked me to make a look 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.530
 so then I said what I'm going to put here 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.830
 same in this video so let's go to 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.930
 start from the first this shadow the 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.930
 I'm going to put in the bone of my daughters 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.480
 I like it because it's pretty shiny 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.430
 but not like that it does not look like prices and 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.200
 super bright but super shiny pay 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.780
 but like when you move or so 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.060
 as transition color I will occupy is 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.060
 the basin 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.319
 and for the whole eyelid I'm going to mix 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.319
 is with the gold here 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.769
 will give super nice shine 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.659
 and I will go through the account again 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.989
 that same color that had already 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.989
 taught 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.420
 with this same applicator that I'm going to 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:17.200
 take this area here 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.440
 and I'm going to put it under my feet 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.730
 I'm going to use a little bit of my study 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.730
 that I just met 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.940
 topics that I'm going to use my 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.860
 telescopic 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.430
 at that time my favorite Senate 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.430
 Contact 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.730

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.040
 we return on the lips that is a 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.140
 part of our four's fault of 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.330
 this line that I 'm not sure how it 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.210
 call but they are seen as tapas 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.130

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.980

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.360
 xi I find that information but I 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.850
 I have four I know there was someone else 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:06.000

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.000
 three a day this month 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.680
 but I said to this super cool because that's how 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.480
 I do not know exactly how many more are but 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.970
 is the community of the colors of the 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.739

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.380
 to this color because it's pretty clear 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.380
 for me 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.169
 well, we have hibiscus by jalisco

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.400
 pass them several times so there is a 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.410
 color more or less close to this but not 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.410
