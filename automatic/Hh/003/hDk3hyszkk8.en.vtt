only<00:02:08.190> four<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.759> their<00:02:09.119> class<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.810> they<00:02:10.379> only

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
only four in their class and they only

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.080 
only four in their class and they only

submachine guns and that can be a bit of
a<00:03:03.349> challenge<00:03:03.560> that's<00:03:03.860> much<00:03:04.099> harder<00:03:04.280> for<00:03:04.459> me

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
a challenge that's much harder for me

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.789 
a challenge that's much harder for me
than<00:03:04.730> getting<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.390> 150<00:03:06.019> kills<00:03:06.230> with<00:03:06.380> no<00:03:06.530> perks

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
than getting the 150 kills with no perks

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.100 
than getting the 150 kills with no perks
150<00:03:07.400> with<00:03:07.519> no<00:03:07.640> attachments<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.450> 10

150 with no attachments the 10

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.699 
150 with no attachments the 10
bloodthirsty<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.370> 30<00:03:10.640> revenge<00:03:11.440> it's<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.560> lot

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
bloodthirsty the 30 revenge it's a lot

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.289 
bloodthirsty the 30 revenge it's a lot
harder<00:03:12.890> for<00:03:13.190> me<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.310> do<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.700> hundred<00:03:14.030> head

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
harder for me to do the hundred head

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.880 
harder for me to do the hundred head
shots<00:03:14.569> because<00:03:14.750> that<00:03:14.930> does<00:03:15.110> take<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.349> long<00:03:15.620> time

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
shots because that does take a long time

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.300 
shots because that does take a long time
and<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:17.570> in<00:03:17.870> my<00:03:18.109> opinion<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.829> best<00:03:18.980> way<00:03:19.250> to

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
and the in my opinion the best way to

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.940 
and the in my opinion the best way to
get<00:03:19.549> headshots<00:03:19.820> is<00:03:20.390> just<00:03:21.079> straight-up<00:03:21.380> go<00:03:21.680> for

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
get headshots is just straight-up go for

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.550 
get headshots is just straight-up go for
headshots<00:03:22.100> now<00:03:22.940> whenever<00:03:23.780> you're<00:03:24.049> going<00:03:24.380> for

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
headshots now whenever you're going for

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.000 
headshots now whenever you're going for
headshots<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.970> think<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.019> best<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.410> hip<00:03:27.739> fire

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
headshots I think it is best to hip fire

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.000 
headshots I think it is best to hip fire
up<00:03:28.370> at<00:03:28.549> the<00:03:28.670> waist<00:03:28.940> up<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.840> chest<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:30.530> up<00:03:30.799> and

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
whenever they hit you too whenever they

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.059

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
going to get headshots a lot of time

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.080 
going to get headshots a lot of time
that's<00:03:39.829> why<00:03:40.010> whenever<00:03:40.280> I'm<00:03:40.519> going<00:03:40.819> for

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
that's why whenever I'm going for

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.940
