 new moon the solar energies and 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.700
 moles melt and there is difficulty in 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.710

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.500
 dreams and feelings and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.330
 realities of the outside world also 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.880
 signals the beginning of a new cycle 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.279
 lunar the opportunity to integrate 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.500
 masculine and feminine energies of 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.320
 animus and the animates in the psyche itself 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.720
 to encourage internal growth the

 close contact between the sun and the moon 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.680
 indicates that you have a force 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.320
 interior superior to most of the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.660
 people like to be independent with 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.730
 tendency to live for yourself and is 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.070
 Probably from time to time you will be isolated 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.620
 mentally closing you on your own 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.739
 world even occasionally in a way 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.989
 real looking for solitude you prefer 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.539
 lean on yourself before on the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.820
 people around you since you need 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.460
 express creatively and confidently 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.199
 your own individuality the image that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.840
 you have of you and that you want to give to 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.030
 others will find it very important to your 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.990
 ability to work with people 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.180
 greater as with 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.280
 areas younger than you is a true 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.710
 gift and this talent gives you great 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.770
 ability to mediate between both parties 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.229
 and resolve generational conflicts 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.210
 motivated by your own means and you're 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.909
 able to take care of you and take your autonomy 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.189
 to a high degree even though you have 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.830
 creativity and originality when you 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.649
 obstinate is too much try to reflect 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.689
 maybe it's better that you step back 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.729
 how much affective life is concerned 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.860
 tell you that it would not hurt to give 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.319
 little love to others and stop 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.940
 always be waiting to receive as a 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.159
 Sometimes you get carried away by your 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.009
 feelings that tend to be centered 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.229
 in your own self you feel at ease with 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.330
 your personality and your temperament but 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.909
 your personal dealings can be something 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.580
 cold since you prefer to keep certain 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.950
 distance you do not allow anyone to 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.860
 goal in your private life and usually 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.439
 You are not interested in matters either 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.319
 intimate of others in your relationships 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.209
 you usually avoid taking the first step 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.459
 Whoever wants to meet you must take the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.019
 initiative but you are so sensitive and 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.800
 you are so afraid that your 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.720
 feelings 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.780
 can be injured that costs you 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.430
 establishing a deep relationship deserves 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.650
 It's worth working on overcoming that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.050
 trend because maybe one day you 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.420
 you'll find only when you're in trouble 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.130
 and you would like to be able to go to a person 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.130
 of trust and open your heart
