00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello everyone knows the ghost 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.210
 today I would like to make a 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.349
 video a bit special because that for a 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.710
 time I'm going to do that kind of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.660
 videos 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.279
 but before I will tell you about the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.539
 walking dead and more particularly from 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.369
 game edited by activision and developed 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.350
 by terminal reality 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.699
 we will do a little decryption on 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.980
 very first video that the audience has 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.769
 could see about the game but before we 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.080
 will talk about the status of the sale of the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.800
 franchise of so the games series 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.059
 video in this January 3, 2013 then had 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.129
 no date for those who do not know 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.079
 is a basic comics that has been adapted 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.300
 in TV series who am not 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.530
 faithfully the temple of the comics I find 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.989
 that it's a good idea because it allows 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 to see characters that appear 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.890
 rather they die earlier so that 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.879
 gives an alternative 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.039
 events I find it's a 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.480
 good idea the unclassified has had a big 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.480
 success is where I speak to you the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.829
 fourth season has been confirmed but in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.199
 this moment knows it the third season 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.120
 which is broadcast in the united states I think 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.729
 that she will be arriving here soon 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.260
 shortly thereafter what 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.360
 we are interested in video games 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.549
 so yes there is a game is a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.030
 video game the walking dead on facebook 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.070
 but I will not talk about it sorry 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.290
 I will tell you about the game that feels for 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.950
 many games of the year revelation of 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.440
 the year 2012 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.970
 i want to speak t5 course the good game 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.549
 line is published and europe is 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.440
 developed by tt games on me what would 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.940
 to saint just and not in fact it's that 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.409
 these games have a lifetime each 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.240
 about three hours per episode 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.640
 so do the math three times 5 15 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.909
 food we have already exceeded to say and he 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.140
 most fps and other games 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.299
 the year of which concerning the gameplay 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.619
 it's a rotten game nick leake and helped 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.210
 adventure where the goal is going to be to see 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.920
 survive the zombies the danger does come 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.899
 not always code outside and yes 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.550
 like in a mass effect also your 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.210
 choices will have an impact throughout all 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.649
 five episodes 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.759
 besides as long as I talk about horses 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.690
 ch 2 beautiful a very important thing 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.460
 in the gameplay 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.039
 in the game the choices you'll have to 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.300
 do will very quickly not 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.979
 the time to weigh the for and account that 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.810
 I leave you very little time there 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.060
 meet weeks of game frenzy 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.409
 incredible added if at that a 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.819
 atmosphere a writing and narration 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.709
 perfect you have a game that you 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.140
 put on which you want 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.430
 to have the following 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.450
 of course this game a texan credit that 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.370
 a dazzling success 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.750
 more the game that only sold 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.739
 I'm in shape he's going to be entitled to a 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.110
 box version 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.730
 only negative point you will tell me game is 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.190
 only in English but patches 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.470
 to add French subtitles 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.329
 exists of course and of course when one is 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.650
 at the top we can only go down and 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.390
 it's now because we attack the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.900
 decryption of the video unveiled by 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.900
 activity 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.580
 presentation video is where we do not 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.100
 could already see that 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.080
 there is it looks like a ford is as soon 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.030
 that I saw that I did to the ford is 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.370
 still there we can see the engine 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.970
 graph with the flames so the dough 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.090
 stop 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.000
 the first we say we see good 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.620
 also sees the big shotgun of 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.540
 blackbird 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.700
 finally maybe from sea ​​or from his brother 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.100
 dixon because the game will be based on that one 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.810
 continues the video it has a good side he 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.760
 had to be drunk 1 it was the 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.620
 first day of the year so he did the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.850
 party and where we do not know too much but here we 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.880
 will make a still picture of you 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.460
 see here 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.040
 do you see the mouth of the 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.650
 zombie greets it looks like a playmobil 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.000
 look at his haircut but that's 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.300
 awful omen nothing good for the 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.310
 after 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.660
 we can also see the knife rather 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.010
 well in his plant is against the 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.720
 blood on his shirt and tqs 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.140
 next let's talk about are so it's about 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.530
 music 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.180
 so hope the game music 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.370
 be fine so here we just had a 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.170
 scene where the character launches a 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.120
 bottle to attract people bis but 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.890
 it has not seemed to work well it 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.860
 look like a lot but good 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.330
 it is not serious 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.860
 so there the game takes place in a 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.290
 clampin so we see the player getting 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.670
 to walk in atlanta with 1h what 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.900
 always make think of the east ford a 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.420
 Great clearing to wander 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.220
 cushy good always full of zombies here 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.250
 this shock scene is the most 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.370
 important of the video counted there is 1 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.370
 2 3 4 5 6 7 mio - it's long but they 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.620
 continue ok I do like it and we're going 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.710
 Carry on 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.530
 and when the guy turns around there is 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.050
 only one message his mates they are where 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.530
 frankly it does not bode well 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.530
 for the future 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.160
 seeing in an empty building 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.320
 so there we feel the atmosphere at the king 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.570
 day of ehf help but then it's 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.070
 whatever 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.840
 the guy but and jostles all the zombies 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.169
 he gets hit by all the zombies 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.180
 and he goes through 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.340
 it's anything but in games 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.330
 video in the comics in the series on 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.240
 never saw that a survivor who passes 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.660
 through all the zombies they would have 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.260
 had to die right from the first 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.500
 what 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.600
 so here's a little video decryption 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.729
 the walking dead on the flights a stent 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.650
 is written amc top left so I 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:23.020
 think it's them approved by society 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.389
 mg france and the one that makes the series 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.520
 way it's a TV thing and where I 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.389
 know more too much but in any case this 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.660
 video my god it's a strong soufflé of 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.680
 two excuse me if you if you find 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.310
 that the game looks cool but not me 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.310
 That's all I had to say
