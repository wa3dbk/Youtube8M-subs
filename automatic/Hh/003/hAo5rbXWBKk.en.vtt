00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello youtube as a multi yellow again 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.310
 here and especially quiet again 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.020
 tuned 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.670
 there is something new about windows 8 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.260
 and today we'll have a look 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.690
 quick start for the system control 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.309
 as you can see from the screen 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.240
 first look at no access 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.820
 system control and could only time 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.590
 guess what is possible only one thing 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.029
 it's relatively easy for us to go here 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.099
 on the desktop version has seen me 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.109
 Just click on the desktop here 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.090
 your country is broken down 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.140
 could because the right mouse button and her 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.950
 can immediately control the system 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.059
 dial anmailen 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.870
 that is, however, in such 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.760
 then you can form that way 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.200
 attitude now we need to see 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.579
 I now on the desktop, the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.480
 but is not relevant for the fall 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.510
 begin 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.950
 I did not want that down again 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.030
 in and you can also if the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.480
 other things are doing here 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.579
 prompt perform explorer 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.910
 taskmanager is everything there manager 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.859
 System great thing as particularly resourceful 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.710
 it is important to be working 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:07.380
 could also enter it directly 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.530
 you can soballa right into the moment 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.240
 shows itself directly into the mini 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.770
 that means you can in cmd options 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.320
 go or barely able it is all 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.299
 simply impossible and no witchcraft 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.950
 no witchcraft actually not that way 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.869
 Bad as people do it is only 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.000
 if you have this standard screen 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.409
 here that was of course google that 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.759
 it's not a bit of it 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.280
 complicated have second monitor turn 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.869
 that's why i have to rethink away from me 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.150
 always see the standard screen here 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.540
 go to desktop chuck from there 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.820
 won and when the tick is 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.990
 still right click side in everything 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.650
 otherwise you can easily do it yourself 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.710
 go up here 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.259
 if the search gives system and 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.040
 already from the control panel there you are 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.960
 also disconnect there 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.890
 that's the number two option 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.149
 covered with it and I think 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.369
 so that we are already at the end again 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.100
 if you have any questions ask sony 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.829
 com is looking forward to every response 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.909
 and I say that as a multi plot 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.909
 to Munich
