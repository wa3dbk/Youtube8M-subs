reality yes friends hardware is hot
there's<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> whole<00:00:20.010> bunch<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.340> new<00:00:20.520> prototyping

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
there's a whole bunch of new prototyping

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
printing and like a laser cutter that

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.450 
printing and like a laser cutter that
have<00:00:25.140> really<00:00:25.380> bought<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.830> price<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
have really bought the price and the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.689 
have really bought the price and the
pace<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:27.380> prototyping<00:00:28.380> down<00:00:28.830> very<00:00:29.250> very<00:00:29.340> fast

thousand dollars and six months I would

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.810 
thousand dollars and six months I would
say<00:01:52.290> would<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.560> taken<00:01:52.890> us<00:01:53.100> about<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> million

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
say would have taken us about a million

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.520

dollars to get this far we are now five
years<00:01:55.560> ago<00:01:55.860> due<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> need<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.509> actually

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
years ago due to the need to actually

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.510 
years ago due to the need to actually
create<00:01:58.079> molds<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.619> injection<00:01:59.070> mold<00:01:59.250> all<00:01:59.399> of

to iterate four different times on our

to iterate four different times on our
product<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.310> really<00:02:05.640> refined<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.360> process

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
product and really refined the process

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.510 
product and really refined the process
in<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
in the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
of these companies the fact remains they

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.199 
of these companies the fact remains they

understand is that these new

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.070 
understand is that these new

technologies that have a rap there

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.530 
technologies that have a rap there
around<00:02:21.410> they're<00:02:22.099> not<00:02:22.340> helping<00:02:22.610> get<00:02:23.120> products

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
around they're not helping get products

around they're not helping get products
to<00:02:23.690> market<00:02:24.010> earlier<00:02:25.010> well<00:02:25.430> they're<00:02:25.879> not

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
to market earlier well they're not

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.150 
to market earlier well they're not
making<00:02:26.299> it<00:02:26.569> easier<00:02:27.080> right<00:02:27.500> well<00:02:27.890> they<00:02:28.010> are

making it easier right well they are
doing<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.489> enabling<00:02:28.879> prototyping<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.690> be

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
doing is enabling prototyping to be

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.600 
doing is enabling prototyping to be
quicker<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.379> easier<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.190> more<00:02:31.430> accessible

quicker and easier and more accessible

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.820 
quicker and easier and more accessible
right<00:02:32.299> getting<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.959> product<00:02:33.200> from<00:02:33.440> prototype

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
right getting a product from prototype

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.670 
right getting a product from prototype
to<00:02:34.010> product<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:35.030> actually<00:02:35.660> still<00:02:36.110> very<00:02:36.530> very

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
to product is actually still very very

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.190 
to product is actually still very very
hard<00:02:37.160> with<00:02:37.910> manufacturing<00:02:38.599> you<00:02:38.840> give

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
hard with manufacturing you give

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.780 
hard with manufacturing you give
something<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.650> manufacturers<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
something to manufacturers and the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.420 
something to manufacturers and the
output<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.150> uncertain<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.079> so<00:02:42.410> in<00:02:42.920> general<00:02:43.190> I

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
output is uncertain and so in general I

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.130 
output is uncertain and so in general I
think<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.090> main<00:02:44.269> recommendation<00:02:44.989> is<00:02:45.110> to

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
think that the main recommendation is to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.110 
think that the main recommendation is to
not<00:02:45.440> do<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.620> alone<00:02:45.950> right<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.849> do<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.090> with

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
not do it alone right is to do it with

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.440 
not do it alone right is to do it with
people<00:02:47.510> who<00:02:47.599> know<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:49.370> let<00:02:50.090> them<00:02:50.269> help

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
people who know and and let them help

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.839 
people who know and and let them help
you<00:02:50.569> get<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.959> market<00:02:51.170> despite<00:02:51.980> these<00:02:52.400> issues

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
you get to market despite these issues

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.970 
you get to market despite these issues
the<00:02:53.150> rate<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.510> innovation<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:54.260> hard<00:02:54.560> work<00:02:54.739> is

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
the rate of innovation in hard work is

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.580 
the rate of innovation in hard work is
only<00:02:55.370> going<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.120> increase<00:02:56.299> which<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.410> going<00:02:57.530> to

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
only going to increase which is going to

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.460 
only going to increase which is going to

whereas<00:03:08.569> now<00:03:08.810> I'm<00:03:09.140> getting<00:03:09.319> emails<00:03:09.860> from

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
whereas now I'm getting emails from

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.920 
whereas now I'm getting emails from
investors<00:03:10.489> all<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.760> time<00:03:10.970> asking<00:03:11.450> me<00:03:11.660> to

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
investors all the time asking me to

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.949 
investors all the time asking me to
recommend<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.530> them<00:03:12.650> hardware<00:03:13.040> startups<00:03:13.430> so

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
recommend to them hardware startups so

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.620 
recommend to them hardware startups so
you<00:03:14.959> know<00:03:15.049> I<00:03:15.079> think<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.920> it's<00:03:16.579> become<00:03:17.030> hot<00:03:17.299> I

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
you know I think that it's become hot I

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.990 
you know I think that it's become hot I
think<00:03:18.049> all<00:03:18.230> these<00:03:18.410> feels<00:03:19.190> 3d<00:03:19.670> printing

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
think all these feels 3d printing

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.250 
think all these feels 3d printing
connecting<00:03:20.389> devices<00:03:20.660> people<00:03:21.049> are<00:03:21.170> getting

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
connecting devices people are getting

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.720 
connecting devices people are getting
very<00:03:21.380> excited<00:03:21.680> about<00:03:22.130> this<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.639> I<00:03:22.670> think

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
very excited about this and I think

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.829 
very excited about this and I think
investors<00:03:23.329> are<00:03:23.510> also<00:03:23.930> following<00:03:24.470> soon
