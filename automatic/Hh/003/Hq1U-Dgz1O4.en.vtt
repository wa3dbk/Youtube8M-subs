about the screenshots they released and
do<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.120> little<00:00:12.540> bit<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:13.200> breakdown<00:00:13.500> about

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
do a little bit of a breakdown about

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.650 
do a little bit of a breakdown about
that<00:00:14.460> information<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.269> here's<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> first

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
that information so here's the first

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.689 
that information so here's the first
screenshot<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:17.100> whenever<00:00:17.279> you're<00:00:17.670> in

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
screenshot it's just whenever you're in

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.490 
screenshot it's just whenever you're in
the<00:00:17.910> game<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.480> press<00:00:18.690> Start<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.380> know

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the game and you press Start to you know

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.109 
the game and you press Start to you know
quit<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.010> save<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.550> stuff<00:00:21.000> like<00:00:21.060> that

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
quit and save and stuff like that

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.689 
quit and save and stuff like that
doesn't<00:00:21.960> look<00:00:22.140> too<00:00:22.710> much<00:00:22.859> different<00:00:23.340> than<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
doesn't look too much different than the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.720 
doesn't look too much different than the
actual<00:00:23.850> layout<00:00:24.359> but<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.769> course<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.279> textures

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
actual layout but of course the textures

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.609 
actual layout but of course the textures
and<00:00:26.760> all<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.269> stuff<00:00:27.390> look<00:00:27.660> different<00:00:28.080> hence

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
and all that stuff look different hence

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.349 
and all that stuff look different hence
the<00:00:28.980> fact<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.609> new<00:00:29.760> texture<00:00:30.090> pack

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the fact that it's a new texture pack

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.900 
the fact that it's a new texture pack
and<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.470> all<00:00:31.650> based<00:00:31.920> upon<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.489> game<00:00:32.669> Mass

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and this is all based upon the game Mass

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.610 
and this is all based upon the game Mass
Effect<00:00:33.300> I've<00:00:33.450> never<00:00:33.600> played<00:00:33.809> mass<00:00:34.050> effect<00:00:34.079> so

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
Effect I've never played mass effect so

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.799 
Effect I've never played mass effect so
I<00:00:34.680> don't<00:00:34.829> know<00:00:34.950> much<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.809> correlation

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
I don't know much of the correlation

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.260 
I don't know much of the correlation
between<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.260> two<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:38.190> there<00:00:38.340> will<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.969> I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
between the two that there will be but I

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
between the two that there will be but I
can<00:00:39.629> only<00:00:39.750> show<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.320> new<00:00:40.469> stuff<00:00:40.710> about<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
can only show you the new stuff about it

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.709 
can only show you the new stuff about it
that's<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> game<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> current

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
that's in the game from the current

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.810 
that's in the game from the current
minecraft<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.950> next<00:00:44.190> picture<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
minecraft so the next picture is

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.560 
minecraft so the next picture is
actually<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.989> creative<00:00:46.980> mode<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.789> it's

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
actually in creative mode of and it's

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.389 
actually in creative mode of and it's
the<00:00:48.780> building<00:00:49.020> blocks<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.710> our<00:00:50.039> creative

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the building blocks for our creative

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
the building blocks for our creative
mode<00:00:50.550> whenever<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.570> press<00:00:51.780> X<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> first

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
mode whenever you press X it's the first

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
mode whenever you press X it's the first
one<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:52.980> opens<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.149> there's<00:00:54.809> that

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
one that opens up so there's that

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.810 
one that opens up so there's that
picture<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> blocks<00:00:56.550> on

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
picture you can see all the blocks on

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.639 
picture you can see all the blocks on
that<00:00:56.940> first<00:00:57.120> page<00:00:57.420> there<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:58.079> coat<00:00:58.260> also

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649

that first page there in your coat also
can<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> top<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.969> top<00:01:00.780> bar<00:01:01.050> where

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
can see the top are the top bar where

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
can see the top are the top bar where
all<00:01:01.469> each<00:01:01.770> tabs<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.760> that's<00:01:02.910> pretty<00:01:03.120> cool

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359

all each tabs are so that's pretty cool
we<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> little<00:01:04.260> bit<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.769> kind<00:01:05.100> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
we can see a little bit and kind of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
we can see a little bit and kind of
correspond<00:01:05.790> which<00:01:06.060> ones<00:01:06.360> look<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.930> here's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
correspond which ones look and here's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.920 
correspond which ones look and here's
the<00:01:07.619> zoomed<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.010> picture<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.930> then

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the zoomed in picture of it and then

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.480 
the zoomed in picture of it and then
we'll<00:01:10.110> move<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.010> pause<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.400> video

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
we'll move on you can pause the video

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.100 
we'll move on you can pause the video
and<00:01:11.729> look<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:12.000> these<00:01:12.119> individually<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.049> then

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and look at these individually and then

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.969 
and look at these individually and then
here's<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.220> original<00:01:14.780> minecraft<00:01:15.979> picture

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
here's the original minecraft picture

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.620 
here's the original minecraft picture
right<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.820> go<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> create<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.299> mode<00:01:18.479> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
right now if you go to create a mode and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.210 
right now if you go to create a mode and
look<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.650> kind<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:19.979> back<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
look so you can kind of go back and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.980 
look so you can kind of go back and
forth<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> look<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.390> those<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.810> see

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
forth and have a look at those and see

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.770 
forth and have a look at those and see
how<00:01:22.710> they<00:01:22.920> correspond<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> each<00:01:23.700> other<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
how they correspond to each other so the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
how they correspond to each other so the
third<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.229> screenshot<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:25.950> released<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.610> just

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
third a screenshot they released is just

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.780 
third a screenshot they released is just
another<00:01:27.390> portion<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.890> mass<00:01:29.070> effect<00:01:29.549> a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
another portion of the mass effect a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.510 
another portion of the mass effect a
texture<00:01:30.509> pack<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.650> looks<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.130> they're

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
texture pack that it looks like they're

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.480 
texture pack that it looks like they're
in<00:01:32.670> survival<00:01:33.329> mode<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.810> has<00:01:34.049> them<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:35.250> looks

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
in survival mode it has them it looks
