00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.900
 to the girls good this mix that I'm going to 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.210
 do you are going to deal with chalks ok 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.150
 they had them I bought them in the one 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.460
 pharmacy store at 25 cents then 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.340
 what I 'm doing right now and 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.830
 taking everything out and grabbing the red color 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.410
 because it caught my attention a lot 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.250
 My friend told me that she will deal with chalk 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.560
 she saw a video of mine that I combine to 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.320
 the shadow that was an average shadow 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.870
 dark red but in reality that red to 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.940
 I did not like it because he told me why not 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.130
 you deal with chalk and actually I had 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.899
 already bought a box of chalk because 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.570
 when I find specials I buy 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.090
 and then I leave it there and good and she 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.390
 he said why not use it ok 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.070
 well actually I am sincere girls 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.960
 this is what it takes me 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.430
 be there but it still goes with the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.559
 shadows because the shadow you too the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.930
 has to dissolve crush it in sachet 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.180
 in a bag with cype crush it and 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.250
 undo the not good to stay in our 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.409
 time but I see that with this color chalk 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.180
 red that is lit I think I'm not 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.860
 sure is the one I was looking for 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.910
 and quickly I already have there 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.910
 my chalk this is what has got together ok 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:21.830
 I'm going to empty it in this little bottle and 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.830
 I'm going to empty all of them all there 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.440
 ok so we're going to 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.070
 to throw everything there 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.220
 I 've never dealt with chalk I've seen 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.660
 many small videos but they have not 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.320
 called attention but what I 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:45.430
 I want to make with this chalk mix good 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.170
 I'm going to quickly throw in 24 tablespoons 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.970
 half ok 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.510
 one 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.510
 two 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:02:01.760
 let's try with three ok are on average 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:05.590
 well I'm going to cover it and I 'm going to beat it 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.590
 well covered we beat it 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.020
 I already have my wrist there to prove it 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.370
 then I will grab a colored nail 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.750
 skin color a tip 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.970
 ok I'm going to grab a skin-colored guy and what 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.760
 I'm going to put it here and quickly I'm going to 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.940
 try and you are going to see how it is going to 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.940
 go out 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.180
 and this stage is harder, good 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.540
 well clearly it looks like a 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.520
 red acrylic but not clear is perhaps with 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.069
 transparent acrylic but let's 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.840
 try it to see how it goes with chalk I 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.670
 As I tell you, I've seen a lot but not 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.310
 it never caught my attention I'm going to get wet 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.270
 well my brush and what I'm going to do then 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.570
 is we are going to put it in our makes 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.990
 fast the consistency I do not need more and 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.390
 well what I'm going to do is 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.310
 wow how nice is a red comes 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.700
 on girls 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.130
 I've seen videos and never dared to 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.220
 do it with chalk because I said no maybe 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.459
 It does not work well, what do I know, but I'm not 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.470
 wrong, well, I was wrong now 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.640
 I see that with the chalk it works very 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.530
 well I love it and look ok what I 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.730
 I want to do now is to throw a 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.430
 little bit of this glitter 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.470
 it is a glitter behind final and reluctant 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.860
 ok I'm going to throw a teaspoon of 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.860
 half 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.590
 well a half teaspoon 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.870
 and what I 'm going to throw is my plin plin 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.319
 I call it my blin blin and it's this 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.019
 this is this wings of mermaid wings 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.319
 or mermaid tails this is 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:13.540
 Iridescent also good and I 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.540
 I will quickly take half 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.090
 half half ok 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.400
 and again I'm going to beat it quickie for 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.460
 see what effect comes out 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.229
 and girls use another container 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.400
 because these containers the caps are 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.389
 it gets harder 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.680
 Excuse me let's see what comes out 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.710
 remember that I already have my box that 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.750
 comes in 12 chalks in which comes in 6 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.050
 colors and you come double of each 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.930
 so if I did not like the 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.229
 leaders because I already have a chalk there for 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.990
 do double mix ok I like this or the 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.440
 I'm going to teach you right now 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.110
 Well, quickly, let's try it 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.990
 here it is 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.090
 I do not like it when everything is stained 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.650
 fast fast fast girls I'm going to 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.640
 grab a little bit and I'll put it in 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.160
 the lower part 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.280
 this is the mix voucher it was already 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.460
 with the slider I'm going to wet my brush well 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.800
 I'm going to submerge 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.590
 makes the consistency fast means 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.760
 that the acrylic is fine 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.760
 do not need more 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.760
 hey is nice he does not look bad 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.590
 and what I like now that I'm watching 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:39.350
 this mix is ​​that the siren and 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.290
 resistant are put as purple I do not know 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.969
 if you can visualize them there, it looks like 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.159
 some bright lights 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:52.399
 I like both ways and I'm going to have 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:52.399
 red acrylic and the mix that I have right now
