00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.860
 Good people are good elementary and today I 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.720
 I bring a new tutorial of how 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.670
 download minecraft for free this time with 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.400
 the updated version a new lancer 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.840
 that came out a while ago I do not have time 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.030
 so far to do the tutorial but 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.640
 well I hope I apologized jce is for 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.910
 1.7 I guess it will serve the 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.890
 next if I'm not wrong you have 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.599
 when a version comes out in launcher what 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.640
 that you just have to update it now 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.529
 works 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.480
 but since it 's not, I'm not entirely sure 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.700
 but for 1.7 at least yes that 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.340
 it works so good are these 2 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.770
 these two files that left here the weird 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.660
 or the removable car if you do not have 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.840
 here the exe point 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.340
 and good I'll leave the links 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.510
 in the good description you have them here 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.510
 in these 2 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.829
 I'll leave the link in the description 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.400
 and well let's start if you do not have 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.400
 winrar as for 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.530
 extract here because you leave the car 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.620
 removable that is a point that only 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.720
 you have to double-click 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.790
 and if you do not put where you want it to be 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.080
 decompress in this case in the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.600
 desk for example you give him to extract 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.600
 and in a moment you will extract everything 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.190
 fast pretty fast is the thing like that 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.540
 that you can not complain I have a 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.150
 fucking computer come that fast 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.790
 so perfect and I will leave you and you will leave 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.870
 this here is the team launcher 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.370
 extreme and good this is information but 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.350
 what you have to do is execute the 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:48.130

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.130

 come come then you can you can 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.000
 but as it goes pretty fast I'm not going to 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:20.390
 cut it but it's already ending as you see 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.940

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.200

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.280
 online servers I'm not sure not what 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.450
 tried but I think if I try it and 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.640
 you tell me in the comments 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.090
 and well I'll see if this loaded the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.090
 fucking time 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.550
 it is worth the user here that you 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.820
 that you want in my case 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.820
 Martin 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.819
 rice and that's it 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.590
 profile has been easy if you want 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.500
 all the things that you want the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.900
 resolution in which you want to open it with 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.030
 the directory this is already the point of 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.390
 always alone do not touch just in case 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.830
 the ma 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.260
 this is 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.510
 as with different options that there are me 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.820
 I would leave it as it is here to use the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.410
 last version that there is or if you can not 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.740
 use whatever version you want from 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.660
 some points 0 to 1 with 0.4 that 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.720
 now point 4 has come out 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.370
 I would leave them like this but you can 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.350
 use the one you want to imagine you have 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.980
 a pack of motorcycles that can only be used 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.080
 at 1.6 or 1.5 imagine anything 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.860
 you give him here I remember him in the 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.860
 version that you want 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:14.090
 executable all this and is at 6 finally 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:16.639
 and that's it if you want to have more than one 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.879
 from a yes account 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.080
 ye make a new a new put 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:25.450
 here I know 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.450
 your name the name you want 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.450
 and 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.740
 then anything I do not care 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.419
 You can create 6 profile 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.419
 and you can create what you want 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.650
 Well, here whatever is already 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.750
 you can enter as a reward a way 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.289
 do not 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.889
 and it is already 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.889
 good 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.330
 you can use the one you want 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:09.110
 and so you can see that it works because 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.320
 you're just waiting for all pods and 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.320
 good 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.790
 it's good 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.790
 making the blade for the new 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.180
 OK 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:36.479
 that's why you would have to update 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:39.110
 you just have to add the mic but in 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.239
 this case I will play myself in 1.7 points 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.320
 installed now where you will be presented 

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:47.230
 to you 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.060
 to update them the only thing you have 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:55.680
 what to say is a team stream 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:06:00.510
 I think it's point net is around here 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:05.490
 here and it's 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:08.550
 and what you use good they saw my 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.490
 message is good the thing is this 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.650
 If you want newer versions which 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.530
 you have to do is update the 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.870
 launcher from the page is and is already 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.030
 and I'm going to play now on the 7.2 bike 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.680
 I have 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.680
 installed so you can see that it works 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.440
 how it works so far 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.129
 it's opening 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.669
 and let it be a world that comes here 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:44.789
 it seems that this is the one of the display I think 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.789
 can be 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.180
 effectively 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:01.960
 charge photo world the area of ​​law 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.910
 or good or not 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.080
 there is seen them 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.300
 it does not work for them here is the display that 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:18.840
 I have to I'll do the tutorial 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.840
 here pretty little 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:22.929
 but when I can because this week 

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:26.559

00:07:22.929 --> 00:07:28.639
 days I 'll start doing it on one or two 

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:31.189
 weeks 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:35.740
