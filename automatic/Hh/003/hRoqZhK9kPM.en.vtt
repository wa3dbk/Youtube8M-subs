00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:15.160
 good friends today touched exclusivity 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.030
 thanks to the autoblog friends I have 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.330
 here a mitsubishi mirage 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.590
 1.2 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.660
 three cylinders 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.660
 it is clear not here we have them 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.550
 76 horses 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.890
 and well well mitsubishi thinks 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:41.470
 enter again in segment b 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.970
 I'm going to show you a little here 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.320
 engine and engine compartment and accessories 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:53.510
 that we have here in the turn 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:57.230
 here the famous abs this is the engine 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.610
 electrical sometimes with the outputs 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.610
 the pipes that carry the liquid 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.909
 Well, we have a good strap 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.850
 accessories to move the alternator 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.800
 the air conditioning this is another engine 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.280
 that does not have a timing belt 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.409
 comes with chain 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.440
 which is very good because we did not know 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.229
 of the maintenance of the belt because the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.150
 Hard chain practically the life of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.130
 engine 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.510
 this is the butterfly body of 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.190
 acceleration that has no cable is a 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.140
 accelerator robotic accelerator 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.530
 It has a sensor and what you see here is 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.220
 the motor that obeys the signal of the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.380
 accelerator to open the butterfly 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.840
 this big here is the air filter 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.870
 that has to be generous and this that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.500
 come here is a noise suppressor 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.500
 admission 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.700
 to the best Japanese car style because 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.100
 that 's mostly en route 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.770
 the mission this begins to make a noise 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.390
 which is quite annoying and adding to 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.390
 buzz of the three cylinders 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.010
 that system only reduces a lot of noise 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.099
 here we have 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.489
 the brake fluid from the brake pump 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.489
 to the bottom 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.390
 good general girls this is the the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.080
 new three cylinder mitsubishi 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.080
 mirage
