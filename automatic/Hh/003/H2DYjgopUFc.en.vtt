I<00:00:30.619> guess<00:00:31.619> my<00:00:31.830> granddad<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.820> ones<00:00:33.030> that

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
I guess my granddad is the ones that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.850 
I guess my granddad is the ones that
brought<00:00:33.390> me<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.660> falling<00:00:33.899> because<00:00:34.200> when<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.649> was

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
brought me to falling because when I was

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.639 
brought me to falling because when I was
a<00:00:34.890> little<00:00:35.070> boy<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.719> grown<00:00:36.719> up<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.140> whatever

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
a little boy and grown up with whatever

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.100 
a little boy and grown up with whatever
I<00:00:38.160> stayed<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:38.670> him<00:00:38.820> all<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> time<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.930> it

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I stayed with him all the time so it

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.510 
I stayed with him all the time so it
just<00:00:40.350> pretty<00:00:40.649> much<00:00:42.559> worked<00:00:43.559> out<00:00:43.770> together<00:00:43.950> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
just pretty much worked out together I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.090 
just pretty much worked out together I
guess<00:00:45.170> but<00:00:46.170> never<00:00:46.379> did<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> chocolate

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
guess but never did like the chocolate

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.760 
guess but never did like the chocolate
the<00:00:47.370> biker<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> hose<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.600> whatever<00:00:48.960> we

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the biker with the hose or whatever we

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.139 
the biker with the hose or whatever we
didn't<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.730> didn't<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
didn't like it and we didn't like to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.479 
didn't like it and we didn't like to
have<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.360> pull<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> suckers<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.860> outside<00:00:53.309> of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
have to pull the suckers but outside of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.350 
have to pull the suckers but outside of
there<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.270> was<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:54.570> enjoyable<00:00:55.940> if<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.120> think

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
there it was all enjoyable if you think

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.830 
there it was all enjoyable if you think
about<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.160> guess<00:00:59.160> from<00:00:59.399> my<00:00:59.809> granddad<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
about it I guess from my granddad and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.349 
about it I guess from my granddad and
all<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.320> those<00:01:01.469> were<00:01:01.770> coming<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.940> 20s

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
all of those were coming up in the 20s

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.910 
all of those were coming up in the 20s
and<00:01:03.510> 30s<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:04.530> were<00:01:04.710> essential<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.129> organic<00:01:05.670> -

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
and 30s they were essential to organic -

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.500 
and 30s they were essential to organic -
the<00:01:07.920> hardest<00:01:08.250> part<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> week<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.270> just

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the hardest part of the week is just

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.469 
the hardest part of the week is just
trying<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> keep<00:01:10.140> everything<00:01:10.560> moving<00:01:11.479> alone

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
trying to keep everything moving alone

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.750 
trying to keep everything moving alone
like<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.049> supposed<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.760> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
like it's supposed to be the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.370 
like it's supposed to be the
satisfaction<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> customers<00:01:16.229> is

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
satisfaction of the customers is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.330 
satisfaction of the customers is
probably<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.369> most<00:01:17.549> reward<00:01:19.130> getting<00:01:20.130> away

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
probably the most reward getting away

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.679 
probably the most reward getting away
from<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.509> guess<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.200> synthetic<00:01:22.740> chemicals

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
from the I guess the synthetic chemicals

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.910 
from the I guess the synthetic chemicals
was<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.930> reason<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:27.590> knowing<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.740> I

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
was one reason and knowing that I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.350 
was one reason and knowing that I
thought<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> lot<00:01:29.700> better

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
thought it was a lot better

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.510 
thought it was a lot better
and<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.259> course<00:01:31.500> regardless<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.250> anybody

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
and of course regardless of what anybody

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.660 
and of course regardless of what anybody
says<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.270> still<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.590> financial<00:01:34.590> incentive<00:01:35.310> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
says it's still a financial incentive to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.940 
says it's still a financial incentive to
do<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:38.240> we<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.619> 42<00:01:40.619> acres

able<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:04.340> see<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.670> can<00:02:05.880> do<00:02:06.030> about<00:02:06.210> maybe

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
able to see what we can do about maybe

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.449 
able to see what we can do about maybe
getting<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.229> yields<00:02:07.619> up<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.860> little<00:02:08.099> bit<00:02:08.220> more

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
getting the yields up a little bit more

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.460 
getting the yields up a little bit more
so<00:02:08.700> maybe<00:02:08.910> we<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.300> fall

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
so maybe we can fall

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.540 
so maybe we can fall
yes<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.610> more<00:02:12.710> when<00:02:13.710> we<00:02:13.800> got<00:02:13.980> produce<00:02:14.220> in

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
yes and get more when we got produce in

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.970 
yes and get more when we got produce in
season<00:02:15.060> we<00:02:15.180> eat<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.380> eat<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
season we eat it so we eat it all the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.580 
season we eat it so we eat it all the
time<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.610> guess<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.600> don't<00:02:19.020> have<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.290> say<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
time but I guess I don't have to say the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.120 
time but I guess I don't have to say the
my<00:02:19.800> toes<00:02:20.040> would<00:02:20.220> probably<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.910> my<00:02:21.810> favorite

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
my toes would probably be my favorite

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
my toes would probably be my favorite
