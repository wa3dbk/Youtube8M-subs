00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.509
 hello to you and welcome to this 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.030
 new video so today we're going 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.460
 study a tool I had already spoken in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.050
 an earlier video that about the senses 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.420
 whirling I mean actually a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.859
 most geek of the traffic manager is in 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.109
 does the red fire timer 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.769
 Sincerely this tool this game you go 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.000
 a little flew over but no more 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.199
 I'm actually going to regret I can not 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.550
 did it earlier because that's 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.559
 really a tool that is really pretty 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.020
 nice with her commits pleasure to 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.340
 use it seems a bit complicated but 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.770
 I want to tell you this is this 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.270
 wealth this complicated collection which 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.620
 add such depth of gameplay 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.469
 on the traffic that I find 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.950
 aberrant in fact not to do not 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.170
 use it 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.870
 so for that we will follow you so go 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.870
 on an intersection where I will be able to 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.860
 present this so this is this 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.600
 small 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.020
 small intersection of worry mans 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.550
 none of my strings proud of them 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.309
 machault highway junction canal 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.840
 whip so you see I left fire 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.670
 red 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.980
 so the first thing to really do 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.380
 to couple with this mode so it's 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.610
 so use the the other plugin that 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.640
 is called Chechen who you 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.840
 actually allows to change direction of 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.540
 voorhout therefore to assign a 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.880
 truly a specific direction 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.920
 in the coach month on the ramp 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.570
 access separate travel but his granny 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.130
 circulation 2 making it allows 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.110
 to study circulations of power 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.000
 modify this one and notice 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.790
 immediately before using 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.070
 the tool that observe so the 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.860
 circulation we notice from the outset that a 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.210
 part goes right and who who so who 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.000
 comes from the highway goes mainly to 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.860
 right while those coming out of their 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.770
 downtown has crossed the bridge for 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.759
 take the bull just so with 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.780
 those in mind we will be able to 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.390
 so settle our our other fires 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.410
 red so we're going to pause 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.690
 then we just do traffic 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.130
 managers did timer traffic light and 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.619
 we click on our intersection with 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.310
 little three red lights and we're doing next to 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.780
 that moment then we have al houthi fall 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.670
 these who appears that he is going so you 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.250
 to adjust our red lights 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.020
 so just do it at stake and at that 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.790
 moment then we can m 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.980
 see this red or green to apply the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.130
 pictures here you can adjust the duration 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.470
 so up to 100 up to two minutes and 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.269
 so where it gets interesting it's 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.170
 change operating done 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.390
 to assign you see a saying of 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.080
 directions that's it's you can 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.000
 assign by therefore sees his seed and to 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.090
 from there that actually this tool 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.970
 becomes absolutely awesome it's you 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.540
 will be able to see them enforced 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.000
 that you want at your intersections and 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.739
 it's really great 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.580
 because here we really have the depth 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.950
 even gameplay what we can do 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.420
 with this tool that's how I know 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.810
 that the majority of traffic goes to 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.790
 right 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.709
 I'll leave that to the greens there 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.280
 also I leave to the green I put in the 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.989
 hands 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.780
 thirty seconds at a time put 20 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.450
 second the tone is then had there I 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.709
 I'm going to delete the possibility 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.090
 allowing 100 to add another one 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.350
 step I remove the possibility of 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.329
 turn left 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:28.950
 and if I gave the opportunity to 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:32.920
 turn right for 15 seconds 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.650
 so I have had so at that moment I 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.380
 still doing a new stage 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.389
 so I delete there totally and there I 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.049
 will let people from yale but there I 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.250
 will leave here I deleted the 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.549
 opportunity turn right what I 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.440
 know that few studies use and to his 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:55.480
 age so I'll add the same 20 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.520
 seconds in a hurry and here I go the same 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.230
 I will then deleted 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.270
 putting at 100 I'm going to prevent so 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.180
 people to be able to turn and I'm going 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.040
 leave that for 15 seconds roadstead and 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.460
 once it's done you are very 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.650
 satisfied so we made start to launch 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.650
 the simulation we launch the simulation in 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.299
 it even speeds up the jemaye show 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.440
 the counters see you see there all 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.500
 moment everything turns 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.830
 and if ever there is vehicle that goes 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.580
 arrive 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.580
 Of course not 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.450
 no vehicle was turning seated right 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.550
 he stops while the others 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.640
 continue at that time not the 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.340
 Such a situation unfortunately continues 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:44.400
 vehicles so can again 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:46.230
 drive through this center of vehicles by 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.540
 here vigil he can not advance then 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:54.120
 that he can continue go hop that's 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.100
 of the artsakh orders but the 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.640
 vehicles to follow very different than 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.620
 here and with this system we can 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.750
 really set extremely finely 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.100
 make your intersection this camp you 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.320
 really know that you have a 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.460
 a voice that has priority over 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.380
 to others because he really has more 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.720
 of vehicles so you can increase 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.900
 the timing of this one and at the same time 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.350
 so spread more effectively in fact 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.940
 your voice and frankly that's it 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.320
 add such depth to the level 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.280
 of the gameplay that I really find 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.680
 a shame to do without 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.290
 it's for me it's a tool that since 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.110
 that I discovered there I say sincerely 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.940
 why do not I read use earlier 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.200
 so now I'm going to talk a little 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.050
 little of the chain so I want to 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.940
 thank all the subscribers no worth 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.040
 subscribers who have arrived is really 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.750
 awesome i'm really happy i hope 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.800
 in any case, please go if you are 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.180
 subscriber is that the videos you 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.350
 please I hope to continue to you 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.700
 provide in videos anyway 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.940
 good enough 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.010
 so for the future of the chain 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.400
 I still see continue some tutorials 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.630
 I have two three there in mind on 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.040
 property I like a lot heavier 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.080
 really gameplay tutorials like 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.490
 I had done on the on how 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.600
 say on agricultural areas I 'm going in 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.890
 do another one because I have 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.800
 rediscovered a new way for 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.990
 to do them that lets you that 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.640
 will be purely these cutscenes 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.280
 these natives to say since they will have no 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.950
 no functionality in terms of play at 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.180
 level of resource production 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.860
 I will also do a tutorial on 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.150
 airports thanks to plugins that are 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.010
 come out after a long time that allows you 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.160
 really to model an airport like 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.230
 you want as a cushion 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.970
 thanks to plugins also g1 that are 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.390
 gone out at a few times already to make 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:36.150
 actually really a port wearing 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.100
 goods a fear of containers and 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.140
 then I have two diaries of two 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.390
 other two other tutorials I have in mind at 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.180
 subject so the 3ds max for small 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.010
 little things actually stupid with 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.900
 3ds max and that will allow you in 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.540
 for example to do this is to 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.220
 say a good people at the tables in your 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.540
 Park it is really stupid like 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.050
 little trick but it can be really 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.419
 helpful and I think like a lot to do 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.070
 a leash pleases but I think about it 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.440
 still I have not found the 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.620
 formula that I want 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:09.260
 I will use for 6.6 so good 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.540
 thank you for all good leap 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.250
 this and I hope for what if of 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.170
 the API of you liked subscribe you you in 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.550
 will have others and on this I will 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.210
 wish a good evening or a good 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.210
 day to you
