00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.270 

we<00:03:02.000> hear<00:03:02.209> AR<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.379> probably<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.010> couple

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
we hear AR it's a probably a couple

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.210 
we hear AR it's a probably a couple
hours<00:03:04.519> later<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.230> we<00:03:06.230> pretty<00:03:06.590> much<00:03:06.680> have<00:03:07.190> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
hours later and we pretty much have the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
roof pretty well cleaned up Steve is

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.770 
roof pretty well cleaned up Steve is
going<00:03:10.640> back<00:03:10.790> through<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.330> putting<00:03:11.510> another

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
going back through and putting another

trash<00:03:12.019> bag<00:03:12.319> in<00:03:12.530> there<00:03:12.709> so<00:03:12.860> we<00:03:12.980> can<00:03:13.160> just<00:03:13.580> pick

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
trash bag in there so we can just pick

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.290 
trash bag in there so we can just pick
up<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.030> last<00:03:14.239> few<00:03:14.420> piles<00:03:14.840> here<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.180> you

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
up the last few piles here and so you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.000 
up the last few piles here and so you
can<00:03:17.540> see<00:03:17.810> what<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.110> difference<00:03:18.560> this<00:03:18.709> looks

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
can see what a difference this looks

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.070 
can see what a difference this looks
