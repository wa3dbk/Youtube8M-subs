00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
composite acoustic is that the tops are

actually<00:00:31.050> tunes<00:00:31.679> per<00:00:32.130> model<00:00:32.309> with<00:00:32.610> different

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
actually tunes per model with different

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.330 
and loud acoustically so when you're
playing<00:02:07.750> little<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:08.259> very<00:02:08.410> resonant<00:02:08.950> for

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
playing little it's very resonant for

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.570 
playing little it's very resonant for
really<00:02:09.520> great<00:02:09.700> harmonics<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:11.190> VV<00:02:12.190> custom

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
really great harmonics to VV custom

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.610 
really great harmonics to VV custom
design<00:02:12.880> humbucking<00:02:13.660> pickups<00:02:14.110> which<00:02:14.380> are<00:02:14.530> both

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
design humbucking pickups which are both

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.530 
design humbucking pickups which are both
coil<00:02:14.950> tapped<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:15.940> can<00:02:16.120> get<00:02:16.180> some<00:02:16.330> nice

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
coil tapped so you can get some nice

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.449 
coil tapped so you can get some nice
combinations<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.470> your<00:02:17.620> single<00:02:17.860> coil<00:02:18.070> sounds

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
combinations of your single coil sounds

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.910 
combinations of your single coil sounds
with<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.730> too<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.239> it's<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.080> nice<00:02:20.260> sounding<00:02:20.709> of

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
with that too so it's a nice sounding of

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.130 
with that too so it's a nice sounding of
guitar<00:02:21.850> i<00:02:21.880> got<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.239> XXX<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.810> hear<00:02:22.959> on<00:02:23.050> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
guitar i got the XXX to hear on the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:34.470 
guitar i got the XXX to hear on the
clean<00:02:23.350> channel<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:33.220> with<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.239> clean<00:02:34.450> channel

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
clean channel so with the clean channel

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.590 
clean channel so with the clean channel
on<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.049> clock<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.530> XXX<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.430> pass<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.209> eq

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
on the clock on the XXX to pass of eq

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.710 
on the clock on the XXX to pass of eq
and<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:38.310> really<00:02:39.310> crystal<00:02:39.790> clean<00:02:40.030> channel<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.630> it

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
and a really crystal clean channel so it

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.360 
and a really crystal clean channel so it
takes<00:02:40.900> pedals<00:02:41.290> extremely<00:02:41.830> extremely<00:02:42.100> well

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
takes pedals extremely extremely well

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.240 
takes pedals extremely extremely well
it's<00:02:42.820> actually<00:02:42.910> designed<00:02:43.420> for<00:02:44.080> not<00:02:44.769> only<00:02:44.920> by

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
it's actually designed for not only by

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.770 
it's actually designed for not only by
itself<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:45.730> was<00:02:45.850> designed<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.269> take<00:02:46.450> pedals

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
itself it was designed to take pedals

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.740 
itself it was designed to take pedals
very<00:02:46.959> well<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.880> when<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:48.970> switch<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
very well and when you switch to the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.539 
very well and when you switch to the
rhythm<00:02:50.200> channel<00:02:50.680> first<00:02:50.860> 30<00:02:51.070> channel<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:51.489> the

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
rhythm channel first 30 channel in the

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.520 
rhythm channel first 30 channel in the
amp<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:52.330> notice<00:02:52.600> you've<00:02:52.750> got<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.900> fat<00:02:53.200> switch

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
amp you notice you've got a fat switch

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.340 
amp you notice you've got a fat switch
and<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:55.060> can<00:02:55.180> get<00:02:55.299> anything<00:02:55.660> from<00:02:55.959> really

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
and you can get anything from really

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.220 
and you can get anything from really
nice<00:02:56.530> crunchy<00:02:57.390> classic<00:02:58.390> rock<00:02:58.480> tunes<00:02:58.870> out<00:02:59.080> of

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
nice crunchy classic rock tunes out of

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.170 
nice crunchy classic rock tunes out of
this<00:02:59.350> too

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.610 

but<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.330> can<00:03:06.480> really<00:03:06.720> over<00:03:07.080> top<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.290> gain<00:03:07.590> on

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
but you can really over top the gain on

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.400 
but you can really over top the gain on
it<00:03:07.890> as<00:03:07.980> well

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.710 

so<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:15.010> can<00:03:15.160> really<00:03:15.340> it's<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.760> very<00:03:15.970> versatile

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
so you can really it's a very versatile

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.120 
so you can really it's a very versatile
chant<00:03:16.960> a<00:03:17.050> very<00:03:17.320> versatile<00:03:17.560> channel<00:03:17.890> it's<00:03:18.010> also

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
chant a very versatile channel it's also

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.330 
chant a very versatile channel it's also
got<00:03:18.400> active<00:03:19.270> eq<00:03:19.660> so<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.440> middle<00:03:20.710> is<00:03:20.830> flat<00:03:21.100> and

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
got active eq so the middle is flat and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.250 
got active eq so the middle is flat and
that's<00:03:21.580> cut<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.060> boost<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.990> you've<00:03:23.110> got<00:03:23.200> the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
that's cut and boost and you've got the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.350 
that's cut and boost and you've got the
fat<00:03:23.530> switch<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:24.160> also<00:03:24.550> a<00:03:24.580> noise<00:03:24.850> gate<00:03:24.880> and

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
fat switch and also a noise gate and

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.940 
fat switch and also a noise gate and
then<00:03:25.630> lastly<00:03:25.990> we've<00:03:26.200> got<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.470> lead<00:03:26.650> channel

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
then lastly we've got the lead channel

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.290 
then lastly we've got the lead channel
which<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.400> really<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.940> built<00:03:28.810> for<00:03:28.990> shredding
