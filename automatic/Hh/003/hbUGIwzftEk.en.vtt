00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.490 
around I got this one I mean glad it was
just<00:03:42.370> one<00:03:42.730> scene<00:03:43.420> we<00:03:43.630> saw<00:03:43.840> one<00:03:44.260> gameplay

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
just one scene we saw one gameplay

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.400 
just one scene we saw one gameplay
section<00:03:45.130> we<00:03:45.220> saw<00:03:45.430> but<00:03:45.700> for<00:03:46.390> my<00:03:46.540> personal

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
section we saw but for my personal

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.600 
section we saw but for my personal
opinion<00:03:47.650> from<00:03:47.769> just<00:03:47.950> seeing<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.370> looks

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
opinion from just seeing that it looks

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.979 
opinion from just seeing that it looks
like<00:03:48.700> it's<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.180> little<00:03:49.300> bit<00:03:49.420> more<00:03:49.630> toned<00:03:49.840> down

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
like it's a little bit more toned down

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.470 
like it's a little bit more toned down
which<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.650> like<00:03:50.950> it's<00:03:51.340> like<00:03:51.550> if<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:51.850> took<00:03:52.060> base

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
which I like it's like if you took base

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.890 
which I like it's like if you took base
star<00:03:52.989> wars<00:03:53.290> like<00:03:53.769> episode<00:03:54.370> well<00:03:54.910> what<00:03:55.180> is<00:03:55.299> it<00:03:55.450> 4

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
star wars like episode well what is it 4

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.770 
star wars like episode well what is it 4
&amp;<00:03:56.200> 5<00:03:56.500> technically<00:03:57.130> yeah<00:03:57.519> you<00:03:57.820> take<00:03:58.030> those<00:03:58.390> and

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
&amp; 5 technically yeah you take those and

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.350 
&amp; 5 technically yeah you take those and
then<00:03:59.140> you<00:03:59.320> just<00:03:59.650> slightly<00:04:00.190> amplify<00:04:01.060> amplify

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
then you just slightly amplify amplify

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.890 
then you just slightly amplify amplify
it<00:04:01.840> because<00:04:02.470> we<00:04:02.920> have<00:04:03.209> better<00:04:04.209> technology

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
it because we have better technology

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.720 
it because we have better technology
than<00:04:04.930> we<00:04:05.140> did<00:04:05.320> in<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.560> past<00:04:05.769> yes<00:04:06.250> like<00:04:06.519> that's

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
than we did in the past yes like that's

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.460 
than we did in the past yes like that's
what<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:07.000> get<00:04:07.209> there's<00:04:07.420> nothing<00:04:07.780> like<00:04:07.959> 6

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
what you get there's nothing like 6
