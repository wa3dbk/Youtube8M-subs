people have asked me to stop using or

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.080 
people have asked me to stop using or
not<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.960> post<00:00:25.199> part<00:00:25.619> 1<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.279> my<00:00:26.490> replay<00:00:26.910> when

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
not to post part 1 in my replay when

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.870 
not to post part 1 in my replay when
it's<00:00:27.210> only<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> one<00:00:27.810> part<00:00:28.109> replay<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.880> that's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
it's only a one part replay and that's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.790 
it's only a one part replay and that's
more<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.359> complaint<00:00:30.929> than<00:00:31.199> anything<00:00:31.619> else

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
more of a complaint than anything else

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.799 
more of a complaint than anything else
but<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.340> haven't<00:00:32.700> heard<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.000> any<00:00:33.210> real<00:00:33.540> reason

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
but I haven't heard of any real reason

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.900 
but I haven't heard of any real reason
why<00:00:34.230> they<00:00:34.469> don't<00:00:34.620> like<00:00:34.920> part<00:00:35.340> 1<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:35.730> there's

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
why they don't like part 1 if there's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.500 
why they don't like part 1 if there's
only<00:00:36.059> one<00:00:36.480> part<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:38.309> reason<00:00:38.640> why<00:00:38.790> part<00:00:39.120> 1<00:00:39.329> is

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
only one part the reason why part 1 is

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.209 
only one part the reason why part 1 is
there<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.870> because<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> lot<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.500> players<00:00:40.829> don't

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
there is because a lot of players don't

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.100 
there is because a lot of players don't
want<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.610> know<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> outcome<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> ending

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
want to know the outcome or the ending

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.600 
want to know the outcome or the ending
of<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.350> game<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:43.739> would<00:00:43.890> they<00:00:44.100> don't<00:00:44.190> want<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
of a game they would they don't want to

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.779 
of a game they would they don't want to
know<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.930> game<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.469> only<00:00:46.710> under<00:00:47.520> 10

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
know that the game is only under 10

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.430 
know that the game is only under 10
minutes<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.180> that's<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> reason<00:00:48.600> why<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> go

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
minutes so that's the reason why I go

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.979 
minutes so that's the reason why I go
ahead<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.710> put<00:00:50.010> part<00:00:50.309> 1<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:51.870> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
ahead and put part 1 so that if there is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.400 
ahead and put part 1 so that if there is
a<00:00:52.020> art<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.829> makes<00:00:53.489> sense<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.170> if<00:00:55.170> there<00:00:55.379> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
a art to it makes sense and if there is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.229 
a art to it makes sense and if there is
a<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.760> part<00:00:56.910> 1<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
a and just because it's a part 1 you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.520 
a and just because it's a part 1 you
can't<00:00:57.449> always<00:00:57.629> guarantee<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.230> will<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
can't always guarantee there will be a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
can't always guarantee there will be a
part<00:00:58.800> 2<00:00:58.829> liquid<00:00:59.520> now<00:00:59.670> school<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
chrono boost on that Nexus most likely

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
chrono boost on that Nexus most likely
going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> double<00:01:15.869> gateway<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
going to go for a double gateway and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.320 
going to go for a double gateway and
after<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> double<00:01:17.520> gateway<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.090> start

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
after a double gateway just start

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.620 
after a double gateway just start
pumping<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.960> zealots<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.330> anyways<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.600> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
pumping out zealots so anyways that is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.010 
pumping out zealots so anyways that is
the<00:01:21.960> reason<00:01:22.170> why<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.729> why<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> put<00:01:24.210> part<00:01:24.479> 1<00:01:24.689> even

nicely done by white rock realizing that
you<00:02:48.549> need<00:02:48.790> those<00:02:48.969> minerals<00:02:49.389> probes<00:02:49.930> now

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
you need those minerals probes now

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.479 
you need those minerals probes now
coming<00:02:50.409> off<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.530> mineral<00:02:50.949> line<00:02:51.099> doing<00:02:51.430> a

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
coming off that mineral line doing a

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.039 
coming off that mineral line doing a
little<00:02:51.669> bit<00:02:51.819> of<00:02:51.849> an<00:02:51.969> engagement<00:02:52.239> we<00:02:52.780> have

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
little bit of an engagement we have

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.959 
little bit of an engagement we have
probe<00:02:53.560> sitting<00:02:53.859> over<00:02:54.099> here<00:02:54.129> for<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.790> was

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:54.969 
probe sitting over here for I was

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.369 
probe sitting over here for I was
thinking<00:02:55.239> maybe<00:02:55.359> there's<00:02:55.569> been<00:02:55.810> some<00:02:56.139> sort<00:02:56.260> of

thinking maybe there's been some sort of
proxy<00:02:56.739> pylon<00:02:56.859> in<00:02:57.189> that<00:02:57.340> other<00:02:57.489> base<00:02:57.760> probes

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419 
proxy pylon in that other base probes

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.479 
proxy pylon in that other base probes
and<00:02:58.659> zealots<00:02:59.139> once<00:02:59.739> again<00:02:59.949> doing<00:03:00.189> a<00:03:00.280> little

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
and zealots once again doing a little

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.220 
and zealots once again doing a little
bit<00:03:00.639> more<00:03:00.819> of<00:03:00.879> an<00:03:00.939> engagement<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.449> for<00:03:01.750> zealots

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
bit more of an engagement so for zealots

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.819 
bit more of an engagement so for zealots
against<00:03:03.010> an<00:03:03.459> army<00:03:03.939> of<00:03:04.120> probes<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.719> zealots<00:03:05.650> as

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
against an army of probes and zealots as

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.069 
against an army of probes and zealots as
well<00:03:06.099> so<00:03:06.340> more<00:03:06.579> zealous<00:03:07.209> coming<00:03:07.449> in<00:03:07.569> army<00:03:07.900> wise

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079
