this little gadget is called a crimping

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.830 
this little gadget is called a crimping
tool<00:00:35.920> and<00:00:36.160> it's<00:00:36.520> for<00:00:36.640> crimping<00:00:37.090> a<00:00:37.270> loop<00:00:37.510> or<00:00:37.780> a

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
tool and it's for crimping a loop or a

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.260 
tool and it's for crimping a loop or a
swivel<00:00:38.680> onto<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.100> end<00:00:39.220> of<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.400> hooklink<00:00:39.610> but

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
swivel onto the end of the hooklink but

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.150 
swivel onto the end of the hooklink but
it<00:00:40.360> will<00:00:40.510> only<00:00:40.660> work<00:00:41.020> on<00:00:41.230> certain<00:00:41.710> kinds<00:00:41.920> of

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
it will only work on certain kinds of

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.350 
it will only work on certain kinds of
hook<00:00:42.340> links<00:00:42.550> now<00:00:42.670> we<00:00:42.760> showed<00:00:42.940> this<00:00:43.090> on<00:00:43.240> the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
hook links now we showed this on the

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.990 
hook links now we showed this on the
last<00:00:43.540> DVD<00:00:43.810> and<00:00:44.680> unfortunately<00:00:45.370> up<00:00:45.520> until<00:00:45.790> now

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
last DVD and unfortunately up until now

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.850 
last DVD and unfortunately up until now
it<00:00:46.210> hadn't<00:00:46.510> actually<00:00:46.780> come<00:00:46.990> out<00:00:47.020> we've<00:00:47.680> now

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
it hadn't actually come out we've now

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.650 
it hadn't actually come out we've now
got<00:00:48.100> them<00:00:48.190> right<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.670> crimps<00:00:49.000> are<00:00:49.120> right<00:00:49.330> and

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
got them right the crimps are right and

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.210 
got them right the crimps are right and
you<00:00:49.870> can<00:00:49.989> now<00:00:50.170> use<00:00:50.200> them<00:00:50.590> on<00:00:50.680> anything<00:00:51.040> that's

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
you can now use them on anything that's

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.460 
you can now use them on anything that's
got<00:00:51.340> a<00:00:51.400> stiff<00:00:51.670> coating<00:00:52.090> to<00:00:52.270> it<00:00:52.300> so<00:00:52.630> this<00:00:53.290> is

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
got a stiff coating to it so this is

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.870 
got a stiff coating to it so this is
what<00:00:53.830> I've<00:00:53.920> been<00:00:53.950> using<00:00:54.220> on<00:00:54.460> this<00:00:54.550> particular

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
what I've been using on this particular

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.380 
what I've been using on this particular
session<00:00:55.470> we've<00:00:56.470> got<00:00:56.710> stiff<00:00:57.400> coated<00:00:57.970> material

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
session we've got stiff coated material

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.960 
session we've got stiff coated material
called<00:00:58.540> hybrid<00:00:58.960> stiff<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.530> I've<00:01:00.520> crimped<00:01:00.880> a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
called hybrid stiff and I've crimped a

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.460 
called hybrid stiff and I've crimped a
loop<00:01:01.150> on<00:01:01.330> the<00:01:01.420> end<00:01:02.020> there<00:01:02.260> what<00:01:02.380> I've

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
loop on the end there what I've

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.350 
loop on the end there what I've
basically<00:01:02.680> done<00:01:03.070> I've<00:01:03.280> gone<00:01:03.520> through<00:01:03.580> the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
basically done I've gone through the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.900 
basically done I've gone through the
double<00:01:04.660> barrel<00:01:04.809> crimp<00:01:05.280> around<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.460> link<00:01:06.670> loop

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
double barrel crimp around the link loop

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.790 
double barrel crimp around the link loop
back<00:01:07.390> through<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.780> crimp<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.290> then<00:01:08.650> with

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
back through the crimp and then with

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.320 
back through the crimp and then with
these<00:01:09.040> pliers<00:01:09.310> have<00:01:09.640> just<00:01:09.790> squeezed<00:01:10.150> it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
these pliers have just squeezed it

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.930 
these pliers have just squeezed it
really<00:01:10.690> tight<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.260> that<00:01:12.130> will<00:01:12.310> give<00:01:12.520> you<00:01:12.730> a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
really tight and that will give you a

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.940 
really tight and that will give you a
much<00:01:13.240> higher<00:01:13.540> breaking<00:01:14.110> strain<00:01:14.380> than<00:01:14.710> you<00:01:14.800> can

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
much higher breaking strain than you can

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.010 
much higher breaking strain than you can
get<00:01:15.100> if<00:01:15.220> you<00:01:15.250> tire<00:01:15.550> not<00:01:15.760> in<00:01:15.970> it<00:01:16.090> but<00:01:16.270> only<00:01:16.510> in<00:01:16.900> a

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
get if you tire not in it but only in a

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.020 
get if you tire not in it but only in a
stiff<00:01:17.260> material<00:01:17.860> if<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.310> use<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.760> soft

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
stiff material if you use the soft

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.420 
stiff material if you use the soft
coated<00:01:19.420> material<00:01:19.870> like<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.170> entrap<00:01:20.530> soft<00:01:20.860> it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
coated material like the entrap soft it

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.680 
coated material like the entrap soft it
won't<00:01:21.670> give<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.090> same<00:01:22.240> breaking

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
won't give you the same breaking

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.240 
won't give you the same breaking
strainers<00:01:23.050> or<00:01:23.170> not<00:01:23.380> we've<00:01:23.530> done<00:01:23.710> loads<00:01:23.980> of

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
strainers or not we've done loads of

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.160 
strainers or not we've done loads of
breaking<00:01:24.580> strain<00:01:24.790> tests<00:01:25.090> on<00:01:25.300> this<00:01:25.480> and<00:01:25.810> it

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
breaking strain tests on this and it

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.110 
breaking strain tests on this and it
only<00:01:26.350> works<00:01:26.710> on<00:01:26.980> stiff<00:01:27.250> materials<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:27.909> you<00:01:28.000> can

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
only works on stiff materials so you can

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.730 
only works on stiff materials so you can
do<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.360> mouth<00:01:28.570> trap<00:01:28.840> in<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.140> that's<00:01:29.590> no

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
do the mouth trap in it that's no

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.800 
do the mouth trap in it that's no
problem<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.520> can<00:01:30.550> do<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.880> hybrid<00:01:31.060> stiffen<00:01:31.659> it

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
problem you can do the hybrid stiffen it

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.930 
problem you can do the hybrid stiffen it
but<00:01:32.229> don't<00:01:32.470> try<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:32.740> do<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:32.950> soft<00:01:33.250> uplink<00:01:33.640> in<00:01:33.790> it

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
but don't try and do a soft uplink in it

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.310 
but don't try and do a soft uplink in it
because<00:01:34.270> you'll<00:01:34.390> get<00:01:34.510> a<00:01:34.540> lower<00:01:34.780> breaking

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
because you'll get a lower breaking

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.110 
because you'll get a lower breaking
strain<00:01:35.590> as<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:36.550> talked<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.790> you<00:01:36.850> about<00:01:36.940> the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
strain as it talked to you about the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.330 
strain as it talked to you about the
rest<00:01:37.330> of<00:01:37.480> the<00:01:37.540> rig<00:01:37.830> we've<00:01:38.830> probably<00:01:38.950> got<00:01:39.130> 8

knotless knot but after a couple of

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.250 
knotless knot but after a couple of
turns<00:01:48.670> I've<00:01:48.880> pulled<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.390> hair<00:01:49.780> out<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.140> way

he<00:01:50.440> carried<00:01:50.770> on<00:01:50.890> doing<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.400> knotless<00:01:51.670> knot

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
he carried on doing the knotless knot

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.460 
he carried on doing the knotless knot
then<00:01:52.360> gone<00:01:52.540> back<00:01:52.720> through<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:53.020> art<00:01:53.140> solves

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
then gone back through the art solves

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.170 
then gone back through the art solves
the<00:01:53.590> point<00:01:53.800> that's<00:01:54.010> very<00:01:54.430> important<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.030> you

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
the point that's very important that you

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.180 
the point that's very important that you
go<00:01:55.330> towards<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:55.690> point<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.200> then<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.010> hair

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
go towards the point and then the hair

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.370 
go towards the point and then the hair
is<00:01:57.310> tied<00:01:57.550> after<00:01:58.000> that<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.600> get<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:58.840> exactly<00:01:59.260> the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
kicks in an acute angle and that helps

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.010 
kicks in an acute angle and that helps
the<00:02:05.950> hook<00:02:06.100> flip<00:02:06.400> over<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:07.000> catch<00:02:07.420> hold<00:02:07.690> even

just to pin everything flat on the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.869 
just to pin everything flat on the
bottom<00:02:20.319> so<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.129> fish<00:02:21.310> find<00:02:21.519> it<00:02:21.670> very

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
bottom so the fish find it very

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
difficult to detect it's there and then

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.150 
difficult to detect it's there and then
the<00:02:23.530> hook<00:02:23.680> bite

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.910 
the hook bite
absolutely<00:02:25.150> critical<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.260> caighdeán<00:02:26.650> rig

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
absolutely critical so the caighdeán rig

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.680 
absolutely critical so the caighdeán rig
is<00:02:27.099> a<00:02:27.129> slow<00:02:27.519> sinking<00:02:27.970> hook<00:02:28.120> by<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.360> see<00:02:28.599> I've

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
is a slow sinking hook by you see I've

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.600 
is a slow sinking hook by you see I've
got<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.019> Mauser<00:02:29.530> effect<00:02:29.950> there<00:02:30.099> that's<00:02:30.310> Tom's

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
little beauty just drilled the bait out

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.830 
little beauty just drilled the bait out
with<00:02:33.010> one<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.280> our<00:02:33.340> new<00:02:33.550> bait<00:02:33.760> drills<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.330> 6<00:02:34.629> mil

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840

with one of our new bait drills a 6 mil
cult<00:02:35.110> plug<00:02:35.349> has<00:02:35.620> gone<00:02:36.069> into<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.730> little

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
cult plug has gone into that a little

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.460 
cult plug has gone into that a little
bit<00:02:37.300> sticks<00:02:37.569> out<00:02:37.750> at<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.900> end<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.290> just

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
bit sticks out at the end so it just

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.619 
bit sticks out at the end so it just
lifts<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.950> up<00:02:39.010> off<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.310> bottom<00:02:39.459> like<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:39.819> so

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
lifts it up off the bottom like that so

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.780 
lifts it up off the bottom like that so
the<00:02:40.749> hook<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:41.109> caught<00:02:41.409> ready<00:02:42.249> to<00:02:42.430> go<00:02:42.549> into<00:02:42.700> the

and got away with it if I wind it back
in<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.329> that<00:03:11.420> bit<00:03:11.599> of<00:03:11.689> line<00:03:11.810> he's<00:03:11.989> still<00:03:12.200> up

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379

inside<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.920> lid<00:03:13.069> clip<00:03:13.310> as<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.519> put<00:03:13.700> it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
inside the lid clip as I put it

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.369 
inside the lid clip as I put it
originally<00:03:14.299> but<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.870> means<00:03:14.959> something's

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
originally but it means something's

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.379 
originally but it means something's
happened<00:03:15.739> between<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:16.189> reek<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.639> the<00:03:17.209> rod

happened between the reek and the rod

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.240 
happened between the reek and the rod
tip<00:03:17.689> so<00:03:17.930> probably<00:03:18.319> a<00:03:18.379> lion<00:03:18.620> bite<00:03:18.889> so<00:03:19.069> it's<00:03:19.189> a

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
tip so probably a lion bite so it's a

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.039 
tip so probably a lion bite so it's a
real<00:03:19.459> good<00:03:19.669> indication<00:03:20.329> whether<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.900> fish

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
real good indication whether the fish

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.390 
real good indication whether the fish
are<00:03:21.200> mucking<00:03:21.379> about<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.799> your<00:03:21.919> rigs<00:03:22.099> or<00:03:22.250> not

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
are mucking about of your rigs or not

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.190 
are mucking about of your rigs or not
but<00:03:22.519> if<00:03:22.579> you<00:03:22.639> put<00:03:22.849> this<00:03:23.000> out<00:03:23.239> amongst<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.019> big

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
but if you put this out amongst the big

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.869 
but if you put this out amongst the big
bed<00:03:24.379> of<00:03:24.409> boilies<00:03:24.829> you're<00:03:25.129> gonna<00:03:25.280> get<00:03:25.459> loads<00:03:25.730> of

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
bed of boilies you're gonna get loads of

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.090
