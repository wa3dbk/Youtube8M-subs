and<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:26.160> until<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.539> few<00:00:27.570> weeks<00:00:27.779> ago<00:00:28.140> I

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
and up until just a few weeks ago I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.790 
and up until just a few weeks ago I
really<00:00:29.550> didn't<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> consistent<00:00:31.650> way<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
really didn't have a consistent way to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.410 
really didn't have a consistent way to
do<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.250> maybe<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.669> few<00:00:32.850> months<00:00:33.149> I've<00:00:33.360> been

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
do this maybe a few months I've been

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.130 
do this maybe a few months I've been
doing<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> last<00:00:34.350> few<00:00:34.590> months<00:00:34.850> but

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
doing this for the last few months but

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.380 
doing this for the last few months but
recently<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:38.070> had<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.579> aha<00:00:38.790> moment<00:00:39.329> like

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
recently I just had this aha moment like

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.760 
recently I just had this aha moment like
maybe<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.809> could<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> brush

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
maybe I could do this with the brush

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.139 
maybe I could do this with the brush
tool<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.309> tried<00:00:42.000> using<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:43.550> hsl<00:00:44.550> panel<00:00:44.969> down

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
tool I tried using the hsl panel down

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.479 
tool I tried using the hsl panel down
here<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.750> sometimes<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.010> would<00:00:47.160> click<00:00:47.309> on

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
here and sometimes I would click on

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.459 
here and sometimes I would click on
saturation<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.420> then<00:00:48.570> using<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.079> targeted

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
saturation and then using the targeted

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.319 
saturation and then using the targeted
adjustment<00:00:49.980> brush<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.399> would<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.760> drag<00:00:51.000> down

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
adjustment brush I would just drag down

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.819 
adjustment brush I would just drag down
where<00:00:51.629> maybe<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.930> thought<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> little

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
where maybe I thought there was a little

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.100 
where maybe I thought there was a little
bit<00:00:52.949> too<00:00:53.039> much<00:00:53.129> red<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:54.329> problem<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
bit too much red the problem is is that

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.229 
bit too much red the problem is is that
I<00:00:55.530> felt<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.190> really<00:00:56.219> d<00:00:56.610> saturated<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
I felt like it really d saturated the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.139 
I felt like it really d saturated the
skin<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:57.780> than<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.050> wanted<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
skin more than I wanted it to

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.160 
skin more than I wanted it to
occasionally<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.180> would<00:01:00.270> use<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.690> luminance

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
occasionally I would use the luminance

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.410 
occasionally I would use the luminance
here<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.219> would<00:01:02.280> click<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.210> same

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
here and I would click on the same

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.000 
here and I would click on the same
targeted<00:01:03.930> adjustment<00:01:04.439> brush<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.949> then

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
targeted adjustment brush and then

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.760 
targeted adjustment brush and then
increase<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.790> luminance<00:01:06.680> luminance<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
increase the luminance luminance is

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.910 
increase the luminance luminance is
basically<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> lightness<00:01:08.909> or<00:01:09.150> darkness<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
basically the lightness or darkness of a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.730 
basically the lightness or darkness of a
color<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.670> your<00:01:11.700> photo<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.930> would<00:01:13.140> increase

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
color in your photo so I would increase

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.399 
color in your photo so I would increase
it<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.040> kind<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> lighten<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.790> color<00:01:15.409> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
it to kind of lighten that color the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
it to kind of lighten that color the
problem<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.130> before<00:01:17.670> long<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.030> starts

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
problem is is that before long it starts

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.600 
problem is is that before long it starts
to<00:01:18.570> brighten<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> whole<00:01:19.470> face<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.250> didn't

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
to brighten the whole face and I didn't

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.920 
to brighten the whole face and I didn't
really<00:01:21.180> want<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.200> side<00:01:22.560> effect<00:01:22.920> either<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
really want that side effect either so I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.170 
really want that side effect either so I
found<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> brush<00:01:26.189> tool<00:01:26.520> helps<00:01:26.759> me<00:01:27.030> do

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
found that the brush tool helps me do

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.340 
found that the brush tool helps me do
this<00:01:27.330> pretty<00:01:27.540> well<00:01:27.810> i'm<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> show<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
this pretty well i'm going to show you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.190 
this pretty well i'm going to show you
how<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.600> usually<00:01:30.600> set<00:01:31.079> my

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
how I do that I usually set my

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.740 
how I do that I usually set my
brightness<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:32.119> select<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> brush<00:01:33.390> tool<00:01:33.450> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
brightness I select the brush tool and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.480 
brightness I select the brush tool and
then<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.020> sent<00:01:34.259> my<00:01:34.320> brightness<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.070> about<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
then I sent my brightness to be about a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.840 
then I sent my brightness to be about a
plus<00:01:35.820> 5<00:01:36.470> not<00:01:37.470> generally<00:01:38.250> any<00:01:38.400> more<00:01:38.670> than<00:01:38.820> that

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
plus 5 not generally any more than that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.580 
plus 5 not generally any more than that
and<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.450> I'm<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> come<00:01:39.869> down<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and then I'm going to come down here and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.840 
and then I'm going to come down here and
the<00:01:40.710> only<00:01:40.920> other<00:01:41.070> thing<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.340> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> change

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the only other thing I'm going to change

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.240 
the only other thing I'm going to change
is<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.210> color<00:01:42.540> I'm<00:01:43.259> going<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.560> select<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
is this color I'm going to select a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.060 
is this color I'm going to select a
green<00:01:44.880> color<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:46.020> light<00:01:46.380> green<00:01:46.740> color

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
green color a really light green color

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.840 
green color a really light green color
and<00:01:47.460> then<00:01:48.890> exit<00:01:49.890> out<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.490> reason

here<00:02:17.860> just<00:02:18.760> where<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.360> think<00:02:19.690> there's<00:02:19.870> just<00:02:20.020> a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
here just where I think there's just a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.350 
here just where I think there's just a
teeny<00:02:20.410> bit<00:02:20.590> too<00:02:20.770> much<00:02:20.890> red<00:02:21.220> then<00:02:22.090> I'm<00:02:22.180> going<00:02:22.300> to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
teeny bit too much red then I'm going to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.330 
teeny bit too much red then I'm going to
zoom<00:02:22.420> into<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:23.050> hundred<00:02:23.320> percent<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.010> can<00:02:24.190> see

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
zoom into a hundred percent so I can see

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.310 
zoom into a hundred percent so I can see
his<00:02:24.490> eyes<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.360> then<00:02:25.870> I'm<00:02:25.960> going<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.140> try<00:02:26.290> to

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
his eyes and then I'm going to try to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.350 
his eyes and then I'm going to try to
get<00:02:26.500> rid<00:02:26.710> of<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.950> red<00:02:27.610> that's<00:02:27.910> in<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> whites

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
get rid of the red that's in the whites

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.270 
get rid of the red that's in the whites
of<00:02:28.540> his<00:02:28.660> eyes<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.380> along<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:29.740> edge<00:02:30.010> at

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
of his eyes and just along the edge at

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.360 
of his eyes and just along the edge at
the<00:02:30.430> edge<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.420> eye<00:02:31.510> there<00:02:32.100> these<00:02:33.100> changes

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
the edge of the eye there these changes

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.040 
the edge of the eye there these changes
are<00:02:33.610> going<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.850> be<00:02:33.940> extremely<00:02:34.180> subtle<00:02:34.720> so

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
are going to be extremely subtle so

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.020 
are going to be extremely subtle so
there<00:02:35.230> might<00:02:35.710> be<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.920> little<00:02:36.100> bit<00:02:36.310> hard<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.640> see

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
there might be a little bit hard to see

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.030 
there might be a little bit hard to see
but<00:02:37.420> try<00:02:37.720> them<00:02:37.900> out<00:02:38.020> for<00:02:38.230> yourself<00:02:38.620> because<00:02:38.830> I
