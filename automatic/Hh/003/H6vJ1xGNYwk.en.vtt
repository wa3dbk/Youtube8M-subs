quarter we've got our angle direction

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:55.600 
quarter we've got our angle direction
that<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.370> could<00:00:35.550> change<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:53.899> there<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.020> go

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
that we could change here there we go

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.860 
that we could change here there we go
all<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:56.850> now<00:00:57.059> we're<00:00:57.210> moving<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.750> the

all right now we're moving on to the
next<00:00:58.170> round<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:59.010> more<00:00:59.250> difficulty<00:01:08.780> as<00:01:09.780> you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
next round with more difficulty as you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
can see over here it takes three

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.090 
can see over here it takes three
quarters<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.240> pass<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.750> level<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.439> 40

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.179 
quarters to pass this level we have 40
quarters<00:01:14.520> left<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.439> course<00:01:16.710> when<00:01:17.040> we

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
quarters left and so of course when we

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.330 
quarters left and so of course when we
miss<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:18.299> uses<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.930> quarter<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.189> don't

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
miss it uses up a quarter and we don't

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
miss it uses up a quarter and we don't
get<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.670> keep<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> next<00:01:21.509> round<00:01:23.840> all

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
right added difficulty here with that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:42.530 
right added difficulty here with that
bottle<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> way

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
difficulty here we've got a glass back

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.010 
difficulty here we've got a glass back
there<00:01:51.250> which<00:01:51.550> I've<00:01:51.760> yet<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.120> make<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.810> so

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
I'm not going to try but let's try and

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.720 
I'm not going to try but let's try and
get<00:01:55.630> up<00:01:55.870> looks<00:01:56.170> like<00:01:56.230> I<00:01:56.440> lost<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:57.040> quarter<00:01:57.580> there

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
you can see I now have 39 coins left now

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.400 
you can see I now have 39 coins left now
just<00:02:07.720> for<00:02:07.870> the<00:02:07.930> heck<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.320> let's<00:02:08.380> try<00:02:08.920> let's

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
just for the heck of it let's try let's

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.500 
just for the heck of it let's try let's
try<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:12.120> huge<00:02:13.120> arc<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.020> see<00:02:14.500> if<00:02:14.590> we<00:02:14.770> can't<00:02:15.120> nap<00:02:16.120> I

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
try a huge arc and see if we can't nap I

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.090 
try a huge arc and see if we can't nap I
don't<00:02:17.050> even<00:02:17.140> know<00:02:17.320> if<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.680> get<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.950> into

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
don't even know if you can get it into

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.490 
don't even know if you can get it into
that<00:02:18.310> glass<00:02:18.580> I've<00:02:18.880> definitely<00:02:19.090> tried<00:02:19.690> but<00:02:20.380> it

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
that glass I've definitely tried but it

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:32.040 
that glass I've definitely tried but it
is<00:02:20.620> very<00:02:20.860> difficult<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:30.480> one<00:02:31.480> more<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.870> pass

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
is very difficult and one more to pass

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.080 
is very difficult and one more to pass
this<00:02:32.290> level<00:02:32.560> up<00:02:33.250> looks<00:02:33.490> like<00:02:33.640> we<00:02:33.760> did<00:02:33.880> pass

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
this level up looks like we did pass

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.110 
this level up looks like we did pass
that<00:02:34.330> level<00:02:34.600> so<00:02:35.080> now<00:02:35.230> we've<00:02:35.410> really<00:02:35.860> got

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
that level so now we've really got

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.020 
that level so now we've really got
something<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.450> our<00:02:37.510> way<00:02:37.810> here<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:39.030> what's

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
something in our way here and what's

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.270 
something in our way here and what's
cool<00:02:40.300> about<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.660> is<00:02:40.870> there<00:02:41.260> are<00:02:41.470> even<00:02:41.800> ways<00:02:42.010> to

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
cool about it is there are even ways to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.400 
cool about it is there are even ways to
get<00:02:42.400> extra<00:02:42.760> points<00:02:42.970> if<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.900> were<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.170> ricochet

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
get extra points if you were to ricochet

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.229 
get extra points if you were to ricochet
