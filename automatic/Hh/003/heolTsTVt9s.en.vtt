what tools you're going to need for Dyna
matting<00:00:11.340> one<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.610> course<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.030> you're<00:00:12.120> going<00:00:12.210> to

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
matting one of course is you're going to

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.030 
matting one of course is you're going to
need<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.690> tape<00:00:13.139> measure<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.620> can<00:00:13.830> measure

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
need a tape measure so you can measure

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.039 
need a tape measure so you can measure
your<00:00:14.309> spot<00:00:14.730> if<00:00:15.210> you're<00:00:15.240> doing<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.599> big<00:00:15.839> area

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
your spot if you're doing a big area

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.890 
your spot if you're doing a big area
like<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.250> good<00:00:17.460> idea<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.820> cut<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.830> do

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
like this it's a good idea to cut and do

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.660 
like this it's a good idea to cut and do
two<00:00:21.900> sections<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.070> whole<00:00:23.220> reason<00:00:23.400> why<00:00:23.609> is

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
two sections and the whole reason why is

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.060 
two sections and the whole reason why is
of<00:00:23.910> course<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.539> try<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> rush<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.410> then<00:00:25.890> you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
of course if you try to rush it then you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.710 
of course if you try to rush it then you
it's<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.369> lot<00:00:26.519> harder<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.880> keep<00:00:26.970> their<00:00:27.269> bubbles

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
it's a lot harder to keep their bubbles

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.169 
it's a lot harder to keep their bubbles
out<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.800> wrecks<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.460> final<00:00:29.760> product<00:00:30.119> so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
out and it wrecks the final product so

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.269 
out and it wrecks the final product so
what<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.960> highly<00:00:31.109> suggest<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.949> what

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
what I highly suggest you do is what

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.000 
what I highly suggest you do is what
we've<00:00:32.430> done<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:32.820> we've<00:00:33.030> cut<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.660> then<00:00:34.380> we've

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
we've done here we've cut and then we've

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.610 
we've done here we've cut and then we've
done<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.579> piece<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> time<00:00:36.120> then<00:00:36.960> for

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
done one piece at a time then for

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.310 
done one piece at a time then for
applying<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.670> you're<00:00:39.540> gonna<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.930> roll<00:00:40.140> it

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
applying it you're gonna just roll it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.990 
applying it you're gonna just roll it
once<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.670> go<00:00:41.790> with<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
once you have it on you just go with a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.690 
once you have it on you just go with a
roller<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:44.100> know<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.550> want

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
roller and if you you know if you want

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.700 
roller and if you you know if you want
to<00:00:44.760> go<00:00:44.940> 100%<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:46.050> cool<00:00:46.260> outside

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
to go 100% and it's really cool outside

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.430 
to go 100% and it's really cool outside
it's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> good<00:00:47.430> idea<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.820> as<00:00:48.300> you're<00:00:49.170> rolling

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it's a good idea to as you're rolling

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.200 
it's a good idea to as you're rolling
shoot<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.129> either<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.430> hairdryer<00:00:50.879> or<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
shoot it with either a hairdryer or a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.389 
shoot it with either a hairdryer or a
heat<00:00:51.510> gun<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.829> extra<00:00:53.280> bit

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
heat gun just so you get that extra bit

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.520 
heat gun just so you get that extra bit
of<00:00:54.350> adhesiveness

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
of adhesiveness

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.150 
of adhesiveness
to<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> metal<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.059> other<00:00:57.239> than<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.449> yeah<00:00:58.199> all

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
to the metal so other than that yeah all

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.450 
to the metal so other than that yeah all
you're<00:00:59.370> gonna<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:01.309> when<00:01:02.309> you're

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
you're gonna have to do is when you're

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399 
you're gonna have to do is when you're
putting<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.789> corner<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.930> work<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
putting a corner on you just work the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.810 
putting a corner on you just work the
one<00:01:04.589> corner<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> go<00:01:05.610> with<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
one corner and then you go with the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.929 
one corner and then you go with the
roller<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.070> once<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> corner<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
roller and once you get the corner you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.289 
roller and once you get the corner you
just<00:01:09.150> slowly<00:01:09.540> work<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.500> corner<00:01:10.890> out<00:01:11.130> or<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
just slowly work the corner out or the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.850 
just slowly work the corner out or the
other<00:01:12.420> way<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.689> doing<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.170> which<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.650> another

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
other way of doing it which is another

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.429 
other way of doing it which is another
good<00:01:14.070> way<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> line<00:01:15.869> say<00:01:16.229> like

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
good way is if you have a line say like

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.980 
good way is if you have a line say like
this<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:17.100> you'll<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.640> you'll<00:01:17.850> start<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
this what you'll do is you'll start it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.200 
this what you'll do is you'll start it
there<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.590> line<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.400> slowly

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
there like line it up and then slowly

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.039 
there like line it up and then slowly
flip<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.380> over<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.920> work<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.060> along<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> side

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
flip it over and work it along the side

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.719 
flip it over and work it along the side
with<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.320> hands<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.830> you're<00:01:26.130> rolling<00:01:26.340> down

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
with your hands as you're rolling down

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.080 
with your hands as you're rolling down
and<00:01:27.560> then<00:01:28.560> once<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.579> know

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and then once you have it you know

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.810 
and then once you have it you know
slowly<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.900> roll<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.470> way<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.009> then<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
slowly just roll this way and then it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.120 
slowly just roll this way and then it
should<00:01:33.119> turn<00:01:33.299> out<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.750> not<00:01:33.960> 100%<00:01:34.500> perfect<00:01:34.890> on

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
should turn out it's not 100% perfect on

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.950 
should turn out it's not 100% perfect on
the<00:01:35.220> first<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.939> mean<00:01:36.390> don't<00:01:36.689> chew

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the first time I mean don't chew

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.510 
the first time I mean don't chew
yourself<00:01:37.350> out<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.860> still<00:01:38.009> gonna<00:01:38.189> give<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.490> a

good<00:01:38.700> sound<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.210> mean<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.110> instance

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
good sound I mean just for instance

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.370 
good sound I mean just for instance
listen<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.640> side<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.229> even

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
listen to this side or if you can even

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.340 
listen to this side or if you can even
hear<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.680> at<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.009> camera<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:45.110> it's<00:01:46.110> solid

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
hear it at the camera but it's solid

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.760 
hear it at the camera but it's solid
there<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:50.329> once<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.869> all<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.680> know

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
there but once you have it all you know

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370 
there but once you have it all you know
matted<00:01:53.250> out<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.390> only<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.899> side<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
matted out this is only one side and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.170 
matted out this is only one side and
then<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.040> quarter<00:01:56.399> piece<00:01:56.579> it's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
then this is just a quarter piece it's

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.389 
then this is just a quarter piece it's
even<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:57.990> more<00:01:58.860> different<00:01:59.219> when<00:01:59.310> you
