welcome to simply scuba in today's

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.110 
welcome to simply scuba in today's
session<00:00:07.339> we're<00:00:07.460> gonna<00:00:07.520> be<00:00:07.640> looking<00:00:07.970> at<00:00:08.000> the

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
session we're gonna be looking at the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.180 
session we're gonna be looking at the
scubapro<00:00:08.570> mark<00:00:09.080> 25s<00:00:10.179> 600<00:00:11.179> balance<00:00:11.570> regulator

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
scubapro mark 25s 600 balance regulator

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.259 
scubapro mark 25s 600 balance regulator
let's<00:00:13.190> take<00:00:13.340> a<00:00:13.370> closer<00:00:13.670> look<00:00:13.790> at<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:14.059> first

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
let's take a closer look at the first

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.929 
let's take a closer look at the first
and<00:00:14.509> second<00:00:14.840> stages<00:00:15.080> mark<00:00:15.799> 25<00:00:16.189> first<00:00:16.580> stage

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
and second stages mark 25 first stage

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.210 
and second stages mark 25 first stage
then<00:00:17.240> this<00:00:17.599> particular<00:00:17.840> version<00:00:18.200> is<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:19.189> a

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
then this particular version is the a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.819 
then this particular version is the a
clamp<00:00:19.669> version<00:00:20.210> it<00:00:20.899> can<00:00:21.140> come<00:00:21.410> in<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:21.649> din

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:21.829 
clamp version it can come in a din

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.700 
clamp version it can come in a din
version<00:00:22.279> as<00:00:22.369> well<00:00:22.399> obviously<00:00:23.239> the<00:00:23.840> a<00:00:24.110> clamp<00:00:24.590> is

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
version as well obviously the a clamp is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.280 
version as well obviously the a clamp is
good<00:00:24.919> for<00:00:25.130> two<00:00:25.430> three<00:00:25.640> two<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.180> the<00:00:26.840> din<00:00:27.050> is

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
good for two three two and the din is

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.790 
good for two three two and the din is
good<00:00:27.529> for<00:00:27.770> 300<00:00:28.340> bar<00:00:28.989> lots<00:00:29.989> of<00:00:30.110> features<00:00:30.470> on<00:00:30.649> the

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
good for 300 bar lots of features on the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.729 
good for 300 bar lots of features on the
mark<00:00:30.980> 25<00:00:31.550> its<00:00:32.450> first<00:00:32.840> of<00:00:32.989> all<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.200> piston

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
mark 25 its first of all a piston

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.770 
mark 25 its first of all a piston
regulator<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:34.700> it's<00:00:34.850> a<00:00:34.910> very<00:00:35.330> high

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
regulator so it's a very high

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.350 
regulator so it's a very high
performance<00:00:36.500> regulator<00:00:37.130> often<00:00:38.090> used<00:00:38.300> for

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
performance regulator often used for

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.840 
performance regulator often used for
very<00:00:38.750> deep<00:00:39.050> diving<00:00:39.320> but<00:00:40.100> excellent<00:00:40.580> for

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
very deep diving but excellent for

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.530 
very deep diving but excellent for
recreational<00:00:41.420> diving<00:00:41.720> as<00:00:42.050> well<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:44.000> features

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
recreational diving as well it features

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.280 
recreational diving as well it features
five<00:00:44.960> low-pressure<00:00:45.620> ports<00:00:46.570> for<00:00:47.570> on<00:00:47.870> the

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
five low-pressure ports for on the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.400 
five low-pressure ports for on the
outside<00:00:48.350> of<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:48.950> turret<00:00:49.310> and<00:00:49.850> one<00:00:50.360> on<00:00:50.630> the<00:00:51.170> top

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
outside of the turret and one on the top

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.729 
outside of the turret and one on the top
of<00:00:51.560> the<00:00:51.650> turret<00:00:52.270> much<00:00:53.270> discussion<00:00:53.660> occurs<00:00:54.410> on

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
of the turret much discussion occurs on

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.069 
of the turret much discussion occurs on
which<00:00:55.040> way<00:00:55.250> up<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.790> mark<00:00:56.030> 25<00:00:56.570> should<00:00:56.960> be

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
which way up the mark 25 should be

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.290 
which way up the mark 25 should be
orientated<00:00:57.530> it's<00:00:58.430> really<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:58.850> matter<00:00:59.120> of

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
orientated it's really a matter of

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.229 
orientated it's really a matter of
personal<00:00:59.660> preference<00:01:00.399> it<00:01:01.399> operates<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.060> same

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
personal preference it operates the same

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.869 
personal preference it operates the same
either<00:01:02.540> way<00:01:02.780> up<00:01:03.079> if<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:04.129> want<00:01:04.309> extreme

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
either way up if you want extreme

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.350 
either way up if you want extreme
performance<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:07.250> put<00:01:07.490> your<00:01:07.670> second<00:01:08.090> stage

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
performance you put your second stage

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.910 
performance you put your second stage
offer<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.170> very<00:01:09.440> top<00:01:10.220> of<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.120> turret<00:01:11.920> but

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
offer the very top of the turret but

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.630 
offer the very top of the turret but
really<00:01:13.670> for<00:01:13.940> most<00:01:14.090> recreational<00:01:14.810> diving

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
really for most recreational diving

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.580 
really for most recreational diving
that's<00:01:16.640> very<00:01:16.940> much<00:01:17.060> overkill<00:01:17.690> and<00:01:17.900> not

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
that's very much overkill and not

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.610 
that's very much overkill and not
required<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:20.000> has<00:01:20.150> two<00:01:20.479> high-pressure<00:01:21.110> ports

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
required it has two high-pressure ports

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.039 
required it has two high-pressure ports
one<00:01:22.340> on<00:01:22.460> either<00:01:22.610> side<00:01:23.030> which<00:01:23.600> allows<00:01:23.840> you<00:01:24.020> to

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
one on either side which allows you to

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.700 
one on either side which allows you to
have<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.200> gauge<00:01:24.500> in<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.830> computer<00:01:25.930> these<00:01:26.930> fins

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
have a gauge in a computer these fins

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.000 
have a gauge in a computer these fins
halfway<00:01:28.400> down<00:01:28.580> below<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.120> turret<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.600> turret

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
halfway down below the turret the turret

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.899 
halfway down below the turret the turret
swivels<00:01:31.010> for<00:01:31.280> comfort<00:01:32.650> generally<00:01:33.670> you'll<00:01:34.670> see

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
swivels for comfort generally you'll see

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.330 
swivels for comfort generally you'll see
that<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.180> orientation<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.979> turret

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
that the orientation of the turret

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.539 
that the orientation of the turret
allows<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.240> most<00:01:38.869> of<00:01:39.049> one<00:01:39.260> half<00:01:39.560> isn't

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
allows that most of one half isn't

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.870 
allows that most of one half isn't
actually<00:01:41.299> used<00:01:41.630> for<00:01:41.840> hoses<00:01:42.440> so<00:01:43.070> personally<00:01:43.850> I

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
actually used for hoses so personally I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.730 
actually used for hoses so personally I
tend<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.330> put<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:44.780> section<00:01:45.229> towards<00:01:45.500> the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
tend to put this section towards the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.700 
tend to put this section towards the
back<00:01:45.920> of<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.220> head<00:01:46.510> so<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.600> hoses<00:01:48.020> come<00:01:48.530> out

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
back of the head so the hoses come out

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.410 
back of the head so the hoses come out
although<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:49.430> does<00:01:49.610> mean<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.180> back

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
although it does mean that the back

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.010 
although it does mean that the back
hoses<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.110> normally<00:01:51.470> go<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.799> BC<00:01:52.220> DS<00:01:53.020> tend

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
hoses that normally go to the BC DS tend

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.240 
hoses that normally go to the BC DS tend
to<00:01:54.490> come<00:01:55.490> out<00:01:55.580> of<00:01:55.760> a<00:01:55.790> bit<00:01:55.909> of<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.060> strange<00:01:56.390> angle

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
to come out of a bit of a strange angle

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.030 
to come out of a bit of a strange angle
but<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.610> completely<00:01:59.119> personal<00:01:59.479> preference

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
but it is completely personal preference

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.249 
but it is completely personal preference
you<00:02:01.040> have<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.310> fins<00:02:01.580> as<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.090> go<00:02:02.240> down<00:02:02.540> this<00:02:02.990> is

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
you have the fins as you go down this is

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.160 
you have the fins as you go down this is
the<00:02:03.950> tisk<00:02:04.460> system<00:02:05.030> thermal<00:02:05.630> insulation

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
the tisk system thermal insulation

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.109 
the tisk system thermal insulation
system<00:02:06.799> this<00:02:07.369> keeps<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.850> regulator

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
system this keeps the regulator

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.199 
system this keeps the regulator
effectively<00:02:08.989> warm<00:02:09.289> in<00:02:09.769> cold<00:02:10.039> water<00:02:10.399> to

effectively warm in cold water to

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.559 
effectively warm in cold water to

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
dissipate away any potential ice that

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.730 
dissipate away any potential ice that
may<00:02:14.719> form

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
may form

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.530 
may form

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
regulator this way up which obviously

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.860 
regulator this way up which obviously
that<00:02:45.200> then<00:02:45.440> keeps<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.130> very<00:02:46.430> low<00:02:46.610> profile<00:02:47.450> on

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
that then keeps a very low profile on

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.990 
that then keeps a very low profile on
the<00:02:48.500> top<00:02:48.710> of<00:02:48.830> your<00:02:48.860> cylinder<00:02:49.430> if<00:02:49.610> your<00:02:49.730> rec

diving<00:02:50.630> or<00:02:51.050> something<00:02:51.470> like<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.650> then<00:02:52.580> that

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
diving or something like that then that

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.120 
diving or something like that then that
would<00:02:53.300> be<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.510> way<00:02:53.690> up<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:54.110> mount<00:02:54.350> that<00:02:56.980> so<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
would be the way up to mount that so the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.030 
would be the way up to mount that so the

fully balanced second stage which means

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.410 
fully balanced second stage which means

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
meaning that if you drop the regulator

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.090 
meaning that if you drop the regulator
face<00:03:35.300> down<00:03:35.570> in<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.840> water<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:36.650> does<00:03:36.890> reduce

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
face down in the water it does reduce

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.050 
face down in the water it does reduce
the<00:03:37.400> chance<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.330> free<00:03:38.570> flow<00:03:39.340> in<00:03:40.340> dive<00:03:40.730> mode

that<00:03:41.540> baffle<00:03:42.140> is<00:03:42.350> then<00:03:42.890> adjusted<00:03:43.120> so<00:03:44.120> now<00:03:44.390> it

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
that baffle is then adjusted so now it

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.530 
that baffle is then adjusted so now it
sits<00:03:44.840> like<00:03:45.140> this<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:46.100> air<00:03:46.370> comes<00:03:47.150> into

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
sits like this and the air comes into

just<00:04:34.160> obviously<00:04:34.400> when<00:04:34.550> your<00:04:34.669> air<00:04:34.850> density

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
just obviously when your air density

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.360 
just obviously when your air density
increases<00:04:35.810> as<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.199> get<00:04:36.380> deeper<00:04:36.620> that

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
increases as you get deeper that

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.580 
increases as you get deeper that
wouldn't<00:04:37.760> occur<00:04:38.120> but<00:04:38.630> on<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.900> surface<00:04:39.410> where

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
wouldn't occur but on the surface where

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.830 
wouldn't occur but on the surface where
you<00:04:39.710> have<00:04:39.889> normal<00:04:40.250> air<00:04:40.370> density<00:04:40.780> that<00:04:41.780> can

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
you have normal air density that can

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.010 
you have normal air density that can
occur<00:04:42.410> on<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:46.220> back<00:04:46.460> of<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:47.060> second<00:04:47.780> stage

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
occur on the back of the second stage

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.760 
occur on the back of the second stage
you<00:04:48.410> have<00:04:49.340> scuba<00:04:49.820> pros<00:04:50.150> comfy<00:04:51.020> fit<00:04:51.229> mouthpiece

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
you have scuba pros comfy fit mouthpiece

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.570 
you have scuba pros comfy fit mouthpiece
and<00:04:52.300> bubble<00:04:53.300> deflector<00:04:54.130> it's<00:04:55.130> a<00:04:55.310> nice

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
and bubble deflector it's a nice

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.540 
and bubble deflector it's a nice
lightweight<00:04:56.560> very<00:04:57.560> high-performance

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
lightweight very high-performance

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.090 
lightweight very high-performance
