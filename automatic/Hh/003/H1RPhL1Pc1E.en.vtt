6 9 PI R on how to remove the
differentials<00:00:15.209> from<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.500> LSD<00:00:16.890> -<00:00:17.070> um<00:00:18.320> so

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
differentials from the LSD - um so

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.440 
differentials from the LSD - um so
pretty<00:00:19.530> much<00:00:19.620> it's<00:00:19.860> really<00:00:20.100> simple<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.670> went

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.750 
it enough you're just gonna pull this
off<00:03:04.470> well<00:03:05.470> these<00:03:05.590> two<00:03:06.630> spaces<00:03:07.630> over<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:09.340> your

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
off well these two spaces over and your

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.560 
off well these two spaces over and your
differential<00:03:10.360> should<00:03:11.190> simply<00:03:12.190> pop<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.670> may

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
differential should simply pop it may

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.470 
differential should simply pop it may
take<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> bit<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.110> force<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:18.430> go<00:03:18.580> it's<00:03:19.240> pretty

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
take a bit of force you go it's pretty

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.530 
take a bit of force you go it's pretty
tight<00:03:19.720> down<00:03:19.750> there

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.450 

hey<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.140> guys<00:03:25.230> we're<00:03:25.409> back

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
hey you guys we're back

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.010 
hey you guys we're back
so<00:03:26.610> just<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.970> quick<00:03:27.090> update<00:03:27.270> on<00:03:27.540> what<00:03:27.660> happened

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
so just a quick update on what happened

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.960 
so just a quick update on what happened
there<00:03:28.190> reasonings<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.370> differential<00:03:29.910> has

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
there reasonings the differential has

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.880 
there reasonings the differential has
not<00:03:30.090> been<00:03:30.240> taking<00:03:30.510> up<00:03:30.600> for<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.780> while<00:03:30.990> so<00:03:31.320> in<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
not been taking up for a while so in the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.120 
not been taking up for a while so in the
plastic<00:03:32.340> coupling<00:03:32.790> right<00:03:33.240> here<00:03:33.800> alright<00:03:34.800> and

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
plastic coupling right here alright and

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.500 
plastic coupling right here alright and
that<00:03:35.250> plastic<00:03:35.430> coupling<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.060> differential

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
that plastic coupling the differential

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.390 
that plastic coupling the differential
actually<00:03:36.780> goes<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:36.960> got<00:03:37.200> stuck<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:38.100> might<00:03:38.250> be

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
actually goes to got stuck that might be

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.770 
actually goes to got stuck that might be
a<00:03:38.430> problem<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.820> you'll<00:03:39.030> have<00:03:39.240> and<00:03:39.630> goes

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
a problem that you'll have and goes

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.900 
a problem that you'll have and goes
Josh's<00:03:40.170> phone<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:40.890> what<00:03:41.340> we<00:03:41.460> did<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.760> solve

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
Josh's phone so what we did to solve

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.240 
Josh's phone so what we did to solve
that<00:03:42.120> problem<00:03:42.570> is<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:43.620> can<00:03:43.740> just<00:03:43.860> take<00:03:44.010> any

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
that problem is you can just take any

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.820 
that problem is you can just take any
key<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:45.080> just<00:03:46.080> go<00:03:46.320> from<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.530> differential

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
key and just go from the differential

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.310 
key and just go from the differential
just<00:03:47.040> like<00:03:47.160> that<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:48.000> it's<00:03:48.180> back<00:03:48.330> alright

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
just like that and it's back alright

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.620 
just like that and it's back alright
that'll<00:03:50.040> loosen<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.340> trade<00:03:50.610> up<00:03:50.760> Josh<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.570> want

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
that'll loosen a trade up Josh you want

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.690 
that'll loosen a trade up Josh you want
to<00:03:51.750> finish<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:51.960> off<00:03:52.080> also<00:03:52.890> another<00:03:53.250> reason

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
to finish that off also another reason

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.990 
to finish that off also another reason
why<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.210> was<00:03:54.330> like<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.720> was<00:03:54.780> cuz<00:03:55.290> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
why that was like that was cuz the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.610 
why that was like that was cuz the
anodized<00:03:57.000> blue<00:03:57.360> was<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.840> just<00:03:58.050> an<00:03:58.200> appeal

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
anodized blue was that just an appeal

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.700 
anodized blue was that just an appeal
and<00:03:58.860> as<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.460> was<00:03:59.790> peeling<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:00.840> heating<00:04:01.470> up

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
and as I was peeling is just heating up

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:16.700 
and as I was peeling is just heating up
and<00:04:01.950> then<00:04:02.100> got<00:04:02.580> stuck<00:04:02.880> in<00:04:03.120> there<00:04:03.330> so<00:04:15.050> and<00:04:16.050> there

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:16.710 
and then got stuck in there so and there

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.600 
and then got stuck in there so and there
is<00:04:16.890> your<00:04:17.040> differential<00:04:18.110> okay<00:04:19.110> so<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.650> was<00:04:20.550> just

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
is your differential okay so I was just

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.960 
is your differential okay so I was just
going<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:20.940> say<00:04:21.120> off<00:04:22.430> I'm<00:04:23.430> gonna<00:04:23.610> take<00:04:23.790> these

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
going to say off I'm gonna take these

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.870 
going to say off I'm gonna take these
apart<00:04:24.240> it's<00:04:24.630> pretty<00:04:24.810> simple<00:04:25.110> it's<00:04:25.200> three

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
apart it's pretty simple it's three

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:45.790 
apart it's pretty simple it's three
three<00:04:26.880> squares<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.630> top<00:04:30.200> take<00:04:31.200> all<00:04:31.470> three<00:04:31.740> up

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.439 

not<00:04:46.800> bad<00:04:47.039> music<00:04:49.999> yeah<00:04:50.999> nice<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:51.589> dark<00:04:52.589> so<00:04:53.449> very

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
not bad music yeah nice and dark so very

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.339 
not bad music yeah nice and dark so very
uh<00:04:55.759> so<00:04:56.759> that's<00:04:57.509> that<00:04:57.689> piece<00:04:57.869> right<00:04:58.050> there

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
uh so that's that piece right there

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.429 
uh so that's that piece right there
yep<00:04:59.059> so<00:05:00.059> you<00:05:00.089> can<00:05:00.269> take<00:05:00.479> care<00:05:00.599> of<00:05:00.659> that<00:05:00.809> natural

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:01.439 
yep so you can take care of that natural

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:06.259 
yep so you can take care of that natural
differential<00:05:02.159> itself<00:05:04.849> there's<00:05:05.849> a<00:05:05.909> another

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:06.269 
differential itself there's a another

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:11.029 
differential itself there's a another
four<00:05:06.689> screws<00:05:06.959> on<00:05:07.110> here<00:05:08.569> and<00:05:09.569> then<00:05:10.199> take<00:05:10.860> those

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
four screws on here and then take those

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.389 
four screws on here and then take those
out<00:05:11.659> this<00:05:12.659> is<00:05:12.719> gonna<00:05:12.839> be<00:05:12.989> very<00:05:13.019> hard<00:05:13.349> cuz<00:05:13.679> I've

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:14.399 
out this is gonna be very hard cuz I've

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:17.419 
out this is gonna be very hard cuz I've
hurt<00:05:14.580> your<00:05:14.669> fingers<00:05:15.800> just<00:05:16.800> trying<00:05:17.009> to<00:05:17.129> hold<00:05:17.279> on

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:17.429 
hurt your fingers just trying to hold on

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:19.869 
hurt your fingers just trying to hold on
to<00:05:17.459> it<00:05:17.759> not<00:05:17.999> spin<00:05:18.569> it<00:05:18.719> voila

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
to it not spin it voila

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.739 
to it not spin it voila
well<00:05:20.879> unless<00:05:21.029> you<00:05:21.179> want<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.360> get<00:05:21.509> a<00:05:21.539> lot<00:05:21.719> of

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:21.749 
well unless you want to get a lot of

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:22.969 
well unless you want to get a lot of
grease<00:05:21.990> on<00:05:22.110> your<00:05:22.229> fingers<00:05:22.289> which<00:05:22.679> I'm<00:05:22.830> not

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
grease on your fingers which I'm not

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:33.330 
grease on your fingers which I'm not
really<00:05:23.189> in<00:05:23.459> the<00:05:23.490> mood<00:05:23.639> for

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:48.649 

you

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.760 

pretty<00:05:49.659> much<00:05:49.780> you've<00:05:50.020> taken<00:05:50.199> out<00:05:50.439> the<00:05:50.560> four

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
pretty much you've taken out the four

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.330 
pretty much you've taken out the four
screws<00:05:51.039> you<00:05:51.189> can<00:05:51.340> just<00:05:51.490> open<00:05:51.669> it<00:05:51.879> up<00:05:52.289> and<00:05:53.340> don't

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
screws you can just open it up and don't

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.140 
screws you can just open it up and don't
let<00:05:54.490> up<00:05:54.610> for<00:05:54.639> us<00:05:54.879> there<00:05:55.629> your<00:05:55.840> spider<00:05:56.139> gears

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
let up for us there your spider gears

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.700 
let up for us there your spider gears
put<00:05:58.150> it<00:05:58.270> back<00:05:58.419> together<00:05:58.659> is<00:05:58.990> pretty<00:05:59.560> much

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
put it back together is pretty much

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.379 
put it back together is pretty much
taking<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.340> apart<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.819> other<00:06:00.849> way<00:06:01.270> around

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
taking it apart the other way around

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.809 
taking it apart the other way around
which<00:06:02.110> as<00:06:02.949> long<00:06:03.069> as<00:06:03.219> you<00:06:03.340> keep<00:06:03.490> everything

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:03.819 
which as long as you keep everything

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.929 
which as long as you keep everything
intact<00:06:04.449> and<00:06:06.030> together<00:06:07.110> she'd<00:06:08.110> be<00:06:08.229> pretty<00:06:08.379> easy

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:08.939 
intact and together she'd be pretty easy

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:10.679 
intact and together she'd be pretty easy
