00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.000
 Son, ears open, these are a few honest words 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.500
 Here is the ordinary everyday life, not a factory of dreams 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.500
 At the end of the month a few hunnies are missing 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.000
 It repeats itself as often as full and new moon 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500
 I never liked the cops, the church and the state 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
 Debt behind people like a funeral procession 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 This is the first line of the front, a war dance 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.000
 The world is deaf to your tears and whining 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500
 Do you remember puberty? Unforgettable atmosphere 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.000
 First parties, amphetamine and cheap wine 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.500
 School tails spent in cinemas was our whole world 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.500
 The first love and the first ??? on the chest 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.000
 On all the moments from those years 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 Problems that are never lacking 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.250
 Cheers, brother. Never too much of that 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.000
 And the experiences gained at that time serve us until today 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.000
 Surely you know such nights. This destructive moment 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.500
 In which every thought weighs far more than a ton 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
 And whether you like it or not, we're the same, homie 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.000
 Our hearts pump blood and the tears are salty 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.750
 I know, sometimes I sink myself in the sea of ​​bad thoughts 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.250
 And all I have is mental scars 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.000
 A rat race around us. Rally behind the plasticine 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 And some will end it, as Carradine did with Cobain 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.500
 A normal gray day, people dye it with vodka 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 Small change, gross 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.000
 Our reality is sad 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Do what you have to do, brother. The world is wild 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.500
 Do not let anyone tell you that you are a nobody 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.000
 Count only on you 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 If you can count 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 Because despite all these years, we still live in the wilderness 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.250
 There is always a moment of calm before the storm 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.000
 The world belongs to the brave, nobody remembers cowards 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.500
 Some are stupid ... 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.750
 Want to kill themselves 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.500
 It has become clear to me how weak a human being can be 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.000
 All the weaknesses of this world create my poetry 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.500
 So I let out the frustration in which I recorded "Bezdech" 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.000
 It's nonsense boy, in spite of all the shit 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Do not be sorry about yourself for things you have no control over 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Because depression destroys society like typhus 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
 I do not want to talk shit about how you have to live and what you should do 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.000
 Some of us budge their graves already during their lifetime 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.500
 Days pass, you are not so young anymore 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.500
 Selfishness turned into a struggle for prosperity 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.000
 Eternal stairs, a world of lies and mold 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.500
 Drink to those who can not and those who have come 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.000
 The head or figure theory, question of luck 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.500
 Sarcasm of life, the devil has humor 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.500
 The pride of people without honor is worth nothing 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.000
 Sneakiness is one of the most common diseases
