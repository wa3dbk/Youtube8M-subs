00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.349
 in the last moment 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.429
 In a few days, many 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.839
 - of the images 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.419
 captured in Chile at the beginning of the year 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.419
 before we went to the next video 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.099
 this is one mitla 5 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.380
 when people are on vacation 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.869
 and a strange object is observed in the 10 where they try 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.360
 the adesal will go 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.720
 we do not change it has left one its vileza of indec of the moment 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.720
 it is not good to clarify 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.780
 winning novel 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.190
 we could make a few faults that fame many more 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.830
 ahead 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.350
 this UFO was simao in extreme south of chin entín castro 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.250
 there it is observed very from the gambling den when appearing in dallas isaak isaak 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.760
 besser she was only 0 3% broke the mix 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.199
 a long wait 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.060
 na 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.060
 in the stellar 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.430
 finally he could not 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.430
 it is also moving at very low speed 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.970
 people of this type objects is obviously blunt a phenomenon that this year 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.770
 is watching my ass points to the air 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.050
 is flying to mu 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.600
 to the public a high altitude 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 music and obviously the heat trails of the nozzles of 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
 can leave that kind of traces in sirte 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.990
 biblos when they have no economic arrangement is investigating that only 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.810
 You can do it 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.649
 37 - 10 37 20 are governed in the home although sometimes gil when the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.180
 last experiment with experimental aircraft worth the redundancy 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.810
 we even have devices 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.170
 the UFO phenomenon 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.460
 it's an unidentified flying object that does not have 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.560
 it is evident that there is what is where it comes from 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.220
 but it can be something absolutely terrible 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.780
 absolutely the network 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.209
 that have explanation after I told myself this of course and that's very 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.159
 important 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.509
 We have one of the analyzes that, in his opinion, he did not want us to see 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.849
 that just about the first of the cases 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.439
 in the parent appointment two lines separated from each other at one point neither does nor the other 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.539
 which could perfectly explain the existence of everything 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.319
 lines that are taking out a lot of heat 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.579
 previously high temperatures the cold 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.459
 a conversation in January 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.359
 but if they are 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.849
 twelve minutes 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.930
 with the variety where we must fold the goal of generating energy 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.189
 stopped waiting for a goal back and reading 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.279
 as it already does with a lot of height 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.169
 that is the problem a phenomenon 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.499
 cited among those birds could be clear aircraft you can see the nozzles but 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:52.669
 Could be it 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:54.099
 when testing 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.099
 I want it to be at that moment it stops being a phenomenon 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:58.879
 me while not 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.919
 sorry but when it was launched s 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.569
 I think what I have to do is to continue then in the two goals between the act and 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.029
 to throw it out of art 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.189
 the delegation has brought stamp 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.519
 There must be a disc 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.539
 they are people of experience 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:18.419
 why do you want that I would be fine as with indifference to sell attacked 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.279
 take out 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:21.760
 all in shock 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.939
 know that for me 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.959
 indeed it is a terrestrial object 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.439
 which is happening very close to the upper parts of the atmosphere 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.779
 possibly an 80 or 60 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:33.249
 kilometers of October 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:38.359
 and with the ability to recreate 88 of the asobal league the satellites the 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.489
 military and espionage satellites 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.789
 They have an approximate height of 200 kilometers 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:48.049
 and can descend to 80 and the era of truce until when 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.609
 not much higher if you can and much harry up to 200 300 400 and 8 and 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.969
 still no man's land swallows open land 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.030
 I know that what happens 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.030
 when one is observing this type 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.180
 and that surely I will not say that he thinks that obviously it could be about 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.919
 a phenomenon 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.269
 that has nothing to do with us 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.599
 And that is what we are going now as a second part of the work 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.989
 not only improve some signals does not stay there 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.750
 With this measure, we are justly looking for 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.090
 a series is tevez has nothing that was mounted on top of the city 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.699
 we have well believe that such a thing 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.759
 and it happened recently 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.710
 14 days ago and after being raised his mind 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.460
 and with an entity, it is necessary to warn or not to swim 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:38.020
 there were many images 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.419
 they are very similar 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.770
 people old law 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.520
 those that are showing in the movie was shown and fruits between the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.460
 upper part 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.809
 in the south 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.809
 that this was automatic the effect is lost a little 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.479
 if it goes wrong 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:01.460
 his works the definition 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.339
 arizona in united states 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.770
 15 days ago 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.889
 but after today 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.159
 but that would have to stay to zero 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.419
 knows the pain 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.939
 is that this does not end 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.620
 this has a property 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.740
 this image that we are seeing corresponds now year 2004 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:24.409
 what you would believe me if I tell you that there were others or almost identical times 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.760
 the in 1997 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.589
 they are not ideals and iniesta and xavi 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:32.589
 There is a great debate in the United States 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.309
 but in a very strong way with the authorities 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:39.590
 where initially the air force denied that he had done some kind of 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.000
 pleasure or pray and meditate 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.410
 but he asked that he's going to do they still say 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.420
 the four-hour attack florist sounded on the patrol radio 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.760
 and will pump it Chinese vehicled and Mr. Antich even the person who 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.180
 recorded he put it on the internet to try to get an answer 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.559
 and that can be compared without intervention of this person 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:02.749
 with the previous one it had in the year 97 lands of the tcp is labor there are 97 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.279
 this picture 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:08.080
 it was not recorded by a person 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.080
 six recordings 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.229
 that's why we chose them aysa carlos ben 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.029
 they demanded an hour 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:20.280
 they had about the city 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.659
 one hour 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.960
 with the armed forces of the United States 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.960
 they denied having done internships in the place 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.039
 river is believed to be the ones of sinaloa violet prepared well 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.469
 in general focus miracle I made my vote I heard a sound that used 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:38.270
 the witnesses even indicate 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.460
 in the document 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.069
 that they actually got the air force planes 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.569
 from the local air base 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:47.219
 get to the place 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:50.539
 later he force me and I was even told that they had done internships and 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.339
 from there they have launched flares 

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.629
 openly to the end affected floating in the sky what is the 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:57.039
 problem the flare 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:58.860
 that unfortunately adapting and 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.860
 The parachutes fell and dominated an area 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.899
 we invite 25 minutes 

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:07.789
 moon hours 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:11.960
 but then they had all the illusion of signing the similar idea of ​​cooperating 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.229
 gave him the use of lighter colors a lot more my 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:16.900
 and when one does it in the sector 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.649
 of the asamoah tagoe balloons 

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:21.889
 and the hills events are shown images recording during the day 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.419
 usually what we do we go to the place 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:26.060
 a Mexican in the same place 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.479
 and we take a picture with the word neither macabre 

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:29.729
 it's more the same point 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:31.279
 10 for the South Koreans 

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:33.960
 When you do this, you see the hills 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.440
 and the need for the year 97 are practically in a brothel do
