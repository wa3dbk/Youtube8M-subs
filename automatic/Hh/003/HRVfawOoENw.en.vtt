left-handed gotta hold the cam in my

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:10.190 
left-handed gotta hold the cam in my
right<00:00:58.829> hand<00:01:00.530> got<00:01:01.530> wet<00:01:01.770> filter<00:01:09.170> cigarette<00:01:10.170> on

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
right hand got wet filter cigarette on

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
right hand got wet filter cigarette on
the<00:01:10.380> walk<00:01:10.830> around<00:01:12.229> doing<00:01:13.229> everything<00:01:13.530> I'm

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the walk around doing everything I'm

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.090 
the walk around doing everything I'm
doing<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.930> takes<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.770> hold

doing it takes you and you and you hold

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.609 
doing it takes you and you and you hold
the<00:01:17.310> cam<00:01:17.549> at<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> right<00:01:18.180> spot<00:01:18.689> too<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.470> can

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the cam at the right spot too so you can

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.630 
the cam at the right spot too so you can
see<00:01:20.040> what<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.430> working<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:21.740> ok<00:01:22.740> guys<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
see what I'm working with ok guys like I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.910 
see what I'm working with ok guys like I
sent<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.299> over<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.650> time<00:01:25.890> being

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
sent this over here for the time being

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.700 
sent this over here for the time being
so<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.670> my<00:01:26.759> way<00:01:27.000> that's<00:01:27.900> all<00:01:28.140> wet

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
so it's out of my way that's all wet

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.200 
so it's out of my way that's all wet
down<00:01:28.979> right<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:30.890> top<00:01:31.890> lip<00:01:32.659> take<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:36.780> way

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
down right now top lip take the way

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.050

through<00:02:04.320> i<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:04.979> i'm<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> move

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
through i think i'm going to move

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
forward over here or the light so you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.889 
forward over here or the light so you
can<00:02:07.770> better<00:02:08.250> see<00:02:08.700> what's<00:02:09.030> going<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.509> you're

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
can better see what's going on you're

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.479 
can better see what's going on you're
not<00:02:10.050> really<00:02:10.319> missing<00:02:10.619> anything<00:02:11.069> right<00:02:11.459> now

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
not really missing anything right now

attack<00:02:51.510> let<00:02:52.230> me<00:02:52.349> go<00:02:52.500> through

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.509 

now<00:02:57.330> grab<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.360> bucket<00:02:58.780> and<00:03:02.129> pour<00:03:03.129> some<00:03:03.370> more

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519

now grab the bucket and pour some more
of<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.730> solutions<00:03:04.269> will<00:03:10.019> always<00:03:11.019> go<00:03:11.319> through

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
of the solutions will always go through

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.190 
of the solutions will always go through
all<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:12.190> just<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.730> case<00:03:12.790> there's<00:03:13.420> some<00:03:13.750> find

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
all of it just in case there's some find

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.119 
all of it just in case there's some find
boils<00:03:15.000> which<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.269> looks<00:03:16.480> like<00:03:16.690> there's

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
boils which it looks like there's

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.440 
boils which it looks like there's
there's<00:03:18.129> some<00:03:18.400> sediment<00:03:18.790> in<00:03:19.030> there<00:03:19.180> anyway

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
there's some sediment in there anyway

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.050 
there's some sediment in there anyway
you<00:03:19.690> know<00:03:19.870> see<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.379> being<00:03:20.560> go<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.430> it's<00:03:21.849> not

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
you know see it being go so it's not

oils in any way yeah whole idea if
something's<00:03:26.650> floating<00:03:27.250> in<00:03:27.370> solution<00:03:27.909> when

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
something's floating in solution when

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.670 
something's floating in solution when
you're<00:03:28.180> sloshing<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.810> around<00:03:29.019> when<00:03:29.530> your
