00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello how about I'm lupita and today we're going 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.309
 to show them the way they are sewn 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.950
 the beans we have here a kilo of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.890
 beans so let's clean them 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.980
 let's remove all the trash that comes 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.530
 in the in the bag with the beans and 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.980
 we are going to clean very well and then the 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.980
 let's put in a colander to be able 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.039
 rinse them I'm going to put them in this 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.720
 strainer and I'm going to move them so that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.600
 go up the garbage that has been 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.089
 stayed and go falling all the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.340
 little land that we have, let's wash them very 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.710
 all right 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.200
 since we wash the beans we're going to 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.910
 put in our express pot 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.910
 approximately 2 liters of water and a 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.230
 trickle of vegetable oil and we're going to 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.730
 put an onion and a clove of garlic 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.830
 we are going to add the beans that already 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.680
 we had washed and drained before 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:01.090
 we are also going to add a branch of 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.879
 epazote let's add salt to taste 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.150
 let's cover our pot and we're going to 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.399
 Leave the fire once our pot 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.270
 start whistling or start doing the 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.800
 that noise is so characteristic of the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.190
 Express pot 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.360
 we will have 45 minutes from 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.680
 that moment and after this time we are going to 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.680
 turn off the fire 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.650
 our pot already started to whistle let's 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.070
 count 45 minutes from now 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.920
 Well, it's been 45 minutes 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.830
 put out the fire I'm going to leave my pot here 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.930
 on the stove to cool down and a 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.530
 once it's cold we're going to unclog it 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.170
 to be able to serve our beans 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.070
 I've already served a plate of beans 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.920
 they are very soft they cooked very well and 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.280
 already empty them in a clay pot to 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.619
 put them to boil 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.100
 this is the way we know the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.140
 beans in his poor house but also 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.100
 If you want to meet them in a pot of 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.620
 mud like the one I have here is the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.350
 same procedure you just have to go 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.959
 adding water and logically it is more 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.160
 time in the clay pot but they remain 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.470
 much richer 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.170
 I hope this tip to know the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.600
 beans you liked, do not forget 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.150
 share the video subscribe to the channel 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.630
 and we'll see each other until the next 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.630
 recipe
