 Collector Welten in the first quarterfinal 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:14.160
 The rematch WM Brazil against Portugal 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.650

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.310
 to open 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.050
 Who gets the most cards? 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.760
 So his team owns some 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.439
 Brazilian goal tells a story like that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.699
 so to speak , of course, there are also 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.260
 special cards that call goals 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.850
 accordingly, two gates exactly and then 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.250
 there was not this without any more 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.260
 here this makes trouble with it too 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.450
 Two and talkmasters make three goals 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.850
 then let's see who the game 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.649
 will win 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.629
 An Englishman is not part of the game 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.820
 Japan also not part of the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.750
 quarterfinal did not play ax final 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.910

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.309
 a goal shoots in brazil of course 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.250
 is the whole wm here, let's have a look 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.720
 second boosters so three boosters 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.790
 stand in principle for a complete 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.680
 it should be a draw 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.869
 come 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:21.390
 it comes to the penalty shootout come 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.520
 German Germans we are already out 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.189
 are no longer not alone 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.840
 Brazilian or Portuguese the last one 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.150
 booster decides and otherwise 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.020
 brazil on so looks far 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.790
 stupid as portugal a dutchman 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.180
 a game changer a dutch one 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.909
 Croats a Spaniard and an Argentine 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.990
 that is, the quarterfinals are the first 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.869
 is over and brazil is the next 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.979

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.430
 Germany is not doing them again 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.500
 to make a pity with 61 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.649
 Well, the brazilians have themselves 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.689
 earned or the next days will be 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.759
 then the next day of the game will come 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.420
 Japan would be against Argentina until the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.420
 next time bye
