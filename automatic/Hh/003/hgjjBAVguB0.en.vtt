 behind a camper 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.059

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:23.760
 optional 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.510

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.139
 he climbs the stairs 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.139

 the four teams skiing 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.930
 p then 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.050
 another option back 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.039
 a little game 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.879

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.349
 and then here is genk 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.349
 with a small third 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.830
 I was hoping rourke carbox ponote 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.779

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.289
 the goals 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.289
 yet I was alone 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.169
 but a little more race 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:45.169
 he works what 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.139
 the 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.809
 here 

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:08.830

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.539
 getty capital 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:13.379
 so there 

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:16.069
 I was great trio but after all night 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:19.210
