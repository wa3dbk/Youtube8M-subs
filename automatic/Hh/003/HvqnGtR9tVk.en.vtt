00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 coffee harvested still green harmed beverage flavors and makes the price of sack 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.660
 fall 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.280
 now a technique developed by the federal mining university 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.929
 which has already been applied on some farms is changing the 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:17.189
 the film wrapping grain f drawn in even green coffee 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.839
 I gave the quality 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.150
 the green coffee between the ripe grains still in the foot 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.079
 is detrimental to producers 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.199
 depending on the amount of green fruits 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.559
 drop in the quality of the drink on this farm and three points the employees 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.640
 are oriented to the fury of the beans carefully the recommendation is to work 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.660
 with a little lost an arm a silver bike hill or injured 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.000
 repeat green arc operation 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.690
 and to try to mitigate the losses of coffee growers, the federal university of 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.660
 Lavras developed a technique for processing 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.070
 green coffee 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.219
 after five years of research 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.460
 the results 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.950
 are satisfactory, the work was coordinated by Professor Flavio 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.080
 postharvest specialist after many experiments. 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 concluded that the catheter can also be peeled by increasing the quality of the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.030
 drink adore to be removed a film that does not cover the grains we observe 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.420
 who stayed with the 11 movie residences 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.159
 that attack is characteristically dead to destroy the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:21.880
 managers 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.490
 and with an augustin dj course 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.330
 today is a 'taste-type' network 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.390
 immature fruit it is softened 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.600
 What are you doing in carmo of the waterfall? 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.170
 the technique has been applied for two years 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.630
 it is indicated for those who already work with the catheterization and peeled 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.200
 what used machinery is the same 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.560
 simon prophet 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 first category must have stopped 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.010
 What are we doing in that first debarking? 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.550
 we are then allowing the passage of a maximum of 10% of fruit 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.650
 mature in the batch batch of green berries unlike many growers 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.000
 cool 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.069
 too hard to strip 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.280
 the fruit passing I see a pain as the mixture the coffee needs to rest for 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.359
 about 16 hours 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.209
 only after it goes to the peeler 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.829
 the effect has 320 hectares of average coffee of 10 thousand bags 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.900
 using the techniques managed to reduce losses and add value to the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.919
 green coffee today with stock control 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.460
 Can we make coffee? 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.390
 gigi from psp exported he gets nervous because the same features and 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.089
 qualities on another front 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:46.189
 according to the agronomist Flavio Borges 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:51.239
 the technique allows up to 30% of green coffee in each lot much more than 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.189
 the limit of 10% of those who do not use the method 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.859
 fruits can be harvested more
