00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.050 
they've both been I think very
underwhelming<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.500> expected<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> lot<00:01:35.610> more<00:01:35.670> from

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
underwhelming I expected a lot more from

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.399 
underwhelming I expected a lot more from
my<00:01:36.180> mind<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.659> tunnel<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.200> thought

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
my mind in this tunnel and I thought

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.289 
my mind in this tunnel and I thought
that<00:01:37.619> they<00:01:37.770> were<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> contender<00:01:38.579> maybe<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that they were a contender maybe not to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.899 
that they were a contender maybe not to
go<00:01:39.450> through<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.650> maybe<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.070> take<00:01:41.280> some<00:01:41.520> points

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
go through but maybe to take some points

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.359 
go through but maybe to take some points
off<00:01:42.090> both<00:01:42.450> South<00:01:43.259> Korea<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.799> Australia<00:01:43.920> they

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
off both South Korea and Australia they

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.219 
off both South Korea and Australia they
failed<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.090> both<00:01:45.210> occasions<00:01:45.540> kuwait

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
failed to do it on both occasions kuwait

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.080 
failed to do it on both occasions kuwait
as<00:01:46.409> well<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> nation<00:01:47.399> with<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> really<00:01:47.939> good

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
as well a nation with a really good

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.719 
as well a nation with a really good
football<00:01:48.329> history<00:01:49.070> really<00:01:50.070> struggled<00:01:50.579> as

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
football history really struggled as

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.010 
football history really struggled as
well<00:01:50.880> particularly<00:01:51.180> gets<00:01:51.479> Australian<00:01:51.899> that

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
well particularly gets Australian that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.590 
well particularly gets Australian that
opening<00:01:52.350> game<00:01:52.530> they<00:01:53.100> were<00:01:53.159> better<00:01:53.600> against

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
opening game they were better against

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.889 
opening game they were better against
South<00:01:54.930> Korea<00:01:55.280> on<00:01:56.280> match<00:01:56.549> day<00:01:56.820> two<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:57.600> push

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
South Korea on match day two they push

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.929 
South Korea on match day two they push
them<00:01:58.140> they're<00:01:58.320> nearly<00:01:58.560> got<00:01:58.770> an<00:01:58.890> equalizer<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
them they're nearly got an equalizer and

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.399 
them they're nearly got an equalizer and
for<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.210> reason<00:02:00.270> alone<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:01.259> they're

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
for that reason alone I think they're

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.020 
for that reason alone I think they're
probably<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.890> better<00:02:02.159> chance<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.640> winning<00:02:02.909> this

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
probably a better chance of winning this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.560 
probably a better chance of winning this
game

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
game

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
game
and<00:02:03.720> I'm<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.230> that<00:02:04.680> set<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> dead<00:02:05.190> rubber<00:02:05.400> and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and I'm on that set a dead rubber and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.100 
and I'm on that set a dead rubber and
both<00:02:05.790> teams<00:02:06.030> should<00:02:06.270> be<00:02:06.360> disappointed<00:02:06.570> with

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
both teams should be disappointed with

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.920 
both teams should be disappointed with
what<00:02:07.140> they've<00:02:07.440> shown<00:02:07.650> so<00:02:07.890> far
