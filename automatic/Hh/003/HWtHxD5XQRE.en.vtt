kind of shifting around with it so for
freshmen<00:02:48.210> after<00:02:48.630> what<00:02:48.780> 12<00:02:49.110> practices<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.650> think

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
freshmen after what 12 practices I think

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
look for I want different type backs to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.730 
look for I want different type backs to
change<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> pace<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> guy<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.320> can<00:02:55.500> be<00:02:55.710> a

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
change the pace a guy that can be a

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.040 
change the pace a guy that can be a
physical<00:02:56.250> guy<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.640> got<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:57.000> could<00:02:57.120> be<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.570> fast

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
physical guy that got it could be a fast

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.720 
physical guy that got it could be a fast
guy<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.560> faster<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.920> got<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.160> be<00:02:59.250> physical

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
guy but the faster I got to be physical

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.760 
guy but the faster I got to be physical
and<00:02:59.760> i<00:02:59.880> hope<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.239> physical<00:03:01.050> guys<00:03:01.200> at<00:03:01.380> low

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
and i hope the physical guys at low

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.979 
and i hope the physical guys at low
speed<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.850> does<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.360> helps<00:03:03.660> us<00:03:03.810> do

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
speed and that does that helps us do

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.630 
speed and that does that helps us do
some<00:03:04.320> variety<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.770> type<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.100> things<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:05.430> want

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
some variety of type of things we want

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.280 
some variety of type of things we want
to<00:03:05.700> do<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:06.480> good<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.660> have<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.870> kind<00:03:07.230> of

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
to do so it's good to have that kind of

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.809 
to do so it's good to have that kind of
mix

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819
