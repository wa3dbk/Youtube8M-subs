00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:10.130
 hello I'm jose antonio maroto the tester 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.330
 of truck magazine today we have to approve 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.550
 a man with 26 76 engine from the 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.180
 first that we are going to try then it fulfills 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.940
 with regulation 16 has 480 horses and 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.880
 2300 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.330
 so let's go starting we started 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.330
 If we leave 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.230
 at the beginning we are going to do controls 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.230
 fuels 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.710
 a certain number of kilometers we will go 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.210
 checking the consumption of the truck 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.910
 and the idea is once we have 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.329
 finished our tour checking and 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.329
 compare 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.200
 once 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.250
 We just passed the port of 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.930
 guadarrama we have checked this engine has 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.979
 responded quite well in the ascent 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.130
 over power with a group of 2.7 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.890
 we have managed to reach the summit in 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.080
 the ninth to a few revolutions 1500 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.770
 turns and at a speed of about 50 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.770
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.760
 as for the gearbox that the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.710
 that mounts this truck is the label f 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.750
 12 to that 23 31 is ideal for the route that 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.640
 we have done even I would say it is 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.930
 ideal for european trucks no european 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.290
 they have no problem of these 12 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.290
 marches 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.890
 for the management of the automatisms this 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.349
 vehicle does not change much buy in 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.909
 comparison to previous models in 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.250
 this part of the flyer we have the 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.650
 Cruise control we can all handle 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.530
 from these buttons and from this panel 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.620
 what's here and here is a lever 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.209
 multipurpose also very important for the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.030
 general handling of automations 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.430
 with which we can use the change and 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.659
 also here is the point challenge to 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.659
 point and for maximum 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.360
 there is enough space between the bunk and 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.680
 the ceiling with a quality of the bed bases 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.659
 we must manage 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.810
 the rise and fall of crystals for 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.549
 keep the bed inadvertently 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.859
 I could stay this little remote control 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.810
 distance the force in living quarters of 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.810
 this vehicle is enough 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.519
 with this and we say goodbye you can read 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.750

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.700
