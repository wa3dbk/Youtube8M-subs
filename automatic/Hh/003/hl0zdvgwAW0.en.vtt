is but all joking aside and this part
runs<00:01:53.189> rather<00:01:53.549> smoothly<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.659> we're<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:54.899> gonna

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
runs rather smoothly so we're just gonna

did it's a minor inconvenience I know
but<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.130> could<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.459> lot<00:03:32.609> worse<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.680> second

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
but it could be a lot worse and second

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.670 
but it could be a lot worse and second
even<00:03:34.980> though<00:03:35.760> these<00:03:36.150> codes<00:03:36.630> fix<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.410> black

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
even though these codes fix the black

instances where the game may crash I

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.830 
instances where the game may crash I
personally<00:03:43.410> haven't<00:03:44.010> tried<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.519> out<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.180> depth

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
personally haven't tried it out in depth

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.620 
personally haven't tried it out in depth
