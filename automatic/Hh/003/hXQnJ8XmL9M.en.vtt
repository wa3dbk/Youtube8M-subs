00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
answer is that most these camcorders now

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.980 
answer is that most these camcorders now
have<00:00:11.670> really<00:00:12.090> wonderful<00:00:12.330> microphones

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
have really wonderful microphones

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.230 
have really wonderful microphones
built-in<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.830> fact<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.219> one<00:00:14.370> has<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> 5.1

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
built-in in fact this one has a 5.1

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.150 
built-in in fact this one has a 5.1
microphone<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.109> records<00:00:16.470> all<00:00:16.680> surround

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
microphone so it records all surround

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.400

sound<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.359> camera<00:00:18.690> all<00:00:18.869> by<00:00:19.080> itself

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
sound so just the camera all by itself

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.990 
sound so just the camera all by itself
will<00:00:19.590> give<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> wonderful<00:00:20.100> surround<00:00:20.670> sound

very<00:00:31.980> nice<00:00:32.189> key<00:00:32.430> feature<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.719> some<00:00:34.020> people

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
very nice key feature but some people

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.630 
very nice key feature but some people
want<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> go<00:00:34.590> beyond<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.309> want<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> be

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
want to go beyond that they want to be

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340 
want to go beyond that they want to be
able<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> connect<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.329> up<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:36.930> example<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
able to connect it up to for example a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.560 
able to connect it up to for example a
wireless<00:00:37.800> mic<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.370> neck<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> shotgun<00:00:39.059> mic<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
wireless mic or neck or a shotgun mic to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.110 
wireless mic or neck or a shotgun mic to
get<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> really<00:00:40.200> tight<00:00:40.230> image<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> sound

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
get a really tight image for the sound

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.020 
get a really tight image for the sound
so<00:00:42.719> here's<00:00:43.320> an<00:00:43.469> example<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.010> shotgun<00:00:44.219> mic<00:00:44.610> so

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
so here's an example of a shotgun mic so

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.340 
so here's an example of a shotgun mic so
basically<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.480> very<00:00:45.510> simple<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.960> connected

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
basically it's very simple you connected

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.650 
basically it's very simple you connected
up<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> hotshoe<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.340> plug<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> into<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
up to the hotshoe you plug it into the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.069 
up to the hotshoe you plug it into the
camera<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.700> there<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:51.090> import

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
camera here and there is a little import

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.270 
camera here and there is a little import
to<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> camera<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.949> where<00:00:53.160> it's

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
to the camera this is where it's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.439 
to the camera this is where it's
important<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> camera<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.329> an

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
important to get a camera with an

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.959 
important to get a camera with an
axillary<00:00:54.960> input<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.770> audio<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.280> plug<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
axillary input for audio you plug the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.840 
axillary input for audio you plug the
back<00:00:57.120> camera<00:00:57.390> right<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
back camera right in here like this and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.709 
back camera right in here like this and
now<00:01:00.510> my<00:01:01.230> camcorder<00:01:01.530> has<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.399> long<00:01:02.820> shotgun<00:01:03.510> very

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
now my camcorder has a long shotgun very

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.260 
now my camcorder has a long shotgun very
good<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.470> getting<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.830> sound<00:01:05.430> from<00:01:05.790> far<00:01:06.030> away

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
good for getting a sound from far away

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.810 
good for getting a sound from far away
now<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.530> other<00:01:07.680> possibility<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.310> doing<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.729> in

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
now the other possibility of doing it in

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.060 
now the other possibility of doing it in
fact<00:01:09.240> even<00:01:09.479> better<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.930> some<00:01:10.110> cases<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.619> using

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
fact even better in some cases is using

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
fact even better in some cases is using
a<00:01:11.130> wireless<00:01:11.369> microphone<00:01:11.729> now<00:01:12.600> these<00:01:12.810> are

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
a wireless microphone now these are

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.390 
a wireless microphone now these are
normally<00:01:13.350> used<00:01:13.530> by<00:01:13.590> professionals<00:01:14.250> but

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
normally used by professionals but

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.800 
normally used by professionals but
they're<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:14.640> some<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:15.060> inexpensive<00:01:15.240> ones

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
they're now some very inexpensive ones

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.399 
they're now some very inexpensive ones
they're<00:01:15.960> available

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
they're available

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.200 
they're available
