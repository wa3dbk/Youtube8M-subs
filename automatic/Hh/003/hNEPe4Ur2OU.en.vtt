00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.190 

so<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.150> next<00:02:58.330> thing<00:02:58.570> is<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.720> put<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.020> washer

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
so the next thing is to put the washer

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.530 
so the next thing is to put the washer
on

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:16.010

just taken up to the end I'm a bit of
Loctite<00:04:39.550> on<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:40.090> board<00:04:40.570> here<00:04:40.810> you<00:04:41.169> take

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
Loctite on the board here you take

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.500 
Loctite on the board here you take
another<00:04:41.650> pod<00:04:41.919> I've<00:04:42.729> undone<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.150> screw<00:04:43.360> to

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
another pod I've undone the screw to

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.050 
another pod I've undone the screw to
take<00:04:43.690> this<00:04:43.810> off<00:04:44.050> but<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.340> looks<00:04:45.490> as<00:04:45.639> though<00:04:45.669> the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
take this off but it looks as though the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.430 
take this off but it looks as though the
arm<00:04:46.210> has<00:04:46.389> gone<00:04:46.540> back<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:46.840> that<00:04:46.990> position<00:04:47.169> with

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
arm has gone back to that position with

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.500 
arm has gone back to that position with
no<00:04:47.560> tension<00:04:48.010> on<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.160> spring<00:04:48.340> so<00:04:49.240> it's<00:04:49.360> one

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
no tension on the spring so it's one

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.960 
no tension on the spring so it's one
complete<00:04:49.930> turn<00:04:49.960> round<00:04:50.470> two<00:04:51.310> tension<00:04:51.699> is<00:04:51.790> right

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
complete turn round two tension is right

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.830 
complete turn round two tension is right
for<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.350> but<00:04:53.350> anything<00:04:53.710> else<00:04:53.800> of<00:04:54.130> paulanos

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
for the but anything else of paulanos

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.750 
for the but anything else of paulanos
I've<00:04:55.840> called<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.260> water<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:57.190> then<00:04:57.580> I<00:04:57.610> can

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
I've called the water and then I can

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.990 
I've called the water and then I can
drop<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.270> rock<00:04:58.479> tied<00:04:58.720> on<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:59.020> screw<00:04:59.350> they<00:05:00.010> a<00:05:00.520> bit

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
drop a rock tied on the screw they a bit

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.070 
drop a rock tied on the screw they a bit
more<00:05:01.180> fiddling<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.660> you<00:05:01.720> have<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.960> actually

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
more fiddling and you have to actually

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.469 
more fiddling and you have to actually
take<00:05:02.410> a<00:05:02.440> spring<00:05:02.800> coat

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
take a spring coat

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.590 
take a spring coat
line<00:05:04.479> up<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:05.460> event<00:05:06.460> spring<00:05:06.760> with<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.300> little

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
line up the event spring with the little

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:18.020 
line up the event spring with the little
gap<00:05:07.900> way<00:05:08.430> push<00:05:09.430> it<00:05:09.580> in<00:05:09.669> place<00:05:15.780> up

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
gap way push it in place up

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.390 
gap way push it in place up
and<00:05:18.570> then<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:19.020> arm<00:05:19.170> goes<00:05:19.470> back<00:05:19.710> on<00:05:19.950> with<00:05:20.220> when

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
and then the arm goes back on with when

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.680 
and then the arm goes back on with when
wound<00:05:20.640> of<00:05:20.820> tension<00:05:21.270> onward<00:05:21.570> on<00:05:22.320> this<00:05:22.620> side<00:05:22.890> and

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
wound of tension onward on this side and

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.930 
wound of tension onward on this side and
the<00:05:24.690> spring<00:05:25.020> goes<00:05:25.260> in<00:05:25.500> that<00:05:25.980> when<00:05:26.190> they<00:05:26.340> do

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
the spring goes in that when they do

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.280 
the spring goes in that when they do
anyone<00:05:27.210> with<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.420> gap<00:05:27.600> that<00:05:27.840> runs<00:05:28.050> right<00:05:28.260> down

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
anyone with a gap that runs right down

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.640 
anyone with a gap that runs right down
to<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.740> back<00:05:28.920> of<00:05:29.100> the<00:05:29.990> yarn<00:05:30.990> that<00:05:31.290> if<00:05:31.440> you<00:05:31.530> can

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
to the back of the yarn that if you can

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.000 
to the back of the yarn that if you can
see<00:05:31.830> it<00:05:32.480> is<00:05:33.480> that<00:05:33.690> when<00:05:33.900> you<00:05:33.930> put<00:05:34.200> in<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.350> notch

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
see it is that when you put in the notch

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.710 
see it is that when you put in the notch
of<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.450> spring<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:37.620> we<00:05:37.680> are<00:05:37.770> back<00:05:38.070> on<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:39.570> one

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
of the spring and we are back on the one

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.950 
of the spring and we are back on the one
turn<00:05:39.960> attention<00:05:40.320> so<00:05:40.800> just<00:05:41.010> get<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.280> chain

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
turn attention so just get the chain

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:52.300 
turn attention so just get the chain
back<00:05:42.960> in<00:05:43.170> the<00:05:43.320> right<00:05:43.470> place

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.629 

drop<00:05:52.940> them

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.179 

look<00:05:56.240> simple<00:05:56.599> on<00:05:56.689> the<00:05:56.780> video<00:05:57.050> but<00:05:57.289> two<00:05:57.500> hands

00:05:58.179 --> 00:05:58.189 
look simple on the video but two hands

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.580 
look simple on the video but two hands
are<00:05:58.430> filthy<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:59.000> I<00:05:59.689> think<00:05:59.870> put<00:06:00.020> four<00:06:00.319> or<00:06:00.349> five

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
are filthy and I think put four or five

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.450 
are filthy and I think put four or five
tracks<00:06:00.949> on<00:06:01.189> the<00:06:01.250> CEO<00:06:01.669> gone<00:06:01.939> bar<00:06:02.180> but<00:06:02.750> there

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
tracks on the CEO gone bar but there

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.369 
tracks on the CEO gone bar but there
there<00:06:04.460> we<00:06:04.550> are

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379 
there we are

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.469 
there we are
just<00:06:06.379> check<00:06:06.740> that<00:06:07.400> it<00:06:07.550> does<00:06:07.789> actually<00:06:08.000> run

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
just check that it does actually run

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:22.469 
just check that it does actually run
okay<00:06:08.810> for<00:06:09.289> ps3<00:06:10.840> and<00:06:12.009> outgoing<00:06:13.240> nothing's<00:06:14.240> okay
