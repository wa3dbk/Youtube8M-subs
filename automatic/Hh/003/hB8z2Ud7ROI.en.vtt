00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
frozen and what you do is you just go

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.280 
frozen and what you do is you just go
ahead<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.000> heat<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.719> up<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> microwave

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
ahead and heat it up in the microwave

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.529 
ahead and heat it up in the microwave
for<00:00:44.129> about<00:00:44.510> five<00:00:45.510> or<00:00:45.719> six<00:00:45.899> minutes<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:47.539> then
