00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
index finger in person and an important

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.719 
index finger in person and an important
thing<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:28.490> my<00:01:28.520> opinion<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:29.299> to<00:01:29.689> understand<00:01:30.259> is

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
thing in my opinion to to understand is

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.359 
thing in my opinion to to understand is
picking<00:01:31.729> has<00:01:32.060> nothing<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.689> do<00:01:32.810> with<00:01:33.369> strength

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
picking has nothing to do with strength

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.440 
picking has nothing to do with strength
you<00:01:35.060> know<00:01:35.469> people<00:01:36.469> pick<00:01:37.460> like<00:01:37.670> this<00:01:37.939> i<00:01:38.180> know

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
you know people pick like this i know

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.510 
you know people pick like this i know
there<00:01:38.719> are<00:01:38.899> people<00:01:39.140> that<00:01:39.320> pic<00:01:39.590> like<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:39.799> and

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
there are people that pic like this and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.810 
there are people that pic like this and
if<00:01:40.609> you<00:01:40.729> want<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:40.969> do<00:01:41.090> it<00:01:41.210> that's<00:01:41.359> fine<00:01:42.759> but<00:01:43.759> i

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
if you want to do it that's fine but i

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.399 
if you want to do it that's fine but i
think<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:45.320> correct<00:01:45.649> way<00:01:46.039> is<00:01:46.960> keeping<00:01:47.960> your

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
think the correct way is keeping your

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:56.050 
think the correct way is keeping your
wrist<00:01:48.710> lose<00:01:50.469> kind<00:01:51.469> of<00:01:51.560> like<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:53.270> know<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:55.789> way

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
wrist lose kind of like you know the way

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.010 
wrist lose kind of like you know the way
I<00:01:56.090> picture<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.659> is<00:01:57.460> water<00:01:58.460> drops<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.179> I<00:01:59.810> want

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
I picture it is water drops and I want

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.380 
I picture it is water drops and I want
to<00:02:00.249> shake<00:02:01.249> them<00:02:01.429> off<00:02:01.640> okay<00:02:02.539> I<00:02:03.530> explain<00:02:04.490> why<00:02:04.729> the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
to shake them off okay I explain why the

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.330 
to shake them off okay I explain why the
hard<00:02:05.960> part<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.179> crucial<00:02:08.979> is<00:02:09.979> to

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
hard part is and that is crucial is to

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.259 
hard part is and that is crucial is to
hold<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.240> pig<00:02:11.480> tight<00:02:12.129> so<00:02:13.129> there<00:02:13.760> should<00:02:14.090> not

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
hold the pig tight so there should not

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.050 
hold the pig tight so there should not
be<00:02:14.330> any<00:02:14.659> movement

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
be any movement

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.210 
be any movement
between<00:02:17.060> your<00:02:17.840> thumb<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.230> your<00:02:18.560> first<00:02:18.860> thing

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
between your thumb and your first thing

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.390 
between your thumb and your first thing
okay<00:02:19.819> but<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.750> must<00:02:21.050> not<00:02:22.420> move<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.660> part

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
okay but you must not move this part

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.400 
okay but you must not move this part
there's<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.880> picking<00:02:26.390> technique<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.870> think<00:02:27.200> of

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
there's a picking technique I think of

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.199 
there's a picking technique I think of
picking<00:02:27.920> technique<00:02:28.280> like<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.700> for<00:02:29.000> dumb

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
picking technique like this for dumb

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.360 
picking technique like this for dumb
that's<00:02:29.540> not<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:30.250> alternate<00:02:31.250> picking

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
that's not the alternate picking

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.699 
that's not the alternate picking
technique<00:02:31.790> i'm<00:02:31.910> not<00:02:32.060> talking<00:02:32.450> about<00:02:32.480> ok<00:02:33.380> so

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
technique i'm not talking about ok so

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.800 
technique i'm not talking about ok so
the<00:02:33.830> tough<00:02:34.069> part<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:35.620> keep<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:37.790> part<00:02:38.660> of

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
the tough part is to keep this part of

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.930 
the tough part is to keep this part of
the<00:02:38.930> hand<00:02:39.140> rigid<00:02:39.590> what<00:02:40.190> could<00:02:40.400> do<00:02:40.489> that<00:02:40.550> lose

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
the hand rigid what could do that lose

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.199 
the hand rigid what could do that lose
and<00:02:41.209> that's<00:02:41.360> how<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:42.310> how<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.340> came<00:02:43.519> up<00:02:43.850> with<00:02:43.880> the

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
and that's how I how I came up with the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.300 
and that's how I how I came up with the
comparison<00:02:45.250> trying<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.370> shake<00:02:46.640> off<00:02:46.989> water

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
comparison trying to shake off water

00:02:48.310 --> 00:03:02.289 
comparison trying to shake off water
