 What has he done in January? 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.250
 they have done very little 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.929
 if that is the main thing 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:19.819

 They gave in February 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.069
 that people have in a marina that their history

 and is that with the triumph of one or the other team but that is presented 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:43.409
 nevertheless we for this one this much because I am requesting the 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.609
 regional intendancy that this tie is declared high risk 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.239
 and one the measure is to change the schedule 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.540
 of the match either from Saturday to Sunday at 4:00 p.m. 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:57.109
 i logically what measures it is if it is declared high risk by 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.709
 the intendant there is another media that establishes the law that are the closing by 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.459
 local examples of alcohols 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.009
 p in a month out there from three hours before 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.800
 and three hours after 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.310
 and in a five-block radius around sports success it's a great day 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.860
 apart from the measures that we can not be a bullfighter to apply within the 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.079
 stadium to maintain public order 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.509
 both at the start during and after the first goal that goal 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.509
 that way he also expressed that carabineros is expected in this 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.889
 party are not the same circumstances that happened in February 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.909
 without a day when people go to the stadium to enjoy a show 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:36.620
