00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.250

 website and maybe I'll answer you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.840
 summer question this question comes from charlie 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.880
 Charlie I would grab it 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.980
 charlie send hey jill I'm going on vacation 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.410
 do you have a nice idea to all 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.230
 to capture memories I have 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.989
 certainly charlie because that is what i always do 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.700
 I make a travel diary you are whole 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.930
 very nice to read back but especially 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.579
 to do 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.700
 especially during the holiday you have too 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.649
 a lot of time so how about it 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.610
 this is actually just very boring 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.579
 booklet 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.440
 follow sheet with photos stuck with 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.149
 shine to look there also gets such 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.359
 beautiful glossy layer 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.460
 and therefore water brother is more convenient there 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.610
 at the pool keeps on beach 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.740
 nevertheless stick it full of glitter 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.140
 plateau favorite stick or one 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.540
 map of where you have been in your 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.009
 travel diary your done 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.290
 so he thought the first to be super boring and 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.759
 this is how it will look 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.409
 with radiation quickly perfect with the spray 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.100
 from phone but I only see that now 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.659
 coincidence but good how do you keep awkward 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.490
 brothers and sisters that you do not 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.829
 secretly read all your secrets from 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.799
 handsome shine a nice holiday love 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.750
 it is therefore a solution for that 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.360
 look this is just your key 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.470
 suitcase that you can use to you 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.840
 diary your all brothers and sisters 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.479
 To make a test you need two pieces 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.479
 ribbon cut and a little glue 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.830
 only very small drop needed 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.070
 make sure you use good fancy 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.580
 stick them on the inside plate there 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.910
 slice of loop and with plants 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.910
 fast 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.220
 side number 1 to ensure that later 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.849
 a 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.599
 this also remains closed on the second side 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.599
 just the exact same thing 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.780
 let dry 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:45.090

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:48.220
