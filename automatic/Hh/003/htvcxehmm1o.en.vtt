00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
using this much and so these are the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.320 
using this much and so these are the
accessories<00:02:37.849> that<00:02:38.180> comes<00:02:38.690> with<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.260> s4

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
droid razr HD and the samsung s4 can't

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.860 
droid razr HD and the samsung s4 can't
really<00:04:36.740> see<00:04:36.979> from<00:04:37.280> this<00:04:37.430> angle<00:04:37.490> but<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.330> can

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
really see from this angle but you can

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.439 
really see from this angle but you can
actually<00:04:39.139> see<00:04:39.410> that<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:40.099> samsung<00:04:40.669> slightly

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
actually see that the samsung slightly

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.070 
actually see that the samsung slightly
thicker<00:04:41.930> that's<00:04:42.770> in<00:04:43.039> there<00:04:43.220> i<00:04:43.250> mean<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:44.080> the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
thicker that's in there i mean and the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.870 
thicker that's in there i mean and the
samsung<00:04:45.620> is<00:04:45.830> actually<00:04:46.160> longer<00:04:46.340> than<00:04:46.580> the

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
samsung is actually longer than the

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.990 
samsung is actually longer than the
droid<00:04:47.150> razr<00:04:47.210> HD<00:04:48.070> on<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.250> side<00:04:49.490> view<00:04:49.729> it

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
droid razr HD on the side view it

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.879 
droid razr HD on the side view it
actually<00:04:50.360> pretty<00:04:50.810> much<00:04:50.900> looks<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.410> same<00:04:51.680> i

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
actually pretty much looks the same i

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.300 
actually pretty much looks the same i
guess<00:04:52.360> same<00:04:53.360> thickness<00:04:53.979> just<00:04:54.979> that<00:04:55.160> the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
guess same thickness just that the

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:04.960 
guess same thickness just that the
samsung<00:04:55.849> s4<00:04:56.300> is<00:04:56.510> actually<00:04:56.960> longer<00:05:03.639> yep<00:05:04.639> so

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
samsung s4 is actually longer yep so

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.589 
samsung s4 is actually longer yep so
this<00:05:05.840> is<00:05:06.080> my<00:05:06.560> droid<00:05:07.010> razr<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.789> original<00:05:08.360> droid

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
this is my droid razr the original droid

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.670 
this is my droid razr the original droid
razr<00:05:09.159> xt910<00:05:10.659> comparison<00:05:11.659> thickness<00:05:12.380> between

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
razr xt910 comparison thickness between

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.640 
razr xt910 comparison thickness between
the<00:05:13.130> galaxy<00:05:13.610> s4<00:05:14.090> so<00:05:14.990> i<00:05:15.530> guess<00:05:15.889> that<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:17.650> that

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
the galaxy s4 so i guess that the that

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.950 
the galaxy s4 so i guess that the that
because<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:20.780> razor<00:05:21.470> is<00:05:21.979> actually<00:05:22.960> not

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
because the razor is actually not

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.310 
because the razor is actually not
proportionate<00:05:24.710> behind<00:05:25.180> so<00:05:26.180> basically<00:05:27.169> the

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
proportionate behind so basically the

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.420 
proportionate behind so basically the
thinnest<00:05:27.770> part<00:05:28.130> of<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:29.169> razor<00:05:30.169> is<00:05:30.560> slightly

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
thinnest part of the razor is slightly

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.850 
thinnest part of the razor is slightly
or<00:05:32.060> more<00:05:32.419> or<00:05:32.510> less<00:05:32.659> the<00:05:32.810> same<00:05:32.840> size<00:05:33.409> same

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
or more or less the same size same

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.719 
or more or less the same size same
thickness<00:05:34.099> as<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.760> s4<00:05:35.389> but<00:05:36.320> you<00:05:36.380> can<00:05:36.610> see<00:05:37.610> the

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
thickness as the s4 but you can see the

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.110 
thickness as the s4 but you can see the
droid<00:05:38.000> razr<00:05:38.229> that<00:05:39.229> the<00:05:39.740> camera<00:05:40.159> portion<00:05:40.940> on

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
droid razr that the camera portion on

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.940 
droid razr that the camera portion on
top<00:05:41.389> is<00:05:41.659> actually<00:05:42.050> much<00:05:42.200> thicker<00:05:42.560> than<00:05:42.800> the

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
top is actually much thicker than the

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.170 
top is actually much thicker than the
rest<00:05:43.130> of<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:43.370> phone<00:05:43.810> so<00:05:45.250> basically<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.400> the

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
rest of the phone so basically the the

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.209 
rest of the phone so basically the the
rest<00:05:47.419> of<00:05:47.570> the<00:05:47.690> phone<00:05:47.900> excluding<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.830> camera

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
rest of the phone excluding the camera

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:53.379 
rest of the phone excluding the camera
portion<00:05:49.700> is<00:05:50.120> actually<00:05:50.990> slightly<00:05:52.000> dinner<00:05:53.000> or<00:05:53.360> i

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
portion is actually slightly dinner or i

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.180 
portion is actually slightly dinner or i
guess<00:05:53.659> more<00:05:53.930> or<00:05:54.050> less<00:05:54.169> the<00:05:54.289> same<00:05:54.610> yes<00:05:55.610> for<00:05:56.030> is

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
guess more or less the same yes for is

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.750 
guess more or less the same yes for is
longer<00:05:58.190> than<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.460> droid<00:05:59.120> razr<00:06:00.550> i'm<00:06:01.550> gonna

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
longer than the droid razr i'm gonna

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.589 
longer than the droid razr i'm gonna
sign<00:06:02.029> you<00:06:02.300> can<00:06:02.479> see<00:06:03.909> nothing<00:06:04.909> much<00:06:05.270> between

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599 
sign you can see nothing much between

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.850 
sign you can see nothing much between
them<00:06:05.919> so<00:06:06.919> yep<00:06:07.729> that's<00:06:08.630> all<00:06:08.870> i<00:06:08.900> will<00:06:09.200> be<00:06:09.409> doing<00:06:09.560> a
