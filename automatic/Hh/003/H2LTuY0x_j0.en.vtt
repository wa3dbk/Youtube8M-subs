really<00:02:34.360> exciting<00:02:35.050> this<00:02:35.140> idea<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.680> being<00:02:35.920> out

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
really exciting this idea of being out

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.460 
really exciting this idea of being out
there<00:02:36.280> in<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.700> wilderness<00:02:37.050> catching<00:02:38.050> fish<00:02:38.320> to

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
there in the wilderness catching fish to

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.470 
there in the wilderness catching fish to
eat<00:02:38.620> for<00:02:38.860> dinner<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.550> think<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.270> was<00:02:40.450> a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
eat for dinner and I think that was a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.190 
eat for dinner and I think that was a
real<00:02:41.220> inspirational<00:02:42.220> trip<00:02:42.430> for<00:02:42.610> me<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:43.200> really

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
developed this love of wild places that

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.440 
developed this love of wild places that
I<00:02:46.989> keep<00:02:47.380> seeking<00:02:47.800> out<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.250> day

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
more just in view I mean the forest is

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.300 
more just in view I mean the forest is
so<00:03:48.840> tall<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:51.290> got<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.319> friend<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.709> bring<00:03:52.890> out<00:03:53.040> some

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
so tall I got a friend to bring out some

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.940 
so tall I got a friend to bring out some
ropes<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:54.090> was<00:03:54.390> able<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:55.019> climb<00:03:55.739> up<00:03:55.829> the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
ropes and I was able to climb up the

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.860 
ropes and I was able to climb up the
rope<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.579> get<00:03:57.269> up<00:03:57.390> there<00:03:57.599> and<00:03:57.690> that's

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
rope and and get up there and that's

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.960 
rope and and get up there and that's
kind<00:03:58.079> of<00:03:58.110> what<00:03:58.290> got<00:03:58.500> me<00:03:58.620> started<00:03:58.920> on<00:03:59.130> exploring

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
kind of what got me started on exploring

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.050 
kind of what got me started on exploring
the<00:04:00.030> rainforest<00:04:00.510> canopy<00:04:04.700> since<00:04:05.700> few

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
the rainforest canopy since few

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.229 
the rainforest canopy since few
scientists<00:04:06.600> bother<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.829> take<00:04:08.579> that<00:04:08.790> difficult

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
scientists bother to take that difficult

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.910 
scientists bother to take that difficult
step<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.600> climbing<00:04:10.079> up<00:04:10.200> into<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.500> treetops

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
step of climbing up into the treetops

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.309 
step of climbing up into the treetops
it's<00:04:11.220> really<00:04:11.459> kind<00:04:11.639> of<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.730> wide-open<00:04:12.000> field<00:04:12.900> of

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
it's really kind of a wide-open field of

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.349 
it's really kind of a wide-open field of
research<00:04:15.859> that<00:04:16.859> canopy<00:04:17.340> level<00:04:17.789> of<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.000> forest

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
research that canopy level of the forest

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.580 
research that canopy level of the forest
is<00:04:18.510> really<00:04:18.870> where<00:04:19.200> most<00:04:19.470> of<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.769> action<00:04:19.979> is

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.990
