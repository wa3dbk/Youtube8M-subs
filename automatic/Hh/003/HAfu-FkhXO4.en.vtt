about<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.050> depth<00:00:28.320> collision<00:00:28.859> module<00:00:29.279> we're

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
about the depth collision module we're

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.980 
about the depth collision module we're
also<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> get<00:00:30.359> into<00:00:30.570> some<00:00:30.750> water

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
also going to get into some water

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.600 
also going to get into some water
effects<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.679> then<00:00:32.070> we're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.369> look<00:00:32.489> at

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
effects and then we're going to look at

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.799 
effects and then we're going to look at
some<00:00:32.669> atmosphere<00:00:33.239> effects<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:33.750> the

sounds<00:00:36.000> awesome<00:00:36.360> let's<00:00:36.719> get<00:00:36.870> started<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
sounds awesome let's get started so to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.280 
sounds awesome let's get started so to
help<00:00:38.730> illustrate<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.480> set<00:00:39.750> up<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.989> custom

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
help illustrate this I set up a custom

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.650 
help illustrate this I set up a custom
seen<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.640> two<00:00:41.940> particle<00:00:42.390> effects

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
seen here with the two particle effects

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
seen here with the two particle effects
that<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:42.870> exactly<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> same<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.430> can

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
that are exactly the same and you can

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.340 
that are exactly the same and you can
see<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.789> particles<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.450> both<00:00:45.719> using<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
see the particles are both using the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.990 
see the particles are both using the
depth<00:00:46.649> buffer<00:00:46.829> collision<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.579> collide<00:00:47.820> with

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
depth buffer collision to collide with

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.020 
depth buffer collision to collide with
these<00:00:48.149> meshes<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:50.550> depth<00:00:50.879> buffer

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
these meshes and the depth buffer

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.569 
these meshes and the depth buffer
collision<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.140> preview<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.010> actual

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
collision you can preview the actual

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.830 
collision you can preview the actual
depth<00:00:53.850> buffer<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> buffer

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
depth buffer here in the buffer

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.069 
depth buffer here in the buffer
visualization<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.000> open<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
visualization and if I open that up you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.439 
visualization and if I open that up you
can<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.129> information<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
can see this is the information that the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.119 
can see this is the information that the
particle<00:01:00.899> collision<00:01:01.199> module<00:01:01.530> uses<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
particle collision module uses to

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.609 
particle collision module uses to
determine<00:01:02.660> where<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.840> particles<00:01:04.260> need<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
determine where the particles need to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.289 
determine where the particles need to
collide<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.070> surface<00:01:05.280> though<00:01:05.700> lighter

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
collide with the surface though lighter

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.000 
collide with the surface though lighter
areas<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:06.930> further<00:01:07.140> back<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> darker

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
areas are further back and the darker

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.000 
areas are further back and the darker
areas<00:01:08.369> are<00:01:08.520> further<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:09.030> front<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.740> just

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
areas are further up front and if I just

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.580 
areas are further up front and if I just
switch<00:01:11.220> back<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.490> lip<00:01:11.880> mode<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.350> that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
switch back to lip mode you can see that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.219 
switch back to lip mode you can see that
even<00:01:14.070> though<00:01:14.430> these<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.640> both<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.479> same<00:01:15.509> mesh

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
even though these are both the same mesh

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.730 
even though these are both the same mesh
they<00:01:17.009> are<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.729> exact<00:01:18.240> same<00:01:18.450> mesh<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.500> only

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
they are the exact same mesh the only

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.899 
they are the exact same mesh the only
thing<00:01:19.890> that's<00:01:20.040> different<00:01:20.159> about<00:01:20.369> them<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
thing that's different about them is the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.490 
thing that's different about them is the
material<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.689> using<00:01:22.110> an<00:01:22.200> opaque

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
material this is using an opaque

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
material this is using an opaque
material<00:01:22.740> well<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.850> using<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.299> mask

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
material well this is using a mask

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.969 
material well this is using a mask
material<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> saw<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.740> depth

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
material and as you saw in the depth

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
material and as you saw in the depth
buffer<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.400> mass<00:01:26.580> material<00:01:27.030> rights<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
buffer the mass material rights to the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.749 
buffer the mass material rights to the
buffer<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.890> these<00:01:29.070> particles<00:01:29.549> can

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
buffer so all these particles can

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.749 
buffer so all these particles can
collide<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.360> fall<00:01:30.570> through<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:32.220> holes<00:01:32.250> in

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
collide and fall through the holes in

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.819 
collide and fall through the holes in
the<00:01:32.880> actual<00:01:33.180> mass<00:01:33.509> surface<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.650> you're

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the actual mass surface so you're

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.289 
the actual mass surface so you're
actually<00:01:35.009> kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.400> poking<00:01:35.790> holes<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.150> this

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
actually kind of poking holes in this

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.179 
actually kind of poking holes in this
mesh<00:01:36.630> by<00:01:36.990> way<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> material<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
mesh by way of the material and the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.999 
mesh by way of the material and the
particles<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.299> fall<00:01:39.600> through<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.960> yes<00:01:40.409> so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
particles can fall through that yes so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.670 
particles can fall through that yes so
if<00:01:41.220> i<00:01:41.340> take<00:01:41.700> my<00:01:41.939> effect<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.570> pull<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.110> pull<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
if i take my effect and pull it pull the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
if i take my effect and pull it pull the
emitter<00:01:43.950> tab<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> properties<00:01:45.060> tab<00:01:45.090> over

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
emitter tab and the properties tab over

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.960 
emitter tab and the properties tab over
here<00:01:45.630> now<00:01:46.439> these<00:01:46.560> are<00:01:46.740> two<00:01:47.070> panels<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
here now these are two panels from the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.420 
here now these are two panels from the
cascade<00:01:48.540> particle<00:01:49.020> editor<00:01:49.409> correct<00:01:49.740> yes<00:01:50.220> an

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
cascade particle editor correct yes an

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.490 
cascade particle editor correct yes an
unreal<00:01:50.700> engine<00:01:50.970> 4<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.720> tear<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> panels

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
unreal engine 4 you can tear the panels

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.810 
unreal engine 4 you can tear the panels
off<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.860> move<00:01:53.009> them<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.250> anywhere<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
off and move them or anywhere on the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.149 
off and move them or anywhere on the
screen<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.450> want<00:01:54.750> them<00:01:54.990> I'm<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.040> going

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
screen that you want them I'm just going

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.039 
screen that you want them I'm just going
to<00:01:56.189> solo<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.820> emitter<00:01:57.180> here<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:57.899> can

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
to solo this emitter here so we can

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.130 
to solo this emitter here so we can
really<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> good<00:01:59.369> look<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.509> i'm

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
really get a good look at this and i'm

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.600 
really get a good look at this and i'm
just<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.500> increase<00:02:01.860> my<00:02:02.070> spawn<00:02:02.399> rate

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
just going to increase my spawn rate

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.050 
just going to increase my spawn rate
something<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.509> little<00:02:03.689> crazy<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.729> really

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
something a little crazy you can really

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
something a little crazy you can really
see<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.450> particles<00:02:07.049> falling<00:02:07.530> through<00:02:07.860> there

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
see the particles falling through there

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.880 
see the particles falling through there
and<00:02:08.520> i<00:02:08.670> use<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.420> bit

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.220 

so<00:02:13.890> when<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.520> get<00:02:14.670> into<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.300> actual<00:02:15.900> collision

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so when we get into the actual collision

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.320 
so when we get into the actual collision
module<00:02:16.860> there<00:02:17.640> are<00:02:17.730> several<00:02:17.910> different

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
module there are several different

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.880 
module there are several different
options<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:18.930> mouse-over<00:02:19.230> any<00:02:19.770> of

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
options and you can mouse-over any of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.160 
options and you can mouse-over any of
these<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.370> get<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> quick<00:02:21.330> description<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:22.020> what

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
these to get a quick description of what

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.990 
these to get a quick description of what
it<00:02:22.290> does<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.430> as<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:23.730> see<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
it does and so as you can see the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000 
it does and so as you can see the
resilience<00:02:24.480> controls<00:02:25.050> how<00:02:25.290> bouncy<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
resilience controls how bouncy the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.610 
resilience controls how bouncy the
sprite<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.910> set<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.510> one<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
sprite is so if I set this to one the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.810 
sprite is so if I set this to one the
particle<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.070> just<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.460> go<00:02:29.610> crazy

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
particle is just going to go crazy

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.780 
particle is just going to go crazy
bouncing<00:02:30.450> all<00:02:30.570> over<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.960> place<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:32.610> set

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
bouncing all over the place and if I set

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.000 
bouncing all over the place and if I set
it<00:02:32.910> back<00:02:33.000> 2.125<00:02:33.660> it's<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.440> little<00:02:34.710> bit<00:02:34.830> more

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
it back 2.125 it's a little bit more

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.930 
it back 2.125 it's a little bit more
reasonable<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.990> then<00:02:37.200> friction<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.520> how

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
reasonable and then friction is just how

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.870 
reasonable and then friction is just how
sticky<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:40.470> surface<00:02:40.860> may<00:02:41.070> be<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.490> if<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.640> set<00:02:41.790> it

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
sticky the surface may be so if I set it

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.160 
sticky the surface may be so if I set it
to<00:02:41.970> one<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.330> particles<00:02:42.780> are<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:43.020> going<00:02:43.140> to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
to one the particles are just going to

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.890 
to one the particles are just going to
really<00:02:43.590> adhere<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> surface<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.060> if<00:02:45.810> I

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
really adhere to the surface and if I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.740 
really adhere to the surface and if I
set<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.170> back<00:02:46.260> 2.25<00:02:47.040> though<00:02:47.460> slide<00:02:48.300> around<00:02:48.570> a

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
set it back 2.25 though slide around a

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.120 
set it back 2.25 though slide around a
little<00:02:48.870> more<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.290> set<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.590> zero<00:02:49.890> they'll

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
little more if I set it to zero they'll

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.330 
little more if I set it to zero they'll
just<00:02:50.280> slide<00:02:50.670> all<00:02:50.850> over<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.270> place<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.310> can

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
just slide all over the place and we can

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.080 
just slide all over the place and we can
also<00:02:53.610> use<00:02:53.880> these<00:02:54.120> radius<00:02:55.490> controls<00:02:56.490> to<00:02:56.670> offset

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
also use these radius controls to offset

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.490 
also use these radius controls to offset
the<00:02:57.240> sprites<00:02:57.540> from<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> surface<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.470> that

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
the sprites from the surface so that

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.590 
the sprites from the surface so that
they<00:02:58.740> don't<00:02:58.920> they<00:02:59.430> don't<00:02:59.460> just<00:02:59.790> clip<00:03:00.390> right

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
they don't they don't just clip right

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.140 
they don't they don't just clip right
into<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.050> ground<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.590> can<00:03:02.370> get<00:03:02.490> them<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.700> show

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
into the ground so can get them to show

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.500 
into the ground so can get them to show
up<00:03:03.180> just<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.780> little<00:03:03.930> bit<00:03:04.050> more<00:03:05.360> there's<00:03:06.360> kind

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
up just a little bit more there's kind

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.910 
up just a little bit more there's kind
of<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.600> offsetting<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.170> collision<00:03:07.560> surface

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
of like offsetting the collision surface

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.910 
of like offsetting the collision surface
yes<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.550> then<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.690> have<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.960> response<00:03:10.440> method

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
yes and then we have the response method

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.740 
yes and then we have the response method
which<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:11.250> determines<00:03:11.940> how<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.210> particles

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
which is determines how the particles

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.750 
which is determines how the particles
are<00:03:12.990> going<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.260> behave<00:03:13.710> once<00:03:14.190> they<00:03:14.400> collide

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
are going to behave once they collide

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.700 
are going to behave once they collide
you<00:03:15.390> can<00:03:15.570> set<00:03:15.840> them<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:15.960> stop<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.560> they'll

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
you can set them to stop and they'll

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.090 
you can set them to stop and they'll
just<00:03:17.420> stick<00:03:18.420> right<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.960> surface<00:03:19.140> or<00:03:19.590> you

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
just stick right to the surface or you

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.680 
just stick right to the surface or you
can<00:03:20.280> set<00:03:20.490> them<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.640> kill<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.210> though<00:03:21.390> they

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
can set them to kill and though they

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.510 
can set them to kill and though they
won't<00:03:21.930> go<00:03:22.110> through<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.470> surface<00:03:22.680> anymore<00:03:23.250> you

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
won't go through the surface anymore you

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.340 
won't go through the surface anymore you
can<00:03:23.670> see<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:23.880> most<00:03:24.240> evidently<00:03:24.750> over<00:03:24.990> here

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
can see that most evidently over here

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.250 
can see that most evidently over here
and<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.490> just<00:03:26.640> too<00:03:26.820> cool

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.360 

typically<00:03:34.260> water<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.830> one<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.220> more

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
typically water is one of the more

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.790 
typically water is one of the more
challenging<00:03:35.430> effects<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.569> create<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.140> what<00:03:37.770> I

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
challenging effects to create and what I

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.250 
challenging effects to create and what I
try<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.700> do<00:03:38.970> when<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.240> first<00:03:39.480> get<00:03:39.690> started<00:03:40.140> is

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
try to do when I first get started is

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.570 
try to do when I first get started is
break<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.530> water<00:03:40.860> down<00:03:41.100> into<00:03:41.400> what<00:03:41.550> I

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
break the water down into what I

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.880 
break the water down into what I
consider<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:42.060> be<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.209> ideal<00:03:42.450> forms<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.319> in

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
consider to be the ideal forms and in

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.410 
consider to be the ideal forms and in
order<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.130> do<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.490> take<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.850> look<00:03:45.030> at<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.209> lot

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
order to do that I take a look at a lot

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.390 
order to do that I take a look at a lot
of<00:03:45.540> different<00:03:45.569> reference<00:03:46.200> sometimes<00:03:47.100> a<00:03:47.250> look

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
of different reference sometimes a look

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.280 
of different reference sometimes a look
at<00:03:47.520> photography<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:48.300> I<00:03:48.480> also<00:03:48.750> like<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.080> look

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
at photography but I also like to look

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.100 
at photography but I also like to look
at<00:03:49.470> 2d<00:03:49.739> animation<00:03:50.280> like<00:03:50.459> old<00:03:50.760> Disney<00:03:51.209> films<00:03:51.600> as

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
at 2d animation like old Disney films as

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.960 
at 2d animation like old Disney films as
well<00:03:52.380> as<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.650> book<00:03:52.860> elemental<00:03:53.430> magic<00:03:53.790> by

Joseph Gillen which I recommend to any
effects<00:03:56.220> artist<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.360> can<00:03:57.480> see<00:03:57.630> here<00:03:57.810> that

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
effects artist and you can see here that

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.140 
effects artist and you can see here that
I've<00:03:58.020> broken<00:03:58.350> all<00:03:58.830> this<00:03:59.160> down<00:03:59.370> into<00:03:59.640> like<00:03:59.940> the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
I've broken all this down into like the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.180 
I've broken all this down into like the
six<00:04:00.450> parts<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.350> felt<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.830> needed<00:04:01.890> to

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
six parts that I felt like I needed to

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.330 
six parts that I felt like I needed to
achieve<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.790> particular<00:04:03.300> effect<00:04:04.190> it's<00:04:05.190> a

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
achieve this particular effect it's a

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.130 
achieve this particular effect it's a
sort<00:04:05.610> of<00:04:05.640> like<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.820> larger<00:04:06.300> splash<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.019> then

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
sort of like a larger splash and then

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.320 
sort of like a larger splash and then
another<00:04:07.380> bit<00:04:08.370> of<00:04:08.400> water<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:08.910> just<00:04:09.120> sort<00:04:09.239> of

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
another bit of water that just sort of

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.780 
another bit of water that just sort of
lifts<00:04:09.630> off<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.930> surface<00:04:10.140> then<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.830> radiating

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
lifts off the surface then the radiating

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.430 
lifts off the surface then the radiating
ripples<00:04:12.239> as<00:04:12.510> well<00:04:12.750> as<00:04:12.870> some<00:04:13.050> different

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
ripples as well as some different

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.810 
ripples as well as some different
droplet<00:04:13.950> shapes<00:04:14.190> which<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.489> can<00:04:14.640> use<00:04:14.790> on

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
droplet shapes which I can use on

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.789 
droplet shapes which I can use on
sprites<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.720> then<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.079> drop<00:04:16.350> which<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:16.680> can

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
sprites and then this drop which I can

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.370 
sprites and then this drop which I can
use<00:04:16.829> with<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.160> measure<00:04:17.459> meter<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:18.109> once<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.230> get

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
use with a measure meter and once I get

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.710 
use with a measure meter and once I get
all<00:04:19.530> those<00:04:19.769> things<00:04:20.669> together<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.209> pull<00:04:21.540> all

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
all those things together I pull all

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.290 
all those things together I pull all
that<00:04:21.750> into<00:04:22.169> cascade<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.980> you<00:04:23.610> can<00:04:23.729> see<00:04:23.940> here's

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
that into cascade and you can see here's

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.290 
that into cascade and you can see here's
the<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:25.050> final<00:04:25.320> effect<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.790> can<00:04:26.940> use<00:04:27.090> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
the the final effect and I can use the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.420 
the the final effect and I can use the
dynamic<00:04:27.960> parameter<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.680> different<00:04:29.040> material

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
dynamic parameter and different material

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.879 
dynamic parameter and different material
controls<00:04:29.880> within<00:04:30.120> cascade<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:31.350> manipulate

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
controls within cascade to manipulate

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.400 
controls within cascade to manipulate
the<00:04:32.010> behavior<00:04:32.460> of<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.820> material<00:04:33.120> in<00:04:33.780> time

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
the behavior of the material in time

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.560 
the behavior of the material in time
with<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.740> animation<00:04:35.610> which<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:35.880> control<00:04:36.270> on

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
with the animation which I control on

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.330 
with the animation which I control on
the<00:04:36.840> mesh<00:04:37.229> level<00:04:37.650> can<00:04:38.010> we<00:04:38.070> see<00:04:38.190> that<00:04:38.220> in

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
the mesh level can we see that in

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.480 
the mesh level can we see that in
wireframe<00:04:38.580> sure<00:04:39.240> oh<00:04:39.950> yeah<00:04:40.950> that's<00:04:41.190> really

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
wireframe sure oh yeah that's really

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.040 
wireframe sure oh yeah that's really
cool<00:04:41.700> you<00:04:41.850> can<00:04:42.090> see<00:04:42.270> here<00:04:42.479> it's<00:04:42.660> one<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:42.960> these

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
cool you can see here it's one of these

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.110 
cool you can see here it's one of these
is<00:04:43.290> three-dimensional<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:44.190> if<00:04:44.370> I<00:04:44.520> rotate<00:04:44.970> it

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
is three-dimensional so if I rotate it

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.760 
is three-dimensional so if I rotate it
around<00:04:45.210> from<00:04:45.690> different<00:04:46.020> angles<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.470> can<00:04:46.650> get

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
around from different angles you can get

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.710 
around from different angles you can get
a<00:04:46.800> different<00:04:47.040> view<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:47.669> and<00:04:48.240> we<00:04:48.300> can<00:04:48.450> even

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
a different view of it and we can even

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.990 
a different view of it and we can even
use<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.900> in<00:04:49.169> different<00:04:49.200> ways<00:04:49.760> like<00:04:50.760> this

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
use it in different ways like this

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.029 
use it in different ways like this
particular<00:04:51.510> mesh<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:51.840> can<00:04:52.020> see<00:04:52.200> looks<00:04:52.830> more

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
particular mesh you can see looks more

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.159 
particular mesh you can see looks more
like<00:04:53.190> if<00:04:53.310> someone's<00:04:53.729> a<00:04:53.820> step<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.360> big<00:04:54.570> deep

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
like if someone's a step in a big deep

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.140 
like if someone's a step in a big deep
puddle<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:55.800> would<00:04:55.919> lift<00:04:56.400> up<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:56.820> splash

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
puddle and it would lift up and splash

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.920 
puddle and it would lift up and splash
out<00:04:57.419> but<00:04:58.070> in<00:04:59.070> order<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.490> reuse<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.539> save<00:05:00.750> on

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
out but in order to reuse and save on

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.630 
out but in order to reuse and save on
memory<00:05:01.260> i<00:05:01.289> actually<00:05:01.740> just<00:05:01.770> scale<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.430> mesh<00:05:02.610> a

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
memory i actually just scale the mesh a

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.310 
memory i actually just scale the mesh a
little<00:05:02.970> bit<00:05:03.060> different<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:03.600> animate<00:05:04.200> it

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
little bit different and animate it

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.590 
little bit different and animate it
differently<00:05:04.650> here<00:05:04.950> so<00:05:05.130> that<00:05:05.280> i<00:05:05.310> can<00:05:05.400> save<00:05:06.360> on

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
differently here so that i can save on

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.870 
differently here so that i can save on
asset<00:05:07.050> space<00:05:07.620> now<00:05:08.100> where<00:05:08.370> do<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.520> see<00:05:08.760> this

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
asset space now where do you see this

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.150 
asset space now where do you see this
effect<00:05:09.270> in<00:05:09.419> infiltrator<00:05:09.900> it's<00:05:10.770> in<00:05:11.039> the

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
effect in infiltrator it's in the

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.950 
effect in infiltrator it's in the
hallway<00:05:11.490> as<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.820> soldiers<00:05:12.210> making<00:05:12.570> a<00:05:12.750> turn

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
hallway as the soldiers making a turn

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.469 
hallway as the soldiers making a turn
walking<00:05:13.440> down<00:05:13.590> towards<00:05:14.100> the<00:05:14.190> infiltrator<00:05:15.090> and

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
walking down towards the infiltrator and

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:16.969 
walking down towards the infiltrator and
you<00:05:15.840> can<00:05:15.990> see<00:05:16.200> it<00:05:16.289> on<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.500> right<00:05:16.650> hand<00:05:16.830> side

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
you can see it on the right hand side

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.560 
you can see it on the right hand side
there<00:05:17.370> it's<00:05:17.550> one<00:05:17.820> of<00:05:17.910> those<00:05:17.970> effects<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.450> we

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
there it's one of those effects that we

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.870 
there it's one of those effects that we
use<00:05:18.780> just<00:05:19.050> more<00:05:19.500> for<00:05:19.740> ambience<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.340> add<00:05:20.490> some

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
use just more for ambience to add some

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.700 
use just more for ambience to add some
secondary<00:05:21.330> animation<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.200> world<00:05:22.410> and

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
secondary animation to the world and

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.820 
secondary animation to the world and
just<00:05:23.160> help<00:05:23.400> bring<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.760> world<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:24.090> life<00:05:24.830> you

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
just help bring the world to life you

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.260 
just help bring the world to life you
can<00:05:25.979> see<00:05:26.160> in<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.340> background<00:05:26.370> here<00:05:26.970> there's<00:05:27.210> a

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
can see in the background here there's a

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.360 
can see in the background here there's a
lot<00:05:27.419> of<00:05:27.450> mist<00:05:27.840> and<00:05:28.140> haze<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.770> this<00:05:29.250> is

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
lot of mist and haze and this is

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.710 
lot of mist and haze and this is
achieved<00:05:29.430> with<00:05:29.760> a<00:05:29.820> mixture<00:05:30.120> of<00:05:30.210> particle

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
achieved with a mixture of particle

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.740 
achieved with a mixture of particle
systems<00:05:31.080> as<00:05:31.440> well<00:05:31.530> as<00:05:32.010> meshes<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:32.750> there's

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
systems as well as meshes and there's

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.810 
systems as well as meshes and there's
some<00:05:33.960> more<00:05:34.289> haze<00:05:34.590> down<00:05:34.890> in<00:05:35.100> here<00:05:35.340> just<00:05:35.370> kind<00:05:35.789> of

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
some more haze down in here just kind of

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.029 
some more haze down in here just kind of
drifting<00:05:36.300> up<00:05:36.419> through<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.750> grates<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:37.320> that

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
drifting up through the grates and that

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.590 
drifting up through the grates and that
helps<00:05:38.280> define<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.700> mid-ground<00:05:39.060> the

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
helps define the mid-ground the

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.120 
helps define the mid-ground the
background<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.200> then<00:05:40.320> in<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:40.560> foreground<00:05:40.890> we

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
background and then in the foreground we

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.270 
background and then in the foreground we
have<00:05:41.250> this<00:05:41.430> kind<00:05:41.640> of<00:05:41.729> lit<00:05:42.289> smoke<00:05:43.289> or<00:05:43.590> fog<00:05:43.890> and

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
have this kind of lit smoke or fog and

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.980 
have this kind of lit smoke or fog and
then<00:05:44.909> some<00:05:45.150> god<00:05:45.360> rays<00:05:45.599> come

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
then some god rays come

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.270 
then some god rays come
through<00:05:46.140> the<00:05:46.260> grades<00:05:46.500> as<00:05:46.740> well<00:05:46.920> as<00:05:47.040> all<00:05:47.160> these

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
through the grades as well as all these

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.490 
through the grades as well as all these
little<00:05:47.550> tiny<00:05:47.760> dust<00:05:48.060> motes<00:05:48.410> floating<00:05:49.410> around

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
little tiny dust motes floating around

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.560 
little tiny dust motes floating around
in<00:05:49.770> the<00:05:49.860> air<00:05:49.890> and<00:05:50.190> you<00:05:50.280> can<00:05:50.430> see<00:05:51.210> they<00:05:51.360> just

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
in the air and you can see they just

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.720 
in the air and you can see they just
sort<00:05:51.720> of<00:05:51.810> parallax<00:05:52.350> and<00:05:52.710> as<00:05:53.250> you<00:05:53.520> move<00:05:53.670> through

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
sort of parallax and as you move through

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.790 
sort of parallax and as you move through
the<00:05:54.030> space<00:05:54.300> yeah<00:05:55.050> they<00:05:55.230> add<00:05:55.350> a<00:05:55.380> really<00:05:55.650> nice

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
the space yeah they add a really nice

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.640 
the space yeah they add a really nice
depth<00:05:56.160> and<00:05:57.090> these<00:05:57.780> dust<00:05:58.080> motes<00:05:58.290> are<00:05:58.440> kind<00:05:58.620> of

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
depth and these dust motes are kind of

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.230 
depth and these dust motes are kind of
interesting<00:05:58.830> because<00:05:59.250> i'm<00:05:59.490> actually<00:05:59.790> using<00:05:59.970> a

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
interesting because i'm actually using a

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.080 
interesting because i'm actually using a
vector<00:06:00.510> field<00:06:00.690> to<00:06:00.930> control<00:06:01.320> their<00:06:01.470> behavior

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
vector field to control their behavior

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.330 
vector field to control their behavior
this<00:06:03.090> vector<00:06:03.360> feels<00:06:03.660> just<00:06:04.140> like<00:06:04.500> basically<00:06:05.220> if

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
this vector feels just like basically if

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.470 
this vector feels just like basically if
you<00:06:05.430> think<00:06:05.670> about<00:06:05.760> it<00:06:05.910> as<00:06:06.090> a<00:06:06.120> grid<00:06:06.450> of

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
you think about it as a grid of

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.660 
you think about it as a grid of
velocities<00:06:07.170> as<00:06:07.440> I<00:06:07.590> move<00:06:07.860> around<00:06:08.160> within<00:06:08.400> this

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
velocities as I move around within this

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.060 
velocities as I move around within this
space<00:06:08.790> each<00:06:09.570> one<00:06:09.840> of<00:06:09.870> these<00:06:10.020> little<00:06:10.380> lines

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
space each one of these little lines

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.940 
space each one of these little lines
denotes<00:06:11.640> a<00:06:11.790> direction<00:06:12.150> that<00:06:12.330> the<00:06:12.930> particle<00:06:13.860> is

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
denotes a direction that the particle is

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.880 
denotes a direction that the particle is
going<00:06:14.280> to<00:06:14.430> move<00:06:14.700> in<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.810> lit<00:06:16.020> translucency

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
going to move in the lit translucency

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.920 
going to move in the lit translucency
also<00:06:17.310> is<00:06:17.460> fantastic<00:06:18.240> because<00:06:18.450> I<00:06:18.600> can<00:06:18.780> just

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
also is fantastic because I can just

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.800 
also is fantastic because I can just
grab<00:06:19.140> this<00:06:19.440> effect<00:06:20.430> here<00:06:20.700> and<00:06:20.880> as<00:06:21.390> I<00:06:21.510> drag<00:06:21.750> it

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
grab this effect here and as I drag it

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.750 
grab this effect here and as I drag it
around<00:06:22.020> the<00:06:22.290> world<00:06:22.470> that<00:06:22.680> updates<00:06:23.100> in<00:06:23.460> real

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
around the world that updates in real

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.000 
around the world that updates in real
time<00:06:24.060> with<00:06:24.870> the<00:06:25.020> lighting<00:06:25.350> information<00:06:25.890> so

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
time with the lighting information so

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.650 
time with the lighting information so
I'd<00:06:26.070> no<00:06:26.280> longer<00:06:26.550> have<00:06:26.670> to<00:06:26.820> tweak<00:06:27.090> a<00:06:27.240> material

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
I'd no longer have to tweak a material

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.480 
I'd no longer have to tweak a material
parameter<00:06:28.200> or<00:06:28.230> an<00:06:28.410> instance<00:06:28.800> parameter<00:06:29.340> oh

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
parameter or an instance parameter oh

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.730 
parameter or an instance parameter oh
yeah<00:06:29.760> that's<00:06:30.000> really<00:06:30.360> awesome<00:06:30.510> now<00:06:31.440> let<00:06:31.680> me

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
yeah that's really awesome now let me

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.770 
yeah that's really awesome now let me
ask<00:06:31.920> you<00:06:32.070> this<00:06:32.130> as<00:06:32.460> an<00:06:32.610> effects<00:06:32.910> artist<00:06:33.360> how

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
ask you this as an effects artist how

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.110 
ask you this as an effects artist how
has<00:06:34.080> Unreal<00:06:34.620> Engine<00:06:34.650> 4<00:06:35.010> enabled<00:06:35.940> you<00:06:36.090> to

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
has Unreal Engine 4 enabled you to

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.810 
has Unreal Engine 4 enabled you to
create<00:06:36.450> scenes<00:06:36.840> like<00:06:37.050> this<00:06:37.260> with<00:06:37.980> the<00:06:38.220> new<00:06:38.370> GPU

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
create scenes like this with the new GPU

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.330 
create scenes like this with the new GPU
particles<00:06:39.450> I<00:06:39.720> really<00:06:40.350> don't<00:06:40.530> have<00:06:40.620> to<00:06:40.860> worry

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
particles I really don't have to worry

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.760 
particles I really don't have to worry
about<00:06:41.520> my<00:06:42.060> emission<00:06:42.450> rates<00:06:42.690> and<00:06:42.930> simulation

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
about my emission rates and simulation

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.370 
about my emission rates and simulation
time<00:06:43.980> as<00:06:44.160> much<00:06:44.370> so<00:06:44.970> I<00:06:45.030> can<00:06:45.210> emit<00:06:45.750> hundreds<00:06:46.260> and

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
time as much so I can emit hundreds and

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.320 
time as much so I can emit hundreds and
hundreds<00:06:46.770> of<00:06:46.860> these<00:06:47.010> little<00:06:47.400> dust<00:06:47.940> motes<00:06:48.180> in

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
hundreds of these little dust motes in

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.490 
hundreds of these little dust motes in
the<00:06:48.450> air<00:06:48.570> and<00:06:48.750> I<00:06:48.840> don't<00:06:48.990> have<00:06:49.110> to<00:06:49.230> worry<00:06:49.410> that
