00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.620
 here is what conditions we have the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.099
 first refugee who took the boat 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.420
 to get to work but 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.529
 my lady cannot tell you 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:23.970
 you can't tell this morning 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:27.869
 but you think you can excuse yourself 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:34.040
 but she thinks she can save herself but 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.040
 to work but to work 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.960
 gentlemen is an amazing thing is one 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.430
 what in credit are the 9 35 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.300
 we are in this condition from this 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.760
 morning at half past six we have offices 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.140
 mail with a computer network and that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.140
 it also risks going haywire 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.650
 we are doing the video on purpose this is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.650
 the most ridiculous thing 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.020
 the level fails to lower not 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.100
 you can tell sir you can't 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.979
 recounting these ways shapes the road 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.570
 main entrance to the city of san 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.830
 pious 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.080
 once defined the city 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.080
 of reception and reconciliation 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.220
 I don't know this administration 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.210
 municipal and if he still thinks he can 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.160
 have other priorities than that of 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.229
 not to the races anymore this city that is 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.229
 floods every time it rains 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.909
 we have few policemen like that much 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.950
 we can't do we have kids from 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.850
 civil protection that not that much 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.340
 if a car passes it will come 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.020
 sea-like waves 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.119
 we don't know what to add 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.759
 we will be repeatable this second gentleman 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.459
 I risked drowning I go 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.849
