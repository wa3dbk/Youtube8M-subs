 Thing that 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.650
 8 I will move to the listening party 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.630
 The 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.710
 It was a very good seller for me to wrap it carefully. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:19.240
 Wintering 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:20.659
 I wanted to buy it with this brand new, but the price at the brand new Amazon was over twenty thousand 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.000
 Ne 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.870
 Maam in and Well buy at the store 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.360
 I wonder if it is all about 2 games 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:33.570
 I thought that but the keyboard 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:39.250
 I have no courage to put out there 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:45.180
 If you look for used, it happens that the usage period is very short 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.180
 He bought it because it came out used 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.890
 Oka 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.350
 First 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.690
 Something like this 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.680
 behind 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:05.500
 This play has a detailed explanation. 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.500
 It is often what Kako cardboard-ish box of 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:16.000
 Switch method is the guy I electrostatic 4 both formula 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.320
 Stroke Town 4 Milly Japanese Sequence 91 Naturalization Nameless 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.320
 45g at 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.220
 Soft 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.920
 Soft feeling feeling 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.470
 usb interface 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:36.460
 Child meter that contains the cable 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.460
 It is the weather, and when I play the back switch 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.569
 Well with windows key and so on 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.100
 Like not to ask 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.970
 I think there is a setting 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.970
 I will dawn 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.630
 1 piece 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.580
 Suzuka day 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.600
 Such feeling- 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.600
 If it is open 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.290
 First of all 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.690
 Is it pure product drinking? 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.020
 It is a key top tree 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.020
 Follow 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.850
 Oh well 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:39.240
 Since it say for the game this 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.240
 wasd only comes with the key top color difference 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.670
 Control 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:03.690
 When 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.690
 What is this or maybe it will be replaced with something 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.260
 Well 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.650
 Here's the control and 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.919
 I do not know how to read this from a few kilometers ago, but this key is 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.919
 I will be able to switch 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.699
 This is also true 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.770
 Where a constant 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.979
 f 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:46.520
 Oh, I'm really fine here 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.520
 I have a switch, but I can switch with this 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:55.039
 Veteran is I feel that come heavily 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.039
 Ah 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.989
 Yes 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.770
 It is here the keyboard 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.499
 Unlike ordinary mechanical 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:21.210
 It's a bit quiet in this, it feels like it has really changed 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:28.810
 Still it's 45 grams so it's a little hard 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:30.529
 Maybe it 's an impression, and maybe I 'm home in the house with the model, probably here . 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:37.840
 This side is softening 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:41.889
 I think there are people who are changing the color of the key top, but that is certainly 30 g 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:49.190
 I think it was a bit harder than that 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:51.360
 Well, it looks like gaming, so it's originally a keyboard 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.840
 9 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.000
 Lowland 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:05.440
 1 I think a place where you hit with a pinky finger is made a little lighter 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.930
 Here as well, but all the keys are 45g together 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.660
 Well hardness 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:16.430
 It is to say that it has become maybe I think that is also here 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:20.110
 The keyboard for the game may be so 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.680
 So it's size 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.689
 I'm using this now 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.319
 It is Black Widow 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:27.319
 Compared to 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.840
 N wonder if cure is whether it a little difficult to understand Well 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.860
 It is a thread 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:43.520
 But Well 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:48.340
 I think the array of keys itself is about the same width, but where is the macro key and the numeric keypad 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:54.729
 Because there is, the width is big 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:07:01.059
 It will be a pretty clean impression just because it is gone 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:04.139
 So I wonder why I'm going to go back to the keyboard and I think I'll buy it for extra 

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:07.610
 It is first and say to gather 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.880
 When this horizontal width is too wide to play a game 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.630
 A little 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:19.420
 It 's more left than you think 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:20.930
 The 9 key sounds like it 's annoying 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:28.689
 this 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:32.519
 The sound of the blue axis is a bit noisy Midnight or something There is a time when it comes to mind after all 

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:32.519
 With that in mind 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.120
 After this printing is 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:44.479
 It is black 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:51.390
 Well it's a bit hard to see, but it's cool and it's blind touch 

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:55.190
 I bought this with the aim of becoming a sound practice or something 

00:07:51.390 --> 00:08:00.680
 I think that I want to use it carefully 

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:01.730
 I would like to more and more out reviews because there Well I Well, those who bought it yet and duck the other to be 

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:07.870
 I'm sorry 

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:07.870
 I wish you something found, If you also comment like that was worrisome
