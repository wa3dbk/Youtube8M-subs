00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
come like this song came out of a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.540 
come like this song came out of a
concept<00:00:35.960> of<00:00:36.230> wanting<00:00:36.949> to<00:00:37.100> write<00:00:37.280> about

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550

something specific and so I pulled some

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.610 
something specific and so I pulled some
ideas<00:00:40.190> together<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:41.239> recall

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620

little kid she was singing harmonies and
and<00:02:18.500> Joe<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.459> weren't<00:02:19.610> really<00:02:19.760> quite<00:02:19.970> sure

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
and Joe and I weren't really quite sure

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.369 
and Joe and I weren't really quite sure
what<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.299> make<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.660> because<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.049> was<00:02:21.080> it

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
what to make of it because it was it

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.479 
what to make of it because it was it
wasn't<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.739> melody<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:22.129> we<00:02:22.280> hadn't<00:02:22.459> really

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
wasn't the melody and we hadn't really

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.009 
wasn't the melody and we hadn't really
heard<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.180> was<00:02:23.209> right<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.540> your<00:02:23.599> ear<00:02:23.810> and

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
heard that it was right in your ear and

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.420 
heard that it was right in your ear and
so<00:02:24.260> she<00:02:24.319> was<00:02:24.500> singing<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:24.829> different<00:02:25.280> line

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
so she was singing this different line

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.160 
so she was singing this different line
and<00:02:25.640> we<00:02:25.700> thought<00:02:25.849> maybe<00:02:26.000> she<00:02:26.269> was<00:02:26.360> off<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:27.110> was

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
and we thought maybe she was off it was

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.839 
and we thought maybe she was off it was
embarrassing<00:02:27.739> at<00:02:27.890> first<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.340> oh<00:02:28.489> my<00:02:28.670> gosh

herself<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.709> realize<00:02:31.010> just<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.340> beauty

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
herself and we realize just the beauty

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.300 
herself and we realize just the beauty
of<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.329> way<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.690> she<00:02:32.870> was<00:02:33.010> adding<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310
