00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.230 

ok<00:00:01.319> so<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:02.190> pretty<00:00:02.429> much<00:00:02.550> look<00:00:02.820> like<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.970> door

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
ok so I pretty much look like a door

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.940 
ok so I pretty much look like a door
here<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.659> that's<00:00:04.140> because<00:00:04.380> one<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:04.830> my

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
here and that's because one of my

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.639 
here and that's because one of my
friends<00:00:05.250> gave<00:00:05.370> me<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.640> idea<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:06.410> putting<00:00:07.410> my

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
friends gave me the idea of putting my

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.919 
friends gave me the idea of putting my
hair<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:07.919> braids<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.700> drying<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.660> way<00:00:09.870> so

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
hair in braids and drying it that way so

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.740 
hair in braids and drying it that way so
that<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.650> stays<00:00:11.010> together<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:11.969> less<00:00:12.150> poufy

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
that it stays together and is less poufy

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.250 
that it stays together and is less poufy
which<00:00:13.679> will<00:00:14.429> cut<00:00:14.759> down<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:15.000> flat<00:00:15.719> ironing<00:00:16.020> time

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
which will cut down on flat ironing time

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.470 
which will cut down on flat ironing time
and<00:00:16.529> here<00:00:17.400> I'm<00:00:17.580> spraying<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.240> heat

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
and here I'm spraying in a heat

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.290 
and here I'm spraying in a heat
protectant<00:00:18.660> spray<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.529> before<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.789> put<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.210> in

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
protectant spray and before I put it in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.480 
protectant spray and before I put it in
braids<00:00:21.689> i<00:00:21.990> actually<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.560> had<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> little<00:00:23.250> bit

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
braids i actually just had a little bit

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.599 
braids i actually just had a little bit
of<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.240> leave<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.840> conditioner<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
of that can to leave in conditioner and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.419 
of that can to leave in conditioner and
some<00:00:26.609> cheese<00:00:27.269> silk<00:00:27.630> infusion<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> really

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
some cheese silk infusion so I really

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.519 
some cheese silk infusion so I really
don't<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.820> much<00:00:29.849> product<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.810> all<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.320> my

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
don't have much product at all in my

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.940 
don't have much product at all in my
house<00:00:32.510> basically<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.590> take<00:00:34.739> one

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
house basically what I do is I take one

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.889 
house basically what I do is I take one
of<00:00:35.010> my<00:00:35.100> round<00:00:35.430> brushes<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.600> kind<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
of my round brushes and I just kind of

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.139 
of my round brushes and I just kind of
pull<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.410> through<00:00:37.559> my<00:00:37.800> hair<00:00:38.070> at<00:00:38.309> one<00:00:38.370> end<00:00:38.850> and

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
pull it through my hair at one end and

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.680 
pull it through my hair at one end and
take<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> flat<00:00:40.469> iron<00:00:40.620> at<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.520> other<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.149> it's

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
take the flat iron at the other and it's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.380 
take the flat iron at the other and it's
a<00:00:42.809> lot<00:00:42.989> easier<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.680> me<00:00:43.829> then<00:00:44.129> using<00:00:44.489> combs<00:00:44.820> use

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
a lot easier for me then using combs use

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.940 
a lot easier for me then using combs use
a<00:00:45.420> comb<00:00:45.690> sometimes<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.410> end<00:00:46.770> up

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
a comb sometimes like they end up

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.720 
a comb sometimes like they end up
bending<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.030> then<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.629> ruins<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
bending and then it just ruins it and

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.430 
bending and then it just ruins it and
it's<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.820> easier<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.539> my<00:00:51.750> wrist<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
it's just easier on my wrist because it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.049 
it's just easier on my wrist because it
turns<00:00:53.190> um<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:54.980> don't<00:00:55.980> necessarily<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
turns um I don't necessarily have a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.750 
turns um I don't necessarily have a
specific<00:00:57.449> direction<00:00:58.280> that<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> put<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
specific direction that I put it on the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.979 
specific direction that I put it on the
round<00:00:59.940> brush<00:01:00.059> because<00:01:00.239> sometimes<00:01:00.600> you'll<00:01:00.780> see

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
round brush because sometimes you'll see

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.380 
round brush because sometimes you'll see
me<00:01:01.170> into<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> other<00:01:01.980> way<00:01:02.160> where<00:01:02.910> instead

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
me into it the other way where instead

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.660 
me into it the other way where instead
of<00:01:03.449> under<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.930> over<00:01:04.320> because<00:01:05.129> I'm<00:01:05.460> not

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
of under it's over because I'm not

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.000 
of under it's over because I'm not
trying<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.420> hair<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.010> stick

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
trying to get my hair to be stick

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.600 
trying to get my hair to be stick
straight<00:01:08.580> um<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:09.470> just<00:01:10.470> trying<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> pretty

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
straight um I'm just trying to pretty

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.100 
straight um I'm just trying to pretty
much<00:01:11.760> basically<00:01:12.030> straight<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:12.900> it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
much basically straight in it because it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.539 
much basically straight in it because it
kind<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.350> straightens<00:01:13.740> itself<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> does

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
kind of straightens itself out and does

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.910 
kind of straightens itself out and does
what<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> want<00:01:15.000> later<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.290> you'll<00:01:16.409> see<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> end

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
what I want later and you'll see the end

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.690 
what I want later and you'll see the end
result<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.509> has<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.040> guess

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
result that it has like more of I guess

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.420 
result that it has like more of I guess
a<00:01:20.880> wave<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> way<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
a wave to it because of the way that I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.050 
a wave to it because of the way that I
dry<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.500> here<00:01:25.500> I'm<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.830> doing<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.759> last

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
dry it and here I'm just doing the last

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.140 
dry it and here I'm just doing the last
piece<00:01:28.220> before<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.400> start<00:01:29.700> touching<00:01:29.729> up

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
piece before I start touching up

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.420 
piece before I start touching up
everything<00:01:30.689> else<00:01:31.549> um<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.860> still<00:01:35.189> going<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
everything else um I it's still going to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.060 
everything else um I it's still going to
be<00:01:35.490> kind<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.000> big<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> way<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.829> this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
be kind of big this is the way like this

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
be kind of big this is the way like this
is<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> way<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.720> mean<00:01:40.320> other

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
is the way that I do it I mean other

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.260 
is the way that I do it I mean other
people<00:01:40.619> might<00:01:41.040> come<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.060> being

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
people might come out with it to being

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.539 
people might come out with it to being
completely<00:01:43.140> straight<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:43.979> when<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.430> by

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
completely straight but when I do it by

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.660 
completely straight but when I do it by
myself<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.329> actually<00:01:45.810> really<00:01:46.170> difficult<00:01:46.670> to

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
myself it's actually really difficult to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.469 
myself it's actually really difficult to
do<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.500> much<00:01:49.799> hair<00:01:50.479> when

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
do because I just have so much hair when

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.690 
do because I just have so much hair when
my<00:01:51.689> mom<00:01:51.869> helps<00:01:52.259> me<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> put<00:01:52.710> obviously<00:01:52.950> it

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
my mom helps me to put obviously it

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.090

have a little elastic at the bottom and

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.599 
have a little elastic at the bottom and
curl<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.239> under<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.900> don't<00:03:16.200> like<00:03:16.260> just<00:03:17.160> leaving

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
curl it under I don't like just leaving

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.970 
curl it under I don't like just leaving
it<00:03:17.760> flat<00:03:18.359> I<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.959> curl<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.319> under<00:03:19.650> because

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980

it flat I like to curl it under because
I<00:03:20.250> don't<00:03:21.209> know<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.630> ends<00:03:21.810> just<00:03:21.989> come<00:03:22.109> out

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
I don't know that ends just come out

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.140 
I don't know that ends just come out
looking<00:03:22.470> weird

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.679 

so<00:03:26.780> basically<00:03:27.200> I<00:03:27.319> step<00:03:27.860> in<00:03:28.099> right<00:03:28.220> here<00:03:28.689> pinned

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
so basically I step in right here pinned

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.500 
so basically I step in right here pinned
on<00:03:30.049> another<00:03:30.079> lip<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.860> clipped<00:03:31.549> up<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.329> two

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
on another lip and clipped up the two

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.449 
on another lip and clipped up the two
braids<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:32.959> who's<00:03:33.110> been<00:03:33.349> together<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:34.430> that

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
braids and who's been together so that

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.059 
braids and who's been together so that
we<00:03:34.640> here<00:03:35.090> will<00:03:35.329> have<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.540> ways<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:36.379> and<00:03:36.590> it'll

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
we here will have a ways to it and it'll

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.100 
we here will have a ways to it and it'll
have<00:03:37.579> less<00:03:37.790> volume<00:03:38.090> since<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:38.720> braids<00:03:38.959> are

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
have less volume since the braids are

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.800 
have less volume since the braids are
going<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.319> hold<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.709> together<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.629> I'm<00:03:41.629> just

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
going to hold it together and I'm just

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.839 
going to hold it together and I'm just
going<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.079> keep<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:42.590> it's<00:03:42.799> not<00:03:43.040> next<00:03:43.310> morning

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
going to keep so it's not next morning

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:56.090 
going to keep so it's not next morning
and<00:03:44.269> I'm<00:03:44.480> just<00:03:44.659> going<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.840> take<00:03:45.019> this<00:03:45.290> out

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.070 

basically<00:03:57.100> it's<00:03:57.820> gonna<00:03:58.090> have<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.420> nice<00:03:58.720> thick
