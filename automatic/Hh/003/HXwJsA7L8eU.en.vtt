not pop up doing a shoulder check so at

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.520 
not pop up doing a shoulder check so at
least<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.970> stays<00:03:16.120> down<00:03:16.480> although<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.350> first

great<00:03:19.890> it's<00:03:20.890> certified<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.610> BSI<00:03:22.120> which<00:03:22.540> i

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
great it's certified the BSI which i

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
great it's certified the BSI which i
think<00:03:22.840> is<00:03:23.200> probably<00:03:23.320> one<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.710> better

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
think is probably one of the better

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.860 
think is probably one of the better

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
helmet to be a little bit softer as we
