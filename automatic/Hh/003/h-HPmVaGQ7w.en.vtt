guys<00:01:13.350> are<00:01:13.530> familiar<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:14.040> how<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.189> snowmobile

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
guys are familiar on how a snowmobile

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.359 
guys are familiar on how a snowmobile
works<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.320> almost<00:01:16.650> exactly<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.310> same

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
works it is almost exactly the same

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.300 
works it is almost exactly the same
thing<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.060> two<00:01:18.450> clutches<00:01:19.070> there's<00:01:20.070> one

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
thing you have two clutches there's one

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
thing you have two clutches there's one
two<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.820> then<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> belt<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.880> S<00:01:24.450> RPMs<00:01:24.990> get

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
two and then a belt the S RPMs get

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
two and then a belt the S RPMs get
higher<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.619> belt<00:01:25.799> gets<00:01:26.240> kind<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.299> stretch

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
higher the belt gets kind of stretch

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.260 
higher the belt gets kind of stretch
longer<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.650> would<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.090> go

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
longer as it would be and then you go

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.550 
longer as it would be and then you go
faster<00:01:31.490> this<00:01:32.490> doesn't<00:01:32.759> really<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
faster this doesn't really have the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
faster this doesn't really have the
transmission<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.770> doesn't<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.390> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
transmission it doesn't really have the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.179 
transmission it doesn't really have the
power<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.990> low<00:01:37.200> low<00:01:37.890> speeds<00:01:38.720> it's<00:01:40.189> like

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
power on low low speeds it's like

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.740 
power on low low speeds it's like
getting<00:01:41.369> out<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.729> hole<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.090> was<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.479> earlier

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
getting out of the hole I was in earlier

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.039 
getting out of the hole I was in earlier
it<00:01:43.430> bogged<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.640> whenever<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.060> gave<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> gasp<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it bogged out whenever I gave a gasp and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.950 
it bogged out whenever I gave a gasp and
tried<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.040> climb<00:01:47.250> out<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> hole<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:49.189> no

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
tried to climb out of the hole so no

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.789 
tried to climb out of the hole so no
this<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.049> what<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:53.060> I've<00:01:54.060> got<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> winch<00:01:54.799> 54

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
cable on that winch I don't know the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.670 
cable on that winch I don't know the
color<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.140> it<00:02:00.110> exclusive<00:02:01.110> oh<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.590> is

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680

better<00:03:45.830> tires<00:03:46.160> or<00:03:46.400> something<00:03:46.430> like<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:46.760> then

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
better tires or something like that then

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.550 
better tires or something like that then
probably<00:03:49.370> wouldn't<00:03:49.580> I've<00:03:49.640> got<00:03:49.760> stuck<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.209> me

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
probably wouldn't I've got stuck to me

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.290 

great<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.810> top<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.960> this<00:04:30.340> this<00:04:31.340> will<00:04:31.970> leave<00:04:32.210> her

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.590 
great so top of this this will leave her
here

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
here

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.330 
here
it's<00:04:32.870> from<00:04:33.020> break<00:04:33.200> so<00:04:33.410> if<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.620> want<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:33.919> figure

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
it's from break so if you want to figure

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.760 
it's from break so if you want to figure
neutral<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:34.910> you<00:04:34.940> want<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.240> go<00:04:35.300> into<00:04:35.510> reverse

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
neutral and you want to go into reverse

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.700 
neutral and you want to go into reverse
you<00:04:36.770> step<00:04:37.040> on<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:37.400> change<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.539> gears<00:04:39.500> and

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
you step on that change the gears and

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.480 
you step on that change the gears and
then<00:04:39.830> your<00:04:39.979> good<00:04:41.770> seat<00:04:42.770> was<00:04:42.950> added<00:04:43.250> when<00:04:43.400> we

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
then your good seat was added when we

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.820 
then your good seat was added when we
bought<00:04:43.700> it<00:04:43.850> about<00:04:44.240> two<00:04:44.600> thousand<00:04:45.050> seven<00:04:45.740> or

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
bought it about two thousand seven or

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.469 
bought it about two thousand seven or
eight<00:04:46.390> and<00:04:47.390> so<00:04:48.460> it's<00:04:49.460> not<00:04:49.610> doesn't<00:04:50.270> come<00:04:50.360> like

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
eight and so it's not doesn't come like

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.420 
eight and so it's not doesn't come like
Dartmouth<00:04:50.780> after<00:04:51.169> II<00:04:51.200> uh<00:04:54.070> overall<00:04:55.070> it's<00:04:55.280> a

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
Dartmouth after II uh overall it's a

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.150 
Dartmouth after II uh overall it's a
pretty<00:04:55.810> decent<00:04:56.810> quad<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:57.500> know<00:04:57.740> it<00:04:57.919> looks

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
pretty decent quad you know it looks

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.219 
pretty decent quad you know it looks
nice<00:04:58.400> when<00:04:58.610> it's<00:04:58.760> clean<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.960> she<00:05:00.080> looks

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229

pretty<00:05:00.440> nice<00:05:00.560> right<00:05:00.770> now<00:05:00.800> actually<00:05:01.220> shouldn't

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
pretty nice right now actually shouldn't

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.230 
pretty nice right now actually shouldn't
say<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:03.490> one<00:05:04.490> this<00:05:04.550> nice<00:05:04.729> and<00:05:04.760> clean<00:05:05.060> and

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
say that one this nice and clean and

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.140 
say that one this nice and clean and
sparkly<00:05:05.630> then<00:05:05.780> it<00:05:05.870> looks<00:05:06.020> pretty<00:05:06.200> good<00:05:06.350> um

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
sparkly then it looks pretty good um

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.360 
sparkly then it looks pretty good um
it's<00:05:08.150> not<00:05:08.300> like<00:05:08.360> there's<00:05:08.720> new<00:05:08.930> can-am<00:05:09.919> so<00:05:10.280> you
