actually saw a blog post recently where

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.940 
actually saw a blog post recently where
they<00:00:28.220> did<00:00:28.460> they<00:00:29.450> used<00:00:29.660> regular<00:00:30.169> like<00:00:30.560> kids

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950

school<00:00:31.400> glue<00:00:31.669> as<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.090> base<00:00:32.720> coat<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.260> it's

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
school glue as a base coat and it's

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.500 
school glue as a base coat and it's
supposed<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:33.950> help<00:00:34.130> it<00:00:34.370> peel<00:00:34.760> right<00:00:35.030> off<00:00:35.090> when

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510

I've<00:00:41.600> taken<00:00:41.840> some<00:00:42.110> regular<00:00:42.470> school<00:00:42.800> glue<00:00:42.980> and

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
I've taken some regular school glue and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.819 
I've taken some regular school glue and
I<00:00:43.310> put<00:00:43.550> it<00:00:43.640> into<00:00:43.880> an<00:00:44.000> empty<00:00:44.270> bottle<00:00:44.450> and<00:00:44.810> use<00:00:45.649> it

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
I put it into an empty bottle and use it

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.880 
I put it into an empty bottle and use it
you<00:00:46.010> know<00:00:46.129> full<00:00:46.460> strength<00:00:46.879> and<00:00:47.649> I'm<00:00:48.649> going<00:00:48.829> to

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
you know full strength and I'm going to

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.250 
you know full strength and I'm going to
experiment<00:00:49.370> with<00:00:49.730> that<00:00:49.879> that<00:00:50.600> technique<00:00:51.079> in

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
experiment with that that technique in

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.040 
experiment with that that technique in
two<00:00:51.410> different<00:00:51.530> ways<00:00:52.030> first<00:00:53.030> I'm<00:00:53.539> going<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.809> do

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
two different ways first I'm going to do

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.860 
two different ways first I'm going to do
just<00:00:54.620> on<00:00:54.800> my<00:00:54.980> bare<00:00:55.250> nail<00:00:55.519> do<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.030> glue<00:00:56.269> I<00:00:56.539> mean

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
just on my bare nail do the glue I mean

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.840 
just on my bare nail do the glue I mean
the<00:00:57.170> glue<00:00:57.350> is<00:00:57.410> non-toxic<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.250> I'm<00:00:58.489> really<00:00:58.730> not

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
the glue is non-toxic so I'm really not

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.060 
the glue is non-toxic so I'm really not
worried<00:00:59.210> about<00:00:59.300> anything<00:00:59.800> having<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.829> do<00:01:01.039> with

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
worried about anything having to do with

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.729 
worried about anything having to do with
my<00:01:01.370> nails<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:01.969> on<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.079> other<00:01:03.230> hand<00:01:03.500> I'm<00:01:03.620> going

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
my nails and on the other hand I'm going

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.160 
my nails and on the other hand I'm going
to<00:01:03.800> do<00:01:03.980> my<00:01:04.160> regular<00:01:04.400> base<00:01:04.820> coat<00:01:05.120> and<00:01:05.330> then<00:01:05.390> do

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
to do my regular base coat and then do

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.650 
to do my regular base coat and then do
the<00:01:06.350> glue<00:01:06.770> on<00:01:06.920> top<00:01:07.130> of<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.460> just<00:01:07.730> to<00:01:07.850> see<00:01:08.060> if<00:01:08.300> it

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
the glue on top of it just to see if it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.950 
the glue on top of it just to see if it
wears<00:01:08.810> any<00:01:09.080> differently<00:01:10.330> okay<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:11.540> what<00:01:11.870> I'm

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
wears any differently okay so what I'm

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.800 
wears any differently okay so what I'm
going<00:01:12.080> to<00:01:12.140> do<00:01:12.320> is<00:01:12.560> just<00:01:12.860> take<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.880> glue<00:01:14.830> and

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
going to do is just take that glue and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.830 
going to do is just take that glue and
paint<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:17.990> very<00:01:18.229> thin<00:01:18.650> layer<00:01:18.920> if<00:01:19.369> I<00:01:20.329> can<00:01:20.509> make<00:01:20.689> it

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
paint a very thin layer if I can make it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.140 
paint a very thin layer if I can make it
then<00:01:21.049> paint<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:22.009> thin<00:01:22.040> layer<00:01:22.369> onto<00:01:22.640> my<00:01:22.939> nails

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
then paint a thin layer onto my nails

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.149 
then paint a thin layer onto my nails
just<00:01:23.299> like<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:23.780> would<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:24.020> regular<00:01:24.170> polish<00:01:24.979> or

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
just like I would a regular polish or

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.730 
just like I would a regular polish or
base<00:01:25.369> coat<00:01:25.670> after<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:27.049> apply<00:01:27.380> this<00:01:27.439> you're

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
base coat after you apply this you're

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.139 
base coat after you apply this you're
going<00:01:27.829> to<00:01:27.950> have<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.220> let<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:28.399> dry<00:01:28.520> completely

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
going to have to let it dry completely

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.300 
going to have to let it dry completely
and<00:01:29.479> it'll<00:01:30.079> go<00:01:30.229> pretty<00:01:30.409> much<00:01:30.649> clear<00:01:31.009> when<00:01:31.189> it's

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
and it'll go pretty much clear when it's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.679 
and it'll go pretty much clear when it's
dry<00:01:32.979> then<00:01:33.979> on<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.340> other<00:01:34.369> hand<00:01:34.850> I'm<00:01:35.360> going<00:01:35.600> to

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
dry then on the other hand I'm going to

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.200 
dry then on the other hand I'm going to
be<00:01:35.780> using<00:01:36.049> my<00:01:36.590> base<00:01:36.979> coat<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.549> for<00:01:37.790> me<00:01:37.970> I

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
be using my base coat and for me I

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.350 
be using my base coat and for me I
always<00:01:38.780> use<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.560> nail<00:01:40.130> teks<00:01:40.549> formula<00:01:41.119> too

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
always use this to nail teks formula too

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.940 
always use this to nail teks formula too
so<00:01:41.630> I'm<00:01:41.719> going<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:41.899> put<00:01:42.079> a<00:01:42.110> coat<00:01:42.320> of<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:42.590> let

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
so I'm going to put a coat of that let

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.130 
so I'm going to put a coat of that let
that<00:01:43.100> dry<00:01:43.430> then<00:01:44.030> I'll<00:01:44.180> do<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.540> glue<00:01:44.750> over<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
that dry then I'll do the glue over the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.319 
that dry then I'll do the glue over the
top<00:01:45.409> of<00:01:45.439> that<00:01:45.619> okay<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.820> then<00:01:47.030> we'll<00:01:47.180> come

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
top of that okay and then we'll come

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.850 
top of that okay and then we'll come
back<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.719> paint<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.049> glitter<00:01:48.290> also<00:01:48.799> to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
back and paint the glitter also to

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.980 
back and paint the glitter also to
further<00:01:49.460> work<00:01:49.759> with<00:01:49.790> this<00:01:50.119> experiment<00:01:50.840> I'm

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
further work with this experiment I'm

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.109 
further work with this experiment I'm
going<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.259> leave<00:01:51.469> this<00:01:51.920> finger<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.030> this

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
going to leave this finger and this

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.069 
going to leave this finger and this
thumb<00:01:54.250> without<00:01:55.250> any<00:01:55.579> glue<00:01:55.939> at<00:01:56.119> all<00:01:56.299> just<00:01:56.960> for

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
thumb without any glue at all just for

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.959 
thumb without any glue at all just for
my<00:01:57.200> regular<00:01:57.619> base<00:01:57.829> coat<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.399> then<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.820> way

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
my regular base coat and then that way

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.910 
my regular base coat and then that way
we<00:01:59.149> can<00:01:59.299> compare<00:01:59.689> the<00:01:59.840> wear<00:02:00.079> of<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.619> glitter

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
we can compare the wear of the glitter

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.749 
we can compare the wear of the glitter
versus<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.090> glitter<00:02:02.360> with<00:02:02.960> glue<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.159> base

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759

coat<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.560> just<00:02:06.560> glue<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.070> as<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.280> can<00:02:07.399> see

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
coat and just glue and as you can see

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.100 
coat and just glue and as you can see
this<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.880> already<00:02:08.060> going<00:02:08.539> clear<00:02:08.780> but<00:02:08.990> we're

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
this is already going clear but we're

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.960 
this is already going clear but we're
not<00:02:09.259> quite<00:02:09.410> dry<00:02:09.740> yet<00:02:09.770> so<00:02:10.220> I'm<00:02:10.640> going<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:10.850> wait

a little<00:04:40.460> bit<00:04:40.580> more<00:04:40.789> than<00:04:40.940> 48<00:04:41.509> hours<00:04:41.539> and<00:04:42.229> I

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
a little bit more than 48 hours and I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.710 
a little bit more than 48 hours and I
have<00:04:42.949> already<00:04:43.129> broken<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.789> nail<00:04:44.000> which<00:04:44.449> you

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
have already broken a nail which you

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.420 
have already broken a nail which you
can't<00:04:44.960> see<00:04:45.080> but<00:04:45.440> I<00:04:45.500> threw<00:04:45.710> some<00:04:45.889> nail<00:04:46.069> glue<00:04:46.250> on

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
can't see but I threw some nail glue on

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.350 
can't see but I threw some nail glue on
there<00:04:46.610> and<00:04:47.409> the<00:04:48.409> wear<00:04:48.650> is<00:04:48.979> actually<00:04:49.819> very<00:04:50.060> good

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
there and the wear is actually very good

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.219 
there and the wear is actually very good
okay<00:04:50.599> so<00:04:50.659> here<00:04:50.990> I<00:04:51.020> am<00:04:51.110> after<00:04:51.560> days<00:04:51.770> three<00:04:52.490> and

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
okay so here I am after days three and

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.770 
okay so here I am after days three and
there<00:04:54.229> is<00:04:54.349> not<00:04:54.530> even<00:04:54.800> a<00:04:54.889> sign<00:04:55.129> of<00:04:55.340> tip<00:04:56.300> wear<00:04:56.569> on

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
there is not even a sign of tip wear on

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.339 
there is not even a sign of tip wear on
these<00:04:57.069> so<00:04:58.270> rather<00:04:59.270> than<00:04:59.539> keep<00:04:59.750> going<00:05:00.050> for<00:05:00.229> days

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
these so rather than keep going for days

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:01.480 
these so rather than keep going for days
and<00:05:00.560> days<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:00.860> days<00:05:00.919> and<00:05:01.159> days<00:05:01.220> and<00:05:01.340> days

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
and days and days and days and days

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.890 
and days and days and days and days
we're<00:05:01.849> just<00:05:02.000> going<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.180> go<00:05:02.300> ahead<00:05:02.449> and<00:05:02.690> test

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
we're just going to go ahead and test

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.339 
we're just going to go ahead and test
this<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:03.560> see<00:05:04.009> how<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:05.090> is<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.479> remove<00:05:05.780> because

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
this and see how it is to remove because

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.379 
this and see how it is to remove because
I<00:05:06.530> think<00:05:06.590> it's<00:05:06.860> safe<00:05:07.039> to<00:05:07.069> say<00:05:07.250> that<00:05:07.699> putting

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
I think it's safe to say that putting

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.149 
I think it's safe to say that putting
the<00:05:08.539> glue<00:05:08.810> underneath<00:05:09.169> does<00:05:09.530> not<00:05:09.710> make<00:05:10.009> it

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
the glue underneath does not make it

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.610 
the glue underneath does not make it
chip<00:05:10.400> faster<00:05:10.909> if<00:05:11.180> anything<00:05:11.629> it's<00:05:11.840> making<00:05:12.500> it

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
chip faster if anything it's making it

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.749 
chip faster if anything it's making it
left<00:05:12.860> quite<00:05:13.819> a<00:05:13.849> nice<00:05:14.090> long<00:05:14.449> time<00:05:14.750> so<00:05:15.520> I'm<00:05:16.520> going

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
left quite a nice long time so I'm going

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.580 
left quite a nice long time so I'm going
to<00:05:16.789> go<00:05:16.909> ahead<00:05:17.030> and<00:05:17.360> try<00:05:17.599> and<00:05:17.719> remove<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:18.110> I'm

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
to go ahead and try and remove it I'm

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.350 
to go ahead and try and remove it I'm
just<00:05:18.770> going<00:05:18.889> to<00:05:18.949> use<00:05:19.069> this<00:05:19.370> cuticle<00:05:20.120> stick

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
just going to use this cuticle stick

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.869 
just going to use this cuticle stick
with<00:05:20.719> the<00:05:20.840> sort<00:05:21.110> of<00:05:21.169> flat<00:05:21.440> edge<00:05:21.710> and<00:05:22.610> I'm<00:05:22.729> just

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:22.879 
with the sort of flat edge and I'm just

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.580 
with the sort of flat edge and I'm just
going<00:05:23.090> to<00:05:23.210> go<00:05:23.780> on<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.020> side<00:05:24.199> and<00:05:24.379> I've<00:05:24.469> never

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
going to go on the side and I've never

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.619 
going to go on the side and I've never
even<00:05:24.710> tried<00:05:25.129> this<00:05:25.250> before<00:05:25.460> so<00:05:25.699> let's<00:05:26.270> see<00:05:26.479> how

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:26.629 
even tried this before so let's see how

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.890 
even tried this before so let's see how
it<00:05:26.719> goes<00:05:27.039> I'm<00:05:28.039> just<00:05:28.069> going<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.490> kind<00:05:28.729> of<00:05:28.900> go

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
it goes I'm just going to kind of go

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.510 
it goes I'm just going to kind of go
underneath<00:05:30.349> the<00:05:30.530> side<00:05:30.740> just<00:05:31.219> because<00:05:31.400> that's

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
underneath the side just because that's

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.379 
underneath the side just because that's
the<00:05:31.669> way<00:05:31.789> I<00:05:31.879> would<00:05:32.000> normally<00:05:32.270> do<00:05:32.629> it<00:05:33.789> and<00:05:34.789> kind

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
the way I would normally do it and kind

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.870 
the way I would normally do it and kind
of

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.540 

just<00:05:40.570> see<00:05:40.750> if<00:05:40.840> this<00:05:40.960> peels<00:05:41.290> off<00:05:41.530> look<00:05:42.370> at<00:05:42.490> that

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
just see if this peels off look at that

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:49.170 
just see if this peels off look at that
you<00:05:42.850> guys<00:05:44.640> yeah<00:05:45.640> I'd<00:05:45.940> say<00:05:46.360> it<00:05:46.690> was<00:05:46.930> about<00:05:48.180> the

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
you guys yeah I'd say it was about the

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.060

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.330 
in my life that is insane let's go ahead
and<00:05:55.420> try<00:05:55.660> now<00:05:55.810> the<00:05:55.870> side<00:05:56.200> that<00:05:56.410> has<00:05:56.650> the<00:05:56.680> base

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
and try now the side that has the base

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.440 
and try now the side that has the base
coat<00:05:58.620> underneath<00:05:59.620> it<00:05:59.890> so<00:06:00.760> these<00:06:00.940> three<00:06:01.300> nails

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
coat underneath it so these three nails

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.340 
coat underneath it so these three nails
are<00:06:01.840> base<00:06:02.620> coat<00:06:03.040> and<00:06:03.400> then<00:06:03.760> glue<00:06:04.150> you<00:06:05.110> know<00:06:05.200> my

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
are base coat and then glue you know my

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.020 
are base coat and then glue you know my
normal<00:06:05.710> strengthener<00:06:06.340> so<00:06:06.610> let's<00:06:06.790> go<00:06:06.940> ahead

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
normal strengthener so let's go ahead

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.210 
normal strengthener so let's go ahead
and<00:06:07.240> try<00:06:07.360> that<00:06:07.510> and<00:06:07.570> see<00:06:07.870> if<00:06:07.900> it's<00:06:08.170> any<00:06:08.530> easier

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
and try that and see if it's any easier

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:22.750 
and try that and see if it's any easier
or<00:06:09.490> harder<00:06:09.520> to<00:06:10.390> get<00:06:10.510> off

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.600

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
of hard to tell it looks like it's

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.530 
of hard to tell it looks like it's
actually<00:06:35.040> a<00:06:35.280> little<00:06:35.460> bit<00:06:35.610> better<00:06:35.790> without<00:06:36.030> the

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
actually a little bit better without the

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.380 
actually a little bit better without the
base<00:06:36.780> coat<00:06:37.050> underneath<00:06:37.290> it<00:06:37.590> and<00:06:37.950> now<00:06:38.910> I'll<00:06:39.060> try

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
base coat underneath it and now I'll try

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.390 
base coat underneath it and now I'll try
to<00:06:39.450> get<00:06:39.930> under<00:06:40.170> it<00:06:40.200> where<00:06:40.530> I<00:06:40.560> did<00:06:40.890> not<00:06:41.040> use<00:06:41.250> any

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
to get under it where I did not use any

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:59.100 
to get under it where I did not use any
glue<00:06:41.700> at<00:06:41.820> all

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.850 

it<00:06:59.710> peels<00:07:00.040> off<00:07:00.250> but<00:07:00.550> not<00:07:00.700> quite<00:07:01.030> as<00:07:01.180> easily<00:07:04.860> and

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
it peels off but not quite as easily and

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.950 
it peels off but not quite as easily and
I<00:07:06.340> can't<00:07:06.670> really<00:07:06.880> tell<00:07:07.180> looks<00:07:07.630> like<00:07:07.780> there

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960
