00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.660
 hello then we're going to need a folder 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.180
 I know how they are left in their country but good 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.129
 I already know them as folders if you 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.520
 they can weave them much better 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:21.750
 let's use balloons and this glue 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.939
 which is special for hardening fabrics 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.240
 also a broach to apply the 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.910
 glue can use a tablet 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.269
 to apply the glue and not 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.519
 stain on no side or equal a bowl 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:39.010
 can put in here glue and 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.440
 then put in the folder also go 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.350
 to use accessories to decorate in 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.570
 this case slats if you want to put a 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.180
 candles can use this type of candles 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.399
 that is used with batteries already had them 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.270
 shown before they are sold in all 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.880
 stores that sell everything to the dollar 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.660
 and then, let's get to work, let's start 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.500
 our balloon depends on how big 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.870
 they want your business if they want it more more 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.730
 small then nothing else always in a little 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.570
 minus the globe 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.390
 well let's put our folder 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.250
 in here in the bowl and let's start 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.250
 to throw the glue 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.180
 and good with a brochita let's go 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.240
 completely soaking up our 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.060
 folder in this way if you 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.780
 they want to do on the little board what 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.780
 can they do there 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.020
 the joke is to make sure that our 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.730
 carpetita is completely soaked 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.980
 of glue 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.490
 and since our folder is 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.220
 mento strip completely filled going 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.160
 to take our balloon let's put in 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.800
 a glass for it to hold and we're going to 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.620
 put on the folder we are going to 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.620
 extend very well we do it well 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.749
 and let's go we are extending the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.510
 that fits very well perfectly 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.970
 extended 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.400
 A) Yes 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.010
 and well now we just have to wait 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.500
 how many hours if you want to leave it all 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.170
 night is much better so that it is 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.690
 completely dry good I left it already 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.510
 all night the little folder look 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.910
 completely hard and now with a 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.150
 tack or with a needle what you guys 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.010
 have they are going to blow up their balloon as well 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.450
 I very carefully gave me a lot 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:47.080
 fear you explode and look and notice now 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.959
 we have ready our bowl cited and how 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.970
 the balloon was full of glue and 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.790
 look, the bowl is ready 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.640
 decorate it and so they put what 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.550
 you want we are going to burst the other 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.250
 balloon even if they do have you 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.520
 larger folders can 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.700
 use as for fruit bowls is also 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.890
 very good idea to put logical fruit the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.100
 carpetita has to be much bigger 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.950
 and here we have these 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:23.130
 ready to decorate them now let's 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.500
 take our bar and here in these 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.080
 openings of our folder let's go 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.110
 accommodating our bar in this case 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.840
 I'm going to put the target here 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.140
 See how our people were 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.870
 transits were super beautiful are going 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.430
 to see very beautiful decorating your house or 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.450
 You can also use them to 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.330
 give them away 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.180
 and the last touch here to this I'm going to 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.090
 put a candle I'll turn it on 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.640
 little candle puts it in and look 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.760
 how nice they really look good 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.769
 tender friends I loved this idea the 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.440
 truth and I love to share it 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.530

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:13.069
