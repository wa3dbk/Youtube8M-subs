00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
two we defended against him and we're

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.520 
two we defended against him and we're
just<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> take<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> look<00:01:35.909> at<00:01:36.150> those<00:01:36.659> two

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
just going to take a look at those two

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.359 
just going to take a look at those two
battles<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.509> see<00:01:39.509> kind<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> strategies<00:01:41.220> he

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
battles to see kind of the strategies he

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.460 
battles to see kind of the strategies he
took<00:01:41.610> each<00:01:41.850> time<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> first<00:01:43.200> time<00:01:43.380> he

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
took each time so the first time he

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.260 
took each time so the first time he
comes<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> right<00:01:44.159> side<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> just

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
comes in on the right side and the just

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.810 
comes in on the right side and the just
a<00:01:45.360> classic<00:01:45.689> zucca<00:01:46.259> heavy<00:01:46.439> rate<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:46.979> duka<00:01:47.640> heavy

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
a classic zucca heavy rate or duka heavy

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.789 
a classic zucca heavy rate or duka heavy
raid<00:01:48.090> which<00:01:48.270> i<00:01:48.479> think<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.170> best<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.649> this

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
raid which i think is the best at this

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.690 
raid which i think is the best at this
at<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.070> level<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.990> our<00:01:52.920> defenses<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.549> you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
at this level and our defenses as you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.670 
at this level and our defenses as you
can<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:53.970> they're<00:01:54.119> pretty<00:01:55.020> high<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:55.290> this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
can see they're pretty high for this

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.319 
can see they're pretty high for this
level<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.219> he's<00:01:56.460> got<00:01:56.670> around<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> same<00:01:57.180> level

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
level but he's got around the same level

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.690 
level but he's got around the same level
troops<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:57.899> do<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.170> our<00:01:59.130> defense<00:01:59.399> has<00:01:59.490> just

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
troops as we do and our defense has just

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340 
troops as we do and our defense has just
do<00:01:59.820> too<00:02:00.000> much<00:02:00.149> damage<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.630> his<00:02:00.719> heavies<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.049> we

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
do too much damage to his heavies and we

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.450 
do too much damage to his heavies and we
beat<00:02:01.590> him<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.119> as<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> second<00:02:03.899> raid<00:02:04.460> he

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
beat him and as for the second raid he

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.859 
beat him and as for the second raid he
tries<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> different<00:02:05.820> approach<00:02:06.299> he<00:02:06.540> comes<00:02:06.719> in

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
tries a different approach he comes in

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.330 
tries a different approach he comes in
from<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> left<00:02:07.320> side<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.770> since<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
from the left side and since we have the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.699 
from the left side and since we have the
symmetrical<00:02:08.879> base<00:02:09.090> layout<00:02:09.360> right<00:02:09.629> now<00:02:09.840> I

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
symmetrical base layout right now I

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.619 
symmetrical base layout right now I
really<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.970> because<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.300> doesn't<00:02:12.540> really

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
really like it because it doesn't really

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.760 
really like it because it doesn't really
matter<00:02:12.900> what

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
matter what

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.810 
matter what
you<00:02:13.830> do<00:02:13.950> if<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.160> come<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.400> from<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.670> middle

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
you do if you come in from the middle

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.140 
you do if you come in from the middle
there's<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.540> lot<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.080> firepower<00:02:17.150> raining

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
there's just a lot of firepower raining

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.030 
there's just a lot of firepower raining
down<00:02:18.300> on<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.570> middle<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.020> base<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.590> if

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
down on the middle of the base and if

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.190 
down on the middle of the base and if
you<00:02:20.220> come<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.520> from<00:02:20.670> one<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:20.940> sides<00:02:21.210> same

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
you come in from one of the sides same

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.340 
you come in from one of the sides same
thing<00:02:23.450> he<00:02:24.450> came<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.750> from<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.990> right<00:02:25.110> side

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
thing he came in from the right side

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.900 
thing he came in from the right side
first<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.800> obviously<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.460> same<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.820> the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
first and obviously it's the same on the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.300 
first and obviously it's the same on the
left<00:02:26.940> hand<00:02:27.270> side<00:02:27.440> all<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.680> our<00:02:28.770> towers<00:02:29.130> are

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
left hand side all of our towers are

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.750 
left hand side all of our towers are
equal<00:02:29.700> levels<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.800> he<00:02:31.800> just<00:02:31.980> gets<00:02:32.190> decimated

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
equal levels so he just gets decimated

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.610 
equal levels so he just gets decimated
from<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> left-hand<00:02:33.420> side<00:02:33.510> as<00:02:33.750> well<00:02:36.350> again<00:02:37.350> he

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
from the left-hand side as well again he

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.260 
from the left-hand side as well again he
almost<00:02:38.100> takes<00:02:38.310> out<00:02:38.460> her<00:02:38.550> headquarters<00:02:39.060> and

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
almost takes out her headquarters and

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.120 
almost takes out her headquarters and
again<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> third<00:02:39.900> time<00:02:40.140> he<00:02:40.290> does<00:02:40.530> but<00:02:40.950> that's

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
again the third time he does but that's

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.560 
again the third time he does but that's

we're just going to be working on those
defenses<00:02:47.910> getting<00:02:48.360> those<00:02:48.510> metals<00:02:48.870> up<00:02:49.050> i<00:02:49.170> want

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
defenses getting those metals up i want

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.010 
defenses getting those metals up i want
to<00:02:49.440> get<00:02:49.500> 300<00:02:50.010> metals<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.430> i<00:02:50.580> said<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.540> stay

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
to get 300 metals like i said so stay

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.610 
to get 300 metals like i said so stay
tuned<00:02:52.290> guys<00:02:52.500> keep<00:02:52.890> watching<00:02:54.380> once<00:02:55.380> we<00:02:55.530> get

those 300 metals hopefully uh it's a big

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.810 
those 300 metals hopefully uh it's a big
challenge<00:02:58.650> for<00:02:58.950> us<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.280> keep<00:02:59.400> up<00:02:59.580> with<00:02:59.730> the
