00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
of it as you can see in because holes in

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.590 
of it as you can see in because holes in
the<00:00:58.920> back<00:00:59.070> instead<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.670> hole<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.059> instead

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the back instead of a hole and instead

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.750 
the back instead of a hole and instead
of<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> big<00:01:01.410> opening<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.370> makes<00:01:02.609> it

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
of a like a big opening it makes it

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.160 
of a like a big opening it makes it
really<00:01:03.090> compact<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.250> really<00:01:05.250> sturdy<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.210> as

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
you can see you can just slide us apart

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.260 
you can see you can just slide us apart
it's<00:01:10.409> quite<00:01:10.590> hard<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.760> where<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.090> won't

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it's quite hard to know where it won't

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.240 
it's quite hard to know where it won't
happen<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.840> your<00:01:12.960> pocket<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.619> then<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.130> can

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
look at the reeds and that might be

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.929 
look at the reeds and that might be
useful<00:01:16.040> if<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.250> want<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:17.670> remove

cover and in here you can see the reeds
they<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.579> actually<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.360> Hawk<00:01:31.290> here

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
they are actually I have this Hawk here

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.050 
they are actually I have this Hawk here
that<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:33.500> hear<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.250> actually<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.880> has

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
that I can hear it actually it has

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.899 
that I can hear it actually it has
smaller<00:01:36.450> reeds<00:01:38.150> shorter<00:01:39.150> reeds<00:01:39.329> then<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
smaller reeds shorter reeds then the

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.679 
smaller reeds shorter reeds then the
Horner<00:01:42.140> marine<00:01:43.140> man<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:44.310> still<00:01:44.939> they<00:01:45.540> have

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
Horner marine man but still they have

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.380 
Horner marine man but still they have
the<00:01:45.840> same<00:01:46.049> thickness<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.740> think<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:48.000> really

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the same thickness I think it's really

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.920 
the same thickness I think it's really
similar<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:48.869> least<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.930> still

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
similar at least so they have this still

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.440 
similar at least so they have this still
a<00:01:51.960> quite<00:01:52.350> broad<00:01:52.619> sound<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.340> least<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
a quite broad sound at least for the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.160 
a quite broad sound at least for the
size<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.350> hear<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.930> here's

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
size of it if you can hear and here's

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.920 
size of it if you can hear and here's
the<00:01:58.770> same<00:01:59.009> key<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.790> see<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.450> marine<00:02:00.630> man

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.840 

this<00:02:03.410> is<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.590> bit<00:02:03.770> louder<00:02:04.010> and<00:02:04.370> this<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.700> bit

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
this is a bit louder and this is a bit

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.250 
this is a bit louder and this is a bit
fake<00:02:05.030> of<00:02:05.210> course<00:02:05.450> because<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.840> got<00:02:05.930> longer

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
fake of course because it got longer

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.760 
fake of course because it got longer
reads<00:02:06.440> but<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.220> still<00:02:07.430> is<00:02:07.930> it<00:02:08.930> works<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.470> mean<00:02:09.740> I

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
reads but it still is it works I mean I

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.950 
reads but it still is it works I mean I
can<00:02:10.010> listen<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.369> play<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:10.880> one<00:02:11.090> like<00:02:11.810> an

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
can listen to play this one like an

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.010 
can listen to play this one like an
ordinary<00:02:12.530> armonica<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.340> as<00:02:13.460> you<00:02:13.550> can<00:02:13.700> see<00:02:14.020> it

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
ordinary armonica and as you can see it

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.000 
ordinary armonica and as you can see it
is<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.470> lot<00:02:15.800> smaller<00:02:16.190> than<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.990> than<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
is a lot smaller than the than the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.420 
is a lot smaller than the than the
Marine<00:02:19.370> Band<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.930> smaller<00:02:20.930> than<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.430> special

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
Marine Band and smaller than the special

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.030 
Marine Band and smaller than the special
xx<00:02:22.700> as<00:02:22.790> well<00:02:22.970> but<00:02:23.720> if<00:02:23.900> anything<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
xx as well but if anything is that the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.300 
xx as well but if anything is that the
holes<00:02:25.280> are<00:02:25.910> actually<00:02:26.440> then<00:02:27.440> it's<00:02:27.770> not<00:02:28.010> not

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
holes are actually then it's not not

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.160 
holes are actually then it's not not
actually<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.820> takes<00:02:29.300> more<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.810> house<00:02:29.930> take

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
actually it takes more the house take

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.110 
actually it takes more the house take
more<00:02:30.380> place<00:02:30.620> because<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.460> here<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.790> was<00:02:31.910> it

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
more place because it here it was it

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.070 
more place because it here it was it
space<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.750> between

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
space in between

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.830 
space in between
hey<00:02:33.710> it's<00:02:33.830> like<00:02:34.040> no<00:02:34.850> space<00:02:35.120> at<00:02:35.270> all<00:02:35.330> nice<00:02:35.630> got

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
hey it's like no space at all nice got

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.830 
hey it's like no space at all nice got
10<00:02:36.530> holes<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:38.150> it's<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.390> same<00:02:38.570> thing<00:02:38.750> as

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
10 holes and it's the same thing as

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.900 
10 holes and it's the same thing as
always<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.650> diatonic<00:02:40.430> harmonica<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.760> can

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
always the diatonic harmonica you can

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.310 
always the diatonic harmonica you can
pay<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.120> scales<00:02:47.450> as<00:02:47.600> always<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:48.080> this<00:02:48.170> the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
pay the scales as always on this the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.590 
pay the scales as always on this the
same<00:02:48.530> terms<00:02:49.120> though<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:52.190> one<00:02:52.400> uncovers<00:02:53.390> the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
same terms though this one uncovers the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.540 
same terms though this one uncovers the
holes<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.410> one<00:02:54.620> all<00:02:54.770> covers<00:02:55.160> eight<00:02:55.310> of

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
holes of this one all covers eight of

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.600 
holes of this one all covers eight of
these<00:02:55.670> holes<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.150> that's<00:02:56.810> because<00:02:57.200> they're

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
these holes and that's because they're

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.130 
these holes and that's because they're
narrow<00:02:58.610> of<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.850> spacing<00:02:59.270> in<00:02:59.360> between<00:02:59.390> the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
narrow of the spacing in between the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.220 
narrow of the spacing in between the
notes<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:01.370> it's<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.240> bit<00:03:02.390> hard<00:03:02.420> in<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.960> first

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
notes so it's a bit hard in the first

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.590 
notes so it's a bit hard in the first
place<00:03:03.470> like<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.800> first<00:03:03.980> two<00:03:04.400> four<00:03:05.000> five<00:03:05.270> times

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
place like the first two four five times

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.720 
place like the first two four five times
to<00:03:05.900> play<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.950> might<00:03:07.130> be<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.310> bit<00:03:07.400> hard<00:03:07.580> but

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
to play it it might be a bit hard but

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.130 
to play it it might be a bit hard but
then<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:07.940> actually<00:03:08.060> learn<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.660> use<00:03:08.780> control

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
then you actually learn to use control

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:19.320 
then you actually learn to use control
one<00:03:09.320> tone<00:03:09.590> at<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:09.800> time

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.200 

and<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:20.620> on<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:21.910> would<00:03:22.090> definitely

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
and so on and so I would definitely

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.390 
and so on and so I would definitely
recommend<00:03:22.540> this<00:03:22.900> one<00:03:23.080> as<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.860> only<00:03:24.040> costs

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
recommend this one as it only costs

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.220 
recommend this one as it only costs
about<00:03:24.550> eight<00:03:25.000> seven<00:03:26.640> eight<00:03:27.640> or<00:03:28.510> seven<00:03:28.810> pounds

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
about eight seven eight or seven pounds

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.880 
about eight seven eight or seven pounds
probably<00:03:30.040> like<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:31.600> highest<00:03:31.960> ten<00:03:32.320> dollars<00:03:32.680> is

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
probably like the highest ten dollars is

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.070 
probably like the highest ten dollars is
really<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.640> neat<00:03:33.970> little<00:03:34.120> top<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:34.600> for<00:03:34.990> the

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
really a neat little top and for the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.800 
really a neat little top and for the
price<00:03:35.290> it's<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.980> bargain<00:03:36.460> definitely<00:03:37.060> comes<00:03:37.720> in

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
price it's a bargain definitely comes in

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.360 
price it's a bargain definitely comes in
a<00:03:37.900> small<00:03:39.060> cartoon<00:03:40.060> cotton<00:03:40.720> cotton<00:03:41.370> that's

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
a small cartoon cotton cotton that's

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.580 
a small cartoon cotton cotton that's
actually<00:03:42.820> quite<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:44.110> full<00:03:45.040> it's<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:47.260> like<00:03:47.530> a

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
actually quite it full it's it's like a

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.840 
actually quite it full it's it's like a
covers<00:03:49.230> yeah<00:03:50.230> it's<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.890> place<00:03:51.100> where<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.370> have

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
covers yeah it's a place where you have

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.010 
covers yeah it's a place where you have
the<00:03:52.000> harmonic<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.540> can<00:03:52.690> actually<00:03:52.810> have

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
the harmonic and you can actually have

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.180 
the harmonic and you can actually have
it<00:03:53.080> in<00:03:53.140> your<00:03:53.260> pocket<00:03:53.530> because<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:53.950> more

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190

study than you think though I actually
accidentally<00:03:57.850> laundered<00:03:58.660> mine<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.860> mine<00:04:00.190> is

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
accidentally laundered mine so mine is

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.490 
accidentally laundered mine so mine is
broken<00:04:00.460> but<00:04:01.390> this<00:04:01.780> one<00:04:01.960> is<00:04:02.080> whole<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.440> I

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
broken but this one is whole and I

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.200 
broken but this one is whole and I
actually<00:04:02.620> learned<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.040> as<00:04:03.370> well<00:04:03.580> it<00:04:03.850> was<00:04:04.000> in

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
actually learned this as well it was in

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.170 
actually learned this as well it was in
the<00:04:04.420> laundry<00:04:05.410> machine<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:06.610> still<00:04:06.850> works

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
the laundry machine and it still works

you can play some nice things and
especially<00:04:11.860> if<00:04:12.220> you<00:04:12.340> play<00:04:12.550> with<00:04:21.330> then<00:04:22.330> it's

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
especially if you play with then it's

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.780 
especially if you play with then it's
really<00:04:22.690> then<00:04:23.320> it's<00:04:23.500> doing<00:04:23.830> what<00:04:23.950> it<00:04:24.070> should<00:04:24.100> so

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
really then it's doing what it should so

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.450 
really then it's doing what it should so
if<00:04:25.300> not<00:04:25.510> I<00:04:25.900> wouldn't<00:04:26.650> have<00:04:26.800> it<00:04:26.919> as<00:04:27.010> a<00:04:27.130> standard

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
if not I wouldn't have it as a standard

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.590 
if not I wouldn't have it as a standard
heart<00:04:27.669> but<00:04:27.880> if<00:04:28.000> you're<00:04:28.120> going<00:04:28.330> on<00:04:28.450> a<00:04:28.540> vacation

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
or something if you don't want to break

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.060 
or something if you don't want to break

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
then you can definitely use this one no

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.540 
then you can definitely use this one no
it's<00:04:33.370> I<00:04:33.460> won<00:04:33.580> in<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.730> pocket<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:35.550> would

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
it's I won in the pocket so I would

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.930 
it's I won in the pocket so I would
recommend<00:04:36.940> it<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.390> comes<00:04:37.600> in<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:37.900> in<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.490> rhesus

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
recommend it it comes in a in the rhesus
