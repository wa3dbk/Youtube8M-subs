00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.290
 yes and we come here to a round 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.549
 call of duty one software is 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.019
 usually not on my channel 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.030
 but many people have got it 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.349
 wanted and that's why I thought so 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.270
 I'll just start it h , me 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.529
 also had problems with purchasing power 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.750
 a game capture card you see 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.130
 I again attempt it so 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.840
 will come back soon 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.160
 I'm just waiting for the second micro 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.310
 here because here is this little pin 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.420
 micro and yes if the second one is there then 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.160
 which in any case with Patrick still 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.480
 can continue recording and yes now 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.690
 enjoy that wonderful in me 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.010
 troja about profile without me would be one 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.540
 play bit multiplayer and easy 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.910
 so let me think about it because 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.350
 many people said hey you have yes 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.490
 also get a call of duty transporter 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.780
 I also posted on install 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.830
 there you can i have here in the picture 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.360
 apply and yes because I have that 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.100
 many people have said to install 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.960
 oh play sometimes in one software and 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.690
 I thought so well then do 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.470
 you simply times and now just need to 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.940
 first play with the multiplayer online 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.170
 the character that I have by the way 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.660
 I did not change that way I know 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.310
 not if that is standard by default 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.470
 Of course you will become my skin color 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.080
 then see you soon 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.080
 thank you and thank you all posts 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.560
 He was like that and I wanted it 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.830
 play a bit here what is playing 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.610
 because here 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.920
 the controller definitely makes 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.150
 noises when she hears through my micro 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.890
 everybody does that and I only have a decent look 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.120
 Annoying but I just play something 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.230
 I am in a team deathmatch 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.250
 not very good in console shooter 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.270
 that's why you're going to make me pretty 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.970
 I am already seeing an upgrade 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.340
 extremely bad even in consoles 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.290
 shooter that we have a very very funny 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.060
 for you I think you can namely 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.890
 Now here you get to know me like this 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.620
 bit fed as he hears there 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.420
 can jump double jumps is 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.650
 namely a super funny thing 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:05.270
 somehow that's not it at all 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:06.890
 more as far as I was'm so bad because 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.539
 good for the track to die again 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.539
 was every time 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.750
 I can drop that down here 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.910
 I am actually falling I am like that 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:28.800
 mega par excellence for the well-stegner 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:30.210
 900 meters jo jo ok sunday forward 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.560
 I have made it seemingly I know 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.700
 not if that is now in the vision deschner 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.670
 was in front 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.050
 but i definitely want it first 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.190
 here to the opponent find because end has 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.880
 I always feel in call of duty 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.880
 if I run in to 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.140
 i'm so bad without joke so i 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.490
 I think enemies would not work anymore 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.470
 I have the meeting with the parents 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.390
 would 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.040
 die die dies I hate so weapons 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.030
 No one has to compete, I think 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.850
 ever change directly to this 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.780
 laser gun just longer suspicious okay 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.220
 if I equal good times so 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.470
 he'll be playing it , too 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.970
 Again, I think you do not think you know 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.080
 Not like a team at eight 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.180
 For a few minutes that was a try 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.590
 the opponent 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.740
 but that is also relatively match that 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.970
 so i could do it well 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.870
 but first made a kill 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.400
 better than no word 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:24.420
 and there was someone just me quite 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:26.340
 exactly as you can you yes I am 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.420
 so bad without joke I'm really the one 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.770
 worst call of duty game though 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.730
 now also fits the bidding 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.430
 through these weapons 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.170
 that's no call of duty anymore 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.760
 He briefly took the thing out and then 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.230
 overheat again or whatever 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.950
 he that made cool short and powerful 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.950
 then it goes on 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.940
 I gave you my retina 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.580
 So it was at least believes hit 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.250
 I do not even talk about it 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.290
 strong from out but so now i want to 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.500
 like to kill another enemy with mine 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.160
 ultra cash laser gun where are the 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.160
 opponents are hot opponents 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.550
 at least it's done for that 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.890
 My consumption is really bad 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.510
 That's not so bad for the beginning 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.220
 I mean some can always do that 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.319
 even better, but I feel that way 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.060
 I'm not even the ultimate wo 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.709
 That's it 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:20.549
 Stop talking was yes, yes, okay 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.139
 a killed wonderful then works 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:31.590
 asks, I'll talk then one 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:33.270
 postprocessing see what's up with call 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.310
 of duty age what is that? 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.990
 Since when is aliens here from 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:43.229
 shoot down their spaceships day 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.520
 old what did you see that all 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.440
 what were the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.190
 I could use this pump gun here 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.410
 or what is important you can do 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.700
 Yes , I have the power of iron 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.780
 you can just shoot grenades 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.340
 from the wrist so loosely the whole 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.650
 world is made of iron you in this 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.280
 time is a bit synonymous the story 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.950
 played 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.229
 oh yes I am such a praise of all of you 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.060
 I played the story a bit and 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.250
 there is something about korea or something 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.800
 may north korea south korea and so is one 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.440
 very cool thing I am the 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.840
 Pumpgun master at pump are by the way 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.250
 the absolute weapons in the computer will 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.460
 always planned for when someone with 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.650
 pump guns running around's hope that me 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.840
 but now do not have one I would have times 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.030
 because fans are really happy 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.550
 or home is somebody what the distance 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.270
 the course is relatively little was 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.010
 now super smart felix we find ourselves 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.800
 Generally not so the shooter so 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.760
 I'm not so good at mucking not 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.870
 after a glimpse of two I am whole 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.120
 Well, I have my style too 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.860
 made with cable and patrick and 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.990
 Again, I am relatively well in it 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.220
 really only on the pc so konsole 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.090
 It's not like I'm the best 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.250
 console is not so my mine 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.760
 Absolute thing because I have somehow 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.169
 that with the consumption not so out yes 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.389
 apparently also a bit 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.169
 not so bad at all though 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.900
 definitely does not condemn me 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.909
 if I'm too bad here or that 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.129
 needed know for this wonderful 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.419
 Do not own shooter because I'm not 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.539
 so the shooter human i have not got there 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.029
 I do not know that much 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.710
 also no call of duty channel 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:21.699
 That's why I'm not that great 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.650
 but at least I have it first 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.050
 that was relatively lukewarm he has 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.490
 The little one did not get me 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.110
 limit driver was so cool 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.569
 now with the pistol still killed something 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.979
 do you have the weapon a bar 27 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.539
 interesting okay because it has seemed to me 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.889
 neat shot at the feet 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.969
 maybe he has my shoes 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.400
 I consider myself yesterday 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:41.740
 asked zalando is in fact even 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.729
 not even that quaintly whimsical 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.699
 not even that weird because 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:50.949
 they were already me so I am the 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:53.919
 shooting in the eighth victory was that now 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.990
 really four minutes jo ok then I would 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.089
 let's say I think that's it 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.620
 what is the fine click online 

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:00.339
 I'm there I thought so when the 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.279
 to know enemies 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:05.080
 that's why the little ruth bbc runs for the 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:06.699
 By the way, the people in playstation 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.050
 network can i do not accept you because 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:10.149
 I have that is because somehow 800 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.979
 request or something felt and me 

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:15.279
 basically take people but one 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:16.779
 Gameplay of 18 9 is quite okay for that 

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:18.189
 that I'm not so special in the console 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:18.520
 good in there with opel again noises 

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:23.139
 made 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.000
 the noises heard again now 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.680
 that sounds ok then i would 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.939
 say if it liked that anyway 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.710
 a privat hungarn if you are more core 

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:31.120
 want to see tier one software then he 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.710
 write me that and in the comments 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.499
 and I would say that's it for today 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.499
 Like us next time and tools
