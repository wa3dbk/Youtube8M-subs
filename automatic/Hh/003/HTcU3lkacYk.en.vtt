00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
lightning damage build your gonna be one

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.889 
lightning damage build your gonna be one
in<00:01:59.219> building<00:01:59.579> lightning<00:02:00.149> damage<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.719> as<00:02:00.780> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
in building lightning damage so as you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.740 
in building lightning damage so as you
can<00:02:01.020> see<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.619> my<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:02.520> Kim<00:02:02.759> Lau<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.360> have

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
can see it on my one Kim Lau I have

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.149 
can see it on my one Kim Lau I have
twenty<00:02:04.140> three<00:02:04.320> percent<00:02:04.439> more<00:02:04.799> lightning

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
twenty three percent more lightning

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.359 
twenty three percent more lightning
damage<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.299> have<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:07.020> amulet<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:07.890> gives<00:02:08.220> me

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
damage and I have a amulet that gives me

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.760 
damage and I have a amulet that gives me
twenty<00:02:08.849> percent<00:02:09.209> more<00:02:09.450> blinding<00:02:09.959> damage<00:02:10.319> so

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
twenty percent more blinding damage so

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.740 
twenty percent more blinding damage so
this<00:02:11.009> actually<00:02:11.190> stuck<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> actually<00:02:12.420> have

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
this actually stuck so I actually have

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.080 
this actually stuck so I actually have

that i've got i can efficiently do
torment<00:02:28.660> one<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.730> final<00:02:30.940> start<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.599> sort

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
of a secondary stat that you're going to

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.089 
of a secondary stat that you're going to
be<00:02:33.549> looking<00:02:33.730> for<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.599> if<00:02:34.810> i<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.140> take<00:02:35.349> off<00:02:35.620> one

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
be looking for so if i just take off one

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.190 
be looking for so if i just take off one
with<00:02:36.670> everything<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.390> moment<00:02:37.690> you'll<00:02:37.870> see

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
with everything in the moment you'll see

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.820 
with everything in the moment you'll see
i'm<00:02:39.129> stacking<00:02:39.760> fire<00:02:40.120> resistance<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.379> when

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
i'm stacking fire resistance so when

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.580 
i'm stacking fire resistance so when
you're<00:02:41.950> building<00:02:42.129> gear<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:44.049> want<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.379> stack

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
you're building gear you want to stack

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.100 
you're building gear you want to stack
one<00:02:44.950> resistance<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:46.569> with<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.840> build<00:02:47.019> you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
one resistance and with the build you

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.750 
one resistance and with the build you
want<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.290> put<00:02:47.410> one<00:02:47.620> with<00:02:47.799> everything<00:02:48.010> on<00:02:48.489> and

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
want to put one with everything on and

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.729 
want to put one with everything on and
you'll<00:02:49.239> automatically<00:02:49.989> get<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.440> one

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
you'll automatically get that one

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.580 
you'll automatically get that one
resistance<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.630> every<00:02:52.630> single<00:02:53.079> bit<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.319> your

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
resistance on every single bit of your

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.680 
resistance on every single bit of your
gear<00:02:54.090> obviously<00:02:55.090> that's<00:02:55.299> not<00:02:55.390> going<00:02:55.599> to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
gear obviously that's not going to

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.350 
gear obviously that's not going to
happen<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:56.920> get<00:02:57.220> resist<00:02:57.790> wall<00:02:58.090> as

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
happen so you can get resist wall as

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.839 
happen so you can get resist wall as
well<00:02:59.129> because<00:03:00.129> it<00:03:00.280> still<00:03:00.610> provides

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
well because it still provides

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.990 
well because it still provides
resistance<00:03:01.390> towards<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:03.160> they're<00:03:03.430> just<00:03:03.760> kind

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
resistance towards so they're just kind

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.850 
resistance towards so they're just kind
of<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.180> means<00:03:04.450> that's<00:03:04.930> another<00:03:05.410> one<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:05.680> you

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
of the means that's another one that you

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.490 
of the means that's another one that you
might<00:03:06.040> want<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.340> get<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.610> movement<00:03:07.000> speed<00:03:07.510> is

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
might want to get is movement speed is

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.970 
might want to get is movement speed is
it<00:03:08.739> will<00:03:08.829> be<00:03:08.950> increase<00:03:09.519> your<00:03:09.849> run<00:03:10.569> times<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.590> if

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
it will be increase your run times so if

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.059 
it will be increase your run times so if
you<00:03:12.519> get<00:03:12.700> around<00:03:13.230> 25<00:03:14.230> which<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.829> cap

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
you get around 25 which is the cap

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.390 
you get around 25 which is the cap
movement<00:03:15.610> speed<00:03:16.290> before<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:18.040> put

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
movement speed before you put

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.970 
movement speed before you put
fleet-footed<00:03:18.730> on<00:03:19.359> you<00:03:19.989> know<00:03:20.049> you'll<00:03:20.709> be<00:03:20.859> able

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
fleet-footed on you know you'll be able

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.789 
fleet-footed on you know you'll be able
to<00:03:21.190> do<00:03:21.340> efficient<00:03:21.970> runs<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.569> lot<00:03:22.900> faster<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.620> it

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
to do efficient runs a lot faster and it

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.590 
to do efficient runs a lot faster and it
actually<00:03:23.950> increases<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.579> overall<00:03:24.819> run<00:03:25.299> times

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
actually increases the overall run times

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.660 
actually increases the overall run times
of<00:03:25.930> your<00:03:26.139> runs<00:03:26.319> so<00:03:26.889> they're<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.190> main<00:03:27.310> stats

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
of your runs so they're the main stats

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.849 
of your runs so they're the main stats
now<00:03:27.910> we're<00:03:28.090> going<00:03:28.569> to<00:03:28.660> look<00:03:28.720> for<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.349> the

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
now we're going to look for is the

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.559 
now we're going to look for is the
paragon<00:03:30.250> point<00:03:30.519> distribution<00:03:30.700> oh<00:03:31.239> really

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
paragon point distribution oh really

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.569 
paragon point distribution oh really
nothing<00:03:32.139> to<00:03:32.230> change<00:03:32.440> or<00:03:32.829> you<00:03:33.010> want<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.370> one

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
nothing to change or you want the one

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.309 
nothing to change or you want the one
percent<00:03:33.940> movement<00:03:34.359> speed<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:36.040> can

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
percent movement speed so that you can

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.780 
percent movement speed so that you can
do<00:03:38.319> runs<00:03:38.560> faster<00:03:39.069> just<00:03:39.280> increase<00:03:39.639> your

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
do runs faster just increase your

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.150 
do runs faster just increase your
movement<00:03:40.090> speed<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.359> little<00:03:40.540> bit<00:03:40.829> dexterity<00:03:41.829> is

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
movement speed a little bit dexterity is

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.780 
movement speed a little bit dexterity is
humane<00:03:42.519> start<00:03:42.940> why<00:03:43.180> not<00:03:43.419> get<00:03:43.599> it<00:03:43.780> offense<00:03:44.530> so

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
humane start why not get it offense so

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.129 
humane start why not get it offense so
the<00:03:45.790> moment<00:03:46.090> I'm<00:03:46.180> stuck<00:03:46.450> in<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.660> tack<00:03:46.870> speed

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
the moment I'm stuck in the tack speed

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.870 
the moment I'm stuck in the tack speed
because<00:03:47.739> they<00:03:47.829> need<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.130> get<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.400> over<00:03:48.849> that

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
because they need to get it over that

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.030 
because they need to get it over that
two<00:03:49.180> percent<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:50.500> don't<00:03:50.739> really<00:03:50.859> need

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.310

actually<00:04:18.370> increases<00:04:18.789> my<00:04:18.940> resistol<00:04:19.450> as<00:04:19.599> well

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
actually increases my resistol as well

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.460 
actually increases my resistol as well
as<00:04:20.410> my<00:04:20.590> toughness

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470

and<00:04:22.890> this<00:04:23.040> actually<00:04:23.280> increases<00:04:24.060> my<00:04:24.900> chance<00:04:25.740> of

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.100 
and this actually increases my chance of
survivability<00:04:26.390> which<00:04:27.390> means<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:27.720> can<00:04:27.900> start

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.370 
survivability which means I can start

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.590 
doing height almonds utilities the final
one<00:04:31.560> obviously<00:04:32.430> when<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:32.700> max<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.240> so<00:04:33.510> you're

can get it's not bad much but it is

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.969 
can get it's not bad much but it is
significant<00:05:51.210> where<00:05:51.510> you<00:05:51.720> can<00:05:51.960> actually<00:05:52.169> tell

significant where you can actually tell

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.540 
significant where you can actually tell
the<00:05:53.190> difference<00:05:54.680> now<00:05:55.680> in<00:05:55.830> terms<00:05:55.860> of<00:05:56.250> gear

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
the difference now in terms of gear

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.719 
the difference now in terms of gear
you're<00:05:57.540> not<00:05:57.690> going<00:05:57.870> to<00:05:57.930> get<00:05:58.110> these<00:05:58.350> a<00:05:58.729> straight

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
you're not going to get these a straight

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.940 
you're not going to get these a straight
off<00:05:59.850> the<00:05:59.880> bat<00:06:00.150> but<00:06:00.210> is<00:06:00.540> sort<00:06:01.229> of<00:06:01.290> want<00:06:01.560> to<00:06:01.710> work

lucky in my first week of RS and I got
quite<00:06:07.800> a<00:06:07.830> few<00:06:08.280> plans<00:06:08.610> so<00:06:09.600> in<00:06:09.840> terms<00:06:10.050> of<00:06:10.229> plans

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
quite a few plans so in terms of plans

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.159 
quite a few plans so in terms of plans
you<00:06:11.700> want<00:06:11.970> to<00:06:12.120> try<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:12.479> get<00:06:12.600> a<00:06:12.630> share<00:06:12.990> as<00:06:13.140> a

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169

finders because this to set plan gives

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.960 
finders because this to set plan gives
you<00:06:15.960> a<00:06:16.050> hundred<00:06:16.410> resistor<00:06:17.040> all<00:06:17.250> which

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
you a hundred resistor all which

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.120 
you a hundred resistor all which

that's so hard to get you want the to

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.300 
that's so hard to get you want the to
set<00:06:30.630> bonus<00:06:30.990> to<00:06:31.080> this<00:06:31.200> because<00:06:31.560> it's<00:06:31.710> extra

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
set bonus to this because it's extra

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.880 
the to set bonus for the extra 250
dexterity<00:06:49.790> the<00:06:50.790> final<00:06:51.210> one<00:06:51.360> is<00:06:51.890> guardians

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
dexterity the final one is guardians

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.240

with the guardians to set you get 250

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.970 
with the guardians to set you get 250
vitality<00:06:56.790> and<00:06:57.120> life<00:06:57.180> per<00:06:58.110> seconds<00:06:58.530> which<00:06:58.770> also

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:58.980 
vitality and life per seconds which also

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.680 
vitality and life per seconds which also
increases<00:06:59.340> just<00:06:59.820> of<00:06:59.940> like<00:07:00.090> the<00:07:00.270> ability

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
increases just of like the ability

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.070 
increases just of like the ability
chance<00:07:00.990> and<00:07:01.940> I<00:07:02.940> believe<00:07:03.060> that's<00:07:03.540> it<00:07:03.810> yes

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
chance and I believe that's it yes

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.250 
chance and I believe that's it yes
that's<00:07:04.350> it<00:07:04.470> so<00:07:04.740> Shearer's<00:07:05.400> is<00:07:05.430> the<00:07:05.760> first<00:07:06.000> one

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
that's it so Shearer's is the first one

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.830 
that's it so Shearer's is the first one
guardians<00:07:07.260> is<00:07:07.440> the<00:07:07.560> second<00:07:07.950> one<00:07:08.100> and<00:07:08.660> sages<00:07:09.660> is

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
guardians is the second one and sages is

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.240 
guardians is the second one and sages is
the<00:07:10.020> third<00:07:10.230> world<00:07:10.440> if<00:07:10.620> you<00:07:10.800> start<00:07:11.130> getting

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
the third world if you start getting

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.580 
the third world if you start getting
these<00:07:11.490> plans<00:07:11.820> and<00:07:12.060> you<00:07:12.150> start<00:07:12.480> building<00:07:12.900> get

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
these plans and you start building get

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:14.990 
these plans and you start building get
around<00:07:13.980> these<00:07:14.190> plans<00:07:14.490> you'll<00:07:14.850> actually

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
around these plans you'll actually

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.940 
around these plans you'll actually
increase<00:07:15.450> your<00:07:15.570> survivability<00:07:16.080> as<00:07:16.620> well<00:07:16.830> as
