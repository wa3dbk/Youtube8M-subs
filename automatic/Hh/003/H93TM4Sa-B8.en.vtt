00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 two beautiful days of rest a bit of the sea 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.160
 we saw some fun with 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.920
 family with friends 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.710
 they served after doing well in the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.900
 first official race is true 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.680
 these two days have been day 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.050
 beautiful as you said well 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.320
 as friends with family we did 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.429
 well this match was just that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.940
 I rested a bit I was fine there with little 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.579
 of sun a bit of sea now re-enter is 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.120
 easy training because we miss it 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.640
 yet another game to decide 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.879
 this this one to get into 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.890
 round of the europa league 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.680
 assisted by Gianni Dodò's header 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.840
 the outside that package by yourself 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.640
 goal that closes the game dodò in the later 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.090
 race said is put a ball like 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.239
 I was making a goal like that at the end 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.070
 of the match he saw it was 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.229
 too easy not to put your head there 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.030
 instead I was a little worried because I have 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.369
 seen opponent putting his feet 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.540
 I thought he was a little scared of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.479
 put to put it on your head and break 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.729
 of the second half and is a saying do do 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.490
 I am always the second 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.340
 second second pole alone tomi c è 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.409
 that instead I will be against it 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.900
 I'm happy for him for so long 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.070
 he wasn't ava was your first 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.720
 official match with inter and assigned 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.670
 we hope he can continue to do 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.930
 well as they did I saw them I said 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.750
 just what you saw from above that the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.220
 number 17 fiction that had to cover you 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.619
 it always remained a little low and you were 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.380
 often in the condition of being everything 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.670
 only is that sometimes the ball there 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.530
 they are also the opponents was not easy 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.119
 to get it if not maybe you could 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.600
 unlock it you in the first time has 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.600
 had opportunities 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.960
 matteo gave lots of balls for good 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.439
 for me one that in my opinion was the most 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.050
 the ball went a little easier 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.879
 has passed very close to my foot not 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.560
 I managed to take it though it is 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.110
 life was important 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.390
 of the team we played well 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.180
 we know that it was important to start 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.270
 so to take confidence take 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.230
 moral for this next game 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.660
 he clarified at home 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.660
 we count with a booth of all ours 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.019
 fans can come to the stadium e 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.019
 screaming to help the team a lot
