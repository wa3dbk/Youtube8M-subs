00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.600
 less than a year ago you couldn't play a decision game 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.290
 to degrade from the third class that mission was brought and is this season 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.489
 everything different 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:17.769
 winter danish team today with the valley birds then the champion flag may 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.070
 even out 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.010
 these are the veenendaal newspaper final weeks with today the valley birds 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.010
 against candia 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.370
 is going to happen today 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.020
 kind of exciting 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.330
 healthy tension 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.700
 no more is different but yes it is of course a bit more calm and different 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.840
 sectors 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.760
 what is the approach today 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.649
 to put pressure on the world and 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.930
 that happened anyway they were names that is cool to deal with 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.930
 and with that also get back euro within 10 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 then further expand that retention 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.020
 a month ago but it is important to me that we win the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.020
 events around the club but the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 we must win there 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 4 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 wognum 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.919
 have apple marquee with the title initially 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.339
 as the tough match 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.279
 yes this summer season always showing people up 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.829
 hilversum every match will never be good but that is not the point 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.329
 because of the result and we were part of the well-known films being tense 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.759
 miss opportunities 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.769
 the 83 scoreboard finally stands and that is the point 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.939
 after you say from to the match was actually not really a tap of yours either 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.609
 not very bad play 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:41.739
 r 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.700
 at all i seemed alish but where i was a bit tense alone 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.159
 the truth is broken off 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.799
 we just have to be full of prices we don't have to lean back 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.159
 whether you are careful for two years together 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.399
 We must already be over and it must be good ourselves 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.539
 and that actually went right from the start and were immediately busy 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:58.169
 forward 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.130
 well that's why I already spoke 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.519
 we knew that a nice bullet 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.620
 and 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.319
 what a awake point it was 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.189
 and no, I suspend it because the hand walked 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.189
 eibergen that was a weakness put pressure together quickly 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:14.709
 and actually say violate 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.929
 He has a limited learning last year to the stock markets in addition to competitions 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:23.550
 You can just play somewhere for textile 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.799
 what that was in america after the bbc 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.730
 that is difficult in the media but that is still reasonable in my 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.579
 life has had to do with me 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.759
 get the boys 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:37.609
 young boys who died and who made a difference together with the 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.629
 right-wing rights groups 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.749
 i in the east guys only if i have those young guys who already 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:46.079
 why had never been champion of the street last season the idea that 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.599
 this would be possible 2 I do feel that we would be among the first five 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.669
 can end 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.289
 but everyone can join us that we could become champions seems to me now and then 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.849
 It has happened for years and a true champion in your eyes 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.829
 if your champion wants to be entitled to it 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.459
 I think I do many just to just a very tight organization 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.569
 to have 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.219
 and and 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.889
 the stadium that report the champion
