to all this see some people divide

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.140 
to all this see some people divide
reality<00:00:13.290> up<00:00:13.469> into<00:00:13.679> chunks<00:00:13.730> there's<00:00:14.730> like<00:00:14.880> this

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
reality up into chunks there's like this

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.660 
reality up into chunks there's like this
life<00:00:15.599> though<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.650> lights<00:00:16.859> at<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.310> know

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
life though the lights at you and I know

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.490 
life though the lights at you and I know
and<00:00:17.910> then<00:00:18.000> we'll<00:00:18.029> die<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.690> kind<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.930> start

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
and then we'll die and we kind of start

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.200 
and then we'll die and we kind of start
over<00:00:19.650> somewhere<00:00:20.100> else<00:00:20.279> there's<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.850> chunk

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
over somewhere else there's this chunk

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.700 
over somewhere else there's this chunk
of<00:00:21.330> reality<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.020> there's<00:00:22.170> like<00:00:22.260> another

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
of reality and then there's like another

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.470 
of reality and then there's like another
chunk<00:00:23.100> out<00:00:23.279> there<00:00:23.519> somewhere<00:00:23.789> after<00:00:24.330> this

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
chunk out there somewhere after this

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.259 
chunk out there somewhere after this
place<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.039> happens<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.910> end<00:00:26.939> up

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
place so what happens is we end up

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.630 
place so what happens is we end up
falling<00:00:27.840> into<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.230> belief<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:29.039> somehow

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
falling into this belief that somehow

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.730 
falling into this belief that somehow
we'll<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.090> start<00:00:30.300> over<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:31.199> I'll<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.470> end

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
we'll just start over that I'll just end

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.010 
we'll just start over that I'll just end
up<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.219> when<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> die<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:33.059> some<00:00:33.270> new<00:00:33.450> world<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
up and when I die in some new world and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.750 
up and when I die in some new world and
then<00:00:34.110> I'll<00:00:34.230> get<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> new<00:00:34.800> drivers<00:00:35.010> license<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
then I'll get a new drivers license and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.010 
then I'll get a new drivers license and
a<00:00:35.790> change<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.149> address<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:36.840> I'll<00:00:36.989> just

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
a change of address and then I'll just

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.560 
a change of address and then I'll just
kind<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.550> start<00:00:38.550> over<00:00:38.670> with<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> blank<00:00:39.300> slate

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
kind of start over with a blank slate

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.540 
kind of start over with a blank slate
and<00:00:39.780> we'll<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and we'll see what it's like and and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.420 
and we'll see what it's like and and
figure<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:41.969> out<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.149> there<00:00:43.399> may<00:00:44.399> be

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
figure it out from there may be

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.560 
figure it out from there may be
religious<00:00:44.969> people<00:00:45.300> sometimes<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.469> guilty<00:00:47.100> of

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
religious people sometimes are guilty of

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.720 
religious people sometimes are guilty of
