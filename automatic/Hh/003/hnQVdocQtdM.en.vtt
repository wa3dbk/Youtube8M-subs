mine manager now calculates that my
start<00:01:16.200> date<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.580> 929<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.880> i<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:18.869> finish<00:01:19.080> on

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
start date is 929 and i will finish on

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
start date is 929 and i will finish on
1017<00:01:21.259> let's<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:22.619> happens<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:25.220> change

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
1017 let's see what happens as I change

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.749 
1017 let's see what happens as I change
the<00:01:26.460> percentage<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.380> tasks<00:01:28.799> done<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the percentage of the tasks done you

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.730 
the percentage of the tasks done you
notice<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.720> being<00:01:30.990> reflected<00:01:32.360> in

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
notice that this is being reflected in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.999 
notice that this is being reflected in
my<00:01:34.740> summary<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.009> dynamic

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
my summary so now this is dynamic

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.810 
my summary so now this is dynamic
information<00:01:39.110> if<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.439> some<00:01:40.470> reason<00:01:40.650> I'm<00:01:41.640> going

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
information if for some reason I'm going

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.249 
information if for some reason I'm going
to<00:01:41.909> go<00:01:42.030> back<00:01:42.500> here<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.570> i'm<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.930> change

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
to go back here and i'm going to change

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.360 
to go back here and i'm going to change
this<00:01:46.649> date

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.210 

to<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.490> 25th<00:01:53.090> you'll<00:01:53.870> see<00:01:54.080> that<00:01:54.260> my<00:01:54.710> magic

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
to the 25th you'll see that my magic

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.920 
to the 25th you'll see that my magic
automatically<00:01:56.080> updates<00:01:57.080> that<00:01:57.610> for<00:01:58.610> me<00:01:58.930> and

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
automatically updates that for me and

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.100 
automatically updates that for me and
let's<00:02:00.380> go<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.770> let's<00:02:00.890> change<00:02:01.430> this<00:02:01.760> a<00:02:02.240> little

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
let's go and let's change this a little

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.560 
let's go and let's change this a little
bit<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.820> let's<00:02:05.570> say<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.260> due<00:02:06.500> date<00:02:06.830> here

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
bit and let's say that the due date here

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.280 
bit and let's say that the due date here
change<00:02:08.570> to<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.590> fifth<00:02:11.440> notice<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:13.780> my<00:02:14.780> magic

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
change to the fifth notice that my magic

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.730 
change to the fifth notice that my magic
automatically<00:02:16.450> flagged<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.660> for<00:02:18.320> me<00:02:18.470> as<00:02:18.680> a

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
automatically flagged that for me as a

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.810 
automatically flagged that for me as a
potential<00:02:19.810> problem<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.070> visually

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
potential problem so that I can visually

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.340 
potential problem so that I can visually
see<00:02:23.410> what<00:02:24.410> I'm<00:02:24.650> falling<00:02:25.280> behind<00:02:25.430> on<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:27.170> that's

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
see what I'm falling behind on so that's

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.970 
see what I'm falling behind on so that's
just<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.620> quick<00:02:28.360> scenario<00:02:29.360> about<00:02:30.260> how<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.560> can

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
just a quick scenario about how you can

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.670 
just a quick scenario about how you can
use<00:02:31.280> some<00:02:31.460> of<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.060> new<00:02:32.270> features<00:02:32.300> in<00:02:33.020> mind

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
use some of the new features in mind
