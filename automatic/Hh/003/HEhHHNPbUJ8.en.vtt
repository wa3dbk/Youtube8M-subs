harm<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:39.070> we're<00:01:39.250> going<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:39.460> jar<00:01:39.729> them

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
harm you so now we're going to jar them

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.370 
harm you so now we're going to jar them
half<00:01:41.619> step<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.640> jar<00:01:42.940> or<00:01:43.299> can<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.990> pickles

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
half step is to jar or can the pickles

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.170 
half step is to jar or can the pickles
and<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.710> take<00:01:44.860> one<00:01:45.040> of<00:01:45.100> these<00:01:45.159> incredibly<00:01:45.850> hot

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
and you take one of these incredibly hot

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.920 
and you take one of these incredibly hot
boiling<00:01:47.100> jars<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.580> i<00:01:48.940> like<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.390> use<00:01:49.450> heavy

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
boiling jars and i like to use heavy

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.440 
boiling jars and i like to use heavy
like<00:01:50.350> terry<00:01:50.740> towels<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.490> then<00:01:52.119> we're<00:01:52.299> going

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
like terry towels and then we're going

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.450 
like terry towels and then we're going
to<00:01:52.540> take<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:53.049> funnel<00:01:53.710> which<00:01:53.950> i<00:01:54.130> previously

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
to take the funnel which i previously

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.750 
to take the funnel which i previously
put<00:01:54.880> in<00:01:55.000> boiling<00:01:55.420> water<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.960> then<00:01:56.830> i<00:01:57.130> just<00:01:57.490> use

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
put in boiling water and then i just use

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.359 
put in boiling water and then i just use
a<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:59.229> like<00:01:59.350> a<00:01:59.380> liquid<00:01:59.619> measuring<00:02:00.310> cup

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
a just like a liquid measuring cup

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.830 
a just like a liquid measuring cup
because<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:00.850> want<00:02:01.030> some<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.450> pickling

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
because you want some of the pickling

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.770 
because you want some of the pickling
brine<00:02:02.049> so<00:02:03.040> this<00:02:03.250> just<00:02:03.460> came<00:02:03.760> to<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.060> boil<00:02:04.390> and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
brine so this just came to a boil and

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.649 
brine so this just came to a boil and
now<00:02:05.110> immediately<00:02:05.979> we<00:02:06.280> place<00:02:06.520> it<00:02:06.549> in<00:02:06.820> jars<00:02:09.659> and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
now immediately we place it in jars and

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.380 
now immediately we place it in jars and
once<00:02:11.049> you<00:02:11.230> get<00:02:11.409> a<00:02:11.439> complete<00:02:12.370> jar<00:02:12.700> try<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.180> get

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
once you get a complete jar try to get

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.870 
once you get a complete jar try to get
the<00:02:14.049> brine<00:02:14.349> along<00:02:14.980> with<00:02:15.159> the<00:02:15.280> pick<00:02:15.459> holes

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
the brine along with the pick holes

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.730 
the brine along with the pick holes
and<00:02:15.970> it's<00:02:16.150> really<00:02:16.240> important<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.260> allow

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and it's really important to allow

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.270 
and it's really important to allow
approximately<00:02:18.430> one<00:02:19.330> inch<00:02:19.690> head<00:02:20.290> space<00:02:20.910> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
approximately one inch head space and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.320 
approximately one inch head space and
that<00:02:24.280> was<00:02:24.550> over<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.090> top<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.850> just<00:02:31.030> have<00:02:31.210> to

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
that was over the top so we just have to

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.750 
that was over the top so we just have to
take<00:02:31.510> some<00:02:31.780> out<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.500> then<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.280> always

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
take some out this and then I always

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.810 
take some out this and then I always
take<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.300> next<00:02:40.570> jar<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.940> keep<00:02:43.240> the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
take the next jar and to keep the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.790 
take the next jar and to keep the
bacteria<00:02:45.820> at<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.120> low<00:02:46.480> count<00:02:46.870> I'll<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.470> place

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
bacteria at a low count I'll just place

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.180 
bacteria at a low count I'll just place
it<00:02:47.830> here<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.670> now<00:02:49.680> my<00:02:50.680> next<00:02:50.980> little<00:02:51.400> step<00:02:52.180> is

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
it here and now my next little step is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.560 
it here and now my next little step is
we<00:02:54.190> just<00:02:55.150> briefly<00:02:56.610> sterilize<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:58.000> top<00:02:58.270> it

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
we just briefly sterilize the top it

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.630 
we just briefly sterilize the top it
used<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.930> be<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.350> you<00:02:59.590> left<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.130> lids<00:03:00.430> in

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
used to be that you left the lids in

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.670 
used to be that you left the lids in
here<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.060> boil<00:03:01.360> them<00:03:01.600> you<00:03:02.260> don't<00:03:02.500> want

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
here and you boil them you don't want

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.230 
here and you boil them you don't want
boil<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.220> long<00:03:03.460> at<00:03:03.670> all<00:03:03.790> because<00:03:04.320> they<00:03:05.320> will

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
boil that long at all because they will

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.150 
boil that long at all because they will
it<00:03:07.240> will<00:03:07.330> boil<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.810> stickiness<00:03:08.320> off<00:03:08.680> over<00:03:09.010> so

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
it will boil this stickiness off over so

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.790 
it will boil this stickiness off over so
they<00:03:09.280> just<00:03:09.490> need<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.730> real<00:03:10.540> quick<00:03:10.870> immersion<00:03:11.590> in

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
they just need a real quick immersion in

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.670 
they just need a real quick immersion in
the<00:03:12.190> hot<00:03:12.490> liquid<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.570> then<00:03:14.080> we<00:03:14.260> take<00:03:14.440> this

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
the hot liquid and then we take this

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.730 
the hot liquid and then we take this
same<00:03:15.100> hot<00:03:15.520> liquid<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:20.140> just<00:03:20.410> boiling

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
same hot liquid and you just boiling

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.190 
same hot liquid and you just boiling
