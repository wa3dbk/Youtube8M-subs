00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:14.040
 How do I make and untangle gelatin? 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.020
 I will use this quice gelatin it 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.050
 it came in my little box that came from 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.180
 Mexico that my friend Rosana sent me 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.599
 she has a channel here on youtube that the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.050
 channel name is the mother of two princesses 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.260
 She sent me several comedies. I have 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.600

 It came came another strawberry ever did was 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.760
 Delicious I found the Mexican gelatin 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.340
 much more consistent than the Brazilian one 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:01.920
 I do not know what difference it has in formula 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:06.659
 1 but she was very hard and she understood 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.720
 yields a liter small package so in 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:14.070
 yields a liter 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:19.670
 come on I'll use oil to put 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.670
 A little thread on the fominha 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:32.640
 I 'm going to give a liter of water each already 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:35.000
 I came here with half a liter and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.000
 begin 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:58.430
 The water is already boiling, I'm going to turn it off. 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:02:02.260
 fire comes here covered sign here 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.260
 has half a liter of boiled water 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:17.860
 after adding all the machine I 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.860
 I'm going to mix 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
 ae 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.080
 and put another half liter 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:58.220
 when it has well dissolved 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:04.489
 you put more half a liter stir well until 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:06.830
 dissolve completely and when it 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:11.019
 have cold 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.019
 there you put it in the form 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.810
 now that the gelatin is cold 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:39.290
 I'm going to get the shape I chose this one. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:49.310
 here I will put an oil drizzle only 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:51.170
 a little uncle will involve a little 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:59.860
 the fame 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:59.860
 there came with branch water 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.459
 and place the gelatin 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.630
 Now girls I'm going to put on I go 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.830
 and put this gelatin in the 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.140
 refrigerator 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:46.020
 she will spend around 5 hours and 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:49.320
 back to show good informing 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:54.080

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:57.750
 after six hours in the refrigerator 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.960
 now you're going to see that little 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.280
 of the oil thread that causes it to 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:12.630
 slide when uninformed 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:19.880
 I'm going to get a plate from a background 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:19.880
 I'll turn this over 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.170

 look how beautiful 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.370
 here is the result 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:58.090
 you put a small amount of oil in the 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.970
 Forminha you want to make only gelatin 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.150
 and they go out the little screen do not go to pieces 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.150
 huh 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.730
 There are people who say they can not 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.550

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:16.270
