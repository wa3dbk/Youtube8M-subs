00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:16.520
 hello my youtube people that gentlemen 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.740
 if here in the USA when the pollen fell 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.440
 something that attacks her more than another but has 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.620
 moved 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.380
 in gentlemen today I bring you a ready 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.060
 bachata is totally free comes with 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.040
 the back in track and it comes with the table 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.850
 Here, it's good for almost everything 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.290
 the power to use that comes being 3 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.720
 leaks in 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.730
 and can be applied in any kind of 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.460
 music does not have to be only 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.050
 bachata only with the concept and what 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.070
 we can use in other music 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.540
 but it 's dedicated to bachata 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.540
 we do not have to teach the manual 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.620
 so let's see what happens 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.840
 and well now we are going to slow it down 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.840
 so you can see what I'm doing 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.830
 and the other variation can be like this 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.170
 and here begins the first law first law 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.930
 which is basically being a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.740
 pentatonic but the tonic would be like that 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.310
 of itself but I do it I add the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.310
 third minor 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.910
 then I would follow by marley 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.840
 according to us this 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.950
 the phrasing 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.170
 and the last 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.810
 putting more light to be less 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.720
 ah 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.530
 yes 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.080
 i 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.600
 in this link I hope you have 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.010
 enjoyed 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.010
 this is going to be like this 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.400
 good and it 's the lic I hope that they have 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.340
 enjoyed 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.459
 this is going to be lingua to make a 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.370
 pack of 30 leaks that prepare them 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.590
 For this summer 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.930
 will have an advanced intermediate 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.019
 beginners 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.400
 and I think it's a good opportunity to 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.329
 that there are people who want to venture into 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.579
 what the bachata style that idea the 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.409
 can catch and apply it in any 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.569
 instrument as I said look at 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.920
 any style and not necessarily 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.819
 it has to be bachata but it's 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.819
 inspired by bachata 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.709
