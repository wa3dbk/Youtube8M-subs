00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
and the reason I messed up is because I

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.420 
and the reason I messed up is because I
didn't<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.409> almost<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.890> range<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.340> I

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
didn't I was almost in range but I

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580 
didn't I was almost in range but I
wasn't<00:01:29.610> enraged<00:01:30.000> acute<00:01:30.329> Malfurion<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.020> my<00:01:31.140> w

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
wasn't enraged acute Malfurion so my w

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.499 
wasn't enraged acute Malfurion so my w
went<00:01:31.829> off<00:01:31.920> before<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> got<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> him<00:01:33.329> and

went off before I got to him and

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.410 
went off before I got to him and
essentially<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.110> wasted<00:01:34.590> my<00:01:34.619> Hill<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> way<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
always q and then quickly shift click w
