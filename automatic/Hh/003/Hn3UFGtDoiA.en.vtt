Dublin cream cart is confusing with five

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.070 
Dublin cream cart is confusing with five
colors<00:05:31.330> because<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.450> actually<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:32.810> have<00:05:32.960> to

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
colors because you actually you have to

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.050 
colors because you actually you have to
pay<00:05:33.230> through<00:05:33.470> NATO<00:05:33.620> use<00:05:34.010> it<00:05:34.250> so<00:05:34.790> you<00:05:34.850> can't

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
pay through NATO use it so you can't

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.000 
pay through NATO use it so you can't
just<00:05:35.120> like<00:05:35.360> make<00:05:35.780> five<00:05:36.050> colors<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:36.740> then<00:05:36.830> make

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
just like make five colors and then make

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.270 
just like make five colors and then make
it<00:05:37.130> ten<00:05:37.400> because<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:38.840> have<00:05:38.900> to<00:05:39.140> pay<00:05:39.350> three<00:05:39.710> but

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
it ten because you have to pay three but
