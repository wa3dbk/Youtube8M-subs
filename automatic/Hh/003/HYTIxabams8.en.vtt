00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
up this way watch how the how to set the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.380 
up this way watch how the how to set the
cards<00:02:46.800> up<00:02:46.980> using<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.430> sidestepping<00:02:48.000> stack

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
cards up using the sidestepping stack

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.870 
cards up using the sidestepping stack
there<00:02:49.380> are<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> lot<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.680> card<00:02:50.040> tricks<00:02:50.280> using<00:02:50.760> the

there are a lot of card tricks using the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.640 
there are a lot of card tricks using the
size<00:02:51.120> Stebbins<00:02:51.630> stack<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.110> think<00:02:52.320> this<00:02:52.440> one

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
size Stebbins stack and I think this one

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.800 
size Stebbins stack and I think this one
is<00:02:52.770> really<00:02:52.920> cool<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:54.000> what<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.209> want<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.450> do<00:02:54.570> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
is really cool so what you want to do is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.600 
is really cool so what you want to do is
you<00:02:54.989> want<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.230> start<00:02:55.500> out<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.980> show<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.459> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
you want to start out and show that the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.550 
you want to start out and show that the
cards<00:02:56.970> are<00:02:57.150> all<00:02:57.690> different<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.380> good

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
cards are all different this is a good

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.620 
cards are all different this is a good
way<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.739> showing<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.310> cards<00:02:59.700> because<00:02:59.910> you

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
way of showing the cards because you

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.970 
way of showing the cards because you
don't<00:03:00.810> want<00:03:00.930> them<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.200> notice<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.680> they<00:03:01.800> go

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
don't want them to notice that they go

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.160 
don't want them to notice that they go
alternating<00:03:02.580> red<00:03:02.760> black<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.390> then<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.020> can

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
alternating red black and then you can

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.840 
alternating red black and then you can
cut<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.500> cards<00:03:04.950> as<00:03:05.070> many<00:03:05.250> times<00:03:05.520> as<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.820> like

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
cut the cards as many times as you like

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.180 
cut the cards as many times as you like
for<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.780> spectator<00:03:07.380> as<00:03:07.530> long<00:03:07.739> as<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.040> don't

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
for the spectator as long as you don't

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.760 
for the spectator as long as you don't
disturb<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.209> order<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.959> deck<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.410> mess

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
disturb the order of the deck and mess

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.530 
disturb the order of the deck and mess
up<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:11.010> stack<00:03:11.400> now<00:03:12.060> you're<00:03:12.209> going<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.390> tell

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
up the stack now you're going to tell

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.150 
up the stack now you're going to tell
the<00:03:12.630> spectator<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.230> point<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.680> any<00:03:13.860> two

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
the spectator to point to any two

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.640 
the spectator to point to any two
consecutive<00:03:14.610> cards<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.900> let's<00:03:16.080> say<00:03:16.230> they<00:03:16.350> stop

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
consecutive cards so let's say they stop

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.860 
consecutive cards so let's say they stop
right<00:03:16.890> over<00:03:16.920> here<00:03:17.250> at<00:03:17.340> these<00:03:17.519> two<00:03:17.730> cards<00:03:18.150> what

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
right over here at these two cards what

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.330 
right over here at these two cards what

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
now you don't want to reverse count it

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.660 
now you don't want to reverse count it
so<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.540> don't<00:03:48.630> want<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.930> go<00:03:49.049> see<00:03:49.470> oh<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.579> you

another<00:04:05.910> alternate<00:04:06.480> way<00:04:06.570> of<00:04:06.690> doing<00:04:06.959> this<00:04:07.079> is

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
another alternate way of doing this is

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.580 
another alternate way of doing this is
just<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.950> guess<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.970> color<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.480> spell<00:04:10.260> black

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
just to guess the color and spell black

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.050 
just to guess the color and spell black
say<00:04:11.100> let's<00:04:11.340> see<00:04:11.519> if<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.730> card<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.090> black<00:04:12.329> B<00:04:13.230> L

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
say let's see if the card is black B L

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.539 
say let's see if the card is black B L
ACK<00:04:15.060> set<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.780> down<00:04:15.959> turn<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.709> over<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.130> say<00:04:17.519> oh

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
ACK set it down turn it over and say oh
