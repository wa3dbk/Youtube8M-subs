up<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.090> sooner<00:03:33.540> it's<00:03:34.230> over<00:03:34.440> because<00:03:34.710> look

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
up on it sooner it's over because look

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.070 
up on it sooner it's over because look
at<00:03:35.130> thought<00:03:35.370> field<00:03:35.730> he<00:03:35.850> has<00:03:36.150> straight<00:03:36.900> line

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
at thought field he has straight line

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.440 
at thought field he has straight line
ahead<00:03:38.390> 95<00:03:39.390> speed<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:40.820> he's<00:03:41.820> pretty<00:03:42.000> much<00:03:42.150> gone

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
ahead 95 speed and he's pretty much gone

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.030 
ahead 95 speed and he's pretty much gone
at<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.870> point<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.290> here's<00:03:43.650> what<00:03:43.740> I<00:03:43.830> don't

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
at that point and here's what I don't

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.770 
at that point and here's what I don't
like<00:03:44.420> because<00:03:46.100> makes<00:03:47.100> us<00:03:47.250> catch<00:03:47.600> but<00:03:48.600> no

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
like because makes us catch but no

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.240 
like because makes us catch but no
nevermind<00:03:49.230> because<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.710> guess<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.070> doesn't

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
nevermind because I guess that doesn't

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.890 
nevermind because I guess that doesn't
make<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.430> lot<00:03:50.520> of<00:03:50.580> sense<00:03:50.670> he<00:03:51.150> just<00:03:51.330> stopped<00:03:51.630> I

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
make a lot of sense he just stopped I

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.840 
make a lot of sense he just stopped I
was<00:03:52.020> kind<00:03:52.770> of<00:03:52.830> thinking<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.400> weird<00:03:53.730> how

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
was kind of thinking that is weird how

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.530 
was kind of thinking that is weird how
to<00:03:53.910> give<00:03:54.210> a<00:03:54.240> speed<00:03:54.600> burst<00:03:54.840> here<00:03:58.970> but<00:03:59.970> actually

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
to give a speed burst here but actually

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.080 
to give a speed burst here but actually
swear<00:04:00.720> he<00:04:00.840> stops<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.680> has<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.160> re-accelerate

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.300 

but<00:04:06.090> things<00:04:06.750> like<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:07.140> if<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.890> can<00:04:08.010> pick<00:04:08.190> out

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
but things like that if you can pick out

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.370 
but things like that if you can pick out
these<00:04:08.490> key<00:04:08.760> mismatches<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.140> CPU

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
these key mismatches that the CPU

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.520 
these key mismatches that the CPU
doesn't<00:04:10.920> account<00:04:11.130> for<00:04:12.080> because<00:04:13.080> well<00:04:13.380> this

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
doesn't account for because well this

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.260 
doesn't account for because well this
 is<00:04:13.890> just<00:04:14.040> not<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> good<00:04:14.430> play<00:04:14.700> call<00:04:14.970> this

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
 is just not a good play call this

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.760 
 is just not a good play call this
is<00:04:15.390> a<00:04:15.420> 4<00:04:15.750> wide<00:04:15.930> set<00:04:18.109> looks<00:04:19.109> like<00:04:19.320> they<00:04:19.470> came<00:04:19.710> out

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
is a 4 wide set looks like they came out

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.190 
is a 4 wide set looks like they came out
a<00:04:19.950> 335

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.970 

there<00:04:24.130> he<00:04:24.250> goes<00:04:24.400> cut<00:04:25.230> gone<00:04:26.230> as<00:04:26.560> soon<00:04:26.770> as<00:04:26.890> he

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
there he goes cut gone as soon as he

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.120 
there he goes cut gone as soon as he
makes<00:04:27.130> us<00:04:27.280> cut<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:28.360> as<00:04:29.140> soon<00:04:29.320> as<00:04:29.470> wat<00:04:29.680> does<00:04:29.950> not

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
makes us cut and as soon as wat does not

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.950 
makes us cut and as soon as wat does not
make<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:30.790> cut<00:04:30.970> with<00:04:31.210> him<00:04:31.390> because<00:04:31.540> he<00:04:31.750> doesn't

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
make the cut with him because he doesn't

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.080 
make the cut with him because he doesn't
route<00:04:32.200> jump<00:04:32.500> because<00:04:32.920> of<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.100> setting<00:04:33.550> is<00:04:33.910> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
route jump because of the setting is the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.240 
route jump because of the setting is the
slider<00:04:34.330> sets<00:04:34.690> because<00:04:35.560> if<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:35.860> did<00:04:35.980> not<00:04:36.130> have

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
slider sets because if I did not have

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.550 
slider sets because if I did not have
the<00:04:36.340> slider<00:04:36.580> sets<00:04:36.850> he'd<00:04:36.970> be<00:04:37.090> route<00:04:37.390> jumping<00:04:37.840> he

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
the slider sets he'd be route jumping he

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.360 
the slider sets he'd be route jumping he
would<00:04:38.680> have<00:04:38.770> made<00:04:38.890> the<00:04:39.010> break<00:04:39.360> right<00:04:40.360> here<00:04:41.370> it

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
would have made the break right here it

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.730 
would have made the break right here it
makes<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.730> break<00:04:42.910> it's<00:04:43.120> almost<00:04:43.480> seamless<00:04:44.050> they

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
makes a break it's almost seamless they

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.060 
makes a break it's almost seamless they
makes<00:04:45.040> us<00:04:45.190> break<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:46.410> at<00:04:47.410> that<00:04:47.590> point<00:04:47.800> it's

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
makes us break and at that point it's

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.430 
makes us break and at that point it's
over<00:04:48.400> Dingles<00:04:48.820> got<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:49.060> watch<00:04:49.180> his<00:04:49.420> number<00:04:50.050> 31

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
over Dingles got to watch his number 31

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.940 
over Dingles got to watch his number 31
dingle<00:04:50.860> has<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.550> watch<00:04:51.810> on<00:04:52.810> number<00:04:53.080> 16<00:04:53.410> McCarty

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
dingle has to watch on number 16 McCarty

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.050 
dingle has to watch on number 16 McCarty
and<00:04:55.800> he's<00:04:56.800> got<00:04:57.040> at<00:04:57.190> this<00:04:57.340> point<00:04:57.640> this<00:04:57.790> is<00:04:57.850> a

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
and he's got at this point this is a

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.540 
and he's got at this point this is a
wide<00:04:58.330> open<00:04:58.660> play<00:04:58.900> if<00:04:59.710> he<00:04:59.890> hadn't<00:05:00.190> stopped

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
wide open play if he hadn't stopped

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.010 
wide open play if he hadn't stopped
right<00:05:01.090> here<00:05:01.120> because<00:05:01.480> I<00:05:01.570> under<00:05:01.750> threw<00:05:01.930> the

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
right here because I under threw the

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.950 
right here because I under threw the
ball<00:05:02.200> if<00:05:02.470> he<00:05:02.920> hadn't<00:05:03.250> had<00:05:03.340> to<00:05:03.430> stop<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:04.150> make

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
ball if he hadn't had to stop to make

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.410 
ball if he hadn't had to stop to make
sure<00:05:05.080> he<00:05:05.170> gets<00:05:05.230> this<00:05:05.760> this<00:05:06.760> is<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:06.940> touchdown

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
sure he gets this this is a touchdown

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.750 
sure he gets this this is a touchdown
and<00:05:09.450> I<00:05:10.450> am<00:05:11.320> right<00:05:11.560> there<00:05:11.680> not<00:05:11.920> the<00:05:12.070> one<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.700> a

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
and I am right there not the one and a

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.380 
and I am right there not the one and a
half<00:05:12.790> pretty<00:05:13.510> much<00:05:14.970> that's<00:05:15.970> one<00:05:16.180> good<00:05:16.360> thing

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
half pretty much that's one good thing

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.910 
half pretty much that's one good thing
about<00:05:16.540> this<00:05:16.810> game<00:05:16.990> they<00:05:17.200> did<00:05:17.380> a<00:05:17.410> very<00:05:17.650> good<00:05:17.770> job

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
about this game they did a very good job

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.190 
about this game they did a very good job
with<00:05:18.310> mismatches<00:05:18.790> in<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:20.470> passing<00:05:20.950> game<00:05:20.980> and

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
with mismatches in the passing game and

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.110 
with mismatches in the passing game and
that's<00:05:23.200> something<00:05:23.350> that<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:24.160> really<00:05:24.820> noticed

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
that's something that I really noticed

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.080 
that's something that I really noticed
with<00:05:25.270> other<00:05:25.480> games<00:05:25.780> as<00:05:26.080> much<00:05:26.580> but<00:05:27.580> this<00:05:27.910> game

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
with other games as much but this game

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.350 
with other games as much but this game
is<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.270> good<00:05:28.510> job<00:05:28.750> with<00:05:28.930> it<00:05:30.000> small<00:05:31.000> look<00:05:31.120> back

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
is a good job with it small look back

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.400 
is a good job with it small look back
here<00:05:31.690> see<00:05:32.140> my<00:05:32.680> quarterback<00:05:34.170> rolls<00:05:35.170> out<00:05:35.350> a
