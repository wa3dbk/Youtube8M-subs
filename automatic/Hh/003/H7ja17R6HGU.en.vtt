back<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.090> that's<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:40.440> think<00:00:40.469> something

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
back and that's and I think something

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.860 
back and that's and I think something
else<00:00:41.040> about<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.430> camera<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:42.149> can't<00:00:42.660> remember

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
else about this camera I can't remember

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.150 
else about this camera I can't remember
but<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.590> right<00:00:43.800> into<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
but it's going to get right into the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.130 
but it's going to get right into the
unboxing<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.840> got<00:00:46.020> this

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
unboxing here for it and so I got this

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.319 
unboxing here for it and so I got this
camera<00:00:46.350> because<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.800> watch<00:00:47.610> OSHA<00:00:47.820> scan<00:00:48.180> but

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
camera because I watch OSHA scan but

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.360 
camera because I watch OSHA scan but
because<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.690> about<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.410> hundred<00:00:49.829> Elves<00:00:50.160> more

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
because it's about a hundred Elves more

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.700 
because it's about a hundred Elves more

review video and as I'm talking I'm just
taking<00:01:01.440> out<00:01:01.530> all<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.980> stuff<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.579> know

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
taking out all the stuff that you know

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.189 
taking out all the stuff that you know
we<00:01:02.789> don't<00:01:02.879> care<00:01:03.120> about<00:01:03.180> less<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.629> drop<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.110> or

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
we don't care about less I drop it or

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.570 
we don't care about less I drop it or
something<00:01:04.470> well<00:01:04.680> that's<00:01:04.979> probably<00:01:05.189> snap<00:01:05.460> code

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
something well that's probably snap code

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.510 
something well that's probably snap code
