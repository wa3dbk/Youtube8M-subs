00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.630
 very well we have good conditions of 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 work it's already the third year 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.559
 that well here and it's always 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.260
 impeccable beautiful grounds time 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.539
 he's good I think everything is together 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.189
 to do a very good internship not from the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.060
 all not at all because that's good 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.890
 season here it was quite special laa 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.650
 rÃ©taise still quite short three 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.220
 weeks only and leave for me they 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.340
 have not lost anything 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.530
 really not at all I still had 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 the sensation that we stopped yesterday in the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.370
 football and rachi that does not mean big 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.790
 thing the start with must be there 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.559
 that's clear after we'll see by the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.629
 not for the moment mirarchi has 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.910
 respected or but I'm glad that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.289
 I devoured Amiens I think I 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.989
 would still be lucky he had 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.250
 perhaps other colleagues from the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.440
 division a game the possession of us 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.920
 were still two super goalkeeper 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.359
 division 1 so I'm still not going 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.030
 complain I think it's more 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.470
 easy to handle bag l reverse the reverse 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.890
 because here in propane good 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.159
 guards 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.380
 so the best play we train and 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.549
 it pulls everyone up I 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.310
 can not really complain 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.799
 Ben Valentine is a very boy 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.140
 interesting about a year and the fed the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.150
 famous progress it makes that progress 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.340
 that's what counts in football 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.630
 it's progression and I think 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.759
 valentin he 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.439
 it every minute that goes up on the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.649
 ground he progresses and that's what 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.539
 do I care the most yes yes this 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.270
 very interesting aversion so it's a 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.420
 boy who plays in the under 17 and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.100
 at the beginning of the season I had commented on 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.079
 take it with and then he got 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.350
 how many people are there 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.319
 level of field players I decided 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.689
 who comes with us and finally we decided 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.250
 that they come with us and it's a 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.500
 very good thing for him it's a very 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.909
 good experience i think it's 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.349
 pushed a little bit the others 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.399
 behind 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.860
 to have ideas to come also in 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.369
 first good yes that's clear when 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.009
 a 28 28 players a 4th goalkeeper it's not 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.720
 super more good now it's not 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.030
 said I would not have taken 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.430
 Clement even if we are a little less 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.000
 depends it's not a little bit more 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.130
 what do you want to do 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.480
 since it is expensive to have the intention of 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.420
 do in his workouts it's a 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.200
 need three four guards and that's it 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.420
 it's just that what's so perfect it's 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.130
 a great professional I think that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.989
 it's not a guy are difficult to 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.720
 manage I try to motivate him with each 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.130
 moment and work in the shade he 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.989
 must always be ready we do not know 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.220
 I never say perfect attention 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.420
 because from one moment to another you can 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.549
 to play we do not know what can happen 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.560
 he adhere to the cup and in the league 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.239
 we do not know after ten minutes you can 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.500
 you can play we do not know so he 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.810
 must be ready a professional must 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.590
 be ready at all times and prepare 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.910
 as if playing and I think that strength 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.910
 of perfect that's exactly it
