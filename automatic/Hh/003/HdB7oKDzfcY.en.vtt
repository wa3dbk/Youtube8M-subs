last night when my fifth being the World

your<00:00:56.870> arm<00:00:57.019> off<00:00:57.199> is<00:00:57.410> no<00:00:57.890> way<00:00:58.040> I<00:00:58.070> thought<00:00:58.339> that

your arm off is no way I thought that

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.759

would<00:00:58.610> have<00:00:58.729> been<00:00:58.790> a<00:00:58.850> possibility<00:00:59.299> and<00:00:59.769> yeah

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
would have been a possibility and yeah

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.180 
I was sort of planning what I was going
to<00:02:11.360> be<00:02:11.540> doing<00:02:12.170> during<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.620> world<00:02:12.830> chain<00:02:13.040> we

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
to be doing during the world chain we

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.580 
to be doing during the world chain we
should<00:02:13.340> rather<00:02:13.550> than<00:02:13.700> playing<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.330> yeah<00:02:15.290> just

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
should rather than playing so yeah just

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.320 
should rather than playing so yeah just
absolutely<00:02:16.040> amazing<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.490> you<00:02:16.970> know<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.120> come

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
absolutely amazing to you know to come

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.000 
absolutely amazing to you know to come
back<00:02:17.510> from<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.780> match<00:02:17.930> like<00:02:17.960> that<00:02:18.140> 11-5<00:02:18.770> down

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
back from a match like that 11-5 down

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.010 
back from a match like that 11-5 down
and<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.310> think<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.850> was<00:02:19.970> probably<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.300> key<00:02:20.810> to

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
and I think that was probably the key to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.290 
and I think that was probably the key to
my<00:02:21.350> success<00:02:21.430> over<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.490> couple<00:02:22.819> of<00:02:22.910> weeks<00:02:23.090> was

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
my success over the couple of weeks was

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.540 
my success over the couple of weeks was
was<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:23.990> victory<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.560> know<00:02:24.650> when<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.830> knew<00:02:25.069> if

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
was that victory you know when I knew if

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.130 
was that victory you know when I knew if
I<00:02:25.610> could<00:02:25.730> win<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:25.910> match<00:02:26.060> from<00:02:26.180> 11-5<00:02:26.660> down<00:02:26.959> on

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
I could win a match from 11-5 down on

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.350 
I could win a match from 11-5 down on
y'all<00:02:27.500> could<00:02:27.680> win<00:02:27.830> sort<00:02:28.069> of<00:02:28.250> from<00:02:28.459> any<00:02:28.850> deficit

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
y'all could win sort of from any deficit

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.480 
y'all could win sort of from any deficit
so<00:02:29.630> yeah<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.560> was<00:02:30.680> definitely<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:31.100> key<00:02:31.250> to

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
so yeah that was definitely the key to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.850 
so yeah that was definitely the key to
the<00:02:31.580> room<00:02:31.730> he<00:02:32.270> also<00:02:32.390> got<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> great<00:02:33.410> start<00:02:33.680> in

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
the room he also got to a great start in

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
the room he also got to a great start in
the<00:02:33.980> final<00:02:34.310> what<00:02:34.400> was<00:02:34.490> it<00:02:34.580> like<00:02:34.700> playing

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
the final what was it like playing

ground<00:02:35.270> up<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:36.110> was<00:02:36.260> very<00:02:36.290> very<00:02:36.680> tough<00:02:36.920> match

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
wasn't like an all-out attacking sort of

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.310 
wasn't like an all-out attacking sort of
style<00:02:40.280> match<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.480> know<00:02:41.570> possibly<00:02:41.780> we've

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
style match that you know possibly we've

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.560

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
done you know just it is a mouth on

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.900 
done you know just it is a mouth on
event<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:51.920> really<00:02:52.160> really<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.700> know<00:02:52.730> we

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
event it really really is you know we

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.130

both<00:02:53.030> came<00:02:53.270> through<00:02:53.540> some<00:02:53.750> really<00:02:54.020> tough

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
both came through some really tough

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.290 
both came through some really tough
matches<00:02:54.710> and<00:02:54.950> probably<00:02:55.790> took<00:02:55.910> its<00:02:56.090> toll

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
matches and probably took its toll

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.600 
matches and probably took its toll
mentally<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.810> physically<00:02:57.140> on<00:02:57.380> us<00:02:57.500> but<00:02:57.710> you

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
mentally and physically on us but you

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.300 
mentally and physically on us but you
know<00:02:58.700> there<00:02:58.910> are<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.060> lot<00:02:59.210> of<00:02:59.240> tense<00:02:59.510> frames

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
know there are a lot of tense frames

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.140 
know there are a lot of tense frames
obviously<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.370> lot<00:03:01.490> of<00:03:01.580> people<00:03:01.820> have<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.000> see

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
obviously a lot of people have to see

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
obviously a lot of people have to see
all<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.330> big<00:03:02.480> breaks<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:02.900> everything<00:03:03.110> like

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
all the big breaks and everything like

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.110 
all the big breaks and everything like
that<00:03:03.230> but<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.560> think<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:04.040> know<00:03:04.130> people<00:03:04.160> sort<00:03:05.060> of

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
that but I think you know people sort of

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.700 
that but I think you know people sort of
really<00:03:05.420> probably<00:03:05.660> have<00:03:05.840> missed<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.290> lot<00:03:06.470> of<00:03:06.590> the

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
really probably have missed a lot of the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.770 
really probably have missed a lot of the
tents<00:03:07.220> frame<00:03:07.490> to<00:03:07.670> go<00:03:07.790> down<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.180> colors<00:03:08.570> and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
tents frame to go down to the colors and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.060 
tents frame to go down to the colors and
a<00:03:08.810> lot<00:03:08.960> of<00:03:09.050> mistakes<00:03:09.200> from<00:03:09.560> both<00:03:09.770> players

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
a lot of mistakes from both players

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.070 
a lot of mistakes from both players
which<00:03:10.310> they<00:03:10.490> were<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.850> final<00:03:11.060> which<00:03:11.330> you

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
which they were in the final which you

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.360 
which they were in the final which you
know<00:03:12.170> there's<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.440> lot<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.620> pressure<00:03:12.890> out<00:03:13.130> there
