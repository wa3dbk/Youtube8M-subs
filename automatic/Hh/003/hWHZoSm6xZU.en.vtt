00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.559
 then good morning I am raffaella with 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.110
 the chef of the career restaurant of 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.530
 brescia and today I present the recipe 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.909
 of our casoncelli also revisited 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.040
 a bit from us because the case is heaven 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:22.140
 Brescia is not really like that 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:26.500
 we make pasta we use flour eggs 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.870
 salt and a dash of water in proportions 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.589
 there are about 12 eggs per kilo of flour 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.980
 the filling instead we use the meat of 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:39.519
 beef veal and pork we do 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.629
 brown then it is minced and blended 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:46.929
 to breadcrumbs butter cheese and a 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.969
 sautÃ©ed with parsley and garlic 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.300
 all then the malga miamo with a bit of 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.039
 broth until it reaches this 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.699
 consistency then the dough we make it 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:01.479
 with white flour we put it on one 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:04.480
 we make a hole in the middle of it 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:07.120
 we put the eggs one by one a little salt 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.620
 and then it begins to knead slowly 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:19.060
 slowly until dough is obtained 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:22.740
 homogeneous and elastic like this at this 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.740
 point we pull the dough 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.030
 trying to pull a lot of pastry 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:41.730
 thin 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:43.080
 we cut the rectangles we take the 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.210
 pasta 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.240
 we put the filling in the center of the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.210
 dough and fold it into a triangle 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.910
 once put the filling in the dough 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.270
 we close it with this clamp 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.040
 particular which is our patent 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.040
 now the casoncelli are ready and 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:10.170
 then let's cook them now the water 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.230
 bubbles we climb a little we can put 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.690
 our casoncelli will cook for 3 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.270
 minutes and no more at the same time 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.090
 while the casoncello bolle we prepare the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.900
 our butter spilled and the butter must 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.310
 become our hazelnut color 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.750
 casoncelli are cultured 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:36.290
 drain well put them in a dish 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.800
 put some grated parmesan and 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.280
 kaldor spilled butter now the dish is 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.440
 ready 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.440
