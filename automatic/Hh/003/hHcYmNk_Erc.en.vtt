Air Max this came well this didn't come
out<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.650> was<00:01:22.799> made<00:01:23.009> before<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> mx1

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
out but this was made before the mx1

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.020 
out but this was made before the mx1
that's<00:01:24.659> why<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:24.960> called<00:01:25.049> MX<00:01:25.500> 0<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.640> just

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that's why it's called MX 0 it's just

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.050 
that's why it's called MX 0 it's just
that<00:01:27.330> they<00:01:27.900> didn't<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:29.060> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that they didn't really have the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.590
