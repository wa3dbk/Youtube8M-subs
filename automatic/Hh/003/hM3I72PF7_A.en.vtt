00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.609
 what to do to what I'm doing is 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.590
 checking some live data in a 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.960
 mazda car and what I want you to see is 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.570
 how our sensors work 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.240
 oxygen when our converter 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.060
 Catalytic no longer serves all a 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.140
 catalytic converter totally 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.300
 destroyed in disrepair so we're 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.640
 looking here and our computer 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.340
 he entered his close loop mode or 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.180
 closed circuit and sheet 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.790
 temperature 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.310
 now we can see there is already up to 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.570
 half of our car is already 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.340
 normal operating temperature 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.210
 and as you can see, see how it 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 our sensors behave 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.399
 the sensor 1 the bank 1 sensor 1 is the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.350
 which is before catalyst and how 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.420
 you know they go with 1 sensor 2 after 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.949
 of catalyst this is a car of 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.670
 four cylinders only brings two 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.250
 sensors and I want you to see what happens 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.750
 we have our sensor before 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.929
 catalyst working in a way 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.519
 totally normal and adequate is 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.850
 reading our fuel mixture 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.619
 is oscillating quite normal 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.270
 but in its counterpart we see the other 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.100
 it's practically a mirror of what 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.810
 is happening with our sensor number 1 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.490
 which means that the efficiency 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.229
 of the catalyst is totally 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.330
 destroyed there is no efficiency in the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.700
 catalyst is as if we did not have 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.649
 absolutely nothing 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.270
 as if we just had a tube like that 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.060
 nothing more and we did not have any 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.710
 catalyst this sensor signal number 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.850
 2 would have to be oscillating between the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.320
 400 and 600 millivolts so 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.810
 slow and see what he 's doing is 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.670
 doing the same as our sensor 1 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.890
 which means that in this case 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.130
 our catalytic converter no longer 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.170
 It's good for nothing and it's definitely looking 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.380
 how our data behave 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.380
 sensors 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.330
 very good and even if we accelerate, let's do 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.400
 what we do behave the same 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.540
 two sensors that's precisely what 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.050
 we do not want to see 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.920
 when we are verifying the efficiency 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.610
 of our channel 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.610
 catalytic converter
