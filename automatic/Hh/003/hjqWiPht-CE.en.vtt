00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
hospital so I've been kind of trying to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.350 
hospital so I've been kind of trying to
push<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.910> help<00:00:56.910> out<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.300> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
household and the whatnot so that means

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.200 
household and the whatnot so that means
pulling<00:01:05.729> more<00:01:06.000> shifts<00:01:07.340> helping<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:09.060> the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.710 
also depends on work because I'm work is
starting<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.100> pick<00:02:48.280> up<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.090> means<00:02:49.240> more

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
starting to pick up and that means more

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.540 
starting to pick up and that means more
shifts<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.850> getting<00:02:51.850> called<00:02:52.150> in<00:02:52.360> more<00:02:52.600> and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
shifts and getting called in more and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.500 
shifts and getting called in more and
unfortunately<00:02:54.550> as<00:02:54.700> much<00:02:54.850> fun<00:02:55.090> as<00:02:55.210> video<00:02:55.450> games

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
unfortunately as much fun as video games

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.090 
unfortunately as much fun as video games
would<00:02:56.050> be<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.350> play<00:02:56.560> all<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:57.070> time<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:59.100> not

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
would be to play all the time it is not

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.030 
would be to play all the time it is not
really<00:03:00.370> making<00:03:00.700> me<00:03:01.030> any<00:03:01.180> money<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:01.600> as<00:03:02.410> much

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
really making me any money so as much

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.410 
really making me any money so as much
that's<00:03:03.430> why<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.670> used<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:04.000> play<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.330> little

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
that's why I used to play it a little

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.680 
that's why I used to play it a little
bit<00:03:04.660> more<00:03:04.870> because<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.440> used<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.800> actually

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
bit more because it used to actually

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.460 
bit more because it used to actually
partially<00:03:07.690> subsidized<00:03:09.090> my<00:03:10.090> work<00:03:10.900> money<00:03:11.200> and

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
partially subsidized my work money and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.920 
partially subsidized my work money and
now<00:03:11.620> it's<00:03:11.800> not<00:03:11.890> so<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.580> focus<00:03:13.150> more<00:03:13.300> on<00:03:13.360> work<00:03:13.690> as

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
now it's not so I focus more on work as

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.650 
now it's not so I focus more on work as
