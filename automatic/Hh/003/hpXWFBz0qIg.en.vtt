00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello sun with you and you watch 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.660
 first release of a new category on my 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.420
 channel which will be called on 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.070
 advice to the whole world she will go 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.139
 as i will be acquainted with 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.389
 something new and in every issue I will 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.139
 share with you your impressions and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.139
 something to advise 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.170
 the shop is called boutique lila and sell 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.380
 there in french cosmetics perfume 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.689
 and me and mom have golden jewelery 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.180
 the rule is all our cosmetics should be 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.280
 high-quality and expensive and by the way you 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.559
 I advise you to use these rules too 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.510
 it is much better to buy at once expensive 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.309
 and high-quality cream than for 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.230
 long time to fix those 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.910
 the consequences that have come to you 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.670
 after using substandard 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.430
 products first you ask how 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.890
 You can buy cosmetics online 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.870
 Yes, I also did not know how to do it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.360
 nevertheless met 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.129
 representative of this store here 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.739
 you link in case you decide 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.690
 order something plant her catherine she 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.790
 she helped me to understand the site 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.820
 helped me find the one I needed 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 cosmetics and know i'm very pleased i 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.030
 already told you that makeup 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 I use at a minimum but there are such things 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.170
 which well, just have to be in 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.600
 Cosmetic bag any girls and this for example 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.520
 tonal cream again you ask how 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.140
 can order the foundation in 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.420
 online store because it is necessary 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.909
 match the skin color in this store 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.430
 only three tones of the foundation and they are not 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.930
 very different from each other recognized 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.000
 At first I wanted to order another 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.490
 concealer nevertheless followed 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.130
 advice Catherine and ordered tonal 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.380
 cream number one 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.040
 there were difficulties with the next order 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.200
 along with the fact that they sent me another 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.170
 Further 2 probnichka just this cream number 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.850
 2 and cream number three that's actually due 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.950
 That I tried all tonal 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 the cream is not me telling you that they are not 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.759
 very different from each other is not 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.950
 less if you doubt 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.140
 I have now contacted Ekaterina ionomer 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.990
 looked at my photos said that to me 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.119
 more suitable foundation for 1 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.520
 one though wanted to close the third to me 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.440
 it seems that the big difference would not have been a 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.630
 now tell you what I have so 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.250
 liked for these my friends was 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.680
 concealer which over 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.150
 some time was starting to flow and we didn't 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.250
 could find this explanation for me 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.150
 because she really painted 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.250
 neatly no divorce anything a 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.410
 after some time right here begin 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.180
 smudges I had a foundation 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.950
 which when you impose even 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.720
 small little power to them is 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.120
 feeling like you're on your face 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.030
 plaster of which i just don’t 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.430
 I accept in the cosmetics all the same girl 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.890
 should be natural and if we already 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.430
 cheating young people using here 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.350
 such things have to do it well so 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.930
 Here's the plus of this tonalnik is that he 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.330
 lays really like a cream i don't know 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.180
 than you usually apply makeup but to me 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.190
 I like to apply makeup, but 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.519
 such a brush and as Kate Clap used to say 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.549
 with hair and ass squirrels 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.910
 brush and this brush cream falls 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.799
 just perfect and not so he stays 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.930
 all on a tassel she's face nothing 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.150
 everything goes well closes everything 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.040
 irregularities of course yes due to the fact that he 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.100
 so light it doesn’t mean straight 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.620
 huge defects or acne though what am i 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.019
 it seems too terrible to gloss over and because 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.570
 which again turns out a huge layer 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.370
 plaster on the face that is well fu 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.459
 ugly go try girls so not 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.230
 do me as a person who 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.109
 constantly where are you performing video shoots 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.690
 or ride a photo shoot evens out the tone 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.459
 skin is just necessary because i 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.410
 just like any person I can not 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.810
 get enough sleep and I immediately appear 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.670
 the greatest silicas under the eyes which 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.829
 I would like to remove it from this 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.079
 foundation is very very good 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.850
 It turns out despite the fact that 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.280
 online stores I'm still a bit 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.069
 I'm afraid to order something I decided 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.470
 order what I don’t have now and what 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.290
 the worst thing I can not find 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.830
 yes i never draw myself hemi shadows 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.080
 eyebrow makeup but anyway 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.180
 for the performance I need to do 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.150
 bright makeup and I could not 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.330
 pick yourself black shadows that would 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.370
 I was suitable for performances but I will say 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.019
 honestly kindly didn't pick them up i just 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.270
 asked if you have black shadows for me 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.340
 said yes there is and said let's buy and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.200
 when they came to me I am very strong 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.650
 upset because instead of black 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.600
 shadows i saw pink and blue and i 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.090
 upset I thought god where would I be 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.080
 paint her pink shade I have too much 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.970
 not blue 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.520
 but imagine what was mine 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.840
 surprise when i started putting these 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.830
 the bluest shadows 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.690
 they turned gray black with 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.400
 amazing glare again I do not know 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.530
 like you but all the makeup i used to 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.690
 apply brushes so here it is 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.260
 the plan is the same as i don't use i use 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.480
 his brush but here lies in level 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.960
 nice about him and say nothing 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.850
 I can not 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.850
 the only thing I really really 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.740
 happy with the shadows and they suit me like 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.320
 for everyday makeup and 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.780
 and for evening makeup and makeup for 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.930
 speeches and taking advantage of this 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.190
 cosmetics for the past two weeks 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.600
 daily especially even today 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.169
 put on my face 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.050
 exactly the same foundation and all 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.780
 the most shadows for everyday makeup i 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.390
 I draw arrows with shadows, so these are 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.410
 dark slightly and grayish shadow me 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.900
 very fit 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.810
 shop boutique lilu took into account the fact that 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.220
 cosmetics must be selected individually 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.110
 this is how the whole catalog is compiled 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.240
 as well as gave you an example 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.610
 foundation he has number one 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.860
 and their number 3 and if you purchase 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.800
 3 this does not mean that you will 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.440
 Dyed like this Papuan cartoons 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.020
 As for prices, I do not think that 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.240
 Cosmetics there is very expensive but not 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.250
 very cheap in principle it costs 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.919
 as much as good should cost 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.290
