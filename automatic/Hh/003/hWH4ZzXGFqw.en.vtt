00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.860
 mirandola 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.260

 here stu here speaks and beautiful you know 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.720
 that even if you stay here there are languages 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.520
 locals also speak in the way why 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.140
 in the tired because you are tired but because 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.080
 I'm sick of it and I've had it 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.660
 a lung operation five years ago 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.910
 yes, of course 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:03.490
 in time I say is that we take back then 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.920
 you said you had this problem of 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.350
 recent will however you always have one 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.150
 person who has made friends in front of him 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:16.240
 here you pay shooting rightly 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.920
 so I'm still working anyway 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.970
 we can struggle in extreme this 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.060
 tell 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.060
 no 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.440
 at three years that no longer are 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.560
 the only thing I miss the job 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.530
 sure though because at some point 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.610
 because what this engine ever 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.610
 liked them this time though 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:55.480
 but what is the ass I do not know who is certain 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.760
 touched us since then favorite and see 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.770
 a moment we see this was before 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.810
 Opera 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.400
 well meanwhile, however, the art thing 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:14.440
 represents for you safe Fabrizio 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.150
 no knot present nothing well anyway 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.210
 here otherwise we present again in 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.780
 broletto wants to call some and the 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.800
 the only nice thing about domains 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.800
 some as we see a moment 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.160
 let's see a moment that is precisely this 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.660
 just this thing I have done to you 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.750
 certainly some practically the picture more 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.230
 of quality to this just does not play 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.900
 you too, however, a work that you have 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.420
 following which is inspired by matisse is fine 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.990
 but you see fabrizi and arabe 6 but it is a 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.750
 false 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.700
 certainly a couple that never works yours 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.580
 however this is important 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.670
 it is your work very well I want mortals 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.460
 because this is what people talk about 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.770
 look fabrizio po call you for this 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.660
 or other his normal works I think you 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.880
 also have pleasure in making them come 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.270
 so to host here they want to see 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:15.870
 numbers on cranes that can dine 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:18.010
 in short, this is still not mine 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.810
 the show anyway to show a 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.360
 this picture is from this collection 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.280
 it is not the work of fabrizio 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.570
 here is dean and then the last work that 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.490
 I want to show in our first one 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.610
 meeting with the artist then we'll see if 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:41.790
 we will still be able to show you others 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:45.270
 this is this of the nervous pd e 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.340
 however there are some stages that are 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.820
 now not because who built it 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.410
 years 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:55.530
 in fact, here I did not feel them I feel 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:05:00.050
 so fuck off but leave the last one 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.050
 greeting only on fuck off
