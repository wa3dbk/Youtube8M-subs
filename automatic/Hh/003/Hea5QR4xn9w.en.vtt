Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.160
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the run capacitor on your refrigerator.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.580
It’s a pretty easy job; all we’re going
to need is a quarter inch nut driver, and

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.790
a quarter inch socket and a small ratchet.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.120
Let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.640
Now to gain access to the run capacitor on
this refrigerator, which is located at the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.900
rear, we need to pull the refrigerator out
so that you can get at the back of it and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:31.810
disconnect the power supply and any water
lines that may be connected to the refrigerator.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.630
Then remove the screws that hold this metal
panel in place; they’re all quarter inch

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:45.600
hex head screws.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.710
Now the capacitor is located in behind the
condenser fan here and we’ve found the easiest

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.480
way to do this job is to remove two screws
that secure that fan bracket to the base of

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.290
the refrigerator.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:08.780
The first one we can access with our nut driver;
and these are slightly shorter screws than

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.380
the ones that held the panel on the back so
keep them separate.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:21.170
The second screw is in a little tighter spot
so we’ll need our ratchet to get that one

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.880
out.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:35.479
Now we’ll just move the cardboard cover
aside a little bit.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:46.830
Lift up on the fan motor and tilt it forward,
pull it out far enough to access the wire

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.431
harness and unplug it.

00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:58.979
It 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.829
will lift completely out of there.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:08.610
There’s two slots on the base frame of that
condenser fan motor that sit over two tabs

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.720
on the base here so when we reinstall that
we want to make sure to line those up properly.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.810
Now located directly inbehind that is our
run capacitor; there’s a metal shield overtop

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.810
of it.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:40.830
So with a quarter inch nut driver we’ll
remove that screw, then we can pull the capacitor

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.390
out far enough to disconnect the wires on
it.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:53.510
Remove the two wires.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.960
Reinstall them on the new capacitor.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.190
Make sure they fit nice and tight; if they’re
a little bit loose just crimp them with a

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.420
pair of needle nose pliers.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.220
Now there’s a little tab on the bottom of
this metal bracket or housing for that capacitor.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.230
We’ll need to make sure that that sits in
this opening here.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:36.730
Then we’ll line it up with the hole in the
base.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:04:07.120
Now we’re ready to reinstall the condenser
fan motor, get it in far enough so you can

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:24.990
connect with the wire harness, make sure it
fits tight.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:33.599
Now we need to line up those tabs in the base
frame with the slots in the frame for the

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.569
motor.

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:44.699
Remember to use the two shorter screws to
secure the bracket to the frame.

00:04:44.699 --> 00:05:02.080
Now we’re ready to reinstall the grille.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:12.120
We’re ready to reconnect the power, slide
the refrigerator into place, and our repair

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.860
is complete.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.710
Told you it was an easy job.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.130
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
