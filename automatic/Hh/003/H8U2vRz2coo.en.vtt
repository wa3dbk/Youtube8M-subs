190 horsepower she's a bit more than the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.649 
190 horsepower she's a bit more than the
original<00:01:16.409> Dino<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.950> Fort<00:01:17.340> Worth<00:01:17.520> 206<00:01:18.390> which

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
original Dino to Fort Worth 206 which

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.070 
original Dino to Fort Worth 206 which
was<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.560> two<00:01:19.920> liter<00:01:20.159> engine<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:20.820> aluminium

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
was a two liter engine all aluminium

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.149 
was a two liter engine all aluminium
block<00:01:22.850> which<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.000> were<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.270> too<00:01:24.479> many<00:01:24.689> but

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
block which they were not too many but

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.399 
block which they were not too many but
this<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.490> sort<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.750> second<00:01:27.750> series<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.290> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
this is the sort of second series if you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.160 
this is the sort of second series if you
like<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> spider<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.720> open<00:01:31.020> one

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
like and I think the spider the open one

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.789 
like and I think the spider the open one
is<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.920> lot<00:01:32.340> more<00:01:32.520> fun<00:01:32.759> than<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.570> coupe<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.350> which

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
is a lot more fun than the coupe a which

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.420 
is a lot more fun than the coupe a which
I<00:01:34.979> did<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.909> new<00:01:36.500> Imperial<00:01:37.500> best

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
I did have one new Imperial best

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.120 
I did have one new Imperial best
experience<00:01:39.320> that's<00:01:40.320> very<00:01:40.380> difficult<00:01:41.009> because

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
experience that's very difficult because

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.069 
experience that's very difficult because
there<00:01:41.369> are<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.490> many<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.210> done<00:01:42.390> many<00:01:42.930> many

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
there are so many we have done many many

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.910 
there are so many we have done many many
events<00:01:43.790> throughout<00:01:44.790> Europe<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.920> ones

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
events throughout Europe with it ones

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.910 
events throughout Europe with it ones
like<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.399> hopefully<00:01:48.390> are<00:01:48.680> generally<00:01:49.680> in

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
like this hopefully are generally in

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.620 
like this hopefully are generally in
better<00:01:50.460> weather<00:01:50.640> conditions<00:01:51.299> than<00:01:51.420> we've

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
better weather conditions than we've

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.660 
better weather conditions than we've
seen<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.979> roof<00:01:53.130> off<00:01:53.310> most

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
seen here so you have the roof off most

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.580 
seen here so you have the roof off most
of<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> time<00:01:54.890> but<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.189> put<00:01:56.490> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
of the time but to put I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.889 
of the time but to put I
I<00:01:58.740> can't<00:01:59.670> actually<00:01:59.880> think<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.539> know<00:02:00.659> which

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I can't actually think you know which

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.779 
I can't actually think you know which
would<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.530> which<00:02:01.859> would<00:02:02.070> be<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> best<00:02:02.549> one

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
would be the which would be the best one

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.080 
would be the which would be the best one
but<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.320> been<00:02:04.350> too<00:02:04.679> many<00:02:04.969> therapy<00:02:05.969> but

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
but there have been too many therapy but

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.669 
but there have been too many therapy but
they've<00:02:06.270> all<00:02:06.420> been<00:02:06.600> good<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.020> always<00:02:07.439> fun<00:02:07.649> to
