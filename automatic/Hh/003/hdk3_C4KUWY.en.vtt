I believe ladies got some some quite a

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
I believe ladies got some some quite a
bit<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.549> Malaysian<00:01:14.939> character<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.990> him<00:01:16.259> just

bit of Malaysian character with him just

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
bit of Malaysian character with him just
a<00:01:17.040> young<00:01:17.250> little<00:01:17.400> cockerel<00:01:19.549> he<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.850> not

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
a young little cockerel he is not

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.270 
a young little cockerel he is not
showing<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.619> much<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.979> me<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.100> now

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
showing out very much for me right now

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.219 
showing out very much for me right now
but<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.759> think<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.840> he<00:01:25.049> does

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
but I think that you can see he does

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.620 
but I think that you can see he does
have<00:01:25.409> an<00:01:25.500> extremely<00:01:26.009> short<00:01:26.220> back<00:01:26.490> his<00:01:27.150> hackle

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
have an extremely short back his hackle

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.410 
have an extremely short back his hackle
has<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:28.020> grown<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.530> at<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.970> he's<00:01:30.240> got

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
has not grown in at all and he's got

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.380 
has not grown in at all and he's got
plenty<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.750> chest<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.700> for<00:01:32.700> his<00:01:32.820> body<00:01:33.060> size<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
plenty of chest and for his body size I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.010 
plenty of chest and for his body size I
mean<00:01:33.810> he<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:35.060> extremely<00:01:36.060> extremely<00:01:36.390> small<00:01:36.960> I

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
mean he is extremely extremely small I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
mean he is extremely extremely small I
would<00:01:37.259> estimate<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.770> he<00:01:38.009> probably<00:01:38.220> weighs

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
would estimate that he probably weighs

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.219 
would estimate that he probably weighs
in<00:01:38.850> around<00:01:39.229> 10<00:01:40.229> ounces<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.990> he's<00:01:42.990> got

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
in around 10 ounces or so he's got

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.280 
in around 10 ounces or so he's got
plenty<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:46.579> leg<00:01:47.579> length<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.479> hold<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:49.049> his

plenty of a leg length to hold up his
wing

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
definitely short legged I'm not very

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.949

happy<00:03:54.340> with<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:54.970> was<00:03:55.209> hoping<00:03:55.480> his<00:03:55.720> legs

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
happy with that I was hoping his legs

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.210 
happy with that I was hoping his legs
would<00:03:56.079> grow<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.320> little<00:03:56.500> bit<00:03:56.620> but<00:03:56.950> he's<00:03:57.100> just

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
would grow a little bit but he's just

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.729 
would grow a little bit but he's just
got<00:03:57.400> little<00:03:57.640> studies<00:03:58.000> out<00:03:58.180> there<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.630> think<00:03:59.380> he

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
got little studies out there I think he

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.350 
got little studies out there I think he
would<00:03:59.890> be<00:03:59.920> excellent<00:04:00.700> if<00:04:00.880> he<00:04:01.030> had<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.180> little

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
would be excellent if he had a little

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.449 
would be excellent if he had a little
bit<00:04:01.480> longer<00:04:01.720> leg<00:04:02.220> all<00:04:03.220> right

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459
