 Terraces and wooden furniture 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.690
 We meet for a particularly long time 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.869
 Christoph Kauter who knows exactly what 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.029
 Natural products are special 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.769
 meaning for the longtime joy the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.230
 Patio furniture off a terrace floor 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.800
 Wood has regular care twice 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.900
 in the year 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.239
 Ideally, the end of autumn with 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:40.860
 Beginning of spring care for wood 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:44.340
 the best thing with a being lint free 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.690
 cloth a so-called wooden wall 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.010
 gray from the specialist trade of a brush 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.680
 a sponge of a care emulsion 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.710
 a paint bowl a long brush 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.300
 with style and a small brush have 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.579
 They already have everything they need 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.530
 Now there are three steps necessary 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.960
 to make your wood products fit 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.229
 first, the cleaning second, the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.729
 Refreshment and third, the care on 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.830
 we'll do it in the workshop of menz holz 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.159
 Let's knock a test floor today 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.530
 in front 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.409
 however, the instructions and tips apply 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.689
 also for wooden garden furniture as a basis 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.490
 for care, that is the surface 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.220
 dirt and dust must be free 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.570
 Use for cleaning the floor 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.640
 her best one essential 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.600
 So you can handle the coarse dirt well 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.000
 removed from the surface around the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.280
 Cleaning will complete our floor 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.409
 only with a fluff-free cloth 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.780
 after weight until the surface is dust 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.450
 points that is the clean up 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.570
 we'll take care of it next 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.890
 the research of the product 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.770
 due to the normal weathering 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.780
 the garden furniture and form of wood with 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.520
 the time a gray color to us 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.860
 want to counteract this process 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.899
 and the natural brown of the wood 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.000
 to bring to light again 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.950
 Let's inject our product first 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.769
 water is easiest with a 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.670
 garden hose 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.830
 then we wear one like that 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.290
 called wood and gray on it in 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.790
 can buy at any wood trade on 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.510
 best use one for that 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.090
 spray bottle after an exposure time of 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.430
 We scrub with one for about 15 minutes 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.650
 brush and some water to the wood and 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.690
 Gray must have our now carefully 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.940
 Soil dry for about eight hours 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.940
 we can start with the care 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.500
 to shorten the waiting time we have 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.580
 a second test area already 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.190
 let dry 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.370
 We will take care of this terrace now 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.980
 women care for the care of the soil 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.230
 The surface swam first 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.970
 carefully 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.859
 especially at difficult to reach 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.209
 put 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.489
 subsequently be with a being and 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.220
 a lint free cloth of dirt and 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.570
 dust away 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.340
 Finally, we treat our soil 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.430
 with a care ammo in the 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.920
 matching wood color it is important that 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.150
 you apply the emulsion thinly and also 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.170
 difficult to reach 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.569
 account 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.450
 use a long-handled brush 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.250
 to apply on large surfaces and 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.350
 a small brush for heavy 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.720
 accessible places and smaller areas 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.430
 the finished painting should turn 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.430
 dry for at least eight hours 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.930
 even if different means to 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.819
 surface treatment available 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.470
 stand and take care of emotions 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.150
 natural base the first choice 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.489
 These are not only gentle and 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.140
 intensive at the same time that wood one but 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.239
 also provide a long-term water 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.920
 repellent protective type for the wood 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.200
 the cleaning and care shown 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.690
 You should do it twice a year 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.019
 then live their wood products 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.610
 to use the wood and gray the longest 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.450
 They only if the wood is his 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.230
 Color intensity then loses a lot 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.230
 fun in the garden
