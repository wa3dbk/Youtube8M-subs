00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
kind of help us model it and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.399 
kind of help us model it and
visualize<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.970> prototype<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.990> extra

on the common paper we start modeling

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.670 
on the common paper we start modeling
and<00:02:15.180> instantly<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.260> print<00:02:16.440> something

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
and instantly we can print something

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.500 
and instantly we can print something
overnight<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.580> know<00:02:17.610> after<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.150> model<00:02:18.450> is

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
overnight you know after the model is

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.960 
overnight you know after the model is
done<00:02:18.569> we<00:02:19.019> can<00:02:19.050> try<00:02:19.349> different<00:02:19.489> detailed<00:02:20.489> level

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
done we can try different detailed level

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.460 
done we can try different detailed level
as<00:02:21.239> expressions<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.050> stuff<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.380> that

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
as expressions and stuff like that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.070 
as expressions and stuff like that
different<00:02:22.950> poses<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.819> we<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.060> we<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.569> do<00:02:24.900> that

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
different poses so we can we can do that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.820 
different poses so we can we can do that
you<00:02:25.500> know<00:02:25.620> very<00:02:25.980> quickly<00:02:26.190> overnight

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.410 

they're<00:02:32.830> miss<00:02:33.099> you<00:02:33.580> see<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.849> heterodyne<00:02:34.239> czar

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
they're miss you see the heterodyne czar

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.030 
they're miss you see the heterodyne czar
feeding<00:02:34.690> back<00:02:34.840> into<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> stimulus<00:02:35.620> reaction

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
motor control resistor units oh that's

00:02:40.060 --> 00:03:02.710 
motor control resistor units oh that's
good<00:02:40.620> nah<00:02:41.620> lady<00:02:42.010> that's<00:02:42.340> bad

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.750 

Oh
