wanted to show everybody basically how

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.170 
wanted to show everybody basically how
you<00:01:44.240> hook<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.630> Stoker<00:01:44.960> up<00:01:45.230> to<00:01:45.440> a<00:01:46.180> wireless

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
you hook the Stoker up to a wireless

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.760 
you hook the Stoker up to a wireless
router<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.930> then<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.140> control<00:01:48.440> it<00:01:48.560> with<00:01:48.680> the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
router and then you control it with the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.680 
router and then you control it with the
iPhone<00:01:48.890> doesn't<00:01:49.820> get<00:01:49.910> any<00:01:50.060> easier<00:01:50.120> than<00:01:50.630> that

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
iPhone doesn't get any easier than that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.370 
iPhone doesn't get any easier than that

so what I have here is basically a

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.410 
so what I have here is basically a
Ethernet<00:01:54.380> cable<00:01:54.770> that<00:01:54.920> runs<00:01:54.950> from<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.670> back

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
Ethernet cable that runs from the back

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.400 
Ethernet cable that runs from the back
of<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.690> Stoker<00:01:58.090> into<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.240> back<00:01:59.570> of<00:01:59.600> this<00:02:00.350> is

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
of the Stoker into the back of this is

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.700
