00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.170
 the trick is to take good 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.110
 references 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.400
 if you notice I take the edge of the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.850
 waistband for the fork twist and the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.299
 fold is exactly at the end of 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.299
 the previous 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.080
 you will have to take your own 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.380
 references 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.630
 This cloth is quite thick 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.570
 but I encourage you to make your own 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.240
 tests with finer fabrics or even 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.869
 with two fabrics together is a trick that 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.869
 works 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.680
 the folds have been left to simple 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.680
 equal sight 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.470
 but let's check it 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.860
 all have the measure of the fork 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.730
 at the beginning it's easy now we're going to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.730
 use the subway 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.630
 exactly two and a half centimeters each 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.630
 fold 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.970
 the size of the fork also influences 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.940
 clear the dessert fork or the fork 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.570
 of meat 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.570
 it's up to you 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.820
 a sewing plate with two forks 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.820
 until the next video
