it up to date I get about 17 18 hours on
a<00:00:11.340> machine<00:00:11.580> now<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.480> I've<00:00:13.230> made<00:00:13.410> some

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
a machine now and I've made some

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.410 
a machine now and I've made some
modifications<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.700> just<00:00:14.969> made<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> little

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
modifications that just made a little

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.099 
modifications that just made a little
bit<00:00:15.570> more<00:00:15.780> helpful<00:00:17.630> being<00:00:18.630> able<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.960> use<00:00:19.230> it

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
bit more helpful being able to use it

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.040 
bit more helpful being able to use it
first<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.289> all<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:23.180> took<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.510> wheels<00:00:24.750> off

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
first of all I took the wheels off

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.839 
first of all I took the wheels off
because<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.590> wasn't<00:00:25.890> using<00:00:26.250> them<00:00:26.460> very<00:00:26.640> much

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
because I wasn't using them very much

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.160 
because I wasn't using them very much
because<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.210> found<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.599> most<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> time

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
because I found out most of the time

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.720 
because I found out most of the time
that<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:30.349> grass<00:00:31.349> instead<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.099> being

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
that I was on the grass instead of being

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.180 
that I was on the grass instead of being
on<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.000> hard<00:00:33.300> surface<00:00:33.620> that<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:34.800> somewhat

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
on a hard surface that was somewhat

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.700 
on a hard surface that was somewhat
level<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.670> order<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.030> move<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.300> around<00:00:36.649> but<00:00:37.649> I

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
level in order to move it around but I

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.580 
level in order to move it around but I
made<00:00:38.040> up<00:00:38.219> these<00:00:39.559> posts<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:42.350> what's<00:00:43.350> nice

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
made up these posts and what's nice

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.209 
made up these posts and what's nice
about<00:00:43.620> them<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.840> that<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.710> pull<00:00:46.920> out<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
about them is that you can pull out the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.220 
about them is that you can pull out the
hitch<00:00:47.399> pin<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.610> take<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
hitch pin here and you can take and

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.600 
hitch pin here and you can take and

posts<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:57.090> top<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:58.530> put<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.010> pin<00:00:59.730> back

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
posts on top and then put the pin back

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.080 
posts on top and then put the pin back
in<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.570> they'll<00:01:01.020> store<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.829> right<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:03.030> so

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
in and they'll store up right here so

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.960 
in and they'll store up right here so
that<00:01:03.860> they're<00:01:04.860> out<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.309> way<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.760> they're

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
that they're out of the way but they're

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.940 
that they're out of the way but they're
close<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> machine<00:01:07.320> when<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.590> need<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
close to the machine when you need it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.429 
close to the machine when you need it
and<00:01:08.100> then<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:09.030> other<00:01:09.060> thing<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.170> when

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
and then the other thing is is that when

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.250 
and then the other thing is is that when
you<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.740> those<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:13.049> take

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you have those up like this you can take

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.320 
you have those up like this you can take
and<00:01:13.500> adjust<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:15.290> arm<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.680> order<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.250> or<00:01:18.030> your

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and adjust your arm in order to or your

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.910 
and adjust your arm in order to or your
foot<00:01:18.830> in<00:01:19.830> order<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.630> level<00:01:21.920> so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
foot in order to get the right level so

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.560 
foot in order to get the right level so
it<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.280> makes<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.700> lot<00:01:23.820> easier<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.330> then

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it just makes it a lot easier and then

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.740 
it just makes it a lot easier and then
you<00:01:24.720> don't<00:01:24.900> dig<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.560> turf<00:01:26.390> with<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:29.750> with

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you don't dig up the turf with the with

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.620 
you don't dig up the turf with the with
the<00:01:30.900> bottom<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> pad<00:01:32.210> as<00:01:33.210> you're<00:01:33.509> moving

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the bottom of the pad as you're moving

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.620 
the bottom of the pad as you're moving
it<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.009> was<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.030> purposes

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it so that was one of the the purposes

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.929 
it so that was one of the the purposes
that<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.840> did<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:38.040> works<00:01:38.250> real<00:01:38.520> nice<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that I did it and it works real nice and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.190 
that I did it and it works real nice and
it's<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.810> don't<00:01:39.869> know<00:01:40.049> if<00:01:40.140> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it's just kind of I don't know if you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.810 
it's just kind of I don't know if you
could<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.070> kind<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.520> sits

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
could see that but it just kind of sits

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.319 
could see that but it just kind of sits
in<00:01:42.000> between<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.689> two<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.890> works<00:01:44.329> whether

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
in between the two and it works whether

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.800 
in between the two and it works whether
simply<00:01:46.009> okay<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.189> other<00:01:47.220> thing<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.540> did

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
simply okay the other thing that we did

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.889 
simply okay the other thing that we did
is<00:01:49.310> we<00:01:50.310> remoted<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> key<00:01:51.530> we<00:01:52.530> took<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.040> of

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
is we remoted the key we took it out of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.870 
is we remoted the key we took it out of
this<00:01:54.899> area<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.460> then<00:01:57.200> remoted<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.880> to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this area here and then remoted it to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.450 
this area here and then remoted it to
right<00:02:00.119> here

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
right here

don't<00:02:24.750> know<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.290> read<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.770> our<00:02:25.920> meter

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
don't know if you can read the our meter

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.040 
don't know if you can read the our meter
kind<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.880> hard<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.830> for<00:02:28.830> me<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.100> see<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.430> here

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
kind of hard to for me to see it here

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.100 
kind of hard to for me to see it here
but<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.230> an<00:02:31.350> hour<00:02:31.440> meter<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:31.950> diameter<00:02:33.110> it

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
but it's an hour meter in diameter it

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.840 
but it's an hour meter in diameter it
runs<00:02:34.440> at<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.280> slow<00:02:35.700> idle<00:02:36.090> position<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:37.850> right

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
runs at the slow idle position is right

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.560 
runs at the slow idle position is right
around<00:02:39.000> about<00:02:39.830> 1800<00:02:40.830> 1900<00:02:41.280> rpms<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.390> I

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
around about 1800 1900 rpms and I

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.449 
around about 1800 1900 rpms and I
normally<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.410> just<00:02:43.500> leaved<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.070> machine

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
normally I just leaved the machine

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.130 
normally I just leaved the machine
running<00:02:44.700> at<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.120> level<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.840> works<00:02:46.020> very

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
running at that level and it works very

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.280 
running at that level and it works very
nicely<00:02:47.270> some<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> other<00:02:48.540> things<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.080> I've

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
nicely some of the other things and I've

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.840 
nicely some of the other things and I've
changed<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:50.010> there<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.760> course<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.239> put<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:52.850> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
changed on there of course I put the the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.760 
changed on there of course I put the the
throttle<00:02:54.860> down<00:02:55.860> here<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.910> then<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:58.080> just<00:02:58.140> ran

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
throttle down here and then I just ran

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.160 
throttle down here and then I just ran
it<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.489> back<00:02:59.700> here<00:03:00.209> again<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.940> 420

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
it the back here again this is the 420

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.289

a dream it's a bad rihanna's so that's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.640 
a dream it's a bad rihanna's so that's
pretty<00:03:20.850> much<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.260> on<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.519> updates<00:03:24.650> I've

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
pretty much it on the the updates I've

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.590 
pretty much it on the the updates I've
changed<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.190> couple<00:03:26.430> times<00:03:26.760> again<00:03:27.330> just

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
changed it a couple times again just

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.030 
changed it a couple times again just
making<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.110> little<00:03:28.200> bit<00:03:28.410> more<00:03:28.590> convenient

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
making it a little bit more convenient

the 13 that comes with it this is the dr
bucket<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.200> converted<00:03:43.860> this<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.340> 16

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
bucket that I converted this is the 16

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.199 
bucket that I converted this is the 16
inch<00:03:45.650> it's<00:03:46.650> not<00:03:46.829> quite<00:03:47.130> as<00:03:47.310> deep<00:03:47.579> doesn't<00:03:48.060> have

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
inch it's not quite as deep doesn't have

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.830 
inch it's not quite as deep doesn't have
as<00:03:48.299> much<00:03:48.510> volume<00:03:49.130> as<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.310> 13<00:03:51.000> but<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.600> gives

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
as much volume as the 13 but it gives

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.470 
as much volume as the 13 but it gives
you<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.110> extra<00:03:52.530> three<00:03:52.769> inch<00:03:52.950> width<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.640> it's

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
you the extra three inch width and it's

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.539 
you the extra three inch width and it's
real<00:03:54.720> nice<00:03:54.870> for<00:03:55.200> cleaning<00:03:55.560> out<00:03:55.680> larger<00:03:56.130> areas

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
real nice for cleaning out larger areas

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.640 
real nice for cleaning out larger areas
and<00:03:57.090> leveling<00:03:57.630> them<00:03:57.810> down<00:03:58.049> if<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.410> want<00:03:58.590> to

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650

level something a little bit teeth are a

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.440 
level something a little bit teeth are a
little<00:04:01.260> smaller

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
little smaller

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.180

here's the gusset that I talked about in

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.550 
here's the gusset that I talked about in
one<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.609> my<00:04:14.700> other<00:04:14.850> videos<00:04:14.940> I'm<00:04:15.630> confer

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560

one of my other videos I'm confer
you<00:04:16.889> have<00:04:17.129> to<00:04:17.280> take<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.699> weld<00:04:17.879> it<00:04:18.060> back<00:04:18.090> onto

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
you have to take and weld it back onto

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.199 
you have to take and weld it back onto
the<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.439> bushing<00:04:19.889> and<00:04:20.189> then<00:04:20.699> this<00:04:20.819> has<00:04:21.030> all

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
the the bushing and then this has all

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.050 
the the bushing and then this has all
been<00:04:21.239> welded<00:04:21.930> back<00:04:22.079> on<00:04:22.379> -<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.770> all<00:04:23.639> works

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
been welded back on - it all works

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.149 
been welded back on - it all works
rather<00:04:24.300> well<00:04:24.479> it's<00:04:25.139> the<00:04:25.259> same<00:04:25.530> with<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.740> one

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
rather well it's the same with that one

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:32.089 
rather well it's the same with that one
and<00:04:26.639> then<00:04:27.599> that's<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.139> tooth<00:04:30.319> and<00:04:31.319> I<00:04:31.830> just

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
and then that's the tooth and I just

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.020 
and then that's the tooth and I just
recently<00:04:32.280> were<00:04:32.729> able<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:33.180> use<00:04:33.330> all<00:04:34.759> well<00:04:35.759> most

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
recently were able to use all well most

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.350 
recently were able to use all well most

I<00:04:44.900> used<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.199> tooth<00:04:47.629> the<00:04:48.629> 13-inch<00:04:49.639> to<00:04:50.639> get

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
I used the tooth the 13-inch to get

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.610 
I used the tooth the 13-inch to get
around<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.389> break<00:04:51.900> some<00:04:52.139> of<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.349> stuff

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
around it and break some of the stuff

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.559 
around it and break some of the stuff
loose<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:53.159> then<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.370> went<00:04:53.550> in<00:04:53.729> with<00:04:53.819> the<00:04:54.000> 9-inch

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
loose and then I went in with the 9-inch

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:01.700 
loose and then I went in with the 9-inch
in<00:04:55.289> order<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:56.120> under<00:04:57.120> mind<00:04:57.659> the<00:04:59.539> tree<00:05:00.710> stumps

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
in order to under mind the tree stumps

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.770 
in order to under mind the tree stumps
so<00:05:01.770> that<00:05:02.039> I<00:05:02.069> could<00:05:02.340> pull<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:02.550> out<00:05:02.759> but<00:05:03.569> that's

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
so that I could pull it out but that's

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.089 
so that I could pull it out but that's
kind<00:05:04.020> of<00:05:04.110> it<00:05:05.659> not<00:05:06.659> any<00:05:07.020> problems<00:05:07.680> with<00:05:07.919> it

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
kind of it not any problems with it

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.800 
kind of it not any problems with it
whatsoever<00:05:08.129> with<00:05:08.909> the<00:05:09.029> hydraulics<00:05:09.629> or

anything<00:05:09.990> else<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:11.610> machine<00:05:11.969> just<00:05:12.180> keeps

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
anything else the machine just keeps

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.809 
anything else the machine just keeps
running<00:05:13.819> very<00:05:14.819> happy<00:05:15.240> with<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:16.430> my<00:05:17.430> neighbors

running very happy with it my neighbors
have<00:05:18.029> found<00:05:18.300> many<00:05:18.840> projects<00:05:19.590> for<00:05:20.069> me<00:05:20.159> to<00:05:20.250> help

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
have found many projects for me to help

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.950 
have found many projects for me to help
them<00:05:20.580> with<00:05:21.979> so<00:05:22.979> it's<00:05:23.699> been<00:05:23.940> very<00:05:23.969> convenient

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
them with so it's been very convenient

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.519 
them with so it's been very convenient
it<00:05:25.139> sure<00:05:25.409> beats<00:05:25.650> a<00:05:25.800> shovel<00:05:26.419> so<00:05:27.419> I<00:05:27.810> would<00:05:28.289> highly

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 
it sure beats a shovel so I would highly

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:33.800 
it sure beats a shovel so I would highly
recommend<00:05:29.039> it<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.900> I<00:05:31.069> think<00:05:32.069> that<00:05:32.690> it's<00:05:33.690> a

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
recommend it and I think that it's a

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.260 
recommend it and I think that it's a
good<00:05:33.990> piece<00:05:34.199> of<00:05:34.259> equipment<00:05:34.849> you<00:05:35.849> got<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.150> keep

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
good piece of equipment you got to keep

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.800 
good piece of equipment you got to keep
it<00:05:36.479> well<00:05:36.690> greased<00:05:37.080> and<00:05:37.669> I<00:05:38.669> use<00:05:38.849> a<00:05:38.879> pin<00:05:39.270> greaser

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
it well greased and I use a pin greaser

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.260 
it well greased and I use a pin greaser
and<00:05:40.199> it<00:05:40.560> works<00:05:40.800> really<00:05:41.099> simple<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:41.819> just<00:05:42.060> take

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
and it works really simple you just take

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.050 
and it works really simple you just take
the<00:05:42.479> pin<00:05:43.349> and<00:05:45.830> see<00:05:46.830> if<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.009> got<00:05:47.250> that<00:05:47.460> right<00:05:47.729> okay

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
the pin and see if I got that right okay

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.959 
the pin and see if I got that right okay
and<00:05:48.270> you<00:05:49.020> just<00:05:49.050> push<00:05:49.589> in<00:05:49.860> on<00:05:50.190> the<00:05:50.490> little<00:05:50.669> ball

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
and you just push in on the little ball

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:56.149 
and you just push in on the little ball
and<00:05:51.770> it's<00:05:52.770> got<00:05:53.039> a<00:05:53.069> rubber<00:05:54.409> kind<00:05:55.409> of<00:05:55.500> a<00:05:55.560> gasket

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
and it's got a rubber kind of a gasket

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.390 
and it's got a rubber kind of a gasket
on<00:05:56.190> it<00:05:56.580> and<00:05:56.990> it<00:05:57.990> seals<00:05:58.349> it<00:05:58.620> as<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.889> grease<00:05:59.129> goes

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
on it and it seals it as the grease goes

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.760 
on it and it seals it as the grease goes
in<00:05:59.699> so<00:06:00.029> as<00:06:00.180> you<00:06:00.330> can<00:06:00.449> see<00:06:00.509> the<00:06:00.900> machine<00:06:01.289> is<00:06:01.589> well

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
in so as you can see the machine is well

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:09.350 
in so as you can see the machine is well
greased<00:06:03.229> and<00:06:05.060> I<00:06:07.310> have<00:06:08.310> really<00:06:09.089> done<00:06:09.300> nothing

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
every 20 hours but nothing loosened up

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:16.969 
every 20 hours but nothing loosened up
on<00:06:16.469> the<00:06:16.589> machine

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
on the machine

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.939 
on the machine
everything's<00:06:17.729> been<00:06:18.199> been<00:06:19.199> fine<00:06:21.710> well<00:06:22.710> I<00:06:22.740> also

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.889 
I change these these are kind of a
tapered<00:06:25.800> pin<00:06:26.130> as<00:06:26.819> you<00:06:27.240> can<00:06:27.389> see<00:06:27.569> they<00:06:27.750> don't

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:27.899 
tapered pin as you can see they don't

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:29.570 
tapered pin as you can see they don't
see<00:06:28.319> it<00:06:28.380> all<00:06:28.560> the<00:06:28.709> way<00:06:28.830> down

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
but they keep the axle tighter for

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.300 
but they keep the axle tighter for
towing<00:06:32.009> that's<00:06:32.849> another<00:06:33.150> tip<00:06:33.889> like<00:06:34.889> the<00:06:35.069> pass

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
towing that's another tip like the pass

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.969 
towing that's another tip like the pass
on<00:06:35.639> so<00:06:36.449> it's<00:06:36.599> good<00:06:36.780> machine<00:06:37.169> everything<00:06:37.860> is
