00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
wanted to do that so anytime we get to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
tonight just really should just how

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.619 
tonight just really should just how
special<00:00:40.770> over<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> city<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.820> fans<00:00:42.059> truly

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
special over the city and the fans truly

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:54.080 
special over the city and the fans truly
I<00:00:51.980> think<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.309> always<00:00:53.460> weren't<00:00:53.760> there<00:00:53.910> at<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
I think you always weren't there at the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.430 
I think you always weren't there at the
end<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> season<00:00:54.809> what<00:00:54.960> could<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.260> been

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
end of the season what could have been

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.709 
end of the season what could have been
if<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:56.190> thing<00:00:56.550> happened<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.570> bit

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
if one thing happened a little bit

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.590 
if one thing happened a little bit
differently<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.829> think<00:00:59.460> overall<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
differently but I think overall the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.720 
differently but I think overall the
season<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.109> general<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.699> know

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
season in general it just you know

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.729 
season in general it just you know
things<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.239> didn't<00:01:03.629> really<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:04.019> away<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
things just didn't really go away and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.100 
things just didn't really go away and
not<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.430> put<00:01:05.580> any<00:01:05.729> excuses<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.930> think<00:01:07.909> for<00:01:09.110> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
not to put any excuses I think for the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.730 
not to put any excuses I think for the
players<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> opportunity

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
players that we have for the opportunity

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.640 
players that we have for the opportunity
I<00:01:12.770> think<00:01:13.220> we<00:01:13.370> can<00:01:13.549> do<00:01:13.670> better<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:15.020> that's

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
I think we can do better and that's

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.170 
I think we can do better and that's
always<00:01:15.770> like<00:01:15.950> art<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.340> doesn't<00:01:16.369> season<00:01:17.060> to

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
always like art it doesn't season to

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.300 
always like art it doesn't season to
think<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.710> but<00:01:18.710> I<00:01:18.740> think<00:01:19.010> like<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.280> said

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
think that but I think like you said

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.820 
think that but I think like you said
going<00:01:19.760> forward<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.479> think<00:01:20.690> we<00:01:20.810> have<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.229> good

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
going forward I think we have a good

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.920 
going forward I think we have a good
idea<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.190> where<00:01:22.610> we're<00:01:22.790> going<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:23.180> next<00:01:23.630> season

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
idea of where we're going in next season

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.450 
idea of where we're going in next season
I'm<00:01:24.050> sure<00:01:24.350> everybody<00:01:24.770> just<00:01:24.920> wants<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.220> start

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
I'm sure everybody just wants to start

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.800 
I'm sure everybody just wants to start
next<00:01:25.610> season<00:01:25.759> again<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:26.390> press<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.690> reset

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
next season again and press the reset

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.590 
next season again and press the reset
button<00:01:27.050> and<00:01:27.380> get<00:01:27.590> back<00:01:27.770> on<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:27.950> field<00:01:28.479> so<00:01:29.479> in

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
button and get back on the field so in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:52.389 
button and get back on the field so in
that<00:01:29.750> way<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:29.960> think<00:01:30.320> we're<00:01:30.619> encouraged<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:51.399> is

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
that way I think we're encouraged and is

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.790 
that way I think we're encouraged and is
imperative<00:01:53.240> it<00:01:53.720> is<00:01:53.840> not<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.289> way<00:01:56.800> two

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
imperative it is not that way two

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.130 
imperative it is not that way two

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.809 
take into western New York as well or
something<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.860> guys<00:02:12.980> think<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.459> take<00:02:13.610> it

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
something you guys think you can take it

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.180 
something you guys think you can take it
to<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.030> next<00:02:14.150> season<00:02:14.390> yeah<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.350> think<00:02:15.470> both<00:02:15.830> I

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
to the next season yeah I think both I

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.860 
to the next season yeah I think both I
think<00:02:16.700> when<00:02:16.940> were<00:02:17.060> able<00:02:17.329> to<00:02:17.360> play<00:02:17.570> with<00:02:17.720> that

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
think when were able to play with that

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.479 
think when were able to play with that
freedom<00:02:18.260> especially<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.489> attack<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:22.280> see

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
freedom especially in the attack you see

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.509 
freedom especially in the attack you see
really<00:02:22.670> good<00:02:22.880> things<00:02:23.150> from<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.230> team<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.739> I

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
really good things from the team and I

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.069 
really good things from the team and I
think<00:02:25.610> we're<00:02:25.940> going<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> play<00:02:26.239> like<00:02:26.480> tight<00:02:26.780> I

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
think we're going to play like tight I

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.590 
think we're going to play like tight I
think<00:02:27.560> we're<00:02:28.130> not<00:02:28.250> able<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.670> play<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.299> way<00:02:29.329> we

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
think we're not able to play the way we

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.509 
think we're not able to play the way we
want<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.560> think<00:02:30.769> sometimes<00:02:30.980> we<00:02:31.340> just

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
want to and I think sometimes we just

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.059 
want to and I think sometimes we just
played<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> little<00:02:32.390> tight<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:32.840> season<00:02:33.260> and

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
played a little tight this season and

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.399 
played a little tight this season and
were<00:02:34.159> able<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:34.670> relax<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.659> fight<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.260> way

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
were able to relax and fight it the way

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.080 
were able to relax and fight it the way
that<00:02:36.439> we're<00:02:36.709> capable<00:02:36.829> of<00:02:37.249> playing<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.819> I

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
that we're capable of playing and I

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.899 
that we're capable of playing and I
think<00:02:38.420> Western<00:02:38.810> New<00:02:38.930> York<00:02:39.049> will<00:02:39.170> be<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.349> same

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
think Western New York will be the same

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:48.520 
think Western New York will be the same
actually<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:46.209> mean<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.510> feel<00:02:47.870> like<00:02:48.049> I<00:02:48.230> was<00:02:48.379> like
