00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 talk 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.410
 the other day I asked by facebook what 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.450
 topic they wanted me to talk about in the next 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.099
 video or in this and most of 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.289
 people I agreed that he will speak 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.270
 about the mods so I'll talk about the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.460
 spiders and mini grace there are two classes 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.859
 of spiders classes not types the spider of 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.000
 cave and the normal spider is you because not 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.010
 it tells us it's normal is in us 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.330
 also just being cave we are not 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.400
 deformed 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.140
 to get rid of monster starting with the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.730
 cave spiders have told me out there that 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.520
 the cave spiders we can 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.079
 find in the caves but I have 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.790
 my doubts to lines of roe to 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.860
 difference of normal spiders are 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.450
 smaller ones and if it touches you it poisons you 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.340
 I say it for stupid experience 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.260
 strange but in spite of this the spiders 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.850
 they have good things like for example if 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.680
 one day he is alone in an abandoned cave 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.899
 with half a heart and you meet 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.910
 a spider the spider kills you to a wait 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.530
 in the good stupid ones to the year to which 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.030
 did good of the cave spiders is 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.590
 that they will never be caught in your house 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.840
 not that your house is in a cave 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.550
 because normal tasks are thieves 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.140
 professionals, I also tell you 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.330
 experience because you think my house 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.780
 it is surrounded by glass there are sure 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.220
 I feel 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.810
 with glasses I do not care if fold or 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.619
 no but if I did not have the crystals 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.619
 I would pass this 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.330
 all right 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.530
 [Applause] 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.940
 [Music] 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.040
 That day was horrible but if you tell me 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.660
 choose from a spider cave and 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.340
 normal girl I think I would stay with a 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.050
 cave spider at least they are not so 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.630
 trolls why do I tell you this so 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.340
 what happened to me once I still remember it was 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.229
 horrible I will tell you I was 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.300
 happy life killing premium 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.250
 how can I when I suddenly start 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.350
 hearing very strange sounds I did not see anything 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.630
 and as it was getting dark I decided to go home 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.490
 keep walking and every time I heard more 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.440
 near the sounds I started to scare 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.420
 then I bravely turned and I 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.330
 I faced the problem to see what happens 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.250
 want you want from there is a clue ni 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.440
 a fool for those who did not give 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.509
 account killed me an invisible spider a 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.890
 invisible spider that did not look anything else 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.750
 why you prefer cave spiders 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.300
 is because normal spiders are at 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.710
 side of the premium that as I do not know then 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.149
 because the spiders are quality of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.910
 skeletons and the skeletons of the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.010
 premium so it's easy to deduce it good 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.600
 that and because I have your yen contract 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.830
 here specific everything now that we're 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.780
 talking about the alliance of the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.340
 skeletons and spiders will ever 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.440
 have asked how is it that they form a 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.270
 spider jokin who you do not know because I 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.340
 yes and I'm going to show you hey let's go 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.050
 do the merger yes or no if you want 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.050
 and I 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:40.120
 [Music] 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.200
 question of what country are you now that 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.900
 you know what country I am from I would like to know 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.820
