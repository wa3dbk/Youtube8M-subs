this can be seen in the mathematics with

square<00:00:39.170> law<00:00:40.239> we<00:00:41.239> have<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.690> inverse<00:00:41.989> square

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
square law we have the inverse square

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.709 
square law we have the inverse square

in<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.560> theory<00:02:25.040> mass<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.030> byproduct<00:02:26.510> of

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
in this theory mass is a byproduct of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.160 
in this theory mass is a byproduct of
time<00:02:27.349> dilation<00:02:27.880> when<00:02:28.880> time<00:02:29.180> slows<00:02:29.569> down

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
time dilation when time slows down

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.530 
time dilation when time slows down
it<00:02:30.380> takes<00:02:30.680> more<00:02:30.890> effort<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:32.030> move<00:02:32.239> an<00:02:32.390> object

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
it takes more effort to move an object

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.830 
it takes more effort to move an object
from<00:02:32.989> A<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.349> B<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.790> seen<00:02:35.030> as<00:02:35.209> an

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
from A to B and this is seen as an

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.160 
from A to B and this is seen as an
increase<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.410> mass<00:02:37.030> also<00:02:38.170> Einsteins

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
increase in mass also Einsteins

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.860 
increase in mass also Einsteins
equivalence<00:02:39.650> principle<00:02:40.370> between<00:02:41.180> gravity

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.350 
equivalence principle between gravity
and<00:02:42.080> acceleration<00:02:42.849> falls<00:02:43.849> out<00:02:44.090> of<00:02:44.120> this

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
and acceleration falls out of this

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.040 
and acceleration falls out of this
theory<00:02:45.190> because<00:02:46.190> energy<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.819> momentum<00:02:47.050> have

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
theory because energy and momentum have

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.259 
theory because energy and momentum have
to<00:02:48.290> increase<00:02:48.680> for<00:02:49.220> an<00:02:49.310> object<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.700> accelerate

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
to increase for an object to accelerate

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.830 
to increase for an object to accelerate
time<00:02:51.080> dilation<00:02:51.560> will<00:02:52.160> increase<00:02:52.730> relative<00:02:53.360> to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
time dilation will increase relative to

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.949 
time dilation will increase relative to
the<00:02:53.959> acceleration<00:02:55.060> therefore<00:02:56.060> we<00:02:56.180> have<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
the acceleration therefore we have the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.320 
the acceleration therefore we have the
equivalence<00:02:57.470> principle<00:02:57.709> between<00:02:58.640> gravity

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330

and<00:02:59.480> acceleration<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:00.890> will<00:03:01.160> be<00:03:01.280> felt<00:03:01.549> as<00:03:01.790> a

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
and acceleration this will be felt as a

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.940 
and acceleration this will be felt as a
nurturer<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:03.080> direction<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.680> the

nurturer in the direction of the

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.690 
nurturer in the direction of the
acceleration<00:03:05.799> therefore<00:03:06.799> we<00:03:06.950> have<00:03:07.160> Isaac

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
acceleration therefore we have Isaac

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.600 
acceleration therefore we have Isaac
