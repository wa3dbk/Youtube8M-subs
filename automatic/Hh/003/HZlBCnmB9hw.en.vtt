00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
life and it became pivotal at the stage

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.390 
life and it became pivotal at the stage
and<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:33.070> I<00:00:33.100> decided<00:00:33.490> to<00:00:35.010> take<00:00:36.010> some<00:00:36.070> of<00:00:36.340> the

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.779 
and so I decided to take some of the
ideas<00:00:36.520> and<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:37.030> ideals<00:00:37.390> that<00:00:37.630> I<00:00:38.620> found<00:00:38.920> in<00:00:39.220> the

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
ideas and the ideals that I found in the

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.139 
ideas and the ideals that I found in the
dance<00:00:40.239> scene<00:00:40.750> and<00:00:41.550> put<00:00:42.550> them<00:00:42.699> to<00:00:42.789> work<00:00:42.910> in<00:00:42.969> my

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149

life<00:00:43.360> one<00:00:43.629> hundred<00:00:43.870> percent<00:00:43.899> and<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:46.120> this

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
life one hundred percent and so this

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.020

in<00:04:26.550> some<00:04:27.360> countries<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:28.020> is<00:04:28.820> quadruple<00:04:31.490> what

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
in some countries it is quadruple what

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.840 
in some countries it is quadruple what
