elections will start to take place and I

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.689 
elections will start to take place and I
think<00:00:24.269> there<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.019> there's<00:00:25.529> anger<00:00:25.769> surrounding

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
think there is there's anger surrounding

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.390 
think there is there's anger surrounding
this<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.240> impatience<00:00:28.199> now<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:29.010> what<00:00:29.130> do<00:00:29.220> what

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
this and impatience now but what do what

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.429 
this and impatience now but what do what
is<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> reason<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.599> slow<00:00:30.840> movement<00:00:31.140> is

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
is the reason for the slow movement is

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.959 
is the reason for the slow movement is
this<00:00:31.590> simply<00:00:31.890> because<00:00:32.189> these<00:00:32.340> things<00:00:32.640> take

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
this simply because these things take

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.080 
this simply because these things take
time<00:00:33.030> or<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.050> has<00:00:34.350> some<00:00:34.559> people<00:00:34.829> suspect

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
time or is it has some people suspect

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.500 
time or is it has some people suspect
the<00:00:36.090> presence<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.870> many<00:00:37.399> Mubarak<00:00:38.510> former

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the presence of so many Mubarak former

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.229 
the presence of so many Mubarak former
officials<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> existing<00:00:40.800> structure<00:00:41.239> well

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
officials in the existing structure well

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.389 
officials in the existing structure well
interestingly<00:00:42.750> enough<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.500> politics

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
interestingly enough there are politics

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.680 
interestingly enough there are politics
involved<00:00:44.930> that<00:00:45.930> would<00:00:46.079> indicate<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.129> latter

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
involved that would indicate the latter

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.690 
involved that would indicate the latter
that<00:00:48.690> there<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.050> no<00:00:49.260> real<00:00:49.649> reason<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.160> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
that there is no real reason for this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.529 
that there is no real reason for this
timeline<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.449> postponed<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.329> is

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
timeline to be postponed and so this is

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.139 
timeline to be postponed and so this is
why<00:00:54.750> today<00:00:55.550> thousands<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.730> taking<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
why today thousands are taking to the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.299 
why today thousands are taking to the
streets<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:58.440> mention<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.010> mostly

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
streets I will mention that it's mostly

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.500
