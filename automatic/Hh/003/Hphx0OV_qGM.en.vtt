00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.079
 i 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.910
 but who attacks because we're going to receive 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.770
 the next finalist in this case is 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.770
 with you I looked 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:41.730
 elegant thank you very much many thanks 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.800
 thank you good with the votes and the people 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.290
 It's nerves, after all these years 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.460
 of trajectory you are relaxed no no no 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.559
 I think it has nothing to do with 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.860
 trajectory of course that always 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.809
 I think that beyond 31 years with 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.540
 my brother with pimpernel this is a 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.610
 new challenge but more than nerves and more 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.309
 that expectant who wins is a 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.410
 emotion as of having finished having 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.759
 shared these months with so many people 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.040
 what has made me pass moments 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.840
 wonderful all my companions 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.250
 production all the people that 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.600
 works in all that are part of 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.400
 your face sounds to me 'well we saw well no 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.060
 make me talk 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.060
 wait 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.189
 eliminated and beaten by all 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.290
 but nothing good 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.390
 so not grateful mainly more 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.880
 that more than nerves is that is 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.680
 thanks and emotion and contain me 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.930
 to not start crying to the screams 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.060
 that soon I will do so 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.979
 do not cause so much obviously 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.510
 I'm delighted I have other people here 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.970
 trying to imitate clear this was the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.770
 first time this was the first time as 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.229
 good singer as an actress says things 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.420
 comedy and dramatic film does what 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.720
 be but singing imitating other 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.720
 singers 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.080
 apart from singers he was admired 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.630
 all my life and also having fun 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.149
 when my classmates came down 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.800
 that is, we have been boys playing in 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.800
 this game and that's priceless
