00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.009
 your Majesty

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.710
 brother town of chile 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.930
 the history our america the story the great homeland 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.080
 in the cited and the cibao 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.160
 who recorded the heroic episodes of our heroes from Bolivar San 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.090
 Martin 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.390
 manuela sáenz and artigas in this fertile province and network chile 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.590
 the conflict and for the home like 15 josé miguel carrillo and manuel 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.130
 rodríguez 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.079
 the anticolonial struggle left that footprint dignity 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.770
 but at the same time 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.450
 the republican history brought new manifestations of greed as the 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.710
 voracity of savage capitalism 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.100
 and neoliberalism 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.100
 that is why he believes that gold is inequality inequality 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.600
 repressive governments and interviews 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.750
 the breasts for poverty 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.220
 what politicians do 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.920
 in this way our region 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.700
 uneven slats of the world 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.240
 Latin America let's never forget pillar the most unequal region in the world and 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.090
 s from the starting point for any discussion 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.960
 on social cohesion 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.170
 on average latin america the world middle class 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.100
 for poorer regions such as Africa and certain sectors of Asia 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.860
 here we can find poorer poor people than in africa 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.040
 and rich richer than in Switzerland 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.770
 it has never been in consequence of this region a paradigm of social question 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.250
 However, during the long and sad neoliberal night that our 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.530
 continent 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.530
 the destruction of social cohesion was exacerbated 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.359
 suddenly 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:02.480
 that execrable defect manel selfishness 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.370
 it became the ultimate social virtue 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.759
 the competition became the way of life 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.170
 supposedly invisible hands were those that were going to give us the maximum 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.799
 happiness 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.819
 in that context then 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.479
 so that to have a social project in common 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.999
 why have any cohesion 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.049
 Let's not fool ourselves 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.999
 perhaps the most nefarious legacy of neoliberalism has been the destruction 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.740
 of social cohesion 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.279
 in Latin America 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.239
 as long as the gospel of the market prevails 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.539
 seek the end of profit and the rest will blow in addition 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.129
 it will be very difficult to achieve true social cohesion 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.679
 while societies bidegi people 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.719
 are subject to the lequi market 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.479
 where the excluded 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.079
 the poor the miserable 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.349
 they are considered little less than collateral damage 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 very hard there will be social cohesion 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.879
 and if something taught us the 20th century 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.869
 is that the most prosperous countries 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:06.989
 they are no longer those who have more abundance natural resource work 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.799
 human physical capital 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.799
 but those with the greatest human talent and cohesion 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.959
 since without a project of life in common 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.929
 by resource that I have a country 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:20.899
 simply this social community will not be able to get ahead 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:24.149
 in consecuense 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.659
 your Majesty 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.659
 Mr. President, gentlemen, heads of state, friendly friends 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:31.029
 talk about social issue 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:34.739
 can only be understood through consecration to the interests of the 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:35.869
 majorities 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:39.909
 with systems that break the deep economic and social asymmetries 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.309
 and give voice to those who never had it 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.999
 a democracy that channels social transformation 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:51.199
 demanded by our peoples and for everyone to have access to justice 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:53.279
 to work 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:55.719
 and dignity 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.379
 in this context 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.539
 I also propose that this summit 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:04.199
 pronounced radical way in its condemnation of racism and xenophobia 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.539
 we can not forget the great neruda 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.719
 that proclaimed that before the hairdressing jacket 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:14.829
 is already americ of the wonderful civilization of torches petrov life 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.009
 harvest 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.289
 this is the time of the peoples of the epochal change 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.840
 it is also the time the woman of america 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.840
 will represent in Chile by the word and tenderness and mistral gabriela 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.650

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:40.610
 and proclaimed on behalf of my people 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.610
 the reversible will to build a sovereign homeland 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.169
 that humiliates us before the powerful to be 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.050
 together with the brother nations of Ibero-America worthy of the inheritance that 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.779
