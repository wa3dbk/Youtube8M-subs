I<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.559> think<00:00:37.649> lattices<00:00:38.070> cool<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.340> never

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
I just think lattices cool I never

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.220 
I just think lattices cool I never
really<00:00:38.850> had<00:00:39.000> Ruby<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.480> always<00:00:39.780> had<00:00:39.960> sapphires

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
really had Ruby I always had sapphires

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
really had Ruby I always had sapphires
always<00:00:40.829> got<00:00:41.010> latias<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:42.090> when<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> got

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
always got latias and then when I got

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.840 
always got latias and then when I got
emerald<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.960> chose<00:00:43.200> live<00:00:43.410> Yoast<00:00:43.770> actually<00:00:44.760> at

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
emerald I chose live Yoast actually at

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.950 
emerald I chose live Yoast actually at
first<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.120> don't<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.570> kept<00:00:45.840> pushing

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
first I don't know I just kept pushing

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.170 
first I don't know I just kept pushing
and<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> think<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.680> shows<00:00:46.860> red<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.969> haven't

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
and I think it shows red if you haven't

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.340 
and I think it shows red if you haven't
played<00:00:48.329> sapphire<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> cool<00:00:49.170> thing<00:00:49.320> about

latias is well there's nothing different

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
latias is well there's nothing different

like<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.420> weaken<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> pretty<00:00:58.079> well<00:00:58.289> with

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
like I can weaken it pretty well with
