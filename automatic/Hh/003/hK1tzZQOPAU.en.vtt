00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.649 
I use it mostly after the workout to
milk<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.639> then<00:04:01.819> I<00:04:01.879> use<00:04:01.909> it<00:04:02.150> before<00:04:02.239> bed

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
milk and then I use it before bed

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.300 
milk and then I use it before bed
because<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:03.019> helps<00:04:03.229> with<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.889> growth<00:04:04.129> hormone

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
because it helps with the growth hormone

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.309 
because it helps with the growth hormone
levels<00:04:04.759> naturally

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
levels naturally

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.949 
levels naturally

I'm<00:04:09.170> about<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.410> start<00:04:09.620> doing<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:09.920> tonight<00:04:10.580> in<00:04:11.450> a

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
I'm about to start doing it tonight in a

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.100 
I'm about to start doing it tonight in a
few<00:04:11.690> hours

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
few hours

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.320 
few hours
oh<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:13.010> bait<00:04:13.280> alley<00:04:13.519> you<00:04:13.879> guys<00:04:14.090> said<00:04:14.300> that

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
oh and bait alley you guys said that

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.659 
oh and bait alley you guys said that
right<00:04:14.599> it's<00:04:15.050> like<00:04:15.170> any<00:04:15.379> a<00:04:15.590> beta-alanine<00:04:16.459> this

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
right it's like any a beta-alanine this

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.759 
right it's like any a beta-alanine this
that<00:04:16.820> makes<00:04:17.030> me<00:04:17.120> tingle<00:04:17.419> man<00:04:17.840> yeah<00:04:18.230> it's<00:04:18.680> an

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
that makes me tingle man yeah it's an

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.370 
that makes me tingle man yeah it's an
amino<00:04:18.950> acid<00:04:19.040> hook<00:04:19.489> makes<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.760> tingle

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
amino acid hook makes you tingle

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.260 
amino acid hook makes you tingle
increases<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.709> red<00:04:22.160> blood<00:04:22.340> cells<00:04:22.790> production

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
increases the red blood cells production

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.030 
increases the red blood cells production
so<00:04:23.720> it's<00:04:23.840> like<00:04:23.960> a<00:04:23.990> work<00:04:24.380> setting<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.710> bastard

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
so it's like a work setting a bastard

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.830 
so it's like a work setting a bastard
violator<00:04:25.400> means<00:04:26.030> what<00:04:26.210> that's<00:04:26.360> how<00:04:26.419> it<00:04:26.510> works

very good argument because ours me
that's<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:11.570> pump<00:05:11.840> right<00:05:12.170> yeah<00:05:12.440> yeah<00:05:12.680> it's<00:05:12.830> not

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
that's the pump right yeah yeah it's not

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.800 
that's the pump right yeah yeah it's not
a<00:05:13.070> -<00:05:13.370> it's<00:05:13.700> like<00:05:13.790> a<00:05:13.820> vasodilator<00:05:14.180> there's<00:05:14.720> a

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
a - it's like a vasodilator there's a

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.620 
a - it's like a vasodilator there's a
pure<00:05:15.080> aggressive<00:05:15.500> allative<00:05:15.860> amino<00:05:16.250> acids<00:05:16.970> you

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
pure aggressive allative amino acids you

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.030 
pure aggressive allative amino acids you
know<00:05:17.720> like<00:05:18.050> when<00:05:18.410> you're<00:05:18.500> working<00:05:18.620> out<00:05:18.860> you're

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
know like when you're working out you're

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.650 
know like when you're working out you're
breaking<00:05:19.310> that<00:05:19.340> muscle<00:05:19.730> and<00:05:20.240> you<00:05:20.300> creating<00:05:20.630> a

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
breaking that muscle and you creating a

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.090 
breaking that muscle and you creating a
lot<00:05:20.780> about<00:05:21.020> weights<00:05:21.350> in<00:05:21.470> your<00:05:21.590> body<00:05:21.740> yes

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
lot about weights in your body yes

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.100 
lot about weights in your body yes
almost<00:05:23.000> like<00:05:23.240> you<00:05:23.360> take<00:05:23.510> it<00:05:23.600> a<00:05:23.660> step<00:05:23.840> back

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
almost like you take it a step back

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.080 
almost like you take it a step back
continue<00:05:24.590> two<00:05:24.710> steps<00:05:24.950> forward<00:05:25.310> so<00:05:25.850> you<00:05:25.940> want

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
continue two steps forward so you want

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.310 
continue two steps forward so you want
to<00:05:26.150> put<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.360> right<00:05:26.450> nutrition<00:05:26.930> in<00:05:27.020> there<00:05:27.170> so

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
to put the right nutrition in there so

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.020 
to put the right nutrition in there so
let's<00:05:27.500> take<00:05:27.620> a<00:05:27.770> take<00:05:27.980> a<00:05:28.010> step<00:05:28.310> back<00:05:28.490> roasting

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
let's take a take a step back roasting

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.390 
let's take a take a step back roasting
in<00:05:29.090> two<00:05:29.180> steps<00:05:29.330> forward<00:05:29.780> now<00:05:30.290> I'm<00:05:30.980> a<00:05:31.070> muscle

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
in two steps forward now I'm a muscle

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.500 
in two steps forward now I'm a muscle
break<00:05:31.580> um<00:05:31.700> you're<00:05:31.880> working<00:05:32.120> like<00:05:32.180> breaking

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
break um you're working like breaking

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.910 
break um you're working like breaking
down<00:05:32.600> muscle<00:05:32.690> those<00:05:32.990> notes<00:05:33.320> of<00:05:33.440> boom<00:05:33.590> multiple

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
down muscle those notes of boom multiple

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.440 
down muscle those notes of boom multiple
you<00:05:34.310> have<00:05:34.370> to<00:05:34.520> break<00:05:34.670> down<00:05:34.880> muscle<00:05:35.060> didn't

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
you have to break down muscle didn't

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.360 
you have to break down muscle didn't
build<00:05:35.630> muscle<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:36.020> it's<00:05:36.440> like<00:05:36.560> they<00:05:36.680> do

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
build muscle you it's like they do

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:51.040 
build muscle you it's like they do
something<00:05:48.940> if<00:05:49.940> you're<00:05:50.180> in<00:05:50.330> the<00:05:50.480> New<00:05:50.630> York<00:05:50.840> area

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
something if you're in the New York area

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.860 
something if you're in the New York area
you<00:05:51.980> can<00:05:52.130> get<00:05:52.250> all<00:05:52.460> these<00:05:52.640> supplements<00:05:53.210> from

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
you can get all these supplements from
