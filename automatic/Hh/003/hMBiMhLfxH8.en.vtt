00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.570
 no no 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.550
 a little 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.869
 Boys 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.880
 these are zipizape two supermodels 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.790
 beautiful that you look at us have been worth 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.649
 as an image for the new packaging for 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.489
 the new bag of natural feed 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.350
 with ipic have been favored I think 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.659
 very well then it is natural and look 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.210
 naturalis we decided to call it naturalis 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:48.629
 because it is a range of 100% feed 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.269
 natural 100% natural because between the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.640
 content you can find foods that 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.940
 the rabbits have in the nature 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.989
 when when they feed freely 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.140
 It basically consists of a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.760
 mix of multifloral meadow hay 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.320
 multifloral means that it grows in a 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.960
 bunch of different plants 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.649
 also with all the flowers that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 they bloom there with leaves of trees and 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.960
 It also has other small nutrients 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.750
 that we had to incorporate in the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.960
 pellet that is the pellet because you see the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.400
 pellet is these little bars 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.890
 that simulate being trunks where we put 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.150
 the ingredients that go powder all 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.580
 the very tiny ingredients that 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.510
 they would not eat they will be included 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.190
 here in these little bars but more 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.930
 to tell you how good the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.360
 natural is what I have to tell you is 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.490
 what does not take natural naturalis and if 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.490
 it does not take expression they started to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.660
 include a lot of products 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.090
 extruded in food for 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.480
 herbivores and we have seen that they are nothing 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.380
 beneficial extrusion is a process 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.050
 by which food is manufactured for 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.450
 pets and for humans also in the 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.369
 that the cereal undergoes a treatment 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.740
 strong thermal and causes it to explode or 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.140
 makes lose the natural properties 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.870
 that cereals have when they are in 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.120
 raw is like when we make popcorn 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.500
 imagine we put them in the microwave and 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.560
 that heat treatment makes 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.920
 explode they are very full of air 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.140
 they weigh a little bit and of course not 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.270
 they are nothing natural what we do is pre 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.240
 digest help to digest us 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.030
 a phase jump in the process of digestion 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.220
 proper to herbivores and that's not 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.710
 Well, that's very good for people 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.590
 Carnivorous animals are doing very well 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.270
 also but not to herbivores 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.850
 perfect and another thing that they should not do 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.640
 is what you see here, very careful in 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.950
 house with the vegetable eye I want that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.170
 Be very clear on rabbit baby rabbit 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.150
 Little boy just arrived home is not 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.730
 Well they will like it they will eat a 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.500
 lots of this heals a binge and tomorrow 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.960
 they will have diarrhea and diarrhea in 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.330
 small rabbits are fatal therefore 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.030
 very careful and I want to highlight this in 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.460
 baby rabbit within 15 or 30 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.990
 first days he gets home he can 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.880
 take the adults but always with 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.750
 Moderation for babies especially at 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.350
 no, and I will comment 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.330
 fundamentally what are the 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.280
 beneficial properties that the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.320
 natural food is here you have a 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.630
 series of whistles that I want to develop 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.930
 a little bit is that it has an extra fiber 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.180
 The fiber is mainly found in 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.800
 the hay as you see here fiber to everything 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.630
 the world I think it knows or sounds like 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.460
 it's because you know that now it 's 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.110
 very fashionable in person 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.490
 fiber in rabbits helps the 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.050
 intestinal transit and help 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.150
 fundamentally to the attrition of 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.730
 teeth and that's what this has 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.740
 I think it 's balanced in 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.230
 carbohydrates what does this mean 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.210
 It has very little cereal the little cereal that 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.000
 cereal and legume are included 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.800
 is inside the pellets that you 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.260
 I spoke at the beginning and they help 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.330
 mainly to raise the levels of 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.370
 protein of the ration especially in the 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.530
 small bunnies also has the 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.570
 Calcium phosphorus balance needed this 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.730
 above all they are minerals that 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.160
 find they are basically compose 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.660
 the bones is very important in relation 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.489
 to this point that the bunnies give them 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.520
 from time to time the sun well by the 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.560
 tomorrow or in the afternoon at least 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.850
 intensity have but because for the 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.890
 heat you know that the heat is going fatal 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.200
 then they need a little bit of sun 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.900
 to assimilate calcium and talking about 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.500
 calcium I also want to tell you this 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.080
 peak of milk serum whey 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.410
 maternal serum containing serum 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.750
 milk that reminds them of the smell 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.560
 nest the smell of the mother and that makes more 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.530
 appetizing 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.410
 the whole reaction and finally 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.290
 that this is included is the loncho 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.470
 and this leads to a complex work of 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.990
 background and that as a whole really 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.760
 compose your needs I hope that you 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.490
 like at the same time or not only that 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.840
 be good but also like it and 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.180
 very well I think that with this has been 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.120
 everything was explained a bit and not 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.190
 hesitate to go visit other videos 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.720
 related to this as can be the 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.430
 rabbit digestive system the 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.380
 feeding the rabbit that already 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.600
 we recorded earlier and that you can 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.380
 find if you become followers of 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.380
