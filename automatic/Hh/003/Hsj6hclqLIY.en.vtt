right and you have a new perspective in
gaming<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.570> makes<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.080> huge<00:01:43.229> difference

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
you're gonna realize how much smoother

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.130 
you're gonna realize how much smoother
and<00:01:47.390> basically<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> tearing<00:01:49.050> that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and basically all the tearing that

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.440 
and basically all the tearing that
exists<00:01:49.500> today<00:01:49.590> yeah<00:01:50.400> because<00:01:50.670> your<00:01:51.180> brain<00:01:51.420> is

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
exists today yeah because your brain is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.330 
exists today yeah because your brain is
trained<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.050> not<00:01:52.470> realize<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.190> there

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
trained to not realize it's there

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.910 
trained to not realize it's there
anymore<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.360> that's<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.810> screen<00:01:55.140> that's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
anymore so that's this screen that's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
anymore so that's this screen that's
just<00:01:56.130> discrete<00:01:56.550> yeah<00:01:56.940> so<00:01:57.210> your<00:01:57.360> system<00:01:57.720> not

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
just discrete yeah so your system not

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.200 
just discrete yeah so your system not
sure<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.650> you<00:01:58.770> want<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.950> open<00:01:59.190> it<00:01:59.280> here<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.759> yeah

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
sure if you want to open it here or yeah

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.620 
sure if you want to open it here or yeah

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
exactly right so I mean it's functional

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.850 
exactly right so I mean it's functional
and<00:04:27.090> it's<00:04:27.390> just<00:04:27.540> that<00:04:27.660> aesthetic<00:04:28.290> because<00:04:28.380> the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
and it's just that aesthetic because the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.370 
and it's just that aesthetic because the
the<00:04:29.070> Cooley<00:04:29.340> design<00:04:29.700> it's<00:04:30.150> actually<00:04:30.570> when<00:04:31.350> we

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
the Cooley design it's actually when we

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.570 
the Cooley design it's actually when we
were<00:04:31.560> fishing<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.040> everything<00:04:32.160> that's<00:04:32.430> out
