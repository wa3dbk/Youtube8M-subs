 opposed to French jim and coulibaly wood 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.410
 chaos accelerates in the last two 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.270
 round and does the show with his shots 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.309
 knees skip those haitink test shots 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.440
 waka where points are decided by decision 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.050
 unanimous judges and wins the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.579
 wbc belt average weights for 10 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.140
 but coulibaly author of a very good 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.330
 fight it's a second defeat 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.460
 clinging to Thai after the one 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.950
 suffered in 2011 it's a defeat to 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.780
 points I will stand up for the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.520
 first four roles towards the end i 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.290
 had a dieting that made it 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.330
 started to gain self-confidence he has 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.009
 started to advance to do the show 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.820
 what made the change of the count 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.220
 otherwise I think 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 I had a good fight despite his 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.900
 charts is there I could have been managed 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.280
 to have the victory but hey it's the 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.770
 sports there is a winner and a loser 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.390
 it's part of the other french game on 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.610
 the ring johan lydon face the 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.690
 reigning champion the Swedish alex harris 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.340
 in super means 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.229
 French hurts his opponent 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.180
 when he touches but does not 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.220
 quite frequently more active more 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.530
 undertaking the Swedish mark over 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.300
 points and keeps his wbc belt of 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.250
 super weights mean for y including 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.350
 difficult to hide his disappointment in 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.910
 the locker rooms from August 1 judge 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.220
 was not cool by that second 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.130
 round I sang singing I think 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.600
 sing my body word a little heavy a 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.430
 as if I had more 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.780
 I had over a hundred years in the arms 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.350
 especially the arm before the left he 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.720
 is very important 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.650
 I saw that I do not buy my boxing 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.510
 stuck because he only saw that I was 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.709
 dangerous after precisely he 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.820
 clung to me you see it was not bad 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.610
 its costs but I'm going to hang on 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.140
 it was your doing nothing he was just a 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.400
 little bit more active was not it was 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.350
 not especially situation was not 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.519
 power you were not even specially 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.940
 spectacular but here it is a little 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.500
 more active than me 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.670
 in other fights dylan salvador 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.980
 came close to victory 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.840
 but loses on decision of the two judges 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.730
