chord is a c-sharp minor' now normally

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.700 
chord is a c-sharp minor' now normally
you'd<00:00:41.219> play<00:00:41.399> C<00:00:41.460> sharp<00:00:41.700> minor<00:00:42.149> with<00:00:42.680> finger<00:00:43.680> one

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
you'd play C sharp minor with finger one

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.160 
you'd play C sharp minor with finger one
barring<00:00:44.610> across<00:00:44.940> five<00:00:45.270> strings<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:45.960> that's

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
barring across five strings but that's

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.380 
barring across five strings but that's
not<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:46.530> he<00:00:46.590> does<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.950> video<00:00:47.280> he<00:00:48.090> keeps

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
not what he does on the video he keeps

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.950

his<00:00:48.570> bar<00:00:48.840> only<00:00:49.260> across<00:00:49.770> three<00:00:50.160> strings<00:00:50.960> but

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
his bar only across three strings but

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.869 
his bar only across three strings but
then<00:00:52.140> he<00:00:52.230> switches<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.860> uses<00:00:53.370> his<00:00:53.550> third

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
then he switches out uses his third

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.590 
then he switches out uses his third
finger<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.199> fifth<00:00:55.469> fret<00:00:55.559> 2nd<00:00:56.160> string<00:00:56.600> that

frees up his middle finger to reach over

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.039 
frees up his middle finger to reach over
and<00:01:00.180> play<00:01:00.570> fourth<00:01:01.170> fret<00:01:01.530> fifth<00:01:02.039> string<00:01:03.049> kind

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
and play fourth fret fifth string kind

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.200 
and play fourth fret fifth string kind
of<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.199> unorthodox<00:01:05.040> fingering<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.820> c-sharp

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
of a unorthodox fingering for a c-sharp

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.740 
of a unorthodox fingering for a c-sharp
minor<00:01:06.799> but<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.250> allows<00:01:08.610> him<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.880> use<00:01:09.299> his

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
minor but that allows him to use his

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
minor but that allows him to use his
other<00:01:09.990> fingers<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.439> play<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> melody<00:01:11.070> part

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
other fingers to play the melody part

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.170 
other fingers to play the melody part
which<00:01:12.390> we'll<00:01:12.600> go<00:01:12.720> through<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> few<00:01:13.110> minutes

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
which we'll go through in a few minutes

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.670 
which we'll go through in a few minutes
let's<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.540> he<00:01:15.720> moves<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.439> keeps

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
let's see then he moves on and keeps

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.460 
let's see then he moves on and keeps
this<00:01:16.950> bar<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:18.570> slides<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.049> down<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
this bar and just slides it down to the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.850 
this bar and just slides it down to the
second<00:01:19.860> fret<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:21.259> lets<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.380> play<00:01:22.530> ad

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
second fret and that lets you play ad

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.360 
second fret and that lets you play ad
chord<00:01:23.189> pretty<00:01:23.490> easily<00:01:23.729> there

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
chord pretty easily there

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.440 
chord pretty easily there
then<00:01:26.060> an<00:01:26.210> ex<00:01:26.390> corde<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:27.700> an<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:29.000> major<00:01:29.270> chord

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
then an ex corde is an a major chord

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.320 
then an ex corde is an a major chord
with<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:29.900> B<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.230> the<00:01:30.320> bass<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.070> on<00:01:31.730> the<00:01:31.940> tablature

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
with a B in the bass so on the tablature

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.440 
with a B in the bass so on the tablature
that<00:01:32.660> says<00:01:32.930> 5<00:01:33.230> 5<00:01:33.790> which<00:01:34.790> is<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.970> barre<00:01:35.210> chord<00:01:35.240> 6<00:01:36.400> 7

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
that says 5 5 which is a barre chord 6 7

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.950 
that says 5 5 which is a barre chord 6 7
then<00:01:38.450> 7<00:01:38.990> on<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.200> low<00:01:39.350> string<00:01:41.800> next<00:01:42.800> chord<00:01:43.100> is<00:01:43.340> a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
then 7 on the low string next chord is a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.280 
then 7 on the low string next chord is a
b7<00:01:44.960> chord<00:01:45.940> which<00:01:46.940> is<00:01:47.120> a<00:01:47.150> full<00:01:47.450> bar<00:01:47.720> chord<00:01:48.050> all

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
b7 chord which is a full bar chord all

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.500 
b7 chord which is a full bar chord all
the<00:01:48.410> way<00:01:48.470> across<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.010> 7th<00:01:49.400> fret<00:01:49.610> covering<00:01:50.360> all

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
the way across the 7th fret covering all

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.860 
the way across the 7th fret covering all
the<00:01:50.630> strings<00:01:51.850> middle<00:01:52.850> finger<00:01:53.120> plays<00:01:53.420> third

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
the strings middle finger plays third

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.760 
the strings middle finger plays third
string<00:01:54.260> 6<00:01:54.710> no<00:01:55.220> eighth<00:01:55.850> fret<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.480> third<00:01:57.410> finger

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
string 6 no eighth fret and third finger

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.530 
string 6 no eighth fret and third finger
plays<00:01:58.040> fourth<00:01:58.550> string<00:01:58.820> 9th<00:01:59.210> fret<00:02:01.390> then<00:02:02.390> the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
plays fourth string 9th fret then the

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.390 
plays fourth string 9th fret then the
next<00:02:02.780> chord<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.560> all<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.830> way<00:02:03.890> down<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.280> the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
next chord is all the way down to the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.730 
next chord is all the way down to the
second<00:02:04.790> fret<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:07.250> that's<00:02:07.910> basically<00:02:08.540> a<00:02:08.929> b7

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
second fret so that's basically a b7

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.130 
second fret so that's basically a b7
again<00:02:10.040> we're<00:02:10.460> playing<00:02:10.610> 2nd<00:02:11.300> fret<00:02:11.540> on<00:02:11.720> every

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
again we're playing 2nd fret on every

totally<00:02:39.980> differently<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:40.520> time<00:02:42.010> let's

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
totally differently this time let's

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.949 
totally differently this time let's
learn<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.520> that's<00:02:43.760> 4th<00:02:44.209> fret<00:02:44.540> on<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.840> a

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
learn that that's 4th fret on the a

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.720 
learn that that's 4th fret on the a
string<00:02:45.910> 4th<00:02:46.910> fret<00:02:47.000> on<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.540> g<00:02:47.840> string<00:02:48.730> along
