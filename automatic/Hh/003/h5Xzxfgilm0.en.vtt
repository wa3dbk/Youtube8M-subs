complexion and all that but at the same

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.030 
complexion and all that but at the same
time<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:25.900> think<00:04:26.020> that<00:04:26.320> it's<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.560> color<00:04:26.800> that

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
time I think that it's a color that

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.800 
time I think that it's a color that
could<00:04:27.190> work<00:04:27.340> for<00:04:27.400> lots<00:04:28.030> of<00:04:28.210> different<00:04:28.270> skin

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
could work for lots of different skin

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.600 
could work for lots of different skin
tones<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.350> all

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
long way with this product and I don't

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.140 
long way with this product and I don't
really<00:05:31.319> use<00:05:31.560> this<00:05:31.710> as<00:05:31.889> a<00:05:31.919> contour<00:05:32.580> I<00:05:32.879> initially

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.850 
really use this as a contour I initially
thought<00:05:33.389> I<00:05:33.569> would<00:05:33.960> but<00:05:34.289> it's<00:05:34.469> got<00:05:34.620> a<00:05:34.650> little

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
thought I would but it's got a little

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.550 
thought I would but it's got a little
too<00:05:35.129> much<00:05:35.310> shimmer<00:05:35.669> so<00:05:36.150> usually<00:05:37.020> I<00:05:37.050> will<00:05:37.409> do<00:05:37.529> a

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
too much shimmer so usually I will do a

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.800 
too much shimmer so usually I will do a
contour<00:05:38.219> with<00:05:38.339> a<00:05:38.370> matte<00:05:38.729> bronzer<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.599> then

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
contour with a matte bronzer and then

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.050 
contour with a matte bronzer and then
just<00:05:40.199> kind<00:05:40.319> of<00:05:40.440> rub<00:05:40.979> this<00:05:41.129> over<00:05:41.460> my<00:05:41.580> cheeks<00:05:41.849> or
