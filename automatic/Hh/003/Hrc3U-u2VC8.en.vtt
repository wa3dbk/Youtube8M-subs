00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
the clip to 10% real-time at first we

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.990 
the clip to 10% real-time at first we
thought<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:18.920> setting<00:01:19.310> wasn't<00:01:19.490> very<00:01:19.880> useful

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
thought this setting wasn't very useful

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.090 
thought this setting wasn't very useful
because<00:01:20.750> of<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.020> image<00:01:21.260> distortion<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:22.070> the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
because of the image distortion in the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.370 
because of the image distortion in the
far<00:01:22.400> field<00:01:22.640> but<00:01:23.180> notice<00:01:23.540> as<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.840> writer<00:01:24.080> gets

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
far field but notice as the writer gets

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.800 
far field but notice as the writer gets
close<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.890> how<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.130> distortion<00:01:25.580> improves<00:01:26.240> we

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
close to how the distortion improves we

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.600 
close to how the distortion improves we
think<00:01:27.080> this<00:01:27.200> setting<00:01:27.590> will<00:01:27.740> be<00:01:27.770> mad<00:01:28.070> fresh<00:01:28.370> for

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
think this setting will be mad fresh for

think this setting will be mad fresh for
