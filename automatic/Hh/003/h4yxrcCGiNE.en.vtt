tall<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:15.480> about<00:02:16.980> well<00:02:17.980> there's<00:02:18.700> not<00:02:18.850> a

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
tall and just about well there's not a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.759 
tall and just about well there's not a
whole<00:02:19.120> lot<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.810> can<00:02:19.959> do<00:02:20.200> but<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
whole lot that you can do but the

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.350 
whole lot that you can do but the
hardest<00:02:21.100> part<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.340> figuring<00:02:21.549> out<00:02:21.790> what<00:02:22.239> you

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
hardest part is figuring out what you

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.150 
hardest part is figuring out what you
can<00:02:22.540> actually<00:02:22.660> do<00:02:23.080> what<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> variables<00:02:23.950> are

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
can actually do what the variables are

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.590 
can actually do what the variables are
and<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:24.850> what<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.630> do<00:02:25.780> with<00:02:26.049> those<00:02:26.230> variables

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
and then what to do with those variables

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.589 
and then what to do with those variables
I<00:02:29.160> end<00:02:30.160> up<00:02:30.280> looking<00:02:30.610> at<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.819> tutorials<00:02:31.390> most

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
I end up looking at the tutorials most

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.870 
I end up looking at the tutorials most
of<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.840> time<00:02:32.049> so<00:02:32.290> don't<00:02:32.410> be<00:02:32.590> ashamed<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:33.280> when

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
of the time so don't be ashamed and when

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.670 
of the time so don't be ashamed and when
i<00:02:33.910> played<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:34.540> level<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.959> first<00:02:35.170> time<00:02:35.440> it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
i played this level the first time it

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.740 
i played this level the first time it
took<00:02:35.890> me<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.430> million<00:02:36.820> years<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.329> figure<00:02:37.510> out

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
took me a million years to figure out

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.229 
took me a million years to figure out
what<00:02:37.930> was<00:02:38.079> going<00:02:38.109> on<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:39.340> there's<00:02:39.820> no<00:02:39.970> shame<00:02:40.209> in

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
what was going on so there's no shame in

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.830 
what was going on so there's no shame in
your<00:02:40.480> game<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:41.500> game<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:42.100> about<00:02:42.840> somehow

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
your game this game is about somehow

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.050 
your game this game is about somehow
stumbling<00:02:44.410> through<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:44.859> maybe<00:02:45.700> there's<00:02:45.970> like

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
stumbling through it maybe there's like

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.270 
stumbling through it maybe there's like
chess<00:02:46.480> geniuses<00:02:47.140> or<00:02:47.380> just<00:02:47.709> people<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:48.070> are

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
chess geniuses or just people that are

really<00:02:48.489> creative<00:02:49.299> they<00:02:49.450> can<00:02:49.739> figure<00:02:50.739> this<00:02:50.950> out

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
really creative they can figure this out

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.890 
really creative they can figure this out
on<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> first<00:02:51.519> try<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.060> be<00:02:52.239> like<00:02:52.390> super<00:02:52.690> pro

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
on the first try and be like super pro

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.410 
on the first try and be like super pro
but<00:02:53.230> more<00:02:54.160> power<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.549> you

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
but more power to you

but more power to you
I'm<00:02:56.990> doing<00:02:57.290> this<00:02:57.470> low<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.099> slow<00:02:59.470> okay<00:03:00.470> so

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
I'm doing this low and slow okay so

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.680 
I'm doing this low and slow okay so
every<00:03:00.860> time<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.130> pull<00:03:01.340> this<00:03:01.520> switch<00:03:01.849> it<00:03:02.390> poops

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
every time I pull this switch it poops

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.900 
every time I pull this switch it poops
out<00:03:02.840> this<00:03:03.050> little<00:03:03.230> cart<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.830> goes<00:03:04.610> right<00:03:04.849> past

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
out this little cart and goes right past

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.670 
out this little cart and goes right past
and<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.480> need<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.750> somehow<00:03:05.959> figure<00:03:06.230> out<00:03:06.410> how<00:03:06.620> to

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
and I need to somehow figure out how to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.479 
and I need to somehow figure out how to
get<00:03:06.830> in<00:03:07.010> there<00:03:08.319> so<00:03:09.319> i<00:03:09.349> got<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.860> shuffle<00:03:10.310> up

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
get in there so i got that shuffle up

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.949 
get in there so i got that shuffle up
top<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.000> every<00:03:11.330> time<00:03:11.480> they<00:03:11.660> give<00:03:11.810> you

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
top and every time they give you

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.510 
top and every time they give you
something<00:03:12.349> you<00:03:12.440> end<00:03:12.590> up<00:03:12.709> using<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:13.190> so<00:03:13.370> there

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
something you end up using it so there

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.979 
something you end up using it so there
must<00:03:13.610> be<00:03:13.790> some<00:03:14.000> way<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.209> i<00:03:14.480> can<00:03:14.540> use<00:03:14.690> this

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
must be some way that i can use this

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.949 
must be some way that i can use this
shovel<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.650> like<00:03:15.860> make<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:16.850> cannon<00:03:17.450> derail<00:03:17.930> a

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
shovel to like make this cannon derail a

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.280 
shovel to like make this cannon derail a
cart<00:03:18.350> or<00:03:19.280> one<00:03:20.239> of<00:03:20.360> these<00:03:20.480> switches<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.140> going

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
cart or one of these switches is going

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.840 
cart or one of these switches is going
to<00:03:21.350> move<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.709> tracks<00:03:22.040> or<00:03:22.340> something<00:03:22.670> like

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
to move the tracks or something like

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.559 
to move the tracks or something like
that<00:03:24.670> but<00:03:25.670> yeah<00:03:25.849> most<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.209> time<00:03:26.330> you're<00:03:26.540> just

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
that but yeah most the time you're just

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.570 
that but yeah most the time you're just
going<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:26.900> end<00:03:27.050> up<00:03:27.260> testing<00:03:27.590> things<00:03:28.069> out<00:03:28.340> and

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
going to end up testing things out and

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.970 
going to end up testing things out and
don't<00:03:28.970> view<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.330> as<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.630> failure<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:30.830> is

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
don't view it as a failure of you it is

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.610 
don't view it as a failure of you it is
like<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:32.750> know<00:03:32.780> once<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.260> closer<00:03:33.470> to

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
like a you know once the closer to

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.750 
like a you know once the closer to
actually<00:03:33.860> figuring<00:03:34.100> out<00:03:34.280> how<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.370> do<00:03:34.549> below

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
actually figuring out how to do below

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.850 
actually figuring out how to do below
because<00:03:35.000> when<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:35.330> figure<00:03:35.569> out<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.720> level<00:03:36.049> they

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
because when you figure out a level they

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.470 
because when you figure out a level they
give<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.130> like<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.340> little<00:03:37.519> movie<00:03:37.970> tree<00:03:38.269> and

so I was kind of on the right track i
got<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.680> shovel<00:04:36.889> you<00:04:37.820> pooped<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.270> shovel

onto<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.930> track<00:04:39.199> and<00:04:39.500> then<00:04:40.070> push<00:04:40.400> that<00:04:40.430> lever

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
onto the track and then push that lever

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.110 
onto the track and then push that lever
and<00:04:41.210> then<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.540> lever<00:04:41.750> does<00:04:41.990> something<00:04:42.500> and

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
and then the lever does something and

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.150 
and then the lever does something and
then<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.300> wheels<00:04:44.510> go<00:04:44.750> on<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.050> cart<00:04:45.320> and<00:04:45.470> then
