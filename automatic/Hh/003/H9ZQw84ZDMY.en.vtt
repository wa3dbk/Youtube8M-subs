the general backstage ball restrictions
which<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.159> be<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.370> bit<00:02:45.670> annoying<00:02:45.940> at<00:02:46.090> times

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859

overall<00:02:47.859> though<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.069> think<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.640> Kate<00:02:49.000> do<00:02:49.239> you

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269
