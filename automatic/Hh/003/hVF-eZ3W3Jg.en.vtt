Welcome, friends! It's me, fabE!

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.280
And today I'm gonna tell you why YOU should be attending the final of Acer Predator Masters powered by Intel from July 30!

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.080
Of course the finals take place in our new location!

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.120
We've seen some exciting matches during the past few weeks

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.480
And it all comes down to this moment: The qualification for the Grand Finals

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.600
Eight top teams have qualified for the finals, such as Dignitas...

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.420
TSM who keep winning one LAN event after another

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.780
Also we've got some German teams such as mousesports who are the German hope

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.260
And now officially qualified, strux1's guys from PENTA Sports

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.780
Who managed to defeat LGB in an ecxiting last online stage match

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.560

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.140
...Gplay - and these eight teams will fight each other in this arena

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.140
just like gladiators!

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.580
Of course you can watch the finals live in our brand new location

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.420
In fact our gaming bar will open with the Acer Predator Masters powered by Intel

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.320
And we'd like to welcome you here and drink one or two cool beers with you

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.360
While J0hnny, gob b etc will shoot the others out of the tournament

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.600
Your physical well-being will be taken care of

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.560
But there will be lots of entertainment, too

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.000
for example a soccer table, air hockey, dance dance revolution machine, console gaming areas...

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.940
...tablets...and even if I forgot half of it you see, here's where you will have lots of fun, even if you're not into CS:GO.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.060
Of course you can also stop by to relax or get some autographs

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.020
