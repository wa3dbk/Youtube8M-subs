 good to all kids welcome to 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.240
 this new video I'll show you a 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.700
 moment my server for those who have not 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.950
 never seen this here for those who know it 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.160
 the first spawn in the sense and the string 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.910
 initial because as soon as a new one enters 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.460
 here are a couple of rules and this is the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.890
 away for the exit and pa mia mia 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.470
 and immediately you find yourself in front of this 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.539
 really built mega server 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:44.190
 great thanks not only to me but really 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.890
 to many people 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.410
 this is an archery here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.960
 paintings like those and you owe them 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.440
 pecking is this here is a mega fucking 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.440
 giant chicken 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.670
 I liked the idea then I did it 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.330
 I know 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.220
 just to fill a moment forever 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.680
 fantastic though this one a mega 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.939
 the lovely fountain will not be made 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.100
 my friend is really fantastic and goes 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.619
 well i'm not sure why I'm still here 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.640
 I should destroy it but I want it 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.600
 leave then if I can think of 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.090
 build something really useful 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.920
 then yes I destroy it I put it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.200
 why I have a great shooting chickens 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.729
 I know you won't understand what the hell it is 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.420
 then a quick quick demonstration 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.210
 I'll do the same for you 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.759
 because you are you I am me 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.130
 oh my god then one will have to stay there 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.630
 above let the chickens play and you them 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.829
 you will have to catch 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.119
 this is the principle and those that do not 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:06.750
 sins will make a better end to the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.700
 four this one I have a plane 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.180
 I finished it then in practice I have them 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.150
 me started but thanks to stefano that not 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.710
 I know it helped me finish the form a little 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.380
 plane 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.360
 I finished it in a short time would be a 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.520
 bungee jumping plane I never come 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:30.540
 the water is fine and here is a pickaxe two 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:34.170
 swords that in my opinion are not and are not 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.030
 I went out well but I didn't 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.990
 good at making pixel art and that 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.490
 in fact stefania has done it and it seems a 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:48.810
 mcdonald's burger ok i'm parkour ha 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.870
 made henry really amazing and I have to 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.770
 to say that it is a little bit difficult 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.330
 it seems very easy but you will fall once 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:03.860
 surely I tell you this ok 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.420
 initiative to break through and do 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.040
 another part of the server 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:15.180
 she came to me thanks to mick 3 and puts three 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.220
 it would be the maurizia of Leonardo I have 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.530
 I was inspired by his server 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.710
 this tso maze and I must say that 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.560
 come out well I confuse me too 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.940
 I did it and I didn't just do it 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.150
 also stefania did this here at one is 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:41.910
 a spliff a spip arena 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:44.730
 for those who do not know what goes to see a 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.190
 videos where they explain what a 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.350
 minecraft minigame one split and from 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.610
 lots of fun really 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:57.690
 fun and I will publish a video where 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.090
 we split friends and me 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.820
 some friends 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:08.730
 and here we have made another arena of 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:12.540
 spliff me and josÃ¨ fondly apologize 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.460
 today therefore only today we have a fact 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.400
 this arena this second renault 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.140
 spliff because we did it that way 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.040
 bass 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:26.340
 the initiative was that when it breaks 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.760
 ahead of the blocks under the feet of 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.960
 of the partner that is of the adversary if 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.669
 fell evident if I fall tumors e 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.919
 save on spam 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:42.800
 so whoever falls is eliminated type e 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:47.550
 save in the scout is a lot 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.570
 thick and the idea had come to me then 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.760
 we did it stefano together 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:57.840
 wonderful idea ok here's a little one 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.990
 cemetery with nothing you can 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.300
 to enter the server the slots are 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.880
 four maximums then only in three at 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.370
 once you can enter who succeeds comes if 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.389
 read them quietly 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:16.919
 and in short this guys was mine 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:21.270
 server is a really mega server 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:25.020
 galactic so if the server is there 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.840
 liked if you want to get in and you have to 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.110
 wait for me to open servers but guys 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.870
 sometimes I say it under my videos 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.919
 that I open it the server usually doesn't have it 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.650
 never done but you get the notification on 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.830
 your device so you know when 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:48.780
 I open it and when it is 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:51.849
 in short, when I open, then, hello to everyone 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.949

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:57.179
