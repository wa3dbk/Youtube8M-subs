00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
variants instead of the normal weapon

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.100 
variants instead of the normal weapon
and<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> look<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> bottom<00:01:33.689> right<00:01:33.720> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and if you look at the bottom right it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.649 
and if you look at the bottom right it
tells<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.650> what<00:01:34.860> varying<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.880> weapon<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
tells you what varying the weapon is and

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.899 
tells you what varying the weapon is and
also<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> name<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.430> see<00:01:38.729> I
