suspension<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:37.110> word<00:00:37.290> torsion<00:00:37.950> means

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
suspension the word torsion means

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.490 
suspension the word torsion means
twisting<00:00:38.820> motion<00:00:39.210> at<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.629> end<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.960> an<00:00:40.079> object

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
twisting motion at one end of an object

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.160 
twisting motion at one end of an object

bar key mount at the chassis mount or at
the<00:01:02.550> crossmember<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:04.199> twist<00:01:04.589> or<00:01:05.070> adjust

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the crossmember as you twist or adjust

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.840 
the crossmember as you twist or adjust
or<00:01:06.060> crank<00:01:06.360> up<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.840> torsion<00:01:07.320> key<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:08.340> twists

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
or crank up the torsion key it twists

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.929 
or crank up the torsion key it twists
the<00:01:08.939> torsion<00:01:09.360> bar<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:11.070> twist<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> torsion

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the torsion bar as you twist the torsion

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.469 
the torsion bar as you twist the torsion
bar<00:01:12.119> twist<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> lower<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.080> arm<00:01:13.470> down<00:01:14.479> because

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
bar twist the lower a arm down because

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.240 
bar twist the lower a arm down because
the<00:01:15.630> upper<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.049> lower<00:01:16.140> control<00:01:16.590> arms<00:01:17.159> are

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the upper and lower control arms are

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.880 
the upper and lower control arms are
connected<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> knuckle<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.990> both<00:01:19.259> twist

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
connected at the knuckle they both twist

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.760 
connected at the knuckle they both twist
thus<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.000> torsion<00:01:21.420> bar<00:01:21.600> key<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.380> fixed

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
thus the torsion bar key is the fixed

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.070 
thus the torsion bar key is the fixed
position<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.909> held<00:01:24.150> still<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:24.840> still

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
position that is held still for still

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.730 
position that is held still for still
and<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> arm<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.820> twist<00:01:27.450> motion<00:01:27.750> after

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and the a arm is a twist motion after

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.700 
and the a arm is a twist motion after
the<00:01:29.130> wheel<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.729> tire<00:01:29.939> push<00:01:30.329> upward<00:01:30.900> or<00:01:31.140> droop

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the wheel and tire push upward or droop

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.190 
the wheel and tire push upward or droop
downward<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.850> torsion<00:01:33.240> bar<00:01:33.420> springing<00:01:34.049> this

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
downward the torsion bar springing this

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
downward the torsion bar springing this
forces<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> suspension<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.579> return<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.270> its

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
forces the suspension to return to its

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.289 
forces the suspension to return to its
proper<00:01:36.840> position<00:01:37.369> make<00:01:38.369> sure<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.850> adjust<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
proper position make sure you adjust the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.210 
proper position make sure you adjust the
torsion<00:01:39.780> bar<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> proper<00:01:40.650> height<00:01:40.829> or

torsion bar to the proper height or

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.160 
torsion bar to the proper height or
you'll<00:01:41.700> create<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> bind<00:01:42.479> at<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> front

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
you'll create a bind at the front

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.490 
you'll create a bind at the front
bulging<00:01:43.970> over<00:01:44.970> cranking<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> torsion<00:01:46.079> bar<00:01:46.290> to

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
harsh ride or a premature component wear

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.990 
harsh ride or a premature component wear
