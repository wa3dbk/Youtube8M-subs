00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.510 
Ness so it was really cool how the
synthesized<00:04:46.810> 3d<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:47.770> know<00:04:47.830> taking<00:04:48.130> a<00:04:48.190> 2d

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
synthesized 3d you know taking a 2d

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.180

image<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.240> turning<00:04:49.780> it<00:04:49.870> into<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.080> 3d<00:04:50.620> image<00:04:50.800> was

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
image and turning it into a 3d image was

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.600 
image and turning it into a 3d image was
actually<00:04:51.550> very<00:04:51.760> very<00:04:52.000> good<00:04:52.800> other<00:04:53.800> things<00:04:54.250> of

would be developed by Apple in terms of

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.510 
would be developed by Apple in terms of
just<00:05:19.360> how<00:05:19.450> sharp<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:19.990> is<00:05:20.170> but<00:05:20.770> really<00:05:21.100> really

nice<00:05:21.700> feature<00:05:22.000> set<00:05:26.280> my<00:05:27.280> receiver<00:05:27.640> has

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
nice feature set my receiver has

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.230 
nice feature set my receiver has
absolutely<00:05:28.240> no<00:05:29.460> HDMI<00:05:30.460> connections<00:05:31.060> and<00:05:31.180> I

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
absolutely no HDMI connections and I

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.640 
absolutely no HDMI connections and I
thought<00:05:31.390> I'd<00:05:31.570> have<00:05:31.720> to<00:05:31.840> use<00:05:31.930> that<00:05:32.110> as<00:05:32.350> the

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
thought I'd have to use that as the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.520 
thought I'd have to use that as the
brain<00:05:33.400> center<00:05:33.970> of<00:05:34.090> my<00:05:34.270> of<00:05:34.600> my<00:05:34.630> surround<00:05:35.260> sound

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
brain center of my of my surround sound

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.040 
brain center of my of my surround sound
system<00:05:35.950> where<00:05:36.370> all<00:05:36.550> the<00:05:36.970> HDMI<00:05:37.360> is<00:05:37.420> go<00:05:37.840> in<00:05:37.990> there

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
system where all the HDMI is go in there

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.750 
system where all the HDMI is go in there
and<00:05:38.500> then<00:05:38.620> I<00:05:38.710> would<00:05:38.830> have<00:05:38.890> to<00:05:39.010> pump<00:05:39.190> that<00:05:39.370> into

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
and then I would have to pump that into

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.940 
and then I would have to pump that into
them<00:05:39.940> television<00:05:40.690> I<00:05:40.870> actually<00:05:41.320> do<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.710> exact

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
them television I actually do the exact

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.820 
them television I actually do the exact
opposite<00:05:42.340> this<00:05:42.580> TV<00:05:43.060> now<00:05:43.270> is<00:05:43.600> my<00:05:43.840> brain<00:05:44.350> center

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
opposite this TV now is my brain center

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.570 
opposite this TV now is my brain center
I<00:05:45.070> have<00:05:45.670> four<00:05:46.210> HDMI<00:05:46.570> in<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.590> then<00:05:48.100> I<00:05:48.130> have<00:05:48.400> the

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
I have four HDMI in and then I have the

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.990 
I have four HDMI in and then I have the
optical<00:05:49.240> audio<00:05:49.960> digital<00:05:50.860> audio<00:05:51.430> going<00:05:51.790> out

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
optical audio digital audio going out

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.080 
optical audio digital audio going out
from<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.480> TV<00:05:52.720> into<00:05:53.590> the<00:05:53.890> receiver<00:05:54.340> so<00:05:55.000> the

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
from the TV into the receiver so the

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.090 
from the TV into the receiver so the
receiver<00:05:55.420> only<00:05:55.840> has<00:05:56.080> a<00:05:56.110> single<00:05:56.470> wire<00:05:56.650> going

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
receiver only has a single wire going

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.610 
receiver only has a single wire going
into<00:05:57.460> it<00:05:57.640> and<00:05:57.790> that<00:05:58.570> and<00:05:58.780> then<00:05:58.870> it<00:05:59.020> just<00:05:59.230> powers

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
into it and that and then it just powers

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.410 
into it and that and then it just powers
the<00:05:59.770> speakers<00:06:00.220> for<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.520> surround<00:06:00.880> sound<00:06:00.970> and

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
the speakers for the surround sound and

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.960 
the speakers for the surround sound and
the<00:06:02.050> TV<00:06:02.470> does<00:06:02.710> all<00:06:02.920> the<00:06:03.100> management<00:06:03.460> all<00:06:03.940> the

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
the TV does all the management all the

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.080 
the TV does all the management all the
inputs<00:06:04.600> so<00:06:04.890> it's<00:06:05.890> actually<00:06:06.070> really<00:06:06.400> nice<00:06:06.790> with

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
inputs so it's actually really nice with

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.850 
inputs so it's actually really nice with
regard<00:06:07.420> to<00:06:07.540> because<00:06:08.380> sometimes<00:06:08.650> you<00:06:08.740> don't

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
regard to because sometimes you don't

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.430 
regard to because sometimes you don't
want<00:06:08.950> to<00:06:09.100> turn<00:06:09.250> on<00:06:09.370> the<00:06:09.490> stereo<00:06:09.790> and<00:06:10.390> you<00:06:11.350> know

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
want to turn on the stereo and you know

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.230 
want to turn on the stereo and you know
and<00:06:11.590> you<00:06:11.680> may<00:06:12.010> be<00:06:12.190> switching<00:06:12.550> between<00:06:12.610> inputs

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
and you may be switching between inputs

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.030 
and you may be switching between inputs
and<00:06:13.360> just<00:06:13.570> the<00:06:13.660> TV<00:06:13.870> mode<00:06:14.230> like<00:06:14.500> seven<00:06:14.830> speakers

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
and just the TV mode like seven speakers

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.360 
and just the TV mode like seven speakers
on<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:15.460> TV<00:06:15.730> by<00:06:15.880> itself<00:06:16.180> pretty<00:06:16.600> good<00:06:16.900> so<00:06:17.620> it's

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
on the TV by itself pretty good so it's

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.100 
on the TV by itself pretty good so it's
one<00:06:19.000> less<00:06:19.180> remote<00:06:19.510> that<00:06:19.630> you<00:06:19.720> have<00:06:19.810> to<00:06:19.930> worry

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
one less remote that you have to worry

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.200 
one less remote that you have to worry
about<00:06:20.230> like<00:06:20.680> I<00:06:20.710> said<00:06:20.830> I<00:06:20.920> if<00:06:21.430> I<00:06:21.640> could<00:06:21.880> save<00:06:22.060> me
