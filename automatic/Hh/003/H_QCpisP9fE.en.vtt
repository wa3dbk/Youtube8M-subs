00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.899
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.330
 a new test video of the sony hdr cx 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.759
 320 e 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.590
 I always call this video close-up 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.240
 will know a channel knows how to do that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.330
 the whole tested camcorders always 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:24.570
 like to take photos at close-up 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:28.170
 close my dog ​​to film and for that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.179
 I just bothered a bit beautiful 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.440
 round nose here so I am me now 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.510
 always try a few centimeters so me 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.690
 I'm 67 now maybe 8 cm already his 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:46.079
 nose away and film the whole thing 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.280
 with sony hdr cx 320 so dogs have found 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.300
 I always very interesting we are 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.699
 us right in front of the big windows so 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.960
 a lot of daylight 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.360
 that is probably why it is 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.329
 one or the other keeps something about that way 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.739
 now I'll go to on this wine 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.630
 I am now 32 to 13 meters away 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.409
 I touch him so spare some 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.180
 herrchen has dragged on since and this one 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.979
 can see a lot of details that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.409
 you can see small thin hairs yourself 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.830
 on the display here I can now too 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.740
 still ran otherwise seems to always look 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 Now I am in now I have the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.030
 half optical zoom but still 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.079
 can continue to answer then again 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.700
 unfortunately the focus you need 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.979
 here again , these little hairs are there 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.579
 I then focused on the front 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.479
 see no ear how cool is that? 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.509
 that's a really cool 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.680
 reception of dog hair here too 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:57.210
 minimum wage or you moved away 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:00.710
 Now we want to let that happen 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.710
 goes out at the new recording 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:09.250
 now he will probably not because of 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.569
 test video make the running shoe here 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.750
 it is just now we go again 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.250
 These hairs grow too close 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.909
 zoomed three to four centimeters 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.560
 he moves away a bit me 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.430
 That's why they move me 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.590
 involvement 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.480
 Still, you can make tiny hairs real 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.060
 wonderful to recognize so totally awesome 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.360
 I'm totally horny again 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.040
 completely zoomed out and so if so 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.170
 one films against plain one sees only 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:52.090
 then she looks like the camera then 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:52.090
 well so that the camera talks about it 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:59.260
 Continue to create it again 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.260
 not long good 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.410
 I pretty much annoy me 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.900
 I am really 56 cm away from him 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:19.270
 with the camera does the whole thing very much 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.100
 good with but we are annoyed 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.410
 have to go out now too so he and 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.620
 I and I have also a 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.600
 clever h seen 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:36.780
 to focus on the camera somehow 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:40.570
 Can you do that because it does not matter that's it 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.500
 you your focused differently but otherwise 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:47.400
 It looks really awesome maybe 15 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.400
 Fach zoom already 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.840
 well my dog is from the wars of the test 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.490
 video of my dog ​​with close-ups 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.800
 now now I'm back with 3 cm 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.450
 The camera is removed from his photo and 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.050
 You can make it really cool 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:13.450
 we already say that was it then 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:15.220
 again you can with this 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.290
 very nice camera to capture the details 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.640
 I like it very much 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.640
 and so far you can only use this camera 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.810
 recommend that's it's comcast video 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.930
 sony hdr cx 320i and yes to the next 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.930
 times
