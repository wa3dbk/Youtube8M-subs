00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
this thing right here and this is just a

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.010 
this thing right here and this is just a
regular<00:02:01.659> Connie<00:02:02.259> ur<00:02:02.999> 16:25<00:02:03.999> I<00:02:04.030> guess<00:02:04.420> is<00:02:04.630> the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
regular Connie ur 16:25 I guess is the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.660 
regular Connie ur 16:25 I guess is the
code<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.689> think<00:02:07.689> this<00:02:07.869> was<00:02:08.080> like<00:02:08.110> about<00:02:09.100> less
