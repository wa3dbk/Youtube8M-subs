00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
then lay off him running once it hits

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.260 
then lay off him running once it hits
the<00:00:46.829> front<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.309> he<00:00:47.550> doesn't<00:00:47.850> hit<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> front

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the front if he doesn't hit a front

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.369 
the front if he doesn't hit a front
we're<00:00:48.390> gonna<00:00:48.539> lay<00:00:48.690> off<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:49.020> soon<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.260> we

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
we're gonna lay off as soon as we

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.869 
we're gonna lay off as soon as we
possibly<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:49.980> make<00:00:50.250> sure<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.670> lose

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
possibly can and make sure we don't lose

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.939 
possibly can and make sure we don't lose
what<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.719> lose<00:00:51.960> outs<00:00:52.170> from<00:00:52.260> absolutely

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
what we lose outs from absolutely

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:53.270 
what we lose outs from absolutely
minimal

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
minimal

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.369 
minimal
now<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.239> pre-race<00:00:54.629> trading<00:00:55.020> they're<00:00:55.170> just

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
now the pre-race trading they're just

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.990 
now the pre-race trading they're just
just<00:00:55.680> being<00:00:55.890> caught<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> back<00:00:56.760> foot

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
just being caught on on the back foot

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.340 
just being caught on on the back foot
because<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> didn't<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:57.989> lay

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
because I didn't want that like lay

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.110 
because I didn't want that like lay
orders<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:58.800> taken<00:00:59.190> before<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.760> orders

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
orders get taken before the back orders

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.840 
orders get taken before the back orders
so<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.739> take<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> tix<00:01:02.609> loss

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
so I have to take a tix loss

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.289 
so I have to take a tix loss
straightaway<00:01:03.270> there<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:03.539> 6.0<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.880> I'll

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
straightaway there at 6.0 and then I'll

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.969 
straightaway there at 6.0 and then I'll
be<00:01:06.479> looking<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
be looking to see if we can get that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.609 
be looking to see if we can get that
tick<00:01:08.189> back<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.180> take<00:01:10.080> mistake<00:01:10.409> out

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
tick back in there and take mistake out

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.410 
tick back in there and take mistake out
of<00:01:10.740> five<00:01:10.890> nine<00:01:11.159> don't<00:01:11.729> go<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.060> running<00:01:12.299> well

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
of five nine don't go and running well

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.640 
of five nine don't go and running well
that<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> stakes<00:01:12.840> obviously<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> pre

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that the stakes obviously that's a pre

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.899 
that the stakes obviously that's a pre
race<00:01:13.770> trading<00:01:14.189> state<00:01:14.400> that's<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:14.729> used

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
race trading state that's what I'm used

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.640 
race trading state that's what I'm used
to<00:01:15.000> using<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.330> pre-race<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.229> I'm<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
now we haven't got a great amount of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.210 
now we haven't got a great amount of
profit<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.409> I'm<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.590> gonna<00:01:43.710> wrecks<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> just

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
profit so I'm not gonna wrecks it just

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.440 
profit so I'm not gonna wrecks it just
yet<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.579> don't<00:01:44.729> believe<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.149> horse<00:01:45.329> has

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
yet and I don't believe the horse has

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.630 
yet and I don't believe the horse has
gone<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.720> far<00:01:45.960> forward<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.380> he<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
gone as far forward as he will and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.670 
gone as far forward as he will and
that's<00:01:47.880> why<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.090> start<00:01:48.450> laying<00:01:48.630> off<00:01:48.810> mistakes

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
that's why I start laying off mistakes

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.289 
that's why I start laying off mistakes
further<00:01:49.979> down<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> ladder<00:01:50.399> any<00:01:50.670> anticipation

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
further down the ladder any anticipation

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.450 
further down the ladder any anticipation
that<00:01:51.479> yards<00:01:51.810> will<00:01:51.990> close<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> little<00:01:52.530> I'm

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that yards will close a little I'm

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.600 
that yards will close a little I'm
certain<00:01:53.700> laughs<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.380> 44.4<00:01:55.380> yes<00:01:56.369> that's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
certain laughs on 44.4 yes that's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.830 
certain laughs on 44.4 yes that's
probably<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.909> good<00:01:57.000> little<00:01:57.180> place<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.719> out

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
probably a good little place to get out

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.490 
probably a good little place to get out
good<00:01:58.350> little<00:01:58.530> place<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.710> get<00:01:58.979> out<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.640> and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
good little place to get out because and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.200 
good little place to get out because and
the<00:02:01.500> horse<00:02:01.740> can't<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:02.460> go<00:02:02.579> well<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.030> could

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the horse can't really go well it could

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.639 
the horse can't really go well it could
go<00:02:03.360> maybe<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.689> length<00:02:03.899> or<00:02:04.049> two<00:02:04.200> further<00:02:04.439> ahead

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
go maybe a length or two further ahead

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.870 
go maybe a length or two further ahead
of<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> field<00:02:05.070> but<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.579> gonna<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.820> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
of the field but it's not gonna have a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.249 
of the field but it's not gonna have a
huge<00:02:06.090> amount<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.360> resources<00:02:06.570> gone<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.049> far<00:02:07.140> as

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
huge amount of resources gone as far as

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.100 
huge amount of resources gone as far as
it<00:02:07.439> possibly<00:02:07.469> can<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:09.450> we've<00:02:09.569> gone<00:02:09.720> as<00:02:09.869> far<00:02:09.899> as

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
it possibly can so we've gone as far as

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.750 
it possibly can so we've gone as far as
the<00:02:10.560> reaction<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.190> markets<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:11.700> to
