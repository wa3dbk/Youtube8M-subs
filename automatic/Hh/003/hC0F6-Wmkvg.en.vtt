00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.530 

chatter<00:01:22.370> that's<00:01:22.549> never<00:01:22.790> been<00:01:23.000> frozen<00:01:23.270> I

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
chatter that's never been frozen I

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.070 
chatter that's never been frozen I
really<00:01:23.810> can't<00:01:24.049> tell<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.320> difference<00:01:26.080> about

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
really can't tell the difference about

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.580 
really can't tell the difference about
the<00:01:27.409> same<00:01:29.530> okay<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.360> let's<00:01:32.360> eat<00:01:32.540> frozen<00:01:33.229> flavor

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
the same okay so let's eat frozen flavor

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.800 
the same okay so let's eat frozen flavor
you<00:01:33.740> can<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:34.940> can<00:01:35.150> shred<00:01:35.390> while<00:01:35.690> it's

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
you can you can shred while it's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.350 
you can you can shred while it's
still<00:01:36.110> frozen<00:01:36.580> I'm<00:01:37.580> gonna<00:01:37.729> wait<00:01:38.000> I'm<00:01:38.240> gonna

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
still frozen I'm gonna wait I'm gonna

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.410 
still frozen I'm gonna wait I'm gonna
let<00:01:38.540> this<00:01:38.720> thought<00:01:39.110> out<00:01:39.940> unless<00:01:40.940> you<00:01:41.149> get

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
let this thought out unless you get

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.010 
let this thought out unless you get
still<00:01:43.030> no<00:01:44.030> I<00:01:44.060> just<00:01:44.390> read<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.630> difference

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
still no I just read the difference

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.320 
still no I just read the difference
between<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:46.670> two<00:01:47.060> cream<00:01:47.690> cheeses<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.759> one<00:01:50.000> on

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
between the two cream cheeses the one on

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.600 
between the two cream cheeses the one on
this<00:01:50.720> side<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:51.590> can<00:01:51.920> see<00:01:51.950> it's<00:01:52.280> kind<00:01:52.520> of

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
this side you can see it's kind of

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.669 
this side you can see it's kind of
gotten<00:01:52.790> all<00:01:53.000> watery<00:01:53.600> this<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.410> one<00:01:54.530> that

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
gotten all watery this is the one that

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.109 
gotten all watery this is the one that
was<00:01:55.130> frozen<00:01:55.750> this<00:01:56.750> one<00:01:57.020> on<00:01:57.490> my<00:01:58.490> left<00:01:58.820> your

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
was frozen this one on my left your

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.690 
was frozen this one on my left your
right<00:01:59.179> is<00:01:59.660> never<00:02:00.619> frozen<00:02:00.890> was<00:02:01.220> just<00:02:01.429> been<00:02:01.580> in

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
right is never frozen was just been in

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.180 
right is never frozen was just been in
the<00:02:01.820> refrigerator<00:02:01.910> for<00:02:02.390> about<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.720> week<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.590> so

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
the refrigerator for about a week and so

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.469 
the refrigerator for about a week and so
I<00:02:04.220> want<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.670> see<00:02:05.619> if<00:02:06.619> they<00:02:07.130> should<00:02:07.300> spread<00:02:08.300> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
I want to see if they should spread the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.850 
I want to see if they should spread the
same<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:08.929> personally<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.440> one<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.739> was

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
same so personally the one that was

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.259 
same so personally the one that was
refrigerated<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:12.760> behaves<00:02:13.760> exactly

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
refrigerated and that behaves exactly

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.500 
refrigerated and that behaves exactly
the<00:02:15.220> way<00:02:16.220> you'd<00:02:16.430> think<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.820> would<00:02:17.980> then<00:02:18.980> this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
the way you'd think it would then this

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.170 
the way you'd think it would then this
okay<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:20.720> as<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.620> texture<00:02:22.100> has<00:02:22.370> changed<00:02:22.489> a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
okay this as the texture has changed a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.809 
okay this as the texture has changed a
lot<00:02:24.519> much<00:02:25.519> more<00:02:25.550> crumbly<00:02:26.390> and

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.149 

well<00:02:31.299> it<00:02:31.450> goes<00:02:31.629> on<00:02:31.870> but<00:02:32.790> stiffer<00:02:33.790> more<00:02:34.420> crumbly

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
well it goes on but stiffer more crumbly

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:52.930 
well it goes on but stiffer more crumbly
no<00:02:36.159> there's<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.489> taste<00:02:36.760> difference

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.550 

well<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.750> don't<00:02:53.990> think<00:02:54.110> there's<00:02:54.260> much<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.500> a

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
well I don't think there's much of a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.780 
well I don't think there's much of a
taste<00:02:54.800> difference<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.280> think<00:02:55.310> that's<00:02:55.670> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
taste difference I think that's a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.270 
taste difference I think that's a
success<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:59.120> water<00:02:59.720> stuff<00:03:00.710> that's<00:03:00.950> kind

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
success that the water stuff that's kind

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.070 
success that the water stuff that's kind
of<00:03:01.310> separated<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:01.940> kind<00:03:02.180> of<00:03:02.210> looks<00:03:02.420> gross<00:03:02.690> and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
of separated it kind of looks gross and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.670 
of separated it kind of looks gross and
the<00:03:03.200> keys<00:03:03.530> was<00:03:04.430> awfully<00:03:04.850> not<00:03:05.720> as<00:03:05.960> spreadable

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
the keys was awfully not as spreadable

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.410 
the keys was awfully not as spreadable
but<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.210> guess<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.540> could<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:09.050> theory

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
but but I guess you could in theory

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:22.980 
but but I guess you could in theory
freeze<00:03:12.310> cheese<00:03:14.230> my<00:03:15.230> favorite<00:03:15.620> cheese's

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.050 

this<00:03:23.990> one<00:03:24.200> has<00:03:24.380> never<00:03:24.530> been<00:03:24.800> frozen<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.790> I

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
this one has never been frozen and I

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.990 
this one has never been frozen and I
notice<00:03:26.450> while<00:03:27.140> they're<00:03:27.320> still<00:03:27.560> in<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.710> bag

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
notice while they're still in the bag

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.850 
notice while they're still in the bag
this<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.270> this<00:03:29.570> just<00:03:30.040> breaks<00:03:31.040> apart<00:03:31.280> or<00:03:31.940> adds

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
this is this just breaks apart or adds

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.380 
this is this just breaks apart or adds
the<00:03:33.860> one<00:03:34.040> that's<00:03:34.220> never<00:03:34.430> been<00:03:34.640> from<00:03:34.910> them<00:03:35.120> it's

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
the one that's never been from them it's

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.490 
the one that's never been from them it's
still<00:03:35.630> kind<00:03:35.990> of<00:03:36.130> stiff<00:03:37.960> she's<00:03:38.960> kind<00:03:39.290> of<00:03:39.320> got

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
still kind of stiff she's kind of got

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.620 
still kind of stiff she's kind of got
wet<00:03:39.800> inside<00:03:40.490> looks<00:03:40.910> really<00:03:41.150> shiny

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
wet inside looks really shiny

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.320 
wet inside looks really shiny
I<00:03:42.700> got<00:03:43.700> cheese<00:03:43.970> grater<00:03:44.210> unless<00:03:44.480> he<00:03:44.720> does

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
I got cheese grater unless he does

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.960 
I got cheese grater unless he does
that's<00:03:47.380> what<00:03:48.380> normal<00:03:48.620> pecorino<00:03:49.370> romano<00:03:49.400> looks

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
that's what normal pecorino romano looks

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.750 
that's what normal pecorino romano looks
like<00:03:51.580> this<00:03:52.580> is<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.860> it<00:03:55.070> just<00:03:55.100> falls<00:03:55.580> apart

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
like this is and it just falls apart

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.650 
like this is and it just falls apart
when<00:03:56.240> I<00:03:56.360> strutting<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:59.120> can<00:03:59.360> kind<00:03:59.570> of

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
when I strutting it and you can kind of

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.520 
when I strutting it and you can kind of
get<00:04:00.320> a<00:04:00.350> close-up<00:04:00.620> on<00:04:00.920> that<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:03.050> beautiful

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
get a close-up on that this is beautiful

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.430 
get a close-up on that this is beautiful
shredding<00:04:03.920> this<00:04:04.070> is<00:04:04.280> just<00:04:04.459> kind<00:04:04.670> of<00:04:04.790> just

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
shredding this is just kind of just

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.810 
shredding this is just kind of just
crumbles<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.530> does<00:04:06.709> not<00:04:06.860> hold<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.310> shape<00:04:07.580> at<00:04:07.730> all

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
crumbles it does not hold a shape at all

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.949 
crumbles it does not hold a shape at all
so<00:04:08.650> definitely<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:10.280> different<00:04:10.940> texture<00:04:11.240> on<00:04:11.750> the

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
so definitely a different texture on the

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:29.600 
so definitely a different texture on the
frozen<00:04:12.380> one

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.240 

no<00:04:30.210> not<00:04:30.689> the<00:04:30.840> same<00:04:31.020> case<00:04:31.289> so<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.650> guess<00:04:31.919> you<00:04:32.039> did

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
no not the same case so I guess you did

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.730 
no not the same case so I guess you did
previously<00:04:32.520> just<00:04:33.050> keep<00:04:34.050> lying<00:04:34.259> that<00:04:34.470> it's

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
previously just keep lying that it's

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.309 
previously just keep lying that it's
going<00:04:34.889> to<00:04:34.949> be<00:04:35.069> hard<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.340> shred<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:36.319> pecorino

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
going to be hard to shred and pecorino

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.170 
going to be hard to shred and pecorino
romano<00:04:37.500> is<00:04:37.919> not<00:04:38.280> going<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.550> hold<00:04:38.639> its<00:04:38.819> shape<00:04:38.879> at

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
romano is not going to hold its shape at

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.659 
romano is not going to hold its shape at
all<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:40.229> just<00:04:40.289> kind<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.740> breaks<00:04:41.009> apart<00:04:41.400> on<00:04:41.550> the

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
all it just kind of breaks apart on the

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.559 
all it just kind of breaks apart on the
curtain<00:04:43.129> okay<00:04:44.129> that's<00:04:44.340> all<00:04:44.490> for<00:04:45.060> now<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.509> am

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
curtain okay that's all for now I am

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.300 
curtain okay that's all for now I am
going<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.139> try<00:04:46.319> some<00:04:46.500> other<00:04:46.590> experiments<00:04:47.189> here

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
going to try some other experiments here

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.060 
going to try some other experiments here
in<00:04:47.400> just<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.699> second
