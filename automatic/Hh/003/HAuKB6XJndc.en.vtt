00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
did the one that stood out to me the

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.120 
did the one that stood out to me the
most<00:01:49.060> was<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.870> opening<00:01:50.170> exercise<00:01:50.620> in<00:01:50.950> which

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
most was the opening exercise in which

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.670 
most was the opening exercise in which
she<00:01:51.640> had<00:01:51.820> us<00:01:52.000> move<00:01:52.750> freely<00:01:53.020> through<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.409> space

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
she had us move freely through the space

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.070 
she had us move freely through the space
and<00:01:53.950> lead<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:55.150> movement<00:01:55.299> with<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.630> particular

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
and lead the movement with a particular

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.020 
and lead the movement with a particular
part<00:01:56.290> of<00:01:56.320> our<00:01:56.440> body<00:01:56.650> like<00:01:57.040> an<00:01:57.190> arm<00:01:57.400> or<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.700> hand

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
part of our body like an arm or a hand

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.510 
part of our body like an arm or a hand
or<00:01:58.180> an<00:01:58.299> ankle<00:01:58.600> normally<00:01:59.470> improv<00:02:00.010> is<00:02:00.190> sort<00:02:00.400> of<00:02:00.430> a

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
or an ankle normally improv is sort of a

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.830 
or an ankle normally improv is sort of a
challenge<00:02:00.850> for<00:02:01.000> me<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.270> dance<00:02:01.450> because<00:02:01.630> I'm

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
challenge for me and dance because I'm

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.300 
challenge for me and dance because I'm
less<00:02:02.080> experienced<00:02:02.650> and<00:02:02.740> I'm<00:02:02.890> less

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
less experienced and I'm less

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.430 
less experienced and I'm less
adventurous<00:02:03.820> with<00:02:03.940> my<00:02:04.090> movement<00:02:04.510> but<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:05.290> was

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
adventurous with my movement but it was

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.960 
adventurous with my movement but it was
simple<00:02:05.770> enough<00:02:05.799> lead<00:02:06.340> with<00:02:06.460> your<00:02:06.490> hand<00:02:06.760> lead

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
simple enough lead with your hand lead

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.090 
simple enough lead with your hand lead
with<00:02:07.090> your<00:02:07.150> foot<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.600> I<00:02:07.630> found<00:02:08.470> myself<00:02:08.679> being

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
with your foot that I found myself being

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.680 
with your foot that I found myself being
much<00:02:09.280> more<00:02:09.489> inventive<00:02:09.820> than<00:02:09.970> I<00:02:10.179> normally<00:02:10.540> am

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
much more inventive than I normally am

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.330 
much more inventive than I normally am
and<00:02:11.049> much<00:02:11.260> more<00:02:11.440> comfortable<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.130> space

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
and much more comfortable in the space

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.630 
and much more comfortable in the space
and<00:02:12.640> exploring<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.299> movement<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:15.340> me<00:02:15.430> her

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
and exploring the movement for me her

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.250 
and exploring the movement for me her
visit<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:15.970> really<00:02:16.120> perfectly<00:02:16.630> timed<00:02:16.900> because

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
visit is really perfectly timed because

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.199 
visit is really perfectly timed because
I'm<00:02:17.500> taking<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:18.130> dance<00:02:18.310> composition<00:02:18.940> course

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
I'm taking a dance composition course

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.320 
I'm taking a dance composition course

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
we're talking about site-specific dance

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.880 
we're talking about site-specific dance
pieces<00:02:24.519> so<00:02:25.450> we're<00:02:25.660> finding<00:02:26.440> different

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
pieces so we're finding different

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.530 
pieces so we're finding different
environments<00:02:27.519> in<00:02:27.580> which<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.970> work<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.330> then

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
environments in which to work and then

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.229 
environments in which to work and then
creating<00:02:28.989> dance<00:02:29.200> pieces<00:02:29.500> based<00:02:30.310> on<00:02:30.640> what<00:02:31.120> we

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
creating dance pieces based on what we

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.509 
creating dance pieces based on what we
find<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:31.810> those<00:02:31.930> environments<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.400> it's

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
find in those environments and so it's

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.630 
find in those environments and so it's
really<00:02:33.670> interesting<00:02:33.970> for<00:02:34.330> me

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
really interesting for me

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.940 
really interesting for me
