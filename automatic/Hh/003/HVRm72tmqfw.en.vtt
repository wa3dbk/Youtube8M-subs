00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
frustrating because the paper paper

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.389 
frustrating because the paper paper
dollar<00:00:59.360> bills<00:00:59.690> it<00:01:00.229> worn<00:01:00.500> out<00:01:00.649> really<00:01:01.100> quickly

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
dollar bills it worn out really quickly

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.090 
dollar bills it worn out really quickly
and<00:01:01.789> it<00:01:01.940> turns<00:01:02.210> out<00:01:02.360> to<00:01:02.510> be<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:03.739> know<00:01:03.769> a<00:01:03.890> lot

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
and it turns out to be you know a lot

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.040 
and it turns out to be you know a lot
more<00:01:04.129> expensive<00:01:04.699> tax<00:01:05.239> money<00:01:05.509> to<00:01:05.600> make<00:01:05.869> these

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
more expensive tax money to make these

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.469 
more expensive tax money to make these
dollar<00:01:06.560> bills<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.479> environmental

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
dollar bills and the environmental

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:17.500 
dollar bills and the environmental
consequences<00:01:08.960> also

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.700 

you

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.250 

so<00:01:25.430> I<00:01:25.460> really<00:01:25.729> think<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.000> solution<00:01:26.299> is<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:27.020> to

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
so I really think the solution is is to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.950 
so I really think the solution is is to
stop<00:01:27.560> printing<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.220> dollar<00:01:28.430> bill<00:01:28.690> will<00:01:29.690> start

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
stop printing the dollar bill will start

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.020 
stop printing the dollar bill will start
printing<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.409> two-dollar<00:01:30.680> bill<00:01:31.030> the

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
printing the two-dollar bill the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.120 
printing the two-dollar bill the
two-dollar<00:01:32.330> bill<00:01:32.659> on<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:32.900> dollar<00:01:33.140> coin<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.890> think

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
two-dollar bill on a dollar coin I think

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.399 
two-dollar bill on a dollar coin I think
everybody<00:01:34.550> should<00:01:34.790> be<00:01:34.940> happy<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:36.170> that<00:01:36.290> can

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
everybody should be happy and that can

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.920 
everybody should be happy and that can
have<00:01:36.440> five<00:01:36.890> hours<00:01:36.920> worth<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.790> coins<00:01:38.600> in<00:01:38.900> your

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
how much of a hassle it is when you get

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.899 
how much of a hassle it is when you get
like<00:01:46.130> ten<00:01:46.430> dollar<00:01:47.090> bills<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:47.720> your<00:01:47.810> wallet<00:01:48.350> so

like ten dollar bills and your wallet so

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.130 
like ten dollar bills and your wallet so
