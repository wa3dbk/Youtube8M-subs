00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
at the boot I'm going to go on this

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.850 
at the boot I'm going to go on this
little<00:03:25.670> edge<00:03:26.000> right<00:03:26.180> now<00:03:26.239> there's<00:03:27.050> a<00:03:27.230> little

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
little edge right now there's a little

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.350 
little edge right now there's a little
spikes<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.760> these<00:03:30.220> studs<00:03:31.330> they're<00:03:32.330> very

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
cool-looking I guess you got orange

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.810 
cool-looking I guess you got orange
orange<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.600> then<00:03:38.690> silver<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:40.010> goes<00:03:40.310> short

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
orange and then silver and it goes short

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.050 
orange and then silver and it goes short
short<00:03:41.540> big<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:43.190> that's<00:03:43.340> pretty<00:03:43.550> going<00:03:43.880> to

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
short big so that's pretty going to

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.449 
short big so that's pretty going to
bring<00:03:44.209> out<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.480> other<00:03:44.570> food<00:03:45.380> right<00:03:45.560> now<00:03:45.590> and

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
bring out the other food right now and

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.370 
bring out the other food right now and
I'm<00:03:46.880> just<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.270> thing<00:03:47.480> I'd<00:03:47.630> like<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.840> point<00:03:47.989> out

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
I'm just the thing I'd like to point out

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.160 
I'm just the thing I'd like to point out
is<00:03:48.650> I'm<00:03:49.310> right<00:03:49.550> here<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.570> probably<00:03:50.870> can't

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
is I'm right here you probably can't

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.930 
is I'm right here you probably can't
read<00:03:51.290> it<00:03:51.470> because<00:03:51.590> it's<00:03:51.890> in<00:03:52.010> very<00:03:52.250> small<00:03:52.430> font

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
read it because it's in very small font

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.320 
read it because it's in very small font
but<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:54.050> does<00:03:54.380> say<00:03:54.709> created<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.730> exact

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
but it does say created to the exact

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.940 
but it does say created to the exact
specifications<00:03:57.290> of<00:03:57.500> Cristiano<00:03:58.130> Ronaldo<00:03:58.840> and

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
specifications of Cristiano Ronaldo and

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.360 
specifications of Cristiano Ronaldo and
the<00:04:00.950> colorway<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.209> not<00:04:02.360> a<00:04:03.370> Ronaldo's

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
the colorway this is not a Ronaldo's

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.000 
the colorway this is not a Ronaldo's
idea<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:05.030> did<00:04:05.750> read<00:04:05.960> an<00:04:06.110> article<00:04:06.320> that<00:04:06.620> said
