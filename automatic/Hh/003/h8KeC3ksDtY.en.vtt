not go that long without post in the
gameplay<00:00:47.879> i<00:00:47.910> think<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> longest<00:00:48.570> time<00:00:48.600> went

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
gameplay i think the longest time went

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.200 
gameplay i think the longest time went
before<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.379> maybe<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.739> few<00:00:49.980> days<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.550> think

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
before was maybe a few days I think

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.939 
before was maybe a few days I think
maybe<00:00:51.300> four<00:00:51.660> days<00:00:51.690> tops<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.800> been

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
maybe four days tops but it's been

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.520 
maybe four days tops but it's been
seriously<00:00:53.399> over<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> week<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.410> it's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
seriously over a week and I think it's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.560 
seriously over a week and I think it's
time<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.829> back<00:00:55.980> into<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
time to get back into it and the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.490
