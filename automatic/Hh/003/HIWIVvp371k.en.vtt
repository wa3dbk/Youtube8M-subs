the sparrow that is my special

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.450 
the sparrow that is my special
especially<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.619> called<00:01:10.830> out<00:01:11.040> writer

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
especially is actually called out writer

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.920 
especially is actually called out writer

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.660 
and out writer has two different
abilities<00:01:13.290> one<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.189> think<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.490> called

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
abilities one is I think it's called

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.520 
abilities one is I think it's called
pulse<00:01:15.000> where<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.540> pulse<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> environment

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
pulse where you pulse the environment

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.980 
pulse where you pulse the environment
and<00:01:16.770> it'll<00:01:17.580> show<00:01:17.610> where<00:01:18.270> enemies<00:01:18.450> are<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and it'll show where enemies are on the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.050 
and it'll show where enemies are on the
map<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.650> enemies<00:01:20.009> know<00:01:20.280> they've<00:01:20.520> been<00:01:20.549> pulsed

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
map but enemies know they've been pulsed

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.090 
map but enemies know they've been pulsed
so<00:01:21.330> that's<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.350> know<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> balancing

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
so that's kind of you know a balancing
thing<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.360> also<00:01:24.509> choose<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.840 
were able to balance everything so far
everything<00:01:52.590> feels<00:01:52.890> balanced<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.490> terms<00:01:53.700> of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850

I'm<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.009> little<00:01:56.369> worried<00:01:56.610> about<00:01:56.670> which<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
I'm a little worried about which is a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.999 
I'm a little worried about which is a
war<00:01:57.420> machine<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.320> definitely<00:01:58.649> the

war machine it's it's definitely the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.889 
war machine it's it's definitely the
easiest<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.670> use<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> close-range

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
easiest to use it's like a close-range

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.469 
easiest to use it's like a close-range
new<00:02:01.200> tube<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.829> you're<00:02:02.759> not<00:02:02.880> terrible<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.390> the

thing<00:02:05.369> no<00:02:05.490> matter<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.390> some<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.689> them

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
thing no matter what but some of them

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.449 
thing no matter what but some of them
are<00:02:07.020> genuinely<00:02:07.500> hard<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.860> use<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.190> bow<00:02:08.310> and

are genuinely hard to use the bow and

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.450 
are genuinely hard to use the bow and
arrow<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.819> not

I<00:02:10.520> wouldn't<00:02:11.480> say<00:02:11.540> it's<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.720> easiest<00:02:12.020> thing<00:02:12.260> to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
I wouldn't say it's the easiest thing to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.220 
I wouldn't say it's the easiest thing to
use<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.920> lot<00:02:13.130> more<00:02:13.460> of<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.670> feel<00:02:13.940> thing<00:02:14.240> and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
use it's a lot more of a feel thing and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.890 
use it's a lot more of a feel thing and
being<00:02:15.740> lucky<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.190> suppose<00:02:16.310> as<00:02:16.760> well<00:02:16.940> but<00:02:17.570> I<00:02:17.780> was

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
being lucky I suppose as well but I was

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.240 
being lucky I suppose as well but I was
able<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.140> build<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.500> streak<00:02:18.770> right<00:02:18.950> there<00:02:19.130> as

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
able to build a streak right there as

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.000 
able to build a streak right there as
you<00:02:19.370> guys<00:02:19.520> saw<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.120> get<00:02:20.900> all<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.530> my<00:02:21.560> streaks

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
you guys saw and get all of my streaks

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.120 
you guys saw and get all of my streaks
and<00:02:22.250> my<00:02:23.120> sparrow<00:02:23.780> also<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:24.920> how<00:02:25.070> you

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
and my sparrow also this is how you

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.760 
and my sparrow also this is how you
don't<00:02:25.640> use<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> hellstorm<00:02:26.780> missile<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:27.380> don't

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
don't use a hellstorm missile I don't

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.110 
don't use a hellstorm missile I don't
know<00:02:27.860> why<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.040> shot<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.610> there<00:02:28.790> were<00:02:28.910> no

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
know why I shot that there were no

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.110 
know why I shot that there were no
little<00:02:29.600> red<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.710> know<00:02:30.800> circles<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.790> area

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
little red you know circles in the area

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.060 
little red you know circles in the area
at<00:02:32.300> all<00:02:32.600> there<00:02:33.380> are<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.470> lot<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.620> things<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.920> can

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
at all there are a lot of things you can

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.920 
at all there are a lot of things you can
do<00:02:34.160> with<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> hellstorm<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:35.720> most

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
do with the hellstorm but you most

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.900 
do with the hellstorm but you most
likely<00:02:36.380> don't<00:02:36.590> want<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.130> unleash<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.760> that

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
likely don't want to unleash it that

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.880 
likely don't want to unleash it that
early<00:02:38.240> that<00:02:38.600> was<00:02:38.780> an<00:02:38.900> example<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.350> how<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:39.560> not

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
early that was an example of how you not

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.320 
early that was an example of how you not
how<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.610> should<00:02:40.820> not<00:02:41.000> do<00:02:41.120> that

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
how you should not do that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.420 
how you should not do that
ok<00:02:41.990> so<00:02:42.050> right<00:02:42.470> here<00:02:42.680> I've<00:02:42.800> got<00:02:42.950> my<00:02:42.980> Sparrow

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040

was<00:03:01.790> able<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.030> get<00:03:02.270> about<00:03:02.870> three<00:03:03.140> kills<00:03:03.380> which

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
was able to get about three kills which

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.930 
was able to get about three kills which
is<00:03:03.740> pretty<00:03:04.040> good<00:03:04.310> with<00:03:04.430> one<00:03:04.610> of<00:03:04.700> those<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:04.910> would

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
is pretty good with one of those I would

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.230 
is pretty good with one of those I would
say<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.300> average<00:03:05.480> is<00:03:05.840> probably<00:03:06.220> one<00:03:07.240> maybe

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
say the average is probably one maybe

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.200 
say the average is probably one maybe
not<00:03:08.390> even<00:03:08.840> one<00:03:09.220> kills<00:03:10.220> with<00:03:10.550> your<00:03:10.730> specialist

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
not even one kills with your specialist

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.570 
not even one kills with your specialist
