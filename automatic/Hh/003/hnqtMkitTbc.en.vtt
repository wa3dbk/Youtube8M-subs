00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
when the battery went flat was when the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.140 
when the battery went flat was when the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
because we've been quiet for so long but

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.490

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
now it was house impressed with it I

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.010 
now it was house impressed with it I
mean<00:02:47.890> we<00:02:48.010> only<00:02:48.430> had<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> short<00:02:48.970> charge<00:02:49.540> on<00:02:49.840> that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020
