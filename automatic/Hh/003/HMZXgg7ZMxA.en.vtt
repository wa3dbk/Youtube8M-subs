00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.189
 hi to all in this video i'm going 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.440
 introduce you to a knife that you need 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:09.230
 surely know the famous kabar who 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.999
 belongs to the US Marines it's 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.230
 a great knife so I advise you 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.999
 to watch until the end of the review 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.160
 where I will give you my point of view 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.240
 in short I will start with you first 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.009
 describe the history of the knife 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.660
 I will then give you his different 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.580
 features and I'll do some 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.640
 cutting tests and to finish as I 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.990
 wanted 10 I would give my opinion everything 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.060
 first you have to know that this knife 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.579
 is legendary indeed it was created in 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.660
 1942 not long after the beginning 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.180
 of the second world war 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.430
 it was made in collaboration with 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.440
 the marine department who wanted 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.910
 a versatile knife more exactly a 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.030
 fighting knife that also had to 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.210
 serve as a universal knife so more or 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.070
 less expensive survival plus war 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.840
 advanced and the more the knife was recognized 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.429
 by the Marines for its quality 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.070
 by the way when people talk about 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.120
 knife that would remake the kabar knife 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.640
 cabarete at the time the name of the brand 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.050
 and not the model of the knife is 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.679
 so for that reason that this knife is 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.270
 today names kaba usmc in case 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.610
 you do not know usmc i are 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.530
 initials of united states marine crop 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.080
 which of course draws 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.400
 US marines nowadays the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.680
 cabba knife is always so 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.820
 use and appreciate of course by the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.040
 but not only 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.620
 he was adopted by regiments of 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.090
 navy us naval guards army 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.680
 and it's also a very knife 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.540
 widespread among adventurers the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.990
 survivalist outdoor sportsmen 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.950
 and the knife collectors go well 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.210
 enough talk 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.800
 if you have further questions about 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.300
 the story of the knife or if you want 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.740
 know where the name of the company comes from 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.660
 you just have to send me a message 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.830
 on the comments but I do not want 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.150
 to make the video is too long for those 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.160
 who just want to watch the magazine the 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.100
 knife and who are not interested in 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.070
 the story 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.790
 in short, the knife measures fully 35 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.020
 cm he weighs 3 118 g his case what it is 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.540
 rather light for a knife this 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.220
 span 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.290
 let's move on now the blade she measures 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.460
 18 cm and it is made from 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.960
 steel 1095 krovanh I do not know him 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.369
 absolutely not in different types 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.190
 of steel so if anyone can 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.840
 explain to me differences and their 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.350
 uses respectively it would be very 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.959
 nice brief the thickness of the blade is from 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.489
 4 mm which is enough for sticks 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.700
 but not too massive to be able to 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.739
 wrist a crime now let's talk about 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.690
 the case unlike the knife that 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.269
 had been manufactured in the united states is not killed 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.650
 leather is made in mexico it's a 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.780
 very simple case of but who 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.580
 worth its price on the study phase 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.390
 the name of the knife and the 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.739
 marine lettuce logo has a 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.080
 button which allows the knife to 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.370
 stay stable he also has a 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.840
 loop to go kill them at the 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.430
 belt 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.750
 the loop is big enough is 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.430
 so compatible with any 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.290
 belt be it belt 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.930
 tactical military or even a simple 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.060
 city belt to finish with the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.790
 characteristics the handle is made to 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.959
 from wood and leather the market 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.269
 the aspect of the knife I like least 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.410
 because I do not find it very ergonomic 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.739
 aims too much when I have hands 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.140
 wet 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.010
 however the guard that separates the blade 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.239
 Sunday is very effective 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.560
 so I will start the different 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.850
 cutting tests 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.620
 firstly the usual test that 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.900
 is to cut the leaves to see 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.549
 if the blade and well disguised with a 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.780
 leaf the lady cuts very well 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.340
 so I decided to take a dozen 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.049
 of leaves and as you can see 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.049
 we get the same result 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.360
 do 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:38.799
 holding a beefier test and let's see 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:40.180
 it's the boat knife or I 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.829
 took a log of dozens of 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.420
 centimeters in diameter and like you 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.049
 can see he has no trouble cracking 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.879
 of the log 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.530
 of course you will find knives 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.689
 with a thickness of the most important 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.859
 who will do a better job but that 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.260
 remains impressive to see that this 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.549
 knife also waste either they arrive 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:09.159
 to perform tasks that require 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:11.109
 robustness and solidity a weight yet 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.819
 more positive is that even after the 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.980
 sticking the blade remains 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.690
 ditto and easily manages to cut 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.350
 little wood which will allow us to 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.350
 give a fire 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.090
 we third test is to tie 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.490
 of course, as its name indicates 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.530
 the fact of h and should be realized 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.180
 with an ax but I was very 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:55.410
 interested in seeing how the kabar gets 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:57.030
 do not judge yourself but to 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.860
 to be frank the result obtained is all to 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.940
 made correct 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.080
 again knife is not supposed 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.240
 replace the work of an age 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.220
 so I do not recommend you to let go 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.280
 unless you really need it 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.280
 make 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.740
 to finish the last test is going to be from 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.000
 bed dagger because originally this 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.120
 knife is still a knife 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.120
 fight 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.780
 thick and thick which justifies its 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.310
 durability 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.140
 ai as I told you before not 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.030
 guard that separates the blade Sunday and 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.540
 big so your hand is not likely to 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.710
 slip when you stab the 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.790
 knife can also effect 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.790
 lever as you can see 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.039
 this is for 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.300
 that there are tests understand me if 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.030
 I'm wrong but honestly all 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.960
 tests that I have done are positive 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.479
 certainly the knife is not the best 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.780
 specifically regarding the boat 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.979
 swimming or the opposite of precise cuts 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.419
 there are better shots rate of 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.250
 survival of the best butcher knife 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.560
 kraft or the best fighting knife 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.180
 but this one is the best of 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.470
 versatile knives as it is very 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.169
 effective in its three sectors has 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.569
 seemed so if you are looking for a knife 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.860
 multitasking and more precisely knife 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:17.270
 universal and fighting knife 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.560
 the cabba usmc and 100% for you 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.990
 however if you are interested 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.400
 only by a survival knife or 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.500
 a knife or a kraft Gush 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.699
 combat knife precisely I you 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.590
 advise to buy a knife 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:30.830
 specially designed for the sector 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.270
 draws you before finishing I wanted to 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.800
 tell you that you can buy this 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.629
 knife on many websites 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.659
 like amazon and other sites of 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:40.400
 knife and costs around 75 euros price 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:41.770
 which is completely justified and 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.699
 besides it is guaranteed for life 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.259
 thank you for watching the video and 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:47.710
 do not hesitate to comment if you have 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.710
 questions
