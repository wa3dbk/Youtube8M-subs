sovereigns are 0 endpoints this is the

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.309 
sovereigns are 0 endpoints this is the
important<00:01:30.200> part<00:01:30.639> this<00:01:31.639> is<00:01:31.700> where<00:01:32.170> we<00:01:33.170> decide

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
important part this is where we decide

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.529 
important part this is where we decide
whether<00:01:33.950> your<00:01:34.279> microphones<00:01:35.209> going<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.479> be

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
whether your microphones going to be

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.870 
whether your microphones going to be
able<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.779> do<00:01:35.840> tricks<00:01:36.109> on<00:01:36.229> on<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:37.490> what<00:01:37.789> I've

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
able to do tricks on on so what I've

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.719 
able to do tricks on on so what I've
done<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:38.270> set<00:01:38.539> out<00:01:38.779> on<00:01:38.859> elevator<00:01:39.859> in<00:01:40.130> throttle

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
endpoints to 120 percent you'll see you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.159 
endpoints to 120 percent you'll see you
my<00:01:46.729> guy<00:01:46.880> Rosanna<00:01:47.209> and<00:01:47.419> 20<00:01:47.599> percent<00:01:47.719> as<00:01:47.990> well

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:48.169 
my guy Rosanna and 20 percent as well

my guy Rosanna and 20 percent as well
but<00:01:48.319> I've<00:01:48.439> been<00:01:48.560> trying<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.829> experiment<00:01:49.340> with

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
but I've been trying to experiment with

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:50.559 
but I've been trying to experiment with
getting<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.759> lights<00:01:49.939> on<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.240> off

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
getting the lights on and off

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.779 
getting the lights on and off
don't<00:01:51.229> worry<00:01:51.349> about<00:01:51.439> that<00:01:54.579> next<00:01:55.579> thing

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
don't worry about that next thing

don't worry about that next thing
obviously<00:01:56.749> you<00:01:57.229> want<00:01:57.499> your<00:01:57.649> throttle<00:01:57.950> hole

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
obviously you want your throttle hole

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:04.950 
obviously you want your throttle hole
active<00:01:58.999> so<00:01:59.719> that<00:01:59.749> you<00:01:59.989> can<00:02:00.169> kill<00:02:00.859> the<00:02:00.950> throttle

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.870 
I've now got a hundred percent now it
will<00:02:48.160> do<00:02:48.510> flips<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.870> elevator<00:02:50.410> bit

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
will do flips and the elevator bit

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.160 
will do flips and the elevator bit
treble<00:02:51.880> but<00:02:52.690> not<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.080> aileron<00:02:54.270> okay<00:02:55.270> so<00:02:55.840> we

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
treble but not in the aileron okay so we

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.340 
treble but not in the aileron okay so we
can<00:02:56.380> have<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.790> selectable<00:02:57.790> as<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.050> whether<00:02:59.200> you

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
can have it selectable as to whether you

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.699 
can have it selectable as to whether you
do<00:02:59.500> flips<00:03:00.510> forwards<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.600> backwards<00:03:01.780> or

model select for the wltoys court next

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.760 
model select for the wltoys court next
step<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.550> binding<00:03:53.910> it

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
right here you can see my micro quad and

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.640 
right here you can see my micro quad and
to<00:04:02.700> stop<00:04:02.880> transmitter<00:04:03.330> as<00:04:03.990> you<00:04:04.110> can<00:04:04.230> see<00:04:04.410> I

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
to stop transmitter as you can see I

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.740 
to stop transmitter as you can see I
broke<00:04:05.460> just<00:04:05.670> stop<00:04:06.150> transmitter<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:09.390> it<00:04:09.660> all

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
broke just stop transmitter and it all

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.210 
broke just stop transmitter and it all
works<00:04:11.000> now<00:04:12.000> what<00:04:12.120> we're<00:04:12.240> going<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.390> do

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
that's a bit tougher to do with one hand

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.129 
that's a bit tougher to do with one hand
but<00:04:21.560> we'll<00:04:21.709> do<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:21.829> anyway
