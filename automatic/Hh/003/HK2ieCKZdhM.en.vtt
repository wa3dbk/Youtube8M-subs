 very good we all meet in 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.660
 the test realms in patch 5.2 and 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.609
 in this video we are going to have a guide 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.829
 of the new feat the treasures of the king 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.689
 of thunder first of all say that 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.880
 to access you need a key 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.320
 key of the palace of lis in which 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.269
 you can get killing enemies to the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.710
 list once you have that key is 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.989
 or yes it is inside the cave 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.309
 will give you a mission which you accept and 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.850
 you can queue to enter the 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.850
 new feat 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.320
 just enter you can do two things 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.720
 talk to everyone and start the gesta 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.890
 directly or if not and look at the 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.750
 left where the seller is 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.460
 look at what objects sells that though 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.050
 cost in gold coins during the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.000
 gesta those coins are going to be able 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.680
 get inside the chests and in addition 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.839
 those objects can help you as for 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.000
 deactivate traps in moving faster 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.040
 in benefits that will help you along 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.080
 of the feat once you want to start 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.990
 you are talking and uncles will make a debut 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.190
 five minutes is five minutes 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.619
 because it is what lasts the deed although 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.840
 you die this debut never leaves once 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.369
 completed the five minutes the gesta 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.020
 it's finished will take you to the 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.820
 final phase where I would talk again 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.740
 told if to leave or if you do not watch the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.390
 chests which you have already achieved 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.470
 you see throughout the feat you can open 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.450
 the chests to get more 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.880
 rewards 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.439
 as you can see, nothing else 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.960
 counted if the door is opened it places us 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.299
 the debut as I said and the goal of 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.610
 the feat is to get the most 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.350
 booty possible the booty we get from 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.270
 the chests and against further we get 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.039
 the biggest reward chests will give us 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.840
 you have to take into account a few 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.210
 traps things that there are along 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.549
 all the way for example the spiders 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.159
 although they do not stick to the tank just remove 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.009
 Life will get into networks then that you 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.420
 It makes about 34 seconds slow the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.069
 lightning bolts as you can check 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.170
 if you get to touch any one puts a 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.890
 debut a debut that also slows you down 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.100
 about 4 seconds 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.810
 the statues throw the hammer towards the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.090
 soil and if you stay inside that area 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.190
 You also stay in place in 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.569
 the 4 seconds the plates are of the 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.370
 I will not be on the ground myself 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.780
 treading if you get to step on some too 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.370
 you stay on the floor guaranteed is 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.750
 say all the traps that there are at 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.580
 along the way are only for 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.110
 leave you on the site or directly to 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.959
 that you die because apart from leaving the site 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.910
 some that take away enough life 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.770
 then how are you seeing the goal that 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.239
 try to do I is to get what 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.069
 as far as possible and open the odd 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.720
 chest by the way is to say if you are 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.190
 seeing this only Taurus and this one that 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.230
 I'm opening it has already given me a coin 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.850
 of gold that I could use 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.010
 to buy the seller tir the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.650
 different items they sell say then 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.510
 that as you can see now the enemies to 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.010
 that we are going to face 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.600
 small spiders that hardly remove 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.300
 life the enemy that I am facing 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.459
 I now then some dogs that if not 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.989
 you enter combat do not attack you, that is to say 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.700
 you can move to your side that if not 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.860
 You are in combat if you do not detect that there is 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.110
 with that there is someone directly you do not 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.519
 does nothing then my personal advice 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.950
 is that when you face an enemy 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.780
 you stay still and kill him because 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.730
 imagine that I now that enemy what 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.250
 He left me still and I keep going 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.420
 digging I will never abandon combat and 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.159
 the dogs that for example that you see 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.230
 now that they are here if they come to me 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.909
 detect in combat then directly 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.500
 I have to kill the now instead step 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.400
 to yours and nothing happens I do not do any 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.780
 skill and do not touch me then the third 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000
 door that you are seeing that I am a 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.769
 to the right I forgot and you have to 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.030
 go first to the left give the 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.519
 switch that you are going to see that come to 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.650
 give it now and then give it back 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.180
 remember the green areas give us 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.069
 the movement speed will increase 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.049
 red areas will slow you down and leave you 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.060
 and you will stay still on the site like this 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.440
 be careful where you step, you can see 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.510
 example that I am going towards the 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.799
 door on the left the dogs are going to 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.390
 see that I'm going to move on to his and he's not going to 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.799
 spend nothing has me invisible 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.720
 mainly for the big one that's not 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.670
 You have to kill him once I give him 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.319
 this switch the other side door 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.629
 it opens and I go back to the other side 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.370
 the objective as I said well is 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.260
 get as far as possible 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.329
 because in the end we will find a 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.310
 enemy far superior to the rest the 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.870
 which if we do not kill it will give us an achievement 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.730
 and also there is not a special chest that 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.470
 he has his back if by a casual 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.370
 we come to kill him directly he does not pass 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.040
 nothing 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.630
 look for example in dogs a good 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.919
 example that you are going to see now there is no 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.229
 no one around do nothing 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.790
 they have directly detected that someone 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.770
 has used some skill ok combat has 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.690
 got the ability to make myself invisible 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.800
 have seen that I am close and directly 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.139
 they are active and they start attacking 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.580
 so that's why I tell you that when 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.260
 ye remain always someone you have to 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.419
 Stand still for example 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.220
 now another dog has detected that it is 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.840
 in combat for the spider that the spider in 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.289
 yes it does not do anything it just gets you 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.869
 networks as you are watching 5 seconds 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.960
 it does not take anything away from you but it bothers you 

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:51.999
 so that it bothers you because it gets you in 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.159
 combat and you have to kill the dog and 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:56.560
 you say good because I put them fear I leave you 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.780
 slowed down on the site whatever 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.060
 but again big mistake because if 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.860
 you keep moving forward the dogs are going to 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.630
 follow and then at the end you will have 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.190
 too many enemies and time goes 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.350
 happening that is there is no way to stop 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.660
 the time the achievement that just me 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.310
 jumping is mainly because the 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.990
 statues a lot when you go over 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.000
 below one ahead what better 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.010
 said they make the fist down if 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.660
 get that fist take one of these 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.830
 big is going to give an achievement like I 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.210
 I ended up giving to myself I did not 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.760
 intentionally he simply had 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.320
 luck and then as I told you how much 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.090
 further you will get to look to the right 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.770
 well now you will see it better when it kills 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.810
 this big one here to notice that 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.280
 example there is a big enemy that has 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.620
 a concenso back and two dogs to his 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.290
 around and behind him he has three 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.280
 chests there are three large chests what 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.080
 means this as I said 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.300
 the farther you get if you get 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.210
 come to the end they will give you rewards 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.710
 superior in this way as I do not 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.919
 will give time to kill the great kill 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.660
 the dogs and everything because he tried the week 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.490
 a way of saying good then now 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.900
 that I put them fear directly as 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.849
 so they do not attack me and take the 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.159
 reward of the chests 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.619
 you have two options or you try to kill him 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:05.050
 if you do not pass him, you try to open the 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:06.960
 chest but time is time there is no 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.460
 way to increase it 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.620
 and then nothing more people like I've already 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.169
 said after five minutes if you 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.940
 time ends and the first time as 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.770
 you have a mission when you hand it over to her or 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.509
 if it will give you the reward that is a 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.520
 key that you can use to open 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.810
 these chests the keys are obtained 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.030
 also in the chests along the 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.770
 gesta will simply serve to open 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.870
 these final chests that will give them greater 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.130
 reward and said these people we finished 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.380
 the explanation of the whole deed 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.940
 let's hope it helps you to know where 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.470
 you have the main traps and how 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.960
 avoid them and that you get a big 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.830
 amount of loot and you know how to leave a 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.810
 Comment on what you think 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.130
 subscribe to be aware of more 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.500
 keels that are going up and we 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.280
 we see in the next video a greeting and 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.280
 until next time
