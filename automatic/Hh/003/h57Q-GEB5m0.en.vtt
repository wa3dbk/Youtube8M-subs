00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.720
 ae 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.760
 personal hello I am SerjÃ£o professor 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.650
 campinas student office 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.740
 I would like to talk to you at 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.200
 respect to a process that occurs 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.820
 throughout our digestive system that the 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.820
 process is this 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.699
 we all know that our'm have 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 acid character when in the presence of 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:38.620
 protein and that this hydrochloric acid 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.590
 produced by the stomach itself does not 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.670
 breaking up by digesting him 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.940
 own stomach 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.660
 The mucus produced here is of course 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.460
 protects against hydrochloric acid 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.329
 occurs that when this hydrochloric acid 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.480
 that will be part of ki monn is the 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.449
 food and the hydrochloric acid leaves the 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.039
 stomach goes to the small intestine of the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.410
 palm in the model is due to absorption 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.300
 so the model can not have 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.990
 this protective layer to be able to 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.229
 absorb food as it protects the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.080
 Our order does not have a wall. 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.709
 protect against hydrochloric acid from the 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.550
 stomach 

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:26.670
 in this case between action our pancreas 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.300
 palms the pancreas does not produce the hormone 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.229
 digestive enzymes is also but the bread 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:42.660
 children will do the following when the 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:47.099
 food when the food mo mo 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:50.080
 get out of our stomach pass through 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:54.490
 pyllo and fall into the 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 the wall of the year perceives the presence of 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:07.570
 hydrochloric acid and quickly releases 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:11.350
 called hormone if you believe china 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.460
 what is the function of the secretin hormone in 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.100
 it leaves the wall of the year falls on 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.030
 bloodstream and reaches the PAM 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.250
 crimes 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:30.190
 this way our pancreas releases 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.560
 inside of the in baking soda powder 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.730
 the sodium bicarbonate will have 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.700
 function to neutralize chloridic acid 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.030
 of the stomach performing this reaction 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.650
 the release of salt and a weak acid that 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.320
 the carbonic acid 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:54.459
 this way we will neutralize the hcl 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:58.110
 that way we go to kalisa the 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:02.110
 duodenum for pancreatic enzymes 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.850
 and pancreatic juice can act as 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.880
 efficient way 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.870
 then this is the tip for your study to 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.840
 secreted in the hormone released by b 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.880
 in the presence of hydrochloric acid 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.640
 stimulating will make the pancreas 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.800
 secretary or bicarbonate and 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.570
 bicarbonate neutralizes acid 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.190
 hydrochloric 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.230
 I hope it helped a hope 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.830
 that issue is in front of you 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.830
 good evidence
