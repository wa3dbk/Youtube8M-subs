to tune in from vera bradley in
Priscilla<00:00:09.210> pink<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.410> really<00:00:10.650> like<00:00:10.860> this

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
Priscilla pink and I really like this

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.799 
Priscilla pink and I really like this
particular<00:00:11.700> one<00:00:11.849> because<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.389> flower

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
particular one because of the flower

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.330 
particular one because of the flower
design<00:00:13.139> right<00:00:13.349> here<00:00:13.410> at<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> top<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.160> think

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
design right here at the top I think

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.900 
design right here at the top I think
it's<00:00:14.460> really<00:00:14.610> pretty<00:00:15.170> so<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.680> one<00:00:17.369> side<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
it's really pretty so on one side the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.870 
it's really pretty so on one side the
zipper<00:00:18.480> goes<00:00:18.779> i<00:00:19.260> guess<00:00:19.380> about<00:00:19.740> halfway<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.699> on

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
zipper goes i guess about halfway and on

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.550 
zipper goes i guess about halfway and on
the<00:00:21.000> other<00:00:21.119> side<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.600> goes<00:00:21.720> all<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:21.990> way<00:00:22.289> over

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
the other side it goes all the way over

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.820
