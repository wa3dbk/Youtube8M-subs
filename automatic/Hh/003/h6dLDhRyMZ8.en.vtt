00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.790
 hi this is Fiji doing today 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:11.260
 9 lbz on tank t-55 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.260
 on medium tanks 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.380
 now a bunch of any 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:24.890
 given images and made manure 120 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:29.060
 the main task is to 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.650
 set fire to two enemy vehicles either 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.290
 set fire twice 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.120
 one machine and a secondary task 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.120
 is get to the top 3 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.970
 the funny thing is a double arson 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.460
 performed in just three fights how to take 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.140
 this task 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.149
 double arson tank there are 75 he has there 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.420
 between the corpse there is such a square where 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.850
 you shoot and he practically with 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.250
 one hundred percent probability lights up 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.830
 this is exactly what i did at the base 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.530
 when took diol long because not 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.260
 bother much 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:17.600
 it's worth bothering when you do one 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:22.790
 arson here is how now 75 caught fire and i 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.780
 I realized that you need to do something the second 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.880
 burned in this fight 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.880
 I shoot the lion but he regrets 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:46.100
 although it seemed to shoot back too 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:49.329
 part whether again did not catch fire here 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.329
 traveling very lucky 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.979
 oncoming trampoline went 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:04.159
 highlight just the enemy's raid and and 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:07.750
 managed to shoot a miracle same 2 minutes not 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:12.560
 I ended up already 2 thousand 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:17.239
 to damage to shoot trudge from the two 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:21.190
 for some reason, it would seem to be a high-explosive 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.190
 seems like a very good player 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.459
 but it does such nonsense again 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:34.239
 judging by the sound it was in our gas 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:38.750
 They are trying to take the base luckily for me at 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.410
 the whole trio will not make it out of them 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.360
 704 died and missed 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.780
 after all here is information on age 20 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.890
 quite long but I was afraid to get 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:59.320
 cover 704 therefore shot give is and 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.320
 right up to the end is not in a hurry 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:13.829
 decided to go away from him not to 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:17.700
 tempt fate no longer have to to 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.700
 try to shoot them 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:29.140
 noticed here and 4 on the center again here 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:31.599
 as you can see I rate in the back of 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.879
 Sorry until the projectile flew oh 4 passed 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:38.379
 back I hit 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:40.269
 center tanks that is where in theory u 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:48.370
 it should not be more furtively 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:54.819
 more than 140 in the left part of the front shot 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:58.769
 also tried to set fire like that if 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:02.430
 look at 140 higher rack 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.859
 430 probably also in front when you look 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:11.470
 you can shoot right at india nolda on the left 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:15.299
 and there is a rather high probability 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.299
 what does it cause arson 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:31.190
 here 3 4 the funny thing is that 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.030
 the results of the battle I later saw that 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.190
 hurt by the fourth grandma but 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:48.680
 since this shot was the last one 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:51.470
 did not catch fire here 140 managed to set it on fire 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:57.650
 whereby you see Spock's pit 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:05:01.760
 left front was there data machine 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.480
 very often are selected now open 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.480
 battle results 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.129
 apple's main task 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:18.830

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.639
