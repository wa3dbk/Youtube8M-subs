Tide is a tampon ana pad and I just want

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
to talk about why those aren't

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.330 
to talk about why those aren't
necessarily<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.340> best<00:00:56.550> options<00:00:57.030> so

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
necessarily the best options so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.410 
necessarily the best options so
everybody's<00:00:59.340> doing<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> tampon<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.239> pad

everybody's doing the tampon and pad
thing<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.989> thinking<00:01:01.230> everything<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.680> all

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
thing and thinking everything is all

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.650 
thing and thinking everything is all
good<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> problem<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.449> those

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
good but the problem is that those

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.620 
good but the problem is that those
actually<00:01:04.110> contain<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> lot<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.680> toxins<00:01:05.250> that

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
actually contain a lot of toxins that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.109 
actually contain a lot of toxins that
you're<00:01:06.740> shoving<00:01:07.740> right<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you're shoving right up in there and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.990 
you're shoving right up in there and
your<00:01:09.450> body<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:09.900> absorbing<00:01:10.830> lots<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.790> lots

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
your body is just absorbing lots of lots

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
your body is just absorbing lots of lots
of<00:01:12.180> toxins<00:01:12.659> lots<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.990> bleach<00:01:13.260> something

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
of toxins lots of bleach something

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.219

called<00:01:14.280> dioxin<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.150> things<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:16.080> just

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
called dioxin and things that are just

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.990 
called dioxin and things that are just
definitely<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.860> healthy<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.430> your<00:01:17.520> body<00:01:17.729> so

my personal opinion is that they

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.039 
my personal opinion is that they
contribute<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.460> lot<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> things<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
contribute a lot to the things that

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.830 
contribute a lot to the things that

turn into like a monster and it's like
you<00:01:33.150> know<00:01:33.270> why<00:01:33.479> women<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.200> been<00:01:34.409> doing<00:01:34.740> this

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you know why women have been doing this

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.880 
you know why women have been doing this
and<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.430> been<00:01:35.640> natural<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.450> ever<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.770> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
and it's been natural for ever and it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.249 
and it's been natural for ever and it
has<00:01:38.100> not<00:01:38.280> ever<00:01:38.549> been<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:39.270> big<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.780> thing<00:01:40.020> so

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
has not ever been this big of a thing so

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.319 
has not ever been this big of a thing so
I<00:01:40.439> kind<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.860> feel<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.850> way<00:01:42.030> we've<00:01:42.299> been

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
I kind of feel like the way we've been

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.770 
I kind of feel like the way we've been
handling<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.259> not<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.710> natural<00:01:43.890> so

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
handling it is not so natural so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.090 
handling it is not so natural so
introducing<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.960> alternative<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.710> think

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
introducing the alternative that I think

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.160 
introducing the alternative that I think
every<00:01:47.310> woman<00:01:47.430> should<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.909> about<00:01:49.009> this<00:01:50.009> is

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
every woman should know about this is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.730 
every woman should know about this is
the<00:01:52.170> Daisy<00:01:52.439> Cup<00:01:53.240> I'm<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.329> huge<00:01:54.720> fan<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.259> the

went on a few trips and literally this

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.790 
went on a few trips and literally this
is<00:03:36.000> what<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.270> had<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.480> pathway<00:03:37.020> so<00:03:37.080> it's<00:03:37.470> made<00:03:37.650> out

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
is what I had a pathway so it's made out

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.160 
is what I had a pathway so it's made out
of<00:03:37.830> 100%<00:03:38.580> medical<00:03:39.480> grade<00:03:39.810> silicone<00:03:40.200> and

year<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.800> ten<00:04:02.430> years<00:04:02.820> 70%<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:04.470> Americans<00:04:05.100> women

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
year to ten years 70% of Americans women

are using tampons and pads this results

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.580 
are using tampons and pads this results
in<00:04:08.940> tremendous<00:04:09.270> waste<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:09.930> think<00:04:10.200> about<00:04:10.320> it

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
in tremendous waste so think about it

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.610 
in tremendous waste so think about it
this<00:04:10.860> is<00:04:11.340> kind<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.610> gross<00:04:11.760> but<00:04:12.120> if<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:13.019> took

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
this is kind of gross but if you took

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.539 
this is kind of gross but if you took
out<00:04:13.769> every<00:04:14.360> tampon<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:15.690> pad<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.830> you<00:04:17.280> put<00:04:17.459> it

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
out every tampon and pad and you put it

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.789 
out every tampon and pad and you put it
in<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.700> pile<00:04:17.970> in<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.720> corner<00:04:19.080> of<00:04:19.320> your<00:04:19.590> house

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
in a pile in the corner of your house

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.830 
in a pile in the corner of your house
somewhere<00:04:20.220> since<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.269> beginning<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.690> when

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
somewhere since the beginning of when

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.779 
somewhere since the beginning of when
you<00:04:21.930> started<00:04:22.229> using<00:04:22.350> tampons<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.070> pads<00:04:23.130> it

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
you started using tampons and pads it

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.820 
you started using tampons and pads it
wouldn't<00:04:24.150> seem<00:04:24.300> like<00:04:24.360> much<00:04:24.690> at<00:04:24.870> first<00:04:25.110> but

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
wouldn't seem like much at first but

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.430 
wouldn't seem like much at first but
after<00:04:25.979> several<00:04:26.580> years

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
after several years

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.960 
after several years
that<00:04:27.590> would<00:04:27.860> really<00:04:28.070> start<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.580> accumulate

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
that would really start to accumulate

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.030 
that would really start to accumulate
right<00:04:29.420> and<00:04:29.690> it<00:04:29.960> would<00:04:30.110> really<00:04:30.470> start<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:30.860> take

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
right and it would really start to take

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.390 
right and it would really start to take
up<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.280> lot<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.490> space<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:32.860> so<00:04:33.860> not<00:04:34.250> even

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
up a lot of space and so not even

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.360 
up a lot of space and so not even
including<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.890> biodegradable<00:04:36.890> you<00:04:37.220> know

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
including the the biodegradable you know

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.220 
including the the biodegradable you know
question<00:04:38.210> marks<00:04:38.510> about<00:04:38.660> some<00:04:39.020> of<00:04:39.140> the

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
question marks about some of the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.640 
question marks about some of the
plastics<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:39.920> stuff<00:04:40.130> that<00:04:40.280> they<00:04:40.400> put<00:04:40.430> in

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
plastics and stuff that they put in

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.700 
plastics and stuff that they put in
especially<00:04:42.650> pads<00:04:42.920> but<00:04:43.250> tampon<00:04:43.820> applicators

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
especially pads but tampon applicators

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.830 
especially pads but tampon applicators
just<00:04:45.710> think<00:04:45.920> about<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.430> actual<00:04:46.850> Tampa<00:04:47.330> we

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
just think about the actual Tampa we

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.150 
just think about the actual Tampa we
don't<00:04:48.050> think<00:04:48.170> about<00:04:48.320> that<00:04:48.440> waste<00:04:48.800> a<00:04:48.980> lot

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
don't think about that waste a lot

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.640 
don't think about that waste a lot
because<00:04:49.400> it's<00:04:49.820> out<00:04:50.120> there<00:04:50.660> somewhere<00:04:51.320> some

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
because it's out there somewhere some

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.790 
because it's out there somewhere some
landfill<00:04:52.310> somewhere<00:04:52.640> but<00:04:53.450> we<00:04:54.050> only<00:04:54.320> have<00:04:54.590> one

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
landfill somewhere but we only have one

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.640 
landfill somewhere but we only have one
planet<00:04:54.950> right<00:04:55.880> now<00:04:56.060> that<00:04:56.510> we<00:04:56.630> know<00:04:56.780> of<00:04:56.810> we<00:04:57.470> only

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
planet right now that we know of we only

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.700 
planet right now that we know of we only
have<00:04:57.890> one<00:04:58.040> planet<00:04:58.250> so<00:04:59.380> you<00:05:00.380> might<00:05:00.560> as<00:05:00.650> well

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
have one planet so you might as well

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.730 
have one planet so you might as well
take<00:05:00.980> care<00:05:01.040> of<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:01.490> so<00:05:01.640> if<00:05:01.730> you<00:05:01.880> can<00:05:01.910> have<00:05:02.240> one

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
take care of it so if you can have one

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.530 
take care of it so if you can have one

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
and use it over and over again then

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.090 
and use it over and over again then

you're just saving so much waste and

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.190 
you're just saving so much waste and
that's<00:05:10.880> not<00:05:11.030> even<00:05:11.180> including<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.690> wrappers
