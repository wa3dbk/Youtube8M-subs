 use them in the eyes so you can see 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.080
 you have to have a lot of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.150
 shadows to match 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.440

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.260
 Fridays 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.830
 It is very easy to use products from 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.180
 face in the eye this time I'm going to 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.430
 use a powder to accentuate sun 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.830
 lightly the banana a blush 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.080
 pink mineral to give color to the eyelid 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.000
 mobile and a face illuminator for 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.040
 give the point of light in the area of 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.600
 I'm also going to use this powder 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.339
 these sun powders to give a touch 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.610
 light in the lower area of the 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.610
 tabs 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.060
 all right 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.110
 if you want if you like to do eyeliner 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.189
 but you do not want to have to work it 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.020
 everyday 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.970
 choose a shadow to create an effect 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.080
 of intensity in the external part of 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.080
 upper line of eyelashes 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.770
 my advice is that if you do not have to 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.340
 correct do not apply a base of all 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.170
 the days 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.150
 opt for a cream with color or a baby 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.590
 cream that will tone the tone and 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.260
 The time will hydrate and treat the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.630
 face if you need a little coverage 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.250
 apply a slightly more intense concealer 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.610
 in areas you do not need to correct or 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.610
 to illuminate 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.470
 returns volume and color to the face 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.570
 slightly outlining the outer zone 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.310
 of the face and giving a light touch of a 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.580
 blusher to give that good effect 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.580
 face 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.519
 in my day-to-day makeups, I opted more 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.170
 by a lip tint or a balm 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.879
 with color to give a little 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.230
 hydration and color to my lips a 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.230
 very natural way and that's it 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.400
 Well I hope you liked it as 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.350
 you have seen is very easy and we can 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.020
 alternate the products and use them in 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.700
 different parts of the face very many 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.560
