ideas and I brought it back to my
classroom<00:00:25.689> and<00:00:26.320> I<00:00:26.949> still<00:00:27.550> felt<00:00:27.759> like<00:00:27.880> I<00:00:28.269> could

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
classroom and I still felt like I could

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.609 
classroom and I still felt like I could
grow<00:00:29.140> more<00:00:29.380> and<00:00:30.310> so<00:00:30.910> I<00:00:31.269> wanted<00:00:31.779> to<00:00:31.929> watch<00:00:32.140> other

grow more and so I wanted to watch other

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.770 
grow more and so I wanted to watch other
teachers<00:00:33.130> who<00:00:33.400> are<00:00:33.430> just<00:00:33.700> like<00:00:33.850> him<00:00:34.180> but

almost<00:00:35.140> every<00:00:35.500> day<00:00:35.530> and<00:00:36.039> so<00:00:36.640> I<00:00:36.670> found<00:00:37.090> that<00:00:37.300> a

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329
