as I go so first of all this is not a
normal<00:00:52.050> primer<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.219> has<00:00:53.520> color<00:00:54.090> it's

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989

fades<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.640> like<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.420> blends<00:01:00.719> away<00:01:01.109> mostly<00:01:01.710> but

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
fades out like it blends away mostly but

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.420

little red because i've been rubbing it

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.249 
little red because i've been rubbing it
but<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:07.079> really<00:02:07.350> from<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.459> product

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
but it's not really from the product

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.130 
but it's not really from the product
that's<00:02:11.129> all<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> rubbed<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.840> look<00:02:13.019> a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
that's all of it rubbed and I look a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.360 
that's all of it rubbed and I look a
little<00:02:13.290> red<00:02:13.560> because<00:02:13.860> I've<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.069> been

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
little red because I've just been

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.399 
little red because I've just been
rubbing<00:02:14.730> my<00:02:14.849> face<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:15.329> as<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.629> talk<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.079> see<00:02:16.290> it

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
rubbing my face but as I talk to see it

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.710 
rubbing my face but as I talk to see it
kind<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.739> neutralized<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.489> little<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
kind of neutralized a little but the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.920 
kind of neutralized a little but the
color<00:02:18.989> mostly<00:02:19.650> blends<00:02:20.010> away<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:21.209> because<00:02:21.810> I'm

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
color mostly blends away but because I'm

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.740 
color mostly blends away but because I'm
very<00:02:22.140> fair<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.860> does<00:02:23.159> add<00:02:23.370> kind<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.879> a<00:02:24.030> hint<00:02:24.510> of

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
very fair it does add kind of a hint of

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.619 
very fair it does add kind of a hint of
color<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.799> if<00:02:26.099> you're<00:02:26.280> my<00:02:26.579> skin<00:02:27.000> tone<00:02:27.269> or<00:02:27.569> a

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
color so if you're my skin tone or a

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.420 
color so if you're my skin tone or a
little<00:02:27.900> less<00:02:28.200> than<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.799> will<00:02:29.099> add<00:02:29.400> some

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
little less than this will add some

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.319 
little less than this will add some
color<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.150> use<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.599> will<00:02:30.870> kind<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.739> make<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.940> more

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
color to use it will kind of make a more

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.710 
color to use it will kind of make a more
even<00:02:33.599> canvas<00:02:34.349> but<00:02:35.099> if<00:02:35.250> you're<00:02:35.459> tanner<00:02:35.849> then<00:02:36.450> it

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
even canvas but if you're tanner then it

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.960 
even canvas but if you're tanner then it
probably<00:02:37.049> won't<00:02:37.349> be<00:02:37.409> very<00:02:37.590> noticeable<00:02:38.159> but<00:02:38.730> if

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
probably won't be very noticeable but if

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.780 
probably won't be very noticeable but if
you<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.659> dark<00:02:40.049> skin<00:02:40.349> I'm<00:02:40.859> not<00:02:41.280> sure<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.640> would

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
you have dark skin I'm not sure I would

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.220 
you have dark skin I'm not sure I would
recommend<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.359> because<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.810> doesn't<00:02:43.049> blend

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
recommend this because it doesn't blend

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.890 
recommend this because it doesn't blend
away<00:02:43.409> entirely<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.640> all<00:02:44.760> depend<00:02:45.299> I<00:02:45.510> would<00:02:45.690> try

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
away entirely it all depend I would try

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.770 
away entirely it all depend I would try
and<00:02:45.959> see<00:02:46.319> if<00:02:46.349> a<00:02:46.590> friend<00:02:46.739> has<00:02:47.099> it<00:02:47.370> or<00:02:47.750> buy<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
and see if a friend has it or buy it

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.479 
and see if a friend has it or buy it
from<00:02:49.049> a<00:02:49.109> place<00:02:49.409> that<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.920> know<00:02:50.159> you<00:02:50.220> can

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
from a place that you know you can

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.849 
from a place that you know you can
return<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.060> believe<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.569> CVS<00:02:52.319> even<00:02:52.769> if

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
return it I believe that CVS even if

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.110 
return it I believe that CVS even if
you've<00:02:52.980> tried<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.250> product<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.909> still

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
you've tried a product you can still

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.899 
you've tried a product you can still
return<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.879> would<00:02:56.879> definitely

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
return it so I would definitely

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.000 
return it so I would definitely
recommend<00:02:57.299> trying<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.319> out<00:02:58.409> in<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.650> place<00:02:58.859> where

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
recommend trying it out in a place where

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.160 
recommend trying it out in a place where
it<00:02:59.159> can<00:02:59.220> be<00:02:59.519> returned<00:02:59.849> even<00:03:00.239> if<00:03:00.329> it's<00:03:00.480> used<00:03:00.720> if

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
it can be returned even if it's used if

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.289 
it can be returned even if it's used if
you<00:03:01.349> have<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> darker<00:03:01.980> skin<00:03:02.280> tone<00:03:02.489> because<00:03:02.730> I'm

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
you have a darker skin tone because I'm

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.410 
you have a darker skin tone because I'm
not<00:03:03.780> sure<00:03:04.019> how<00:03:04.200> well<00:03:04.409> it'll<00:03:04.590> blend<00:03:04.859> but<00:03:05.730> ok<00:03:06.359> so

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
not sure how well it'll blend but ok so

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.259 
not sure how well it'll blend but ok so
anyway<00:03:07.079> this<00:03:07.739> smell<00:03:08.159> is<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> little<00:03:08.909> bit<00:03:09.060> off

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
anyway this smell is a little bit off

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.470 
anyway this smell is a little bit off
it's<00:03:09.690> not<00:03:10.079> unbearable<00:03:11.000> though<00:03:12.000> because<00:03:12.209> it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
it's not unbearable though because it

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
it's not unbearable though because it
does<00:03:12.690> go<00:03:13.019> away<00:03:13.139> and<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:14.750> kind<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.840> like<00:03:16.139> that<00:03:16.169> it

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
does go away and I kind of like that it

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.259 
does go away and I kind of like that it
has<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.650> hint<00:03:16.949> of<00:03:17.040> color<00:03:17.310> because<00:03:17.819> if<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.209> don't

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.879 
has a hint of color because if I don't
want<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.690> wear<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> lot<00:03:19.049> of<00:03:19.079> foundation<00:03:19.319> i'll
