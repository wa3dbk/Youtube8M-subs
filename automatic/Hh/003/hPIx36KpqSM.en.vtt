00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.240
 samsung television 40 inch lcd 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.009
 defect we turn off the light 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.869
 here is this beautiful strip of color 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.689
 green he turns red every now and then 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:30.550
 becomes the image below 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:32.970
 on the screen on the panel unfortunately 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.910
 if we look after the frame to be able to 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:40.420
 access the facts before you with your hand 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.970
 alpha on the use 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.730
 unfortunately the problem is really up 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.449
 this fact here if we press on how 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.190
 follow the pavia strip 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:55.359
 so we have to find a system for 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 be able to put pressure on those who like staying at 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:00.780
 has in fact francesco a salerno 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.350
 we are trying to take some 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.300
 material what we are 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.369
 film that adapts to high alarm 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.750
 temperature or then disappeared forever 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:19.599
 what I ask of you is enough for you 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.220
 touch monuments and hopefully good as 

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:24.490
 as we see in the strip unfortunately then 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.009
 became from the panel made it under 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.789
 at least in this case we have been 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:34.149
 lucky at least i hope otherwise i am 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.099
 dots that we have content 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.989
 discovered why it was taken from 

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:40.539
 just because we are doing 

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:43.030
 pressure if you fold inward 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.739
 but a fact about himself therefore the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.250
 strip yes water common good not me 

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:46.569
 trust 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.259
 the same they put us something 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:53.410
 profession above ie well goodnight 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.000
 tv output is fine then let's see 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:00.009
 we are already this enough in a below e 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.879
 disappears let's leave it so height ok her 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.179
 to know it so thickness we lower the 

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:06.179
 frame 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:17.480
 f we proceed to the reassembly of the 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:24.040
 television breakers slowly attention 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.040
 to the panel two faces 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.240
 then we are almost finished editing 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.960
 of the TV then soon we see 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.700
 the situation that looks at what it is 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.330
 should say gherardo a few months not 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.370
