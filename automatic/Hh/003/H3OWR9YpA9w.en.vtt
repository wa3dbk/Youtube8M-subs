got and then the last thing that's new

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.330 
got and then the last thing that's new
for<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.760> name<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.560> digital<00:03:01.560> delay<00:03:02.099> and

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
for this name is a digital delay and

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.610 
for this name is a digital delay and
reverb<00:03:02.780> it's<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.900> seventeen<00:03:04.379> hundred

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
reverb it's a seventeen hundred

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.470 
reverb it's a seventeen hundred
milliseconds<00:03:05.159> it's<00:03:05.280> got<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.430> really<00:03:05.819> thick

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
milliseconds it's got a really thick

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.860 
milliseconds it's got a really thick
reverb<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.439> works<00:03:07.680> as<00:03:07.980> either<00:03:08.579> on<00:03:09.120> its<00:03:09.180> own<00:03:09.599> or

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
reverb it works as either on its own or

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.339 
reverb it works as either on its own or
both<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.739> parallel<00:03:11.689> just<00:03:12.689> with<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.959> turning

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
both in parallel just with the turning

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.599 
both in parallel just with the turning
the<00:03:13.470> knobs<00:03:13.650> if<00:03:13.859> you<00:03:13.920> turn<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.159> delay<00:03:14.370> time

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
the knobs if you turn the delay time

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.880 
the knobs if you turn the delay time
down<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.970> reverb<00:03:15.329> works<00:03:15.989> on<00:03:16.200> its<00:03:16.349> own<00:03:16.500> and

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
down the reverb works on its own and

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.289 
down the reverb works on its own and
then<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.129> repeats<00:03:17.549> act<00:03:17.939> as<00:03:18.120> like<00:03:18.269> a

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
then the repeats act as like a

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.140 
then the repeats act as like a
thickening<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.170> sort<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.680> decay<00:03:20.069> control<00:03:20.609> and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
thickening and sort of decay control and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.809 
thickening and sort of decay control and
an<00:03:21.239> overall<00:03:21.480> toe<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:22.319> nature<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.489> reverb

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
an overall toe like nature of the reverb

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.729 
an overall toe like nature of the reverb
effect<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.840> mix<00:03:24.989> as<00:03:25.170> much<00:03:25.349> or<00:03:25.709> as

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
effect and you can mix as much or as

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.710 
effect and you can mix as much or as
little<00:03:25.859> as<00:03:26.099> you<00:03:26.190> want<00:03:26.280> with<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.150> mix<00:03:27.329> control

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
little as you want with the mix control

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.860 
little as you want with the mix control
in<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.379> delay<00:03:28.879> say<00:03:29.879> seventeen<00:03:30.629> hundred

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
in the delay say seventeen hundred

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.259 
in the delay say seventeen hundred
milliseconds<00:03:31.409> and<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:32.190> does<00:03:32.370> pretty<00:03:33.120> much

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
milliseconds and it does pretty much

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.899 
milliseconds and it does pretty much
infinite<00:03:33.780> repeats<00:03:34.109> it<00:03:34.859> gradually<00:03:35.310> decays<00:03:35.639> and

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
infinite repeats it gradually decays and

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.399 
infinite repeats it gradually decays and
like<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> warm<00:03:37.040> wash<00:03:38.040> basically<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.230> retail<00:03:40.230> on

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
like a warm wash basically and retail on

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.860 
like a warm wash basically and retail on
that<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:41.010> one<00:03:41.159> will<00:03:41.280> retail<00:03:41.609> for<00:03:41.639> 185<00:03:42.299> why

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
that that one will retail for 185 why

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.449 
that that one will retail for 185 why
don't<00:03:42.989> we<00:03:43.049> get<00:03:43.170> austin<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.799> play<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:44.129> little<00:03:44.280> bit
