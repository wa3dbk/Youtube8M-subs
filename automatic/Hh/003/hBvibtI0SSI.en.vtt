00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
involving condensation on the windows

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.570 
involving condensation on the windows
something<00:00:26.300> I<00:00:26.390> noticed<00:00:26.900> is<00:00:27.770> that<00:00:27.860> you<00:00:28.460> know

when you spend some time and van of
course<00:00:30.950> you<00:00:31.100> can<00:00:31.220> get<00:00:31.370> condensation<00:00:31.810> buildup

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
course you can get condensation buildup

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.510 
course you can get condensation buildup
on<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:32.990> windows<00:00:33.230> especially<00:00:33.380> when<00:00:34.160> it's<00:00:34.370> kind

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
on the windows especially when it's kind

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.790 
on the windows especially when it's kind
of<00:00:34.550> colder<00:00:34.880> weather<00:00:34.910> outside<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:36.560> try<00:00:36.740> to

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
of colder weather outside you try to

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.400 
of colder weather outside you try to
warm<00:00:37.100> up<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.280> band<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:37.730> today<00:00:38.200> kind<00:00:39.200> of<00:00:39.260> got

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.850 
warm up the band so today kind of got
some<00:00:39.950> water<00:00:40.190> boiled<00:00:40.880> off<00:00:41.030> here<00:00:41.650> put<00:00:42.650> some

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
some water boiled off here put some

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.319 
some water boiled off here put some
vapor<00:00:43.550> into<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.030> air<00:00:44.180> kind<00:00:44.630> of<00:00:44.660> expedia<00:00:45.260> the

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
vapor into the air kind of expedia the

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.990 
vapor into the air kind of expedia the
conversation<00:00:47.329> process<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.140> if<00:00:48.290> you<00:00:48.410> tell

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
kind of hard with the camera here so

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.729 
kind of hard with the camera here so
these<00:00:53.480> windows<00:00:53.870> are<00:00:53.899> pretty<00:00:54.290> damn<00:00:54.410> foggy

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
these windows are pretty damn foggy

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.510 
these windows are pretty damn foggy
right<00:00:55.600> you<00:00:56.600> know<00:00:56.750> obvious<00:00:57.410> that<00:00:57.950> somebody<00:00:58.370> is

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
done nothing to these front windows but

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.590 
done nothing to these front windows but
what<00:01:05.990> I<00:01:06.020> have<00:01:06.170> done<00:01:06.670> something<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:07.850> these<00:01:08.030> side

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
what I have done something to these side

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.770 
what I have done something to these side
windows<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.259> the<00:01:09.920> back<00:01:10.100> windows<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:11.420> can<00:01:11.479> see

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
windows and the back windows you can see

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.260 
windows and the back windows you can see
crystal<00:01:12.590> clear<00:01:13.389> no<00:01:14.389> condensation<00:01:16.030> nice<00:01:17.030> and

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
crystal clear no condensation nice and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:25.929 
crystal clear no condensation nice and
clear<00:01:20.409> so<00:01:21.409> what<00:01:22.130> I've<00:01:22.280> done<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.549> put<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:24.939> like

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
clear so what I've done is put that like

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.620 
clear so what I've done is put that like
the<00:01:26.240> what<00:01:27.109> do<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.200> call<00:01:27.289> it<00:01:27.469> it's<00:01:27.859> like<00:01:28.630> winter

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
the what do you call it it's like winter

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.580 
the what do you call it it's like winter
I<00:01:29.990> guess<00:01:30.380> it's<00:01:30.619> just<00:01:30.679> kind<00:01:30.979> of<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.100> winter

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
I guess it's just kind of a winter

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.910 
I guess it's just kind of a winter
insulation<00:01:33.590> product<00:01:34.069> you<00:01:34.340> can<00:01:34.490> buy<00:01:34.670> at<00:01:34.999> any

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
insulation product you can buy at any

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.830 
insulation product you can buy at any
department<00:01:36.920> store<00:01:37.149> it's<00:01:38.149> a<00:01:38.240> real<00:01:38.450> thin

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
department store it's a real thin

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.249 
department store it's a real thin
plastic<00:01:39.499> with<00:01:40.310> double-sided<00:01:40.759> tape<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:42.020> see<00:01:42.229> I

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
plastic with double-sided tape you see I

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.599 
plastic with double-sided tape you see I
can't<00:01:42.560> even<00:01:42.619> get<00:01:42.859> to<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:42.979> window<00:01:43.310> here<00:01:45.609> yeah

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
can't even get to the window here yeah

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.160 
can't even get to the window here yeah
so<00:01:46.819> you<00:01:46.909> just<00:01:46.939> put<00:01:47.090> double-sided<00:01:47.479> tape<00:01:47.869> and

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
so you just put double-sided tape and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.339 
so you just put double-sided tape and
then<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.380> throw<00:01:48.770> up<00:01:48.799> this<00:01:49.039> plastic<00:01:49.639> and<00:01:50.349> throw

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
then you throw up this plastic and throw

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.739 
then you throw up this plastic and throw
a<00:01:51.439> blow<00:01:52.069> dryer<00:01:52.369> on<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:52.729> or<00:01:52.819> whatever<00:01:53.029> and<00:01:53.359> it

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
a blow dryer on it or whatever and it

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.819 
a blow dryer on it or whatever and it
tightens<00:01:54.289> up<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.630> creates<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.689> seal<00:01:56.929> so<00:01:57.679> it

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
tightens up and creates a seal so it

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.249 
tightens up and creates a seal so it
kind<00:01:58.069> of<00:01:58.189> acts<00:01:58.490> as<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.909> single<00:01:59.389> or<00:01:59.599> as<00:01:59.719> a<00:01:59.749> double

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
kind of acts as a single or as a double

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.050 
kind of acts as a single or as a double
pane<00:02:00.469> the<00:02:00.709> second<00:02:01.069> pain<00:02:01.249> to<00:02:01.459> your<00:02:01.490> single<00:02:01.880> pane

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
pane the second pain to your single pane

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.899 
pane the second pain to your single pane
windows<00:02:02.959> so<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.069> kinda<00:02:04.249> it's<00:02:04.369> a<00:02:04.429> two-fold

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
windows so it kinda it's a two-fold

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.470 
windows so it kinda it's a two-fold
benefit<00:02:05.899> one<00:02:07.179> it<00:02:08.709> eliminates<00:02:10.480> condensation

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
benefit one it eliminates condensation

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.180 
benefit one it eliminates condensation
on<00:02:11.599> these<00:02:11.930> windows

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
on these windows

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.140 
on these windows
and<00:02:13.280> two<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:14.330> adds<00:02:14.930> some<00:02:15.380> insulation<00:02:16.070> value<00:02:16.220> so

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
and two it adds some insulation value so

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.510 
and two it adds some insulation value so
that's<00:02:17.300> pretty<00:02:17.480> rad<00:02:17.660> because<00:02:18.160> windows<00:02:19.160> a

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
that's pretty rad because windows a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.040 
that's pretty rad because windows a
little<00:02:20.450> lot<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.750> cold<00:02:20.990> air<00:02:21.380> come<00:02:21.770> in<00:02:22.810> yeah<00:02:23.810> so

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
little lot of cold air come in yeah so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.030 
little lot of cold air come in yeah so
that's<00:02:24.230> where<00:02:24.350> your<00:02:24.440> ad<00:02:24.530> works<00:02:24.740> really<00:02:24.950> well

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
that's where your ad works really well
