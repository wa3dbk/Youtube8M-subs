00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.029
 first we make sure we don't 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.130
 have traces of nail polish on or nails 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.700
 remove the present one with a lever 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.700
 nail varnish 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.970
 now with a lime we shape the nails 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.970
 so that they are squared 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.079
 but always rounding the sides 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.979
 we raise the accesses with the most part 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.979
 smooth of the file 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.800
 we can give the base 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.200
 this will be a flesh-colored enamel that 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.810
 serves to uniform the color and 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.229
 eventually eliminate the yellow of the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.229
 nails 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.299
 and let it dry we use one now 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.489
 white enamel 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:49.910
 this is a fine brush is suitable 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:52.280
 in french what we have to do is 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.530
 simply hold the brush in place 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.530
 on the nail and rotate the finger 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.340
 in this way we will get a line 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.340
 definite and straight 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:15.069
 as a last touch we apply a top 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:18.540
 transparent that will make the nails 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.540
 bright and resistant 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.900
 and here is the result
