00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
at least from me of course this is all

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.439 
at least from me of course this is all
personal<00:00:59.550> preference<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.270> free

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
personal preference it's a free

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.029 
personal preference it's a free
attachment<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.289> want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> throw<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.920> on

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
attachment so if you want to throw it on

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.880 
attachment so if you want to throw it on
you<00:01:02.280> know<00:01:02.430> that's<00:01:03.059> your<00:01:03.270> choice<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.739> gives

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you know that's your choice but it gives

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.460 
you know that's your choice but it gives
a<00:01:05.010> sniper<00:01:05.280> kick<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.880> i<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.960> little

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
a sniper kick and i think the little

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.440 
a sniper kick and i think the little
increase<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.189> damage<00:01:08.369> isn't<00:01:08.729> worth<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.360> my

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
increase in damage isn't worth it in my

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.469 
increase in damage isn't worth it in my
opinion<00:01:09.869> let's<00:01:10.799> move<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.729> secondary<00:01:12.180> i

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
opinion let's move on to the secondary i

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.850 
opinion let's move on to the secondary i
think<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.799> US<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.909> only<00:01:15.540> sniper<00:01:16.470> rifle<00:01:16.799> i

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
think the US are is only sniper rifle i

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.609 
think the US are is only sniper rifle i
have<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> second<00:01:17.369> around<00:01:17.640> i<00:01:17.850> think<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.200> in

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
have a second around i think so but in

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
have a second around i think so but in
my<00:01:19.860> opinion<00:01:19.950> if<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:21.330> want<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.570> use<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
my opinion if you do want to use a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.450 
my opinion if you do want to use a
secondary<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.439> all<00:01:22.590> your<00:01:22.740> snipers<00:01:23.189> it's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
secondary on all your snipers it's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.469 
secondary on all your snipers it's
definitely<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> p226<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.439> has<00:01:26.130> 11<00:01:27.060> bullets<00:01:27.360> by

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
definitely the p226 it has 11 bullets by

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.539 
definitely the p226 it has 11 bullets by
default<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.140> its<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.159> strong<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
default and its really really strong so

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.399 
default and its really really strong so
i<00:01:29.790> definitely<00:01:30.060> think<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> best

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
i definitely think this is the best

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.590 
i definitely think this is the best
secondary<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.189> use<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.880> sniper<00:01:33.150> rifle

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
secondary to use with your sniper rifle

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.539 
secondary to use with your sniper rifle
and<00:01:33.960> now<00:01:34.079> let's<00:01:34.320> move<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.829> lethal<00:01:35.280> i<00:01:35.369> have

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
and now let's move on to lethal i have

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.940 
and now let's move on to lethal i have
none<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.869> don't<00:01:37.079> find<00:01:37.409> myself<00:01:37.619> wanting

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
none I really don't find myself wanting

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.450 
none I really don't find myself wanting
to<00:01:38.220> throw<00:01:38.460> any<00:01:38.939> c4<00:01:39.360> sore<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.770> don't<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.369> if

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
they're called sent texts because I

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.960 
liked being resistant to concussion
flashes<00:03:36.019> all<00:03:36.290> that<00:03:36.889> good<00:03:37.099> stuff<00:03:37.129> because<00:03:37.819> it

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
flashes all that good stuff because it

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.330 
flashes all that good stuff because it
just<00:03:38.120> makes<00:03:38.419> the<00:03:38.900> game<00:03:39.259> a<00:03:39.319> lot<00:03:39.530> more<00:03:39.739> fun<00:03:40.009> more

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
just makes the game a lot more fun more

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.830 
just makes the game a lot more fun more
fast-paced<00:03:40.729> because<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.299> don't<00:03:41.479> get<00:03:41.599> slowed

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
fast-paced because you don't get slowed

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.640 
fast-paced because you don't get slowed
down<00:03:42.019> by<00:03:42.229> concussions<00:03:42.889> or<00:03:43.040> flashes<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:44.650> those

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
down by concussions or flashes so those

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.439 
down by concussions or flashes so those
are<00:03:45.949> the<00:03:46.009> perks<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.519> I<00:03:46.579> recommend<00:03:46.879> for<00:03:47.299> the

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
are the perks that I recommend for the

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.860 
are the perks that I recommend for the
USR<00:03:48.489> killstreaks<00:03:49.489> I<00:03:49.759> mean<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.180> could<00:03:50.329> this

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
USR killstreaks I mean you could this

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.149

really don't find myself trying to get

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.149 
really don't find myself trying to get
any<00:03:55.489> lethal<00:03:55.909> or<00:03:56.299> assault<00:03:56.959> killstreaks<00:03:57.859> so<00:03:58.129> i

unlocked<00:04:04.759> most<00:04:05.120> of<00:04:05.269> these<00:04:05.389> but<00:04:05.780> I<00:04:06.530> do<00:04:06.919> like<00:04:07.370> the

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
unlocked most of these but I do like the

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.059 
unlocked most of these but I do like the
Oracle<00:04:08.359> it<00:04:08.629> gives<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:08.959> like<00:04:09.139> wall<00:04:09.409> hacks<00:04:09.680> for

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.300 
Oracle it gives you like wall hacks for
a<00:04:10.129> little<00:04:10.789> bit<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.209> think<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:12.019> gives<00:04:12.829> you<00:04:13.039> a<00:04:13.069> read

a little bit I think it gives you a read
every<00:04:13.609> 15<00:04:14.120> or<00:04:14.150> 20<00:04:14.689> seconds<00:04:15.459> but<00:04:16.459> whenever<00:04:16.639> it

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
every 15 or 20 seconds but whenever it

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.270 
every 15 or 20 seconds but whenever it
does<00:04:17.030> it's<00:04:17.239> really<00:04:17.599> really<00:04:17.840> helpful<00:04:18.109> so<00:04:18.799> there
