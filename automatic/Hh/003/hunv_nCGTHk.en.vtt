00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
but a long time ago the first product of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.010 
but a long time ago the first product of
this<00:01:07.500> type<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:08.850> advantage<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:09.810> did

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
this type was advantage and they did

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.750 
this type was advantage and they did
some<00:01:10.200> studies<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.890> found<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.460> worked

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
some studies and found that it worked

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.510 
some studies and found that it worked
better<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.360> cats<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.470> put<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
better in cats if you put it up here and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.730 
better in cats if you put it up here and
they<00:01:15.000> determined<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.630> cats<00:01:16.020> probably<00:01:16.530> get

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
they determined that cats probably get

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.800 
they determined that cats probably get
to<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.100> down<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:17.820> more<00:01:17.970> easily<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.509> lick<00:01:18.780> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
to it down here more easily and lick it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.260 
to it down here more easily and lick it
off<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.890> I've<00:01:20.220> always<00:01:20.430> sort<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.850> held<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
off and so I've always sort of held to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.850 
off and so I've always sort of held to
the<00:01:21.390> belief<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.990> should<00:01:22.200> put<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> closer

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the belief that we should put it closer

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.020 
the belief that we should put it closer
to<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> skull<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.909> that's<00:01:24.090> what<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:26.030> you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
