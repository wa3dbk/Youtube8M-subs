00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
just take a section where I'm putting

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.370 
just take a section where I'm putting
the<00:00:19.109> extensions<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.800> braid<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.060> said

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
once you get to the bottom you'll just

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.100 
once you get to the bottom you'll just
tie<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.040> off<00:02:29.160> with<00:02:29.190> an<00:02:29.520> elastic<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.270> start<00:02:30.960> on

the other side so take about a one-inch
section<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.230> split<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.160> in<00:02:35.280> three<00:02:35.310> I'll<00:02:36.300> take

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
section and split it in three I'll take

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.710 
section and split it in three I'll take
the<00:02:36.660> outside<00:02:36.690> piece<00:02:38.150> put<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.180> under<00:02:39.540> the

and<00:03:25.940> do<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.480> same<00:03:26.690> thing<00:03:27.020> tie<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.440> off<00:03:27.590> with<00:03:27.620> an

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
and do the same thing tie it off with an

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.300 
and do the same thing tie it off with an
elastic<00:03:29.300> band<00:03:29.650> now<00:03:30.650> I'm<00:03:30.770> going<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:30.980> go<00:03:31.070> through

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
elastic band now I'm going to go through

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.490 
elastic band now I'm going to go through
and<00:03:31.520> pancake<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.180> braid<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:32.570> you'll<00:03:33.290> just

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
and pancake the braid so you'll just

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.890 
and pancake the braid so you'll just
pull<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:33.980> braid<00:03:34.160> apart<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:35.180> this<00:03:35.570> is<00:03:35.750> where

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
pull the braid apart and this is where

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.270 
pull the braid apart and this is where
you're<00:03:36.020> going<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.170> want<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.440> make<00:03:37.010> sure<00:03:37.070> you

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
you're going to want to make sure you

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.580 
you're going to want to make sure you
see<00:03:37.520> your<00:03:37.550> fishtail<00:03:38.060> braid<00:03:38.240> in<00:03:38.390> there<00:03:38.540> so<00:03:39.320> I'm

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
see your fishtail braid in there so I'm

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.920 
see your fishtail braid in there so I'm
really<00:03:39.740> focusing<00:03:40.250> on<00:03:40.430> pulling<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:41.450> fishtail

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
really focusing on pulling the fishtail

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.200 
really focusing on pulling the fishtail
braid<00:03:42.320> out<00:03:42.470> behind<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.640> hair<00:03:43.850> in<00:03:44.060> between

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
braid out behind the hair in between

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.750 
braid out behind the hair in between
that<00:03:44.600> braid<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:45.440> you'll<00:03:45.980> just<00:03:46.190> kind<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.430> pull

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
that braid so you'll just kind of pull

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.550 
that braid so you'll just kind of pull
and<00:03:46.970> tug<00:03:47.090> on<00:03:47.210> it<00:03:47.270> make<00:03:47.630> sure<00:03:47.660> that<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.170> braid

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
and tug on it make sure that that braid

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.760 
and tug on it make sure that that braid
showing<00:03:48.890> really<00:03:49.130> well<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:51.350> can<00:03:51.500> see<00:03:51.620> my

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
showing really well and you can see my

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.500 
showing really well and you can see my
extension<00:03:52.160> there<00:03:52.310> but<00:03:52.550> at<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:53.030> end<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.300> can't

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
extension there but at the end you can't

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.280 
extension there but at the end you can't
see<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.780> it's<00:03:53.990> hidden<00:03:55.930> so<00:03:56.930> you'll<00:03:57.110> just

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
see it it's hidden so you'll just

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.140 
see it it's hidden so you'll just
continue<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.920> do<00:03:58.010> that<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.310> other<00:03:58.520> side

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
continue and do that to the other side

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.910 
continue and do that to the other side
just<00:03:59.420> pull<00:03:59.690> that<00:03:59.720> braid<00:04:00.050> apart<00:04:00.410> go<00:04:00.620> all<00:04:00.800> the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
way down and just pull all those edges

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.840

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
out now I'm going to add some bobby pins

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.670 
out now I'm going to add some bobby pins
just<00:04:08.300> to<00:04:08.420> kind<00:04:08.600> of<00:04:08.660> secure<00:04:09.020> it<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.170> my<00:04:09.290> head<00:04:09.470> you

just to kind of secure it to my head you

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.500 
just to kind of secure it to my head you
don't<00:04:10.130> have<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.310> do<00:04:10.430> this<00:04:10.550> part<00:04:10.790> if<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.120> don't

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
don't have to do this part if you don't

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.870 
don't have to do this part if you don't
want<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:12.080> I<00:04:12.290> just<00:04:12.430> felt<00:04:13.430> like<00:04:13.489> it<00:04:13.610> was<00:04:13.700> sticking

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880

want to I just felt like it was sticking
up<00:04:14.090> too<00:04:14.270> much<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:15.140> I'm<00:04:15.530> just<00:04:15.709> Bobby<00:04:15.920> pinning<00:04:16.220> it

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
up too much so I'm just Bobby pinning it

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.550 
up too much so I'm just Bobby pinning it
in<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:16.790> any<00:04:16.940> weird<00:04:17.239> random<00:04:17.510> pieces<00:04:17.840> bobby<00:04:18.320> pin

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
in and any weird random pieces bobby pin

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.230 
in and any weird random pieces bobby pin
those<00:04:18.739> in<00:04:18.890> too<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:21.490> right<00:04:22.490> here<00:04:22.790> I'm<00:04:22.970> just

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240

Bobby<00:04:23.750> pinning<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.230> fishtail<00:04:24.830> itself<00:04:25.790> it

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
Bobby pinning the fishtail itself it

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.900 
Bobby pinning the fishtail itself it
just<00:04:26.060> helps<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.600> stick<00:04:26.810> out<00:04:26.990> more<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:28.550> people

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
just helps it stick out more so people

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.510 
just helps it stick out more so people
can<00:04:29.030> see<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:30.290> part<00:04:30.530> of<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.770> braid<00:04:30.979> that's

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
can see that part of the braid that's

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.080 
can see that part of the braid that's
different<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:33.460> I'm<00:04:34.460> just<00:04:34.640> going<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.910> take
