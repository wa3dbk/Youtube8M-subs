00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.560
 good friends today I come with a review to 2 2 for 1 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.990
 and yes I know I was supposed to have posted the video say buy 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.629
 hoeness the interpreter tom clancy but few rumors a fuckin game so 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:37.330
 I thought 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.250
 it matters a shit the other games the two monks the host and good 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.300
 these games which means that it leads to criticism 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.240
 I would like to tell you about the movie that I saw last Sunday which is angels 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.880
 and demons based on 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.460
 who also wrote the code da vinci 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.020
 the truth is that the movie seemed like shit to me and it's that the story 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.900
 it does not make any sense 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.400
 I have not read the book but it still seemed like rubbish to me 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.060
 watching the movie for those who have read the book 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.470
 the only thing I can rescue from the movie 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.480
 the goal is the soundtrack composed of stands 1st who do not 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.850
 disappoints when making ambient music that is in accordance with the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.110
 movie persecutions 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.920
 he also cited 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.200
 tell them the life of the duckling that finally annoyed me and killed him haha ​​xd 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.840
 but well that's not important let's go to the criticism of the games 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.910
 in the first vote because then the servant of airs the god of war 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.220
 but after murdering his wife and daughter by orders of airs this one decides 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.930
 rebel against him and begins his journey to free the Pandora's box 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.680
 and kill the god of war 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.150
 the gameplay as soon as the combat is quite repetitive but the game is so 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.010
 Well, that's going to matter a fucking fuck 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.320
 you know 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.229
 well at first our attacks are a bit rough but once you have me 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.490
 caught the trick you'll get used to it in addition to the game when 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.589
 appear 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.639
 once the cowboys appear 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.639
 it's not that it will allow us to buy improvements for our 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:20.049
 to say of swords since they are chains and will stop being coarse once 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.359
 that we buy those improvements 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.660
 at the beginning the game is easy 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.989
 but sooner or later 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.769
 in any case sooner than later xd will appear hard enemies to kill 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.769
 and it is when we will learn the successes as 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:39.619
 in the course of the game the gods of Olympus who will grant their powers 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.619
 divine to continue his way and kill Arabs 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:44.240
 will help in the game 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.099
 although we are moving forward we will use those 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.099
 is to eliminate them from the fa 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.059
 the classic 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.059
 which are the wrath of the possessed 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.129
 in stone to his enemies 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.260
 before a time limit the sick ray that give us 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:15.979
 after the others in the i 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.979
 being perhaps equally lethal is that you 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.729
 for two hours in a row 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:46.409
 - ancasti coec isabel will make us faster stronger 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.009
 but challenging 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.199
 which makes the game 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.199
 effective and it will not be me 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.129
 aggrieved and difficult 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.009
 since at the beginning 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.499
 before insignificant 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:09.439
 archers minotaurs cyclops three-headed lions 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.279
 the polls 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:14.639
 ana kim this information abruptly and old commander existing assets 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:20.099
 makes the ftf terán the setting of all scenarios are excellent 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.319
 although detailed and lovely to look at 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.210
 The design of the characters is very detailed, which is very important 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.189
 impressive because they seem real to look at iter flying data clarified 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:36.479
 the music is excellent and goes according to the action game but adventure or what 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.520
 whatever they wanted to do from a 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.680
 it's a title that I do not regret having bought it because 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.030
 has everything a game to stop it good graphics good control good 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.349
 music and so on is that I really enjoyed playing or not so I 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.080
 I put 9 points 5 out of 10 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.030
 now we spend something two bordos retribution dividend but that title 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.949
 it's pathetic and nobody pays attention to it, so we'll simply call it Goths 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.219
 dead I'm worth mothers 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.589
 kratos after beating ares the god of war 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:12.619
 he takes his place and he will always go to all the battles of the Spartans 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.899
 but in his attempt to help kratos he creates a lot of destruction in the Olympus and ugly 

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:22.130
 decides to trick him into using the sword of Olympus where he will deposit all his 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.319
 power like god and make the sword more powerful 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.919
 Kratos is killed and sent to the underworld then it appears that he would 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.639
 mother nature the goddess of the earth or do not know what blowjobs so 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.429
 prevents talk about the sisters of fate by telling him that if he goes to her 

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:38.999
 you could go back 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:40.759
 time and win about 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.080
 so from there to heal wounds decree if it comes out of the underworld 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.379
 to start your journey to kill accents 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:51.889
 and as we suppose we control 14 new spaces we will do a control that 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.999
 we have already seen in god of war 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:58.379
 we use chains once again imaz we will make every son of a bitch appear 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.419
 and we will absorb their red orbits to buy improvements 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.899
 a new implementation are the new powers that will be granted to us 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:07.569
 game travel 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:11.470
 in the past game the powers of kratos were granted by the gods 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.430
 this time the powers were granted by the titans as well as 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.839
 the wrath of the titans 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:22.310
 besides using the chains in some places of the game 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.479
 we are granted 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.589
 all kinds of weapons such as the hammer 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:30.699
 this increase is quite innovative but unfortunately the weapons are 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.139
 very slow and before you are your first goal 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.139
 You will have already gotten millions of expats in your ass 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.910
 There are millions of enemies varied and of all kinds 1 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.250
 you never know what kind of enemies will appear but I think they are more 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.550
 easy to eliminate that in the previous game in the game we were 

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:49.949
 and reiterated 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.249
 little bit deeper than the previous game 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:56.679
 once again the graphics surprise us by giving us an excellent 

00:06:56.679 --> 00:07:00.779
 design of very well-cared and well-done scenarios as well as 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:03.869
 characters that are well designed though 

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:08.379
 2 although the graphics are very similar to the previous game is superior 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:09.550
 its polished 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.770
 the music continues to surprise us 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.639
 creating a very emotive atmosphere 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:15.759
 really that 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:19.319
 excellent game so I gave him 9 points 5 out of 10 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.389
 there will also be a god of war 3 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:27.069
 but unfortunately it will not reach our consoles ps2 xinhua its successor 

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:30.719
 last generation and exclusively for her the ps3 

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:35.709
 my conclusion is that they are excellent games and very varied in their style 

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:40.389
 although it becomes a bit repetitive because of the scarcity of numbers but that is compensated 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:43.849
 with the divine powers that will be granted to us in the game 

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:46.719
 I really recommend it a lot 

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:50.849
 good until here comes the review I hope you liked this video 

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:53.849
 so he said goodbye by saying goodbye until next time 

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:57.419

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.630
