yeah that that's quick but I think it

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.820 
yeah that that's quick but I think it
would<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.530> all<00:00:25.680> right

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.160 

wha<00:00:28.930> well<00:00:29.930> that's<00:00:30.110> awfully<00:00:30.350> cook<00:00:30.980> for<00:00:31.130> that

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
wha well that's awfully cook for that

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:48.740 
wha well that's awfully cook for that
it<00:00:33.260> depends<00:00:33.649> on<00:00:33.739> which<00:00:33.949> the<00:00:34.160> waves<00:00:34.370> for<00:00:34.730> me

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:58.580 

that's<00:00:49.080> an<00:00:49.260> overhang<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:56.989> we've<00:00:57.989> decided<00:00:58.350> on

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
that's an overhang but we've decided on

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:10.100 
that's an overhang but we've decided on
a<00:01:01.430> relatively<00:01:02.430> safe<00:01:03.440> ingress<00:01:04.440> point<00:01:09.110> yeah

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
a relatively safe ingress point yeah

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.400 
a relatively safe ingress point yeah
underneath<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.860> barbed<00:01:11.070> wire<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.229> shall

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
underneath the barbed wire so we shall

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.359 
underneath the barbed wire so we shall
see<00:01:20.060> we're<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.680> we<00:01:22.680> don't<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
see we're on we don't really have to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:33.120 
see we're on we don't really have to
paddle<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.270> quite<00:01:24.450> fast

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.600 

it's<00:01:33.670> not<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.850> nice<00:01:34.060> color<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.340> I<00:01:36.430> keep

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
it's not a nice color and I keep

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.330 
it's not a nice color and I keep
spinning<00:01:37.000> around<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:40.590> river<00:01:41.590> level<00:01:41.950> which<00:01:42.070> is

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
spinning around the river level which is

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.499 
spinning around the river level which is
very<00:01:42.789> high<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:45.399> both<00:01:45.640> agreed<00:01:45.970> it's<00:01:46.149> probably

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
very high we both agreed it's probably

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.899 
very high we both agreed it's probably
not<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.750> most<00:01:47.710> sensible<00:01:48.219> decision<00:01:48.759> we've

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
not the most sensible decision we've

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:58.999 
not the most sensible decision we've
made<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.450> can't<00:01:52.689> always<00:01:52.840> be<00:01:53.049> sensible

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.510
