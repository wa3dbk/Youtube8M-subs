00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.470 
so now I'm moving on to the second raid
although<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.490> only<00:01:38.610> worth<00:01:38.880> eight<00:01:39.150> trophies

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
although it's only worth eight trophies

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.510 
although it's only worth eight trophies
this<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.680> easy<00:01:40.710> base<00:01:41.190> especially

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
this is a really easy base especially

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
this is a really easy base especially
against<00:01:42.210> go<00:01:42.480> wee-wee<00:01:42.870> because<00:01:43.380> all<00:01:43.530> i<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
against go wee-wee because all i have to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.500 
against go wee-wee because all i have to
do<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:43.950> break<00:01:44.280> through<00:01:44.550> two<00:01:44.850> layers<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.150> walls

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
do is break through two layers of walls

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.120 
do is break through two layers of walls
and<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:45.870> my<00:01:45.960> arch<00:01:46.170> cream<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.620> easily<00:01:46.980> just

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and then my arch cream can easily just

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.970 
and then my arch cream can easily just
get<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.430> there<00:01:47.550> and<00:01:47.700> snipe<00:01:48.090> off<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.450> Town<00:01:48.630> Hall

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
get in there and snipe off the Town Hall

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.350 
get in there and snipe off the Town Hall
so<00:01:49.980> as<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.160> can<00:01:50.250> see<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.460> place<00:01:50.729> down<00:01:50.940> my<00:01:51.120> Gomes

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so as you can see I place down my Gomes

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.330 
so as you can see I place down my Gomes
in<00:01:51.600> three<00:01:51.780> different<00:01:51.960> spots<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.770> giant<00:01:53.190> bomb

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
in three different spots that giant bomb

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
in three different spots that giant bomb
came<00:01:53.580> off<00:01:53.760> it<00:01:54.120> only<00:01:54.270> took<00:01:54.450> off<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.660> few<00:01:54.840> Wizards

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
came off it only took off a few Wizards

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.020 
came off it only took off a few Wizards
but<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.590> didn't<00:01:55.830> take<00:01:55.950> off<00:01:56.160> any<00:01:56.430> wall<00:01:56.700> breakers

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
but it didn't take off any wall breakers

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.860 
but it didn't take off any wall breakers
so<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.780> was<00:01:57.900> worth<00:01:58.050> it<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.880> now<00:02:00.120> my<00:02:00.330> golems<00:02:00.720> are

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
so it was worth it so now my golems are

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.170 
so it was worth it so now my golems are
going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> center<00:02:01.740> which<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.370> perfect<00:02:03.000> and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
going to the center which is perfect and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.109 
going to the center which is perfect and
so<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.350> my<00:02:04.680> Wizards<00:02:05.070> placing<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.700> my<00:02:05.790> Barbara

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
so is my Wizards placing on my Barbara

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.370 
so is my Wizards placing on my Barbara
