at<00:00:00.089> the<00:00:00.900> backbone<00:00:01.290> of<00:00:01.319> flash<00:00:01.709> or<00:00:01.949> symbols

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
at the backbone of flash or symbols

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.640 
at the backbone of flash or symbols
which<00:00:02.909> are<00:00:03.000> basically<00:00:03.210> graphics<00:00:04.200> stored<00:00:04.500> in

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
which are basically graphics stored in

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.010 
which are basically graphics stored in
the<00:00:04.770> library<00:00:05.250> that<00:00:05.520> can<00:00:05.640> be<00:00:05.910> reused<00:00:06.150> over<00:00:06.720> and

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
the library that can be reused over and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.870 
the library that can be reused over and
over<00:00:07.290> but<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.919> really<00:00:08.130> goes<00:00:08.189> beyond<00:00:08.639> that

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
over but it really goes beyond that

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.540 
over but it really goes beyond that
because<00:00:09.120> symbols<00:00:09.840> can<00:00:10.080> be<00:00:10.139> animated<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.070> have

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
because symbols can be animated and have

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.360 
because symbols can be animated and have
interactivity<00:00:12.450> associated<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:13.679> them<00:00:13.950> just

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
interactivity associated with them just

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.340 
interactivity associated with them just
to<00:00:14.519> name<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> few<00:00:14.849> things<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.509> that's<00:00:16.199> what<00:00:16.320> I

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
to name a few things and that's what I

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.230 
to name a few things and that's what I
want<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:16.800> with<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.250> nav<00:00:17.580> bar<00:00:17.940> right<00:00:18.210> here

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
want to do with this nav bar right here

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.529 
want to do with this nav bar right here
as<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.260> see<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.039> selected<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.910> in

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
as you can see I have it selected and in

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.380 
as you can see I have it selected and in
order<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.220> convert<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.550> symbol<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.330> I

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
order to convert it to a symbol all I

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.050 
order to convert it to a symbol all I
really<00:00:24.869> need<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.199> do<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.619> click<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.519> drag<00:00:26.849> it

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
really need to do is click and drag it

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.359 
really need to do is click and drag it
into<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.390> library<00:00:27.869> soon<00:00:28.439> as<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.710> let<00:00:28.890> go<00:00:28.920> it

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
into the library soon as I let go it

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.820 
into the library soon as I let go it
gives<00:00:29.910> me<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.300> opportunity<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:31.230> convert<00:00:31.710> it

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
gives me the opportunity to convert it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.040 
gives me the opportunity to convert it
to<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.980> symbol<00:00:32.489> from<00:00:32.969> there<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.480> just<00:00:33.870> call

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
to a symbol from there I can just call

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.740 
to a symbol from there I can just call
this<00:00:34.260> nav<00:00:34.620> bar<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.360> i'm<00:00:36.360> just<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
this nav bar and i'm just going to

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.630 
this nav bar and i'm just going to
really<00:00:36.960> make<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.350> movie<00:00:37.770> clip<00:00:37.920> symbol<00:00:38.489> right

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
really make a movie clip symbol right

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.920 
really make a movie clip symbol right
now<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.030> i'm<00:00:39.090> going<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> select<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.570> movie<00:00:39.809> clip

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
now so i'm going to select a movie clip

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
now so i'm going to select a movie clip
keep<00:00:40.410> them<00:00:40.559> registration<00:00:41.129> point<00:00:41.309> where<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.700> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
keep them registration point where it is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.590 
keep them registration point where it is
select<00:00:42.629> ok<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.520> i<00:00:44.550> take<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.940> look<00:00:45.360> at

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
select ok so now as i take a look at

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.340 
select ok so now as i take a look at
this<00:00:46.320> graphic<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.250> my<00:00:47.719> properties<00:00:48.719> panel<00:00:49.020> you

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
this graphic in my properties panel you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.709 
this graphic in my properties panel you
can<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.160> an<00:00:50.340> instance<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.510> nav

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
can see that it's an instance of the nav

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.590 
can see that it's an instance of the nav
bar<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:53.129> many<00:00:53.489> instances<00:00:54.149> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
bar so you can have many instances in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600 
bar so you can have many instances in
fact<00:00:55.230> that's<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.890> i<00:00:55.920> want<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.370> right<00:00:56.550> now

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
fact that's what i want to do right now

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.260 
fact that's what i want to do right now
is<00:00:56.820> drag<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:57.780> another<00:00:58.430> instance<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.730> nav

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
is drag out another instance of that nav

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.080 
is drag out another instance of that nav
bar<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.840> fact<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.739> i<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.219> i<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.730> sort

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
bar in fact what i can do is i can sort

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.450 
bar in fact what i can do is i can sort
of<00:01:03.149> move<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> down<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.320> page<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.100> i'm<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.339> to

control- if you're on a pc and i can

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.270 
control- if you're on a pc and i can
nest<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.490> right<00:01:12.240> down<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:12.810> okay<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.619> with<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.789 
selected I want this to be sort of more
of<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.890> footer<00:01:17.189> well<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.210> select<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.350> can

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
of a footer well I can select it I can

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.590 
of a footer well I can select it I can
use<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> free<00:01:20.310> transform<00:01:20.580> tool<00:01:20.970> kind<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
use the free transform tool kind of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.899 
use the free transform tool kind of
scrunch<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.560> bit<00:01:22.799> more<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.280> then

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
scrunch it up a little bit more and then

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.330 
scrunch it up a little bit more and then
sort<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> use<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:24.659> selection<00:01:25.320> tool<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.560> snap

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
sort of use my selection tool and snap

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.300 
sort of use my selection tool and snap
it<00:01:26.369> into<00:01:26.640> place<00:01:26.729> down<00:01:27.150> there<00:01:27.650> but<00:01:28.650> just

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
it into place down there but just

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.819 
it into place down there but just
because<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:30.090> from<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.630> same<00:01:30.900> symbol

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
because these are from the same symbol

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.830 
because these are from the same symbol
called<00:01:32.040> nav<00:01:32.430> bar<00:01:32.759> doesn't<00:01:33.090> mean<00:01:33.450> he<00:01:33.689> has<00:01:33.720> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
called nav bar doesn't mean he has to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.200 
called nav bar doesn't mean he has to
look<00:01:34.170> exactly<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.829> same<00:01:34.970> because<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.119> my

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
look exactly the same because in my

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.179 
look exactly the same because in my
properties<00:01:36.689> panel<00:01:36.900> I'm<00:01:37.229> given<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.860> these

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
properties panel I'm given all of these

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.999 
properties panel I'm given all of these
other<00:01:38.520> options<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.140> change<00:01:40.409> for

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
other options so I can change for

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.039 
other options so I can change for
instance<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> color<00:01:41.759> effect<00:01:42.240> i<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.540> change

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
instance the color effect i can change

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.560 
instance the color effect i can change
this<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.500> alpha<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> common<00:01:45.390> way

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
this to alpha and this is a common way

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.569 
this to alpha and this is a common way
to<00:01:45.600> make<00:01:45.930> something<00:01:46.200> transparent<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.340> by

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
to make something transparent is by

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.880 
to make something transparent is by
adjusting<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.149> alpha<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:49.140> could<00:01:49.290> even<00:01:49.409> tint

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
adjusting the alpha you could even tint

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.100 
adjusting the alpha you could even tint
it<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.250> well<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.149> i<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.420> go<00:01:51.540> ahead<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> tint

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
it as well so i can go ahead and tint

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.010 
it as well so i can go ahead and tint
this<00:01:52.439> red<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.880> see<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.750> red

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
and i can crank that all the way up like

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.450 
and i can crank that all the way up like

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that oh i can even go to advanced and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.830

opaque so now i can see that even though

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.390 
opaque so now i can see that even though
it's<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.539> different<00:02:09.989> size<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.800> different
