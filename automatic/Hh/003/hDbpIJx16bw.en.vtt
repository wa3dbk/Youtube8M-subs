00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.900 

okay<00:00:05.060> so<00:00:05.120> our<00:00:05.540> tracking<00:00:06.080> is<00:00:06.290> now<00:00:06.529> done<00:00:06.830> and<00:00:07.069> if

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
okay so our tracking is now done and if

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.850 
okay so our tracking is now done and if
we<00:00:08.090> have<00:00:08.270> a<00:00:08.300> little<00:00:08.540> look<00:00:08.660> there<00:00:08.960> things

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
we have a little look there things

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.970 
we have a little look there things
looking<00:00:10.250> pretty<00:00:10.520> good<00:00:10.700> so<00:00:10.760> far<00:00:11.019> so<00:00:12.019> this<00:00:12.650> isn't

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
looking pretty good so far so this isn't

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.009 
looking pretty good so far so this isn't
actually<00:00:13.519> the<00:00:13.670> the<00:00:14.090> final<00:00:14.450> stage<00:00:14.660> of<00:00:14.690> course

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
actually the the final stage of course

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.260 
actually the the final stage of course
you<00:00:15.440> know<00:00:15.559> we<00:00:15.860> need<00:00:16.430> to<00:00:16.550> come<00:00:16.700> in<00:00:16.820> and<00:00:16.849> refine

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
you know we need to come in and refine

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.720 
you know we need to come in and refine
these<00:00:17.570> here<00:00:17.960> as<00:00:18.110> well<00:00:18.290> but<00:00:19.220> I'm<00:00:19.340> just<00:00:19.369> going<00:00:19.640> to

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
these here as well but I'm just going to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.609 
these here as well but I'm just going to
hop<00:00:20.240> over<00:00:20.390> that<00:00:20.660> just<00:00:20.869> for<00:00:20.990> one<00:00:21.020> moment<00:00:21.529> and

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
hop over that just for one moment and

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.830 
hop over that just for one moment and
I'm<00:00:22.010> going<00:00:22.250> to<00:00:22.310> be<00:00:22.430> taking<00:00:23.119> us<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.420> it<00:00:23.449> another

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
I'm going to be taking us to it another

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.540 
I'm going to be taking us to it another
stage<00:00:24.140> just<00:00:24.350> so<00:00:24.470> we<00:00:24.560> can<00:00:24.680> check<00:00:24.949> how<00:00:25.010> accurate

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
stage just so we can check how accurate

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.000 
stage just so we can check how accurate
the<00:00:25.640> camera<00:00:26.000> is<00:00:26.180> at<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.750> moment<00:00:27.170> so<00:00:27.710> I'm<00:00:27.890> gonna

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
the camera is at the moment so I'm gonna

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.400 
the camera is at the moment so I'm gonna
move<00:00:28.279> past<00:00:28.310> this<00:00:29.029> this<00:00:29.570> part<00:00:29.990> of<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.109> workflow

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
move past this this part of the workflow

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.500 
move past this this part of the workflow
and<00:00:30.710> go<00:00:31.039> straight<00:00:31.400> into<00:00:31.580> solving<00:00:31.910> for<00:00:32.239> camera

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
and go straight into solving for camera

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.750 
and go straight into solving for camera
motion<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.650> what<00:00:33.890> this<00:00:34.010> is<00:00:34.160> doing<00:00:34.190> is<00:00:34.610> it's

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
motion so what this is doing is it's

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.700 
motion so what this is doing is it's
going<00:00:34.910> to<00:00:35.030> come<00:00:35.330> in<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:35.720> calculate<00:00:36.470> our

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
going to come in and calculate our

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.700 
going to come in and calculate our
camera<00:00:37.610> move<00:00:37.760> from<00:00:38.420> our<00:00:38.600> tracking<00:00:39.140> markers

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
camera move from our tracking markers

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.259 
camera move from our tracking markers
here<00:00:39.949> and<00:00:40.640> it's<00:00:40.760> going<00:00:40.879> to<00:00:40.940> create<00:00:41.150> this

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
here and it's going to create this

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.840 
here and it's going to create this
little<00:00:41.510> point<00:00:41.690> cloud<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.339> this<00:00:43.339> point<00:00:43.640> cloud

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
little point cloud and this point cloud

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.780 
little point cloud and this point cloud
here<00:00:44.269> is<00:00:44.479> going<00:00:44.900> to<00:00:44.989> be<00:00:45.140> describing<00:00:45.589> the<00:00:46.159> 3d

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
here is going to be describing the 3d

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.590 
here is going to be describing the 3d
motion<00:00:47.650> so<00:00:48.650> just<00:00:49.159> with<00:00:49.280> one<00:00:49.460> 3d<00:00:49.879> track<00:00:50.210> we<00:00:50.449> can

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
motion so just with one 3d track we can

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.660 
motion so just with one 3d track we can
do<00:00:50.839> a<00:00:50.870> whole<00:00:51.290> host<00:00:51.500> of<00:00:51.710> things<00:00:51.769> and<00:00:52.220> it's<00:00:52.580> gonna

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
do a whole host of things and it's gonna

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.850 
do a whole host of things and it's gonna
be<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:52.909> basis<00:00:53.330> for<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:54.110> rest<00:00:54.290> of<00:00:54.409> the<00:00:54.470> project

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
be the basis for the rest of the project

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.200 
be the basis for the rest of the project
so<00:00:55.010> we're<00:00:55.100> going<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.280> be<00:00:55.369> doing<00:00:55.549> the<00:00:55.640> screen

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
so we're going to be doing the screen

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.359 
so we're going to be doing the screen
replacing<00:00:56.750> adding<00:00:57.409> a<00:00:57.500> logo<00:00:57.890> up<00:00:57.949> in<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.129> wall

00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:58.369 
replacing adding a logo up in the wall

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:00.570 
replacing adding a logo up in the wall
here<00:00:58.640> even<00:00:59.269> cleaning<00:00:59.510> up<00:00:59.720> some<00:00:59.900> of<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.080> desk

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
here even cleaning up some of the desk

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.219 
here even cleaning up some of the desk
and<00:01:01.580> we<00:01:01.909> can<00:01:02.059> do<00:01:02.210> all<00:01:02.239> of<00:01:02.360> that<00:01:02.479> once<00:01:02.930> we<00:01:03.080> get

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
and we can do all of that once we get

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.319 
and we can do all of that once we get
just<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.589> single<00:01:03.949> solid<00:01:04.960> 3d<00:01:05.960> track<00:01:07.119> now<00:01:08.119> at<00:01:08.240> the

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
just a single solid 3d track now at the

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.690 
just a single solid 3d track now at the
moment<00:01:08.780> all<00:01:08.930> of<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.140> points<00:01:09.590> in<00:01:10.039> the<00:01:10.430> point

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
moment all of the points in the point

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.450 
moment all of the points in the point
cloud<00:01:10.789> seem<00:01:11.539> to<00:01:11.689> be<00:01:11.810> matching<00:01:12.159> pretty<00:01:13.159> nicely

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
cloud seem to be matching pretty nicely

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.490 
cloud seem to be matching pretty nicely
but<00:01:13.969> let's<00:01:14.149> see<00:01:14.329> how<00:01:14.509> accurate<00:01:14.930> that<00:01:14.960> really

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
but let's see how accurate that really

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.679 
but let's see how accurate that really
is<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.369> I'm<00:01:16.430> going<00:01:16.549> to<00:01:16.579> move<00:01:16.729> us<00:01:16.880> from<00:01:17.000> our<00:01:17.299> 2d

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
is so I'm going to move us from our 2d

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.099 
is so I'm going to move us from our 2d
view<00:01:17.930> into<00:01:18.710> our<00:01:18.799> 3d<00:01:19.280> view<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.729> this<00:01:20.659> shows<00:01:20.929> us

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
view into our 3d view and this shows us

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.130 
view into our 3d view and this shows us
a<00:01:21.229> 3d<00:01:21.530> representation<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:23.000> of<00:01:23.539> those<00:01:23.869> same

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
a 3d representation of the of those same

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.109 
a 3d representation of the of those same
points<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.189> we<00:01:25.280> can<00:01:25.310> actually<00:01:25.579> start<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:26.090> see

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
points so we can actually start to see

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.450 
points so we can actually start to see
these<00:01:26.450> in<00:01:26.600> space<00:01:26.840> they<00:01:27.740> have<00:01:27.829> a<00:01:27.890> hold<00:01:28.100> down<00:01:28.250> the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
these in space they have a hold down the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.190 
these in space they have a hold down the
command<00:01:28.939> key<00:01:29.090> or<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.509> control<00:01:29.840> key<00:01:30.020> on

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
command key or the control key on

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.380 
command key or the control key on
Windows<00:01:30.649> then<00:01:31.280> I<00:01:31.310> can<00:01:31.520> start<00:01:31.759> to<00:01:31.850> pan<00:01:32.149> around

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
Windows then I can start to pan around

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.389 
Windows then I can start to pan around
this<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:32.960> we<00:01:33.649> get<00:01:33.770> these<00:01:33.950> sort<00:01:34.219> of<00:01:34.249> little

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
this and we get these sort of little

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.810 
this and we get these sort of little
clusters<00:01:34.969> of<00:01:35.119> stars<00:01:35.929> almost<00:01:36.399> and<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.549> hold<00:01:37.729> down

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
clusters of stars almost and I hold down

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.899 
clusters of stars almost and I hold down
the<00:01:37.880> Alt<00:01:38.090> key<00:01:38.149> we<00:01:38.420> can<00:01:38.600> zoom<00:01:38.749> out<00:01:38.990> there<00:01:39.380> and

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
the Alt key we can zoom out there and

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.550 
the Alt key we can zoom out there and
these<00:01:40.909> are<00:01:40.969> our<00:01:41.179> point<00:01:41.450> clouds<00:01:41.869> sorry<00:01:42.439> these

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
these are our point clouds sorry these

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.870 
these are our point clouds sorry these
are<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.799> same<00:01:43.039> points<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.399> we<00:01:43.549> were<00:01:43.640> looking

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
are the same points that we were looking

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.440 
are the same points that we were looking
at<00:01:43.969> just<00:01:43.999> a<00:01:44.240> moment<00:01:44.570> ago<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:45.609> proper<00:01:46.609> 3d<00:01:47.240> space

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
at just a moment ago in proper 3d space

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.609 
at just a moment ago in proper 3d space
now<00:01:47.689> all<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:47.990> this<00:01:48.049> is<00:01:48.229> going<00:01:48.319> to<00:01:48.380> look<00:01:48.560> a

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
now all of this is going to look a

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.319 
now all of this is going to look a
little<00:01:48.740> bit<00:01:48.950> confusing<00:01:49.369> just<00:01:49.700> for<00:01:49.819> the<00:01:49.909> moment

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
little bit confusing just for the moment

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.059 
little bit confusing just for the moment
but<00:01:50.479> we're<00:01:50.659> gonna<00:01:50.749> come<00:01:51.649> in<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:51.859> we're<00:01:51.950> gonna

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
but we're gonna come in and we're gonna

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.279 
but we're gonna come in and we're gonna
look<00:01:52.880> at<00:01:53.030> those<00:01:53.179> and<00:01:53.420> figure<00:01:53.630> out<00:01:53.780> how<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:53.990> read

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
look at those and figure out how to read

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.889 
look at those and figure out how to read
those<00:01:54.469> a<00:01:54.499> bit<00:01:54.740> better<00:01:54.890> later<00:01:55.600> what<00:01:56.600> I'm<00:01:56.719> going

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
those a bit better later what I'm going

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.219 
those a bit better later what I'm going
to<00:01:56.929> do<00:01:57.079> now<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.920> actually<00:01:58.549> just<00:01:58.909> look<00:01:59.329> at<00:01:59.780> this

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
to do now is actually just look at this

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.789 
to do now is actually just look at this
white<00:02:00.560> line<00:02:00.829> here<00:02:00.859> because<00:02:01.819> this<00:02:01.969> white<00:02:02.179> line

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
white line here because this white line

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.879 
white line here because this white line
describes<00:02:03.799> our<00:02:04.069> camera<00:02:04.429> movement<00:02:04.789> and<00:02:05.889> this

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:06.889 
describes our camera movement and this

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:08.380 
describes our camera movement and this
is<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.249> thing<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.490> we're<00:02:07.759> going<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:07.999> look<00:02:08.179> at

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
is the thing that we're going to look at

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.860 
is the thing that we're going to look at
for<00:02:09.369> accuracy<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.520> just<00:02:10.910> see<00:02:11.150> how<00:02:11.180> accurate

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
for accuracy and just see how accurate

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.840 
for accuracy and just see how accurate
our<00:02:12.190> camera<00:02:13.190> movement<00:02:13.670> actually<00:02:13.849> is

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
our camera movement actually is

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.660 
our camera movement actually is
you<00:02:15.910> can<00:02:16.030> see<00:02:16.210> here<00:02:16.510> as<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:17.410> move<00:02:18.220> through<00:02:18.520> the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
you can see here as we move through the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.320 
you can see here as we move through the
timeline<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:20.110> camera<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.620> moving<00:02:20.920> in<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:22.150> way

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
timeline the camera is moving in a way

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.650 
timeline the camera is moving in a way
that's<00:02:22.600> consistent<00:02:22.810> with<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.440> shot<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.540> it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
that's consistent with the shot but it

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.350 
that's consistent with the shot but it
is<00:02:25.810> slightly<00:02:26.140> bumpy<00:02:26.620> still<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.850> those<00:02:28.060> bumps

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
is slightly bumpy still and those bumps

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.760 
is slightly bumpy still and those bumps
are<00:02:28.750> probably<00:02:29.380> due<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> few<00:02:30.280> kind<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.120> weird

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
are probably due to a few kind of weird

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.010 
are probably due to a few kind of weird
tracking<00:02:32.770> markers<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.310> we<00:02:33.460> already<00:02:33.640> have<00:02:34.060> it

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
tracking markers that we already have it

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.500 
tracking markers that we already have it
could<00:02:35.200> also<00:02:35.320> be<00:02:35.500> down<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.250> where<00:02:36.790> we<00:02:36.940> start<00:02:37.240> to

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
could also be down to where we start to

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.020 
could also be down to where we start to
to<00:02:37.870> do<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.140> camera<00:02:38.320> self<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:39.460> let's<00:02:39.790> take<00:02:40.000> a

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
to do the camera self but let's take a

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.590 
to do the camera self but let's take a
look<00:02:40.300> at<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:42.010> first<00:02:42.250> case<00:02:42.730> scenario

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
look at the the first case scenario

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.280 
look at the the first case scenario
there<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.590> if<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.710> hold<00:02:44.830> down<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.070> spacebar<00:02:46.290> we

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
there so if I hold down the spacebar we

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.550 
there so if I hold down the spacebar we
open<00:02:47.830> up<00:02:47.950> our<00:02:48.190> little<00:02:48.780> wheel<00:02:49.780> here<00:02:50.200> with<00:02:50.410> all

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
open up our little wheel here with all

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.020 
open up our little wheel here with all
the<00:02:50.710> different<00:02:51.040> things<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.310> we<00:02:51.460> can<00:02:51.610> do<00:02:51.790> I'm

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
the different things that we can do I'm

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.460 
the different things that we can do I'm
just<00:02:52.180> going<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.360> clear<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.660> solution<00:02:53.290> there

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
just going to clear that solution there

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.160 
just going to clear that solution there
and<00:02:53.800> it'll<00:02:54.190> snap<00:02:54.460> us<00:02:54.640> back<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:55.420> our<00:02:55.540> 2d<00:02:55.900> view

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
and it'll snap us back to our 2d view

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.240 
and it'll snap us back to our 2d view
and<00:02:56.380> our<00:02:56.890> trackers<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.660> what<00:02:59.410> this<00:02:59.590> stage<00:02:59.920> is

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
and our trackers so what this stage is

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.790 
and our trackers so what this stage is
actually<00:03:00.850> going<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.150> be<00:03:01.270> consisting<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.290> is

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
actually going to be consisting of is

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.850 
actually going to be consisting of is
it's<00:03:02.950> going<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.100> be<00:03:03.190> looking<00:03:03.700> at<00:03:04.710> getting<00:03:05.710> the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
it's going to be looking at getting the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.330 
it's going to be looking at getting the
best<00:03:06.190> tracking<00:03:07.060> points<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.990> we<00:03:08.140> can<00:03:08.380> here<00:03:08.710> so

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
best tracking points that we can here so

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.450 
best tracking points that we can here so
I'm<00:03:10.030> going<00:03:10.210> to<00:03:10.270> again<00:03:10.870> use<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.410> Alt<00:03:11.860> key<00:03:12.010> just

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
I'm going to again use the Alt key just

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.510 
I'm going to again use the Alt key just
to<00:03:12.550> zoom<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:12.970> just<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.210> little<00:03:13.240> bit<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:14.400> if<00:03:15.400> you

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
to zoom in just a little bit and if you

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.610 
to zoom in just a little bit and if you
have<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.730> look<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.150> go<00:03:16.780> over<00:03:17.080> any<00:03:17.320> of<00:03:17.440> these

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
have a look and go over any of these

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.770 
have a look and go over any of these
tracking<00:03:18.100> points<00:03:18.430> we<00:03:18.970> get<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.150> sort<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.570> little

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
tracking points we get a sort of little

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.220 
tracking points we get a sort of little
traffic<00:03:20.020> light<00:03:20.350> system<00:03:20.800> so<00:03:21.630> any<00:03:22.630> green<00:03:23.020> line

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
traffic light system so any green line

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.190 
traffic light system so any green line
here<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.770> where<00:03:24.730> about<00:03:25.330> P<00:03:25.600> fo<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:25.990> very

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
here is where about P fo is very

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.090 
here is where about P fo is very
confident<00:03:26.770> that<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.760> track<00:03:28.120> it's<00:03:28.300> got<00:03:28.600> is

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
confident that the track it's got is

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.980 
confident that the track it's got is
accurate<00:03:30.100> where<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:30.970> starts<00:03:31.300> going<00:03:31.480> yellow

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
accurate where it starts going yellow

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.840 
accurate where it starts going yellow
it's<00:03:32.290> less<00:03:32.680> confident<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.370> where<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:33.640> turns

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
it's less confident and where it turns

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.960 
it's less confident and where it turns
red<00:03:34.120> it's<00:03:34.990> not<00:03:35.380> very<00:03:36.100> confident<00:03:36.580> in<00:03:36.670> what's

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
red it's not very confident in what's

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.020 
red it's not very confident in what's
happening<00:03:37.390> at<00:03:37.480> all<00:03:37.710> so<00:03:38.710> let's<00:03:39.520> take<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.760> look<00:03:39.910> at

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
happening at all so let's take a look at

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.930 
happening at all so let's take a look at
this<00:03:40.180> one<00:03:40.360> over<00:03:40.390> here<00:03:40.750> for<00:03:40.930> example<00:03:40.960> and<00:03:41.940> just

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
this one over here for example and just

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.140 
this one over here for example and just
see<00:03:43.180> if<00:03:43.420> that<00:03:43.690> really<00:03:43.990> is<00:03:44.580> matching<00:03:45.580> up<00:03:45.700> with

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
see if that really is matching up with

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.290 
see if that really is matching up with
the<00:03:46.950> movement<00:03:47.950> there<00:03:48.490> actually<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.090> probably

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
the movement there actually is probably

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.610 
the movement there actually is probably
not<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:49.840> what<00:03:49.960> I'm<00:03:50.050> going<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.200> do<00:03:50.350> is<00:03:50.470> just

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
not so what I'm going to do is just

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.390 
not so what I'm going to do is just
select<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.150> hit<00:03:52.150> backspace<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.810> delete<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.400> so

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
select it hit backspace and delete it so

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.470 
select it hit backspace and delete it so
if<00:03:54.490> we<00:03:54.640> call<00:03:55.000> all<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.460> dodgy<00:03:57.460> frames<00:03:57.820> so

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
if we call all of the dodgy frames so

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.230 
if we call all of the dodgy frames so
this<00:03:58.630> one<00:03:58.780> over<00:03:59.020> here<00:03:59.230> for<00:03:59.380> example<00:04:00.150> where<00:04:01.150> you

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
this one over here for example where you

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.270 
this one over here for example where you
can<00:04:01.300> see<00:04:01.390> it's<00:04:01.690> drifting<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:03.730> one<00:04:03.940> here<00:04:05.280> so

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
can see it's drifting this one here so

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.370 
can see it's drifting this one here so
check<00:04:06.580> it<00:04:06.700> out<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:07.240> see<00:04:07.480> it's<00:04:07.600> looking<00:04:08.050> pretty

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
check it out you see it's looking pretty

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.310 
check it out you see it's looking pretty
good<00:04:08.500> until<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.520> starts<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.030> intersect<00:04:10.660> with

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
good until it starts to intersect with

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.410 
good until it starts to intersect with
the<00:04:11.440> screen<00:04:11.740> there<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.700> starts<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.090> drift

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
the screen there and it starts to drift

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.390 
the screen there and it starts to drift
off<00:04:13.570> over<00:04:13.900> time<00:04:14.080> so<00:04:14.860> we're<00:04:14.980> going<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.160> start

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
off over time so we're going to start

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.590 
off over time so we're going to start
just<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.820> cull<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.390> few<00:04:17.020> of<00:04:17.140> these<00:04:17.320> here<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:19.480> we

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
just to cull a few of these here and we

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.150 
just to cull a few of these here and we
can<00:04:19.750> select<00:04:19.989> multiple<00:04:20.850> multiple

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
can select multiple multiple

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.240 
can select multiple multiple
tracking<00:04:23.970> points<00:04:24.270> at<00:04:24.360> any<00:04:24.480> point<00:04:25.100> just<00:04:26.100> by

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
tracking points at any point just by

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.760 
tracking points at any point just by
clicking<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.820> dragging<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.930> we<00:04:28.590> get<00:04:28.740> a

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
clicking and dragging and we get a

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.460 
clicking and dragging and we get a
little<00:04:29.060> lasso<00:04:30.060> tool<00:04:30.300> going<00:04:30.990> around<00:04:31.230> there

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
little lasso tool going around there

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.980 
little lasso tool going around there
let's<00:04:32.040> just<00:04:32.100> get<00:04:32.310> rid<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:35.660> cool<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.840> all

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
let's just get rid of that cool and all

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.570 
let's just get rid of that cool and all
of<00:04:37.140> these<00:04:37.230> things<00:04:37.500> it's<00:04:37.890> just<00:04:38.130> going<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.310> help

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
of these things it's just going to help

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.160 
of these things it's just going to help
with<00:04:39.480> the<00:04:39.630> eventual<00:04:39.930> accuracy<00:04:40.800> of<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:42.510> camera

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
with the eventual accuracy of the camera

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.850 
with the eventual accuracy of the camera
move<00:04:44.060> cool<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:45.450> now<00:04:45.750> I've<00:04:46.230> called<00:04:46.410> a<00:04:46.590> few<00:04:46.620> of

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
move cool so now I've called a few of

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.240 
move cool so now I've called a few of
those

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
those

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.490 
those
hopefully<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.820> worst<00:04:48.000> offenders<00:04:48.540> what<00:04:49.350> we

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
hopefully the worst offenders what we

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.320 
hopefully the worst offenders what we
can<00:04:49.650> do<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:49.950> we<00:04:50.070> can<00:04:50.190> come<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.700> our<00:04:50.790> next<00:04:51.090> part

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
can do is we can come to our next part

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.840 
can do is we can come to our next part
here<00:04:51.390> which<00:04:52.020> is<00:04:52.050> all<00:04:52.380> about<00:04:52.680> estimating<00:04:53.520> the

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
here which is all about estimating the

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.450 
here which is all about estimating the
focal<00:04:54.240> length<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:55.230> you<00:04:55.440> seen<00:04:55.740> orientation

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
focal length and you seen orientation

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.280 
focal length and you seen orientation
and<00:04:56.610> this<00:04:57.090> is<00:04:57.240> going<00:04:57.390> to<00:04:57.480> be<00:04:57.570> absolutely

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
and this is going to be absolutely

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.220 
and this is going to be absolutely
crucial<00:04:58.620> when<00:04:59.400> we<00:04:59.490> take<00:04:59.700> our<00:04:59.940> data<00:05:00.360> over<00:05:01.050> into

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
crucial when we take our data over into

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:09.380 
crucial when we take our data over into
the<00:05:01.320> combusting<00:05:01.800> app

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390
