00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.330
 never 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.510
 Well we told you that today is the day 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.309
 world environment and so it 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.890
 Llama la Paloma is an expert in topics 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.039
 environmentalists pigeon somohano stop and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.060
 we are human evidence and she has 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.679
 work to promote a regenerative future 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.480
 sustainable and ethical is its work is going to 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.099
 tell now what it is about besides 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.470
 form agents of change that transform 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.630
 socio-environmental systems 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.250
 welcome pigeons thank you very much 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.530
 this app sounds lovely but what 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.890
 they would be like the translation at the beginning 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.200
 not all of that is a very complex issue 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.090
 I work in the umma at the university 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.700
 environment there is a university 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.130
 of the environment and proudly here 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.710
 in mexico in valle de bravo with some 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.240
 installation less bad and good we have 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.430
 several programs which do not 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.830
 apply later but our idea 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.960
 is to form agents of change like you well 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.510
 you said they have the ability to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.280
 understand the magnitude these problems 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.180
 so complex since it's not about 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 a 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.880
 of a subject of a pure discipline a 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.200
 pure science we political biology 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.240
 our economy is everything more to recycle 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.600
 recycling is the third option of what 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.470
 it's better to reduce the really we're going to 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.790
 limit our consumption for example 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.400
 when we think of a process that is 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.830
 efficient normally that process does not 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.290
 should have no waste so 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.790
 both in theory in clear theory we are going to 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.590
 seek to be more efficient we can 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.619
 even look at what the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.670
 nature the famous biomimicry that 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.460
 they use many methods of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.350
 production and even in industries 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.970
 that is to say nature all that 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.560
 discards that in the end it is used as 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.180
 as food as nature itself 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.979
 the mind and it's a book hero what 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.259
 we discard is not polluting 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.360
 in things of nature in progress 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.280
 that's why before recycling we're going to 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.000
 reduce and how can we reduce there 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.170
 many ways for example at home 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.050
 We can reduce the packaging we can 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.980
 look for products that contain less 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.730
 packaging because this simple packaging 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.080
 an expense in co2 and that because good that 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.060
 It's difficult because if you're already 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.650
 used to like you or need a certain 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.349
 product of packaging and it comes complicated 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.849
 well no better way and about the companies 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.610
 industries to reduce their 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.830
 packaging from instead of choosing the one 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.290
 more on the simple packaging exactly 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.420
 when it is a joint effort with 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.340
 order to remove them from oscillating exactly 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.810
 it is as much of the producers as of the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.640
 consumers we know that the offer 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.980
 proceed the demand and if we do not 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.239
 we demand this is not going to happen is 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.790
 complicated I do not say that you're 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.099
 used to eat your beans in 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.349
 that's why we act to use batteries 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.750
 for control of television and almost 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.010
 it is better that you do not buy it I am the most 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.440
 simple that you do not want you remember 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.390
 before pigeon you arrived this now yes 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.190
 I'm going to see you very old lady but you 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.739
 the mothers sent for the tortillas and 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.420
 then and you go with your rag 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.660
 napkin to wealthy people you already 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.220
 on napkin paper and then up 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.510
 we saw for those who are on paper 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.950
 because they did not bring their napkin 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.319
 Take your washcloth so they do not have 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.019
 that pack the pieces now 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.689
 they come in triple s love and but with 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.459
 to keep the bags are joined 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.900
 of the super the bags of the super too 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.879
 of the children ask now if you 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.010
 tie in a box or pack you in a bag 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.689
 is taking for comfort says in 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.489
 bag because then think about loading the 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:35.680
 box today that you will use them for 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.090
 throw away the trash or something like that 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.299
 many people are making conscience 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.159
 they carry their ecological bags that is a 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.530
 very good option is one is a good 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.480
 option depending obviously is a subject 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.489
 complex yes but the material from which 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.709
 this ecological bag is made and the 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.780
 number of times you are going to use us 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.159
 we buy an ecological bag every time 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.439
 that we go to the superbowl we always 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.449
 forgot good it does not become ecological anymore 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.090
 it is better to use the beach ones and the batteries 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:03.430
 ordinary people is , we're not that 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.219
 we do not have to make things or anything 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.379
 on foot as it is as most pollute or 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.359
 As a sum, we hurt the environment 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.389
 look environment there is a very tool 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.110
 interesting that is called Carmen 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:18.859
 print 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.120
 or carbon footprint and this is a 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.430
 very interesting tool that was 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.440
 developed as some more than six years 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.190
 that allows us to understand our footprint 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.350
 in co2 in barrel in carbon dioxide and 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.510
 the practicality of carbon dioxide is 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.420
 which is a measurable element a unit 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.550
 we already know that what we can measure is 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.620
 what we can obviously improve and there 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.390
 We can see our environmental footprint in 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.600
 carbon dioxide terms and in 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.400
 reality varies depending on the country of 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.800
 kind of life for example people 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.230
 who travel a lot concentrate their footprint 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.570
 carbon aircraft while 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.600
 others in their consumption because a can 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.669
 comes from us good had to have 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.880
 after being transported in a 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:05.300
 truck that is emitting emissions of 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.120
 carbon dioxide then in these 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.090
 tools search the internet 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.560
 this co2 calculator is true this 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.360
 because I've seen mediums seen 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.280
 all your activities a little bit of what 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.560
 does in the day or closed with chayo and I 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.310
 they ask and they tell you what you spend 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.310
 day so much 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.370
 every more interesting person still tells you 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.370
 how many planets land is needed 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.310
 to be able to support the capacity of life 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.750
 if everyone lived like you is very 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.300
 awesome and here in mexico already 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.310
 we go over the planet so we are already 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.290
 above and country is evidently that they are 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.390
 below are countries that have indexes 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.450
 of human development well below 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.340
 normal standard and you the idea of ​​everything 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.730
 this environmental movement is not 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.130
 save the trees and flowers 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.960
 it's a human development to watch it die 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.440
 is for example as singapore that if you 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.720
 you throw a corkboard a gum what 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.400
 the street is they charge a pretty penny Peró 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.650
 a bundle like five thousand pesos fine 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.120
 In Mexico, we are the real pigs 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.950
 every time it rains everything is flooded 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.960
 because all the strains run away from 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.810
 so much crap what's up with these 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.970
 countries like singapore if you reduce this 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.430
 these levels of which you speak if there 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.080
 countries that have regulations a lot 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.600
 more stringent in environmental matters 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.830
 so much waste energy for example that 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.530
 is the percentage of 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.120
 come from clean sources like wind 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:32.270
 like the solar thing that does not happen here in 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.420
 Mexico we are starting little by little 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.740
 this but a way to get to 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.910
 this objective is legislation 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.010
 unfortunately in Mexico I still do not 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.500
 they are so strict but the delegation 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.330
 also not to the children to the 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.770
 children and now I remember we have 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.730
 say how mccann agree the 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.320
 prehistory by throwing a paper 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.210
 but we were not given that they were not 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.010
 so aware the classes on the 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.240
 environmental education and now the children if 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.750
 you see that they do the exhibition of the little group 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.300
 I arrived and reviewing clear to the best is 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.500
 that they were not so dirty so cochinones 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.890
 like now we are swimming in 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.890
 garbage 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.250
 but we are not seeing the 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.140
 consequences of what happens and I'm going to 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.820
 more quickly to talk about the 

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.070
 costs in the example of the tortillas is 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.400
 very interesting if they charged us the paper 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:27.320
 yes yes they will really quantify what 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.150
 It takes recycling that paper once one 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.040
 he throws it away that goes through the truck 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.140
 garbage that has to be separated 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.090
 a recycling plant and that cost 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.890
 even marginally they charge you in 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.320
 the tortillas and sure that people are 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.300
 is going to take your color wipe 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.970
