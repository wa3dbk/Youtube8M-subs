inner<00:00:12.420> Seavey's<00:00:12.870> well<00:00:13.349> there's<00:00:13.590> only<00:00:13.679> series

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
inner Seavey's well there's only series

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.330 
inner Seavey's well there's only series
on<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.190> front<00:00:14.400> anyway<00:00:14.519> both<00:00:15.330> my<00:00:15.980> inner<00:00:16.980> CV

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
on the front anyway both my inner CV

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:27.470 
on the front anyway both my inner CV
boots<00:00:18.380> ripped<00:00:19.380> or<00:00:19.770> torn<00:00:19.800> as<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.720> see<00:00:26.480> it's

first you're just going to remove your

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.940 
first you're just going to remove your
wheel<00:00:39.239> that's<00:00:39.540> pretty<00:00:40.110> easy<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.710> up

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
wheel that's pretty easy I have up

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
aftermarket wheels so I didn't use the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.979 
aftermarket wheels so I didn't use the
standard<00:00:43.800> tool<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.670> used<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.090> breaker<00:00:45.719> bar

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
standard tool they used a breaker bar

standard tool they used a breaker bar
and<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.500> 21<00:00:46.860> millimeter<00:00:46.980> socket<00:00:47.870> all<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and a 21 millimeter socket all you do is

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.310 
and a 21 millimeter socket all you do is
just<00:00:49.410> pop<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.680> cap<00:00:49.890> off<00:00:50.300> take<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.510> center

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
just pop this cap off take this center

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.709 
just pop this cap off take this center
piece<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.949> couple<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.489> screws<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.090> then

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
piece out a couple of screws and then

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.319 
piece out a couple of screws and then
just<00:00:55.070> crank<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> wheel<00:00:56.309> off<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.940> will<00:00:57.120> have

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
just crank the wheel off you will have

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.520 
just crank the wheel off you will have
to<00:00:58.340> kick<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.660> breaker<00:01:00.660> bar<00:01:00.870> whatever<00:01:01.079> these

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
to kick the breaker bar whatever these

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.070 
to kick the breaker bar whatever these
bolts<00:01:01.949> won't<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.340> come<00:01:02.430> off<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:03.329> brittle

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
guns to be honest a bit dangerous and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.429 
guns to be honest a bit dangerous and

yeah you shouldn't be using a rattle gun
with<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> normal<00:01:22.950> socket<00:01:23.159> anyway<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:24.540> least<00:01:24.570> can

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
with a normal socket anyway at least can

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.219 
with a normal socket anyway at least can
shadow<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:26.570> yeah<00:01:27.570> you'd<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> use

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
shadow and yeah you'd have to use

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.080 
shadow and yeah you'd have to use
Ratigan's<00:01:28.950> socket<00:01:29.280> which<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.850> so

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
yeah anyway I picked up this constant

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.020 
yeah anyway I picked up this constant

apparently following a tutorial that
behind<00:02:33.020> this<00:02:33.170> cap<00:02:33.470> here<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:35.090> some<00:02:35.990> sort<00:02:36.140> of

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
behind this cap here is some sort of

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.350 
behind this cap here is some sort of
circlip<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.890> once<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:37.580> remove<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.790> circlip

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
circlip and once you remove that circlip

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.360 
circlip and once you remove that circlip
it<00:02:38.540> pops<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.959> shaft<00:02:39.200> out<00:02:39.380> from<00:02:39.530> here<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:39.920> then

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
it pops the shaft out from here and then

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.860 
it pops the shaft out from here and then
all<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.520> have<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.730> do<00:02:40.850> is<00:02:41.060> under<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.510> bolts<00:02:41.780> at

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
all you have to do is under the bolts at

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.580 
all you have to do is under the bolts at
the<00:02:41.900> gaiter<00:02:42.230> which<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.930> those<00:02:44.930> four<00:02:45.410> bolts

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
the gaiter which is those four bolts

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.800 
the gaiter which is those four bolts
there<00:02:45.980> which<00:02:46.280> can<00:02:46.520> just<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:47.300> can<00:02:47.330> just<00:02:47.480> move

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
there which can just you can just move

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.030 
there which can just you can just move
this<00:02:48.940> axle<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.120> get<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.450> other<00:02:50.570> ones<00:02:51.040> if

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
this axle to get to the other ones if

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.330 
this axle to get to the other ones if
you<00:02:52.100> can't<00:02:52.610> reach<00:02:53.000> them<00:02:53.239> as<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.380> can<00:02:54.530> see<00:02:54.860> it's

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
you can't reach them as you can see it's

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.870 
you can't reach them as you can see it's
a<00:02:55.430> bit<00:02:55.580> tight<00:02:55.880> but<00:02:57.340> yeah<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.400> can<00:02:58.580> just<00:02:58.610> remove

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
a bit tight but yeah you can just remove

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.880 
a bit tight but yeah you can just remove
those<00:02:59.030> there<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.660> then<00:02:59.959> hopefully<00:03:00.350> this

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
those there and then hopefully this

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.759 
those there and then hopefully this
whole<00:03:01.100> thing<00:03:01.340> couldn't<00:03:01.700> just<00:03:01.820> pop<00:03:02.030> out<00:03:02.440> if<00:03:03.440> not

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
whole thing couldn't just pop out if not

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.580 
whole thing couldn't just pop out if not
then<00:03:04.160> what<00:03:04.489> I'm<00:03:04.610> gonna<00:03:04.730> do<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.180> pop<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:06.320> off

and I can pop those off alternatively I
can<00:03:20.420> just<00:03:20.720> undo<00:03:21.049> it<00:03:21.079> at<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.320> nut<00:03:21.470> here<00:03:21.680> market

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
can just undo it at the nut here market

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.620 
can just undo it at the nut here market
at<00:03:22.190> first<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.579> undo<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:22.910> rather<00:03:23.360> than<00:03:23.480> having

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
at first and undo it rather than having

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.860 
at first and undo it rather than having
to<00:03:23.810> pop<00:03:23.959> them<00:03:24.110> off<00:03:25.030> yeah<00:03:26.030> there's<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.510> couple<00:03:26.690> of

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
to pop them off yeah there's a couple of

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.069 
to pop them off yeah there's a couple of
ways<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.140> do<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.290> but<00:03:27.350> yes<00:03:28.190> anyway<00:03:28.820> what<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.810> did

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
ways to do it but yes anyway what I did

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.470 
ways to do it but yes anyway what I did
was<00:03:30.350> I<00:03:30.380> jacked<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.040> car<00:03:31.070> up<00:03:31.459> on<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:32.030> jacking

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
was I jacked the car up on the jacking

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.350 
was I jacked the car up on the jacking
point<00:03:32.720> there<00:03:32.959> with<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.500> standard<00:03:33.950> Jack<00:03:34.790> and

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
point there with the standard Jack and

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.060 
point there with the standard Jack and
I'm<00:03:35.480> going<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.750> go<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:35.930> some<00:03:36.200> axle<00:03:36.530> stands<00:03:36.739> and

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
I'm going to go to some axle stands and

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.580 
I'm going to go to some axle stands and
there's<00:03:37.190> some<00:03:37.310> axle<00:03:38.030> jacking<00:03:38.959> points<00:03:39.380> on<00:03:39.500> the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
there's some axle jacking points on the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.650 
there's some axle jacking points on the
front<00:03:39.860> here<00:03:40.100> so<00:03:40.310> I've<00:03:40.549> just<00:03:40.579> jacked<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:41.600> up

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
front here so I've just jacked it up

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.100 
front here so I've just jacked it up
there

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
there

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.410 
there
now<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.739> says<00:03:42.950> has<00:03:43.160> no<00:03:43.459> load<00:03:43.730> on<00:03:43.910> this<00:03:44.000> jack<00:03:44.299> at

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
now it says has no load on this jack at

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.900 
now it says has no load on this jack at
the<00:03:44.480> moment<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:45.019> can<00:03:45.590> take<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:45.920> load<00:03:46.190> right<00:03:46.579> off

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
the moment I can take a load right off

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.449 
the moment I can take a load right off
it<00:03:47.090> if<00:03:47.209> I<00:03:47.299> want<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.540> I've<00:03:47.989> just<00:03:48.230> keep<00:03:48.950> tit<00:03:49.220> there

it if I want to I've just keep tit there
just<00:03:49.850> for<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.030> bit<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.329> safety<00:03:50.540> measure

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
just for a bit of a safety measure

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.520 
just for a bit of a safety measure
just<00:03:51.739> in<00:03:51.920> case<00:03:52.100> of<00:03:52.280> my<00:03:52.370> axle<00:03:52.700> stands<00:03:53.530> because

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
just in case of my axle stands because

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.630 
just in case of my axle stands because
you<00:03:54.650> can<00:03:54.739> see<00:03:54.860> there's<00:03:54.980> no<00:03:55.100> load<00:03:55.370> on<00:03:55.400> this

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
you can see there's no load on this

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.810 
you can see there's no load on this
thing<00:03:56.140> just<00:03:57.140> in<00:03:57.290> case<00:03:57.440> my<00:03:57.500> axle<00:03:58.010> stands<00:03:58.310> decide

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
thing just in case my axle stands decide

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.539 
thing just in case my axle stands decide
to<00:03:59.200> give<00:04:00.200> out<00:04:00.350> I've<00:04:00.920> just<00:04:01.100> got<00:04:01.250> an<00:04:01.340> extra

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
to give out I've just got an extra

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.970 
to give out I've just got an extra
safety<00:04:01.820> measure<00:04:02.120> yeah<00:04:03.079> all<00:04:03.500> right<00:04:03.650> enough

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
safety measure yeah all right enough

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.620 
safety measure yeah all right enough
cubed<00:04:04.250> yelling<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:04.940> I'm<00:04:05.000> gonna<00:04:05.090> take<00:04:05.269> this<00:04:05.390> cap

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.059 
Rodie that was a lot easier than I
expected<00:06:05.229> so<00:06:06.229> basically<00:06:06.589> what<00:06:06.770> I<00:06:06.800> did<00:06:06.949> was

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 
expected so basically what I did was

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.360 
expected so basically what I did was
just<00:06:07.099> undo<00:06:07.580> those<00:06:07.789> four<00:06:08.449> bolts<00:06:08.889> I'm<00:06:09.889> not<00:06:10.099> sorry

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
just undo those four bolts I'm not sorry

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.170 
just undo those four bolts I'm not sorry
on<00:06:10.639> the<00:06:10.819> Gator<00:06:12.279> those<00:06:13.279> not<00:06:13.550> staying<00:06:13.849> there<00:06:14.060> you

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
on the Gator those not staying there you

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.490 
on the Gator those not staying there you
can't<00:06:14.389> actually<00:06:14.539> I<00:06:14.719> mean<00:06:14.870> those<00:06:15.050> bolts<00:06:15.349> are

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
can't actually I mean those bolts are

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.929 
can't actually I mean those bolts are
they<00:06:15.680> staying<00:06:15.979> there<00:06:16.219> you<00:06:16.279> can't<00:06:16.490> pop<00:06:16.789> them

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:16.939 
they staying there you can't pop them

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.170 
they staying there you can't pop them
out<00:06:17.029> which<00:06:17.240> would<00:06:17.389> make<00:06:17.509> it<00:06:17.599> a<00:06:17.629> lot<00:06:17.750> easier<00:06:17.779> but

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
out which would make it a lot easier but

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.950 
out which would make it a lot easier but
basically<00:06:20.180> what<00:06:20.360> you<00:06:20.389> do<00:06:20.539> you<00:06:20.689> undo<00:06:20.930> that

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
basically what you do you undo that

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.409 
basically what you do you undo that
circlip<00:06:21.500> that's<00:06:21.710> there<00:06:22.009> which<00:06:22.879> I'll<00:06:23.029> just<00:06:23.149> put

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
circlip that's there which I'll just put

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.899 
circlip that's there which I'll just put
into<00:06:23.659> here<00:06:23.990> and<00:06:24.680> you<00:06:24.949> just<00:06:25.009> pop<00:06:25.310> that<00:06:25.339> off<00:06:25.520> with

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
into here and you just pop that off with

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.869 
into here and you just pop that off with
a<00:06:25.939> flathead<00:06:26.750> screwdriver<00:06:27.460> then<00:06:28.460> what<00:06:28.610> you<00:06:28.699> do

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:28.879 
a flathead screwdriver then what you do

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.540 
a flathead screwdriver then what you do
which<00:06:29.599> is<00:06:29.750> a<00:06:29.779> bit<00:06:29.960> tricky<00:06:30.339> it's<00:06:31.339> been<00:06:31.520> a

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
which is a bit tricky it's been a

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.939 
which is a bit tricky it's been a
probably<00:06:32.539> 5-10<00:06:33.199> minutes<00:06:33.500> trying<00:06:33.649> to<00:06:33.740> work<00:06:33.830> it

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:33.949 
probably 5-10 minutes trying to work it

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:38.920 
probably 5-10 minutes trying to work it
out<00:06:34.039> what<00:06:34.909> you<00:06:35.000> do<00:06:35.149> is<00:06:35.330> you<00:06:36.519> you<00:06:37.519> rotate

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
out what you do is you you rotate

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.340 
out what you do is you you rotate
the<00:06:39.610> hub<00:06:40.610> so<00:06:40.910> you<00:06:41.630> just<00:06:41.810> get<00:06:41.930> your<00:06:41.990> hands<00:06:42.139> and

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
the hub so you just get your hands and

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.610 
the hub so you just get your hands and
rotate<00:06:42.650> the<00:06:42.770> hub<00:06:42.949> there<00:06:43.600> and<00:06:44.600> that'll<00:06:45.289> rotate

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
rotate the hub there and that'll rotate

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.840 
rotate the hub there and that'll rotate
the<00:06:45.800> Gator<00:06:45.979> because<00:06:46.220> the<00:06:46.340> Gator<00:06:46.520> can<00:06:46.729> only

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
the Gator because the Gator can only

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.370 
the Gator because the Gator can only
come<00:06:47.120> out<00:06:47.150> in<00:06:47.479> a<00:06:47.570> certain<00:06:47.900> way<00:06:48.020> all<00:06:48.229> eyes

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
come out in a certain way all eyes

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.010 
come out in a certain way all eyes
they'll<00:06:48.560> hit<00:06:48.710> those<00:06:49.360> protruding<00:06:50.360> bolts<00:06:50.810> so

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
they'll hit those protruding bolts so

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.590 
they'll hit those protruding bolts so
what<00:06:51.169> you<00:06:51.229> got<00:06:51.350> to<00:06:51.440> do<00:06:51.590> is<00:06:51.770> just<00:06:51.970> we<00:06:52.970> can<00:06:53.240> just

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
what you got to do is just we can just

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.749 
what you got to do is just we can just
turn<00:06:53.840> the<00:06:54.020> hub<00:06:54.169> slowly<00:06:54.500> and<00:06:54.830> play<00:06:55.520> around<00:06:55.639> with

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 
turn the hub slowly and play around with

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.330 
turn the hub slowly and play around with
the<00:06:55.850> Gator<00:06:56.060> and<00:06:56.300> -<00:06:56.810> it<00:06:56.990> drops<00:06:57.229> downwards<00:06:57.800> it'll

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
the Gator and - it drops downwards it'll

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.730 
the Gator and - it drops downwards it'll
roll<00:06:58.639> off<00:06:58.850> to<00:06:59.240> the<00:06:59.360> right<00:06:59.539> side<00:06:59.840> and<00:07:00.139> then<00:07:00.530> drop

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
roll off to the right side and then drop

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.230 
roll off to the right side and then drop
down<00:07:00.949> and<00:07:01.220> then<00:07:01.340> you<00:07:01.430> can<00:07:01.580> just<00:07:01.729> wiggle<00:07:02.030> it<00:07:02.090> and

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
down and then you can just wiggle it and

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.070 
down and then you can just wiggle it and
it'll<00:07:02.840> drop<00:07:03.139> down<00:07:03.440> in<00:07:04.070> there<00:07:05.020> there's<00:07:06.020> a

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 
it'll drop down in there there's a

took all of them to remove if I were to

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:41.200 
took all of them to remove if I were to
do<00:07:39.259> it<00:07:39.289> again<00:07:39.410> probably<00:07:40.280> take<00:07:40.550> me<00:07:40.669> about<00:07:40.849> 10

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210 
do it again probably take me about 10

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.149 
do it again probably take me about 10
minutes<00:07:41.419> I'd<00:07:41.690> say<00:07:41.720> remove<00:07:42.530> that<00:07:42.710> and<00:07:42.919> then

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:43.159

cleaning all up and putting it back
together<00:07:44.720> again<00:07:44.960> I'd<00:07:45.710> say<00:07:45.889> all<00:07:46.220> around<00:07:46.490> and

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.610

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.610 
probably about to our job so yeah

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.689 
probably about to our job so yeah
hopefully<00:07:50.330> the<00:07:50.979> the<00:07:51.979> left<00:07:52.190> one<00:07:52.400> is<00:07:52.490> a<00:07:52.550> little

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:52.699 
hopefully the the left one is a little

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:55.089

easier<00:07:53.060> but<00:07:53.780> I've<00:07:54.080> heard<00:07:54.409> it's<00:07:54.620> a<00:07:54.710> lot<00:07:54.889> harder

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:55.099 
easier but I've heard it's a lot harder

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:57.520 
easier but I've heard it's a lot harder
so<00:07:55.250> soon<00:07:56.000> find<00:07:56.210> out<00:07:56.419> so<00:07:57.020> I'm<00:07:57.110> just<00:07:57.139> gonna<00:07:57.380> clean

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:57.530 
so soon find out so I'm just gonna clean

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.550
