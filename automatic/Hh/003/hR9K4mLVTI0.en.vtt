00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the implants in but you know on average

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.160 
the implants in but you know on average
it<00:00:58.559> takes<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.010> human<00:00:59.190> body<00:00:59.579> one<00:01:00.359> year<00:01:00.719> for

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
it takes the human body one year for

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.799 
it takes the human body one year for
that<00:01:01.350> bone<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.890> become<00:01:02.250> totally<00:01:02.820> solidified

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
that bone to become totally solidified

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.410 
that bone to become totally solidified
meaning<00:01:04.470> totally<00:01:04.890> healthy<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.790> strong<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
meaning totally healthy and strong and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.929 
meaning totally healthy and strong and
in<00:01:07.320> between<00:01:07.530> down<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.250> don't<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
in between down we just don't know and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.359 
in between down we just don't know and
that's<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> uncertainty<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.189> just

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that's the uncertainty that we just

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.940 
that's the uncertainty that we just
don't<00:01:11.610> cannot<00:01:12.270> control<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.830> my

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
don't cannot control and so for my

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.370 
don't cannot control and so for my
office<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.790> basically<00:01:15.180> say<00:01:15.540> when<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:15.990> put<00:01:16.200> it

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
office we basically say when we put it

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.710
