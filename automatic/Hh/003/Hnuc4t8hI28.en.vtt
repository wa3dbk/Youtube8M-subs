there were some of the challenges with

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the old water softeners well we couldn't

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.060 
the old water softeners well we couldn't
drink<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> water<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.559> high<00:00:52.710> levels<00:00:53.010> of

sodium made the water corrosives we'd go

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.459 
sodium made the water corrosives we'd go
through<00:00:55.559> water<00:00:56.039> heaters<00:00:56.460> more<00:00:56.670> quickly

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
lugging the bags of salt was a real

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
a real problem dumping all the salt into

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.649 
a real problem dumping all the salt into
the<00:01:04.769> effluent<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.580> Calgary<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.299> dumped<00:01:06.540> a

the effluent in Calgary we dumped a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.600 
the effluent in Calgary we dumped a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
hundred million pounds of salt into the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.000 
hundred million pounds of salt into the
effluent<00:01:09.119> annually<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.380> waste<00:01:10.590> over<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
effluent annually and we waste over a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.740 
effluent annually and we waste over a
billion<00:01:11.400> gallons<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.970> water<00:01:12.150> back<00:01:12.479> washing

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
billion gallons of water back washing

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.149 
billion gallons of water back washing
these<00:01:13.049> every<00:01:13.320> 3-4<00:01:13.710> days

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
these every 3-4 days

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.030 
these every 3-4 days
that's<00:01:14.580> annually<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.799> some

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that's annually right and so in some

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.170 
that's annually right and so in some
areas<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.400> North<00:01:17.580> America<00:01:17.939> they've<00:01:18.060> been

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
areas in North America they've been

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.969 
areas in North America they've been
banning<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> salt<00:01:18.810> softeners<00:01:19.200> outright<00:01:19.500> so

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
banning the salt softeners outright so

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710 
banning the salt softeners outright so
then<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.790> guys<00:01:21.030> said<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.299> right<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.600> must

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
then so you guys said all right we must

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.969 
then so you guys said all right we must
we<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.200> come<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.590> better<00:01:22.740> way<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
we have to come up with a better way and

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.770 
we have to come up with a better way and
tell<00:01:23.280> us<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> bit<00:01:23.520> about<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:24.060> well

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
tell us a bit about what you have well

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.440 
tell us a bit about what you have well
we<00:01:24.869> figured<00:01:25.170> out<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.970> vaporize<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.000> water

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
we figured out how to vaporize the water

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.600 
we figured out how to vaporize the water
by<00:01:28.170> running<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.560> through<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.829> vacuum<00:01:29.369> chamber

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
by running it through a vacuum chamber

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.969 
by running it through a vacuum chamber
and<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.450> allows<00:01:30.659> us<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.020> split<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.619> minerals

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
and that allows us to split the minerals

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.310 
and that allows us to split the minerals
away<00:01:32.430> from<00:01:32.640> their<00:01:32.790> carbon<00:01:33.150> dioxide<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.840> then

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
away from their carbon dioxide and then

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.960 
away from their carbon dioxide and then
we<00:01:34.470> grouped<00:01:34.799> them<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> surface<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
we grouped them on the surface of a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.510 
we grouped them on the surface of a
catalyst<00:01:36.530> billions<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.650> times<00:01:37.860> per<00:01:38.009> second

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
catalyst billions of times per second

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.280 
catalyst billions of times per second
and<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.850> release<00:01:39.180> those<00:01:39.450> back<00:01:39.750> into<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.110> water

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and we release those back into the water

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.740 
and we release those back into the water
in<00:01:40.590> suspension<00:01:41.280> once<00:01:41.939> they're<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.210> suspension

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
in suspension once they're in suspension

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.120 
in suspension once they're in suspension
they<00:01:42.930> can't<00:01:43.170> stick<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.500> things<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.040> they

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
they can't stick to things and they

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.350 
they can't stick to things and they
won't<00:01:44.280> interfere<00:01:44.399> with<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> soaps<00:01:45.000> anymore

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
won't interfere with the soaps anymore

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.940 
won't interfere with the soaps anymore
but<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.290> without<00:01:46.470> electricity

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
but we do this without electricity

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.920 
but we do this without electricity
there's<00:01:47.430> no<00:01:47.579> back<00:01:47.790> washing<00:01:48.090> cycle<00:01:48.689> there<00:01:48.840> are

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
there's no back washing cycle there are

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.870 
there's no back washing cycle there are
no<00:01:48.990> chemicals<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.280> can't<00:01:50.520> wear<00:01:50.670> these

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
no chemicals and you can't wear these

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.219 
no chemicals and you can't wear these
units<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.329> they're<00:01:51.570> designed<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.899> last<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
units out they're designed to last the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.780 
units out they're designed to last the
life<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> house<00:01:52.740> does<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.250> affect<00:01:53.640> water

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
life of the house does this affect water

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.450 
life of the house does this affect water
pressure<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> house<00:01:54.799> it's<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:55.979> something

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
pressure in the house it's not something

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.100 
pressure in the house it's not something
that<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.880> would<00:01:57.060> notice<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.719> our<00:01:57.840> reach

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that we would notice but we our reach

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.929 
that we would notice but we our reach
handling<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> water<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.399> would<00:01:59.520> affect<00:01:59.820> it

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
handling the water so it would affect it

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.580 
handling the water so it would affect it
slightly<00:02:00.420> right<00:02:00.659> yeah<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.320> wouldn't

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
slightly right yeah but I wouldn't

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.929 
slightly right yeah but I wouldn't
notice<00:02:01.740> I'm<00:02:02.009> turning<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.399> my<00:02:02.549> tabs<00:02:02.790> and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
notice I'm turning on my tabs and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.730 
notice I'm turning on my tabs and
waiting<00:02:03.270> half<00:02:03.450> an<00:02:03.540> hour<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.869> then<00:02:03.990> would<00:02:04.500> then

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
waiting half an hour so then would then

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.990 
waiting half an hour so then would then
it's<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.340> old<00:02:05.460> ones<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.759> couldn't

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
it's like the old ones you couldn't

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.550 
it's like the old ones you couldn't
drink<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.360> stuff<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.990> one<00:02:07.170> stuff<00:02:07.439> you

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
drink that stuff is this one stuff you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.139 
drink that stuff is this one stuff you
can<00:02:07.710> drink<00:02:07.950> yes<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.550> that's<00:02:08.849> one<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
can drink yes you can that's one of the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.639 
can drink yes you can that's one of the
advantages<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:09.989> don't<00:02:10.170> need<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.440> isolate

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
advantages so we don't need to isolate

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.230 
advantages so we don't need to isolate
lines<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.819> would

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
lines for I would

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.330 
lines for I would

it<00:02:15.840> tell<00:02:16.140> me<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> little<00:02:16.380> bit<00:02:16.500> about<00:02:16.710> how<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> fist

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
it tell me a little bit about how a fist

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.440 
it tell me a little bit about how a fist
must<00:02:17.430> need<00:02:17.610> some<00:02:17.790> sort<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.030> cleaning<00:02:18.210> how<00:02:18.390> do

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
must need some sort of cleaning how do

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.670 
must need some sort of cleaning how do
you<00:02:18.540> clean<00:02:18.720> what<00:02:18.900> he<00:02:18.990> do<00:02:19.110> well<00:02:19.380> there<00:02:19.500> wouldn't

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
you clean what he do well there wouldn't

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.260 
you clean what he do well there wouldn't
be<00:02:19.740> any<00:02:19.890> maintenance<00:02:20.100> if<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.550> water<00:02:20.760> was<00:02:21.000> only

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
be any maintenance if the water was only

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.210 
be any maintenance if the water was only
hard<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:22.140> because<00:02:22.500> there<00:02:22.920> are<00:02:22.950> other

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
hard but because there are other

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.040 
hard but because there are other
contaminants<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.240> water<00:02:24.450> they<00:02:24.750> tarnish

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
contaminants in the water they tarnish

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.010 
contaminants in the water they tarnish
the<00:02:25.320> catalyst<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.130> we<00:02:26.790> clean<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.300> by<00:02:27.510> putting

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
the catalyst so we clean that by putting

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.170 
the catalyst so we clean that by putting
it<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.170> bypass<00:02:28.680> letting<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.700> pressure<00:02:29.880> off

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
it on bypass letting the pressure off

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.220 
it on bypass letting the pressure off
take<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> nabarro<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:33.540> section<00:02:33.990> will

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
take a nabarro and this section will

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.290 
take a nabarro and this section will
tarnish<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.250> we<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.460> little<00:02:35.610> pad<00:02:35.910> we<00:02:36.150> give

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
tarnish so we have a little pad we give

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300 
tarnish so we have a little pad we give
it<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> scrub<00:02:36.780> rinse<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.530> off<00:02:37.650> how<00:02:37.980> long<00:02:38.190> would

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
it a scrub rinse it off how long would

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.980 
it a scrub rinse it off how long would
you<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.490> scrubbing<00:02:38.940> for<00:02:39.120> like<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.630> said<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:39.960> a

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
you be scrubbing for like I said like a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.420 
you be scrubbing for like I said like a
thirty<00:02:40.350> second<00:02:40.710> thing<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:40.980> yeah<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.280> whole

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
thirty second thing or yeah the whole

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.190 
thirty second thing or yeah the whole
procedure<00:02:41.850> would<00:02:42.180> take<00:02:42.360> about<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.660> minute<00:02:42.960> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
procedure would take about a minute and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.740 
procedure would take about a minute and
how<00:02:43.620> often<00:02:43.830> am<00:02:44.040> i<00:02:44.130> doing<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.490> some<00:02:45.300> do<00:02:45.420> once<00:02:45.660> a

then I said it's fine that's it yeah I
know<00:02:49.440> what<00:02:49.920> about<00:02:50.100> cooking<00:02:50.520> does<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.790> affect

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
know what about cooking does that affect

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.700 
know what about cooking does that affect
