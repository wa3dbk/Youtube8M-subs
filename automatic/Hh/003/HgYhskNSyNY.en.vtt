00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hello again, our video tutorials 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:11.849
 today we look at the topic of the clinch 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.910
 continue we consider the options for tricks 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.100
 precisely the struggle already for the corps on the past 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.830
 video tutorial we looked at the neck 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.330
 valka lock and now what is needed 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.340
 do what the most 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.939
 common fairly effective 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.359
 tricks with a mutual grab the case 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.759
 so first we start again, I'll show you all 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.640
 three, that is, the first is scrub. 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:42.960
 that is, we passed immediately take the capture yes 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:45.629
 and in principle there is already a second course room 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.200
 us and we are waiting we have become for the body 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.200
 loin 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.610
 white rather painfully unpleasant it 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.610
 3 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.710
 Now I will show you this girl with 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.549
 problems but now slowly 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.360
 Everything is done, that is, you get the first one. 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:13.720
 1 inside 1 outside to out initially as 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.380
 this is our fight better 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.720
 of course study right away 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.899
 we get away from the enemy he 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.520
 goes over your head yes you are modeling 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.500
 situation like not something you lost portage 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.200
 were not specifically given away as many 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.690
 things for girls for pride and went for 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.429
 the body to him fry immediately that is from 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.920
 of this position when you have two hands 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:39.550
 inside you can do a lot of things 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.819
 as if quite effective and easier for you 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.729
 total rigid body grip ie 1 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:49.000
 scrub just like the video tutorials about 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.840
 nape and the principle is the same substitute 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.330
 leg its right god its left closely 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.360
 again it is a little on itself for fleece and 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.379
 we start to roll itself behind the back sulfur 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.750
 can twist everything on his back 

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:07.090
 it turns out and due to the sharp and on this 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.500
 movements again became 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.250
 times goes looped by possibilities 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.349
 balanced blocked by 2 he 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.640
 scrolls and you can its proximity 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.340
 and the second point is on the waist again 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.470
 stand up and he goes for your head right away 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.569
 send here here an important point bar 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.550
 capture should be the lowest possible 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.090
 there is a loin 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.480
 exactly on the transition to the lower back here 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.760
 so painful but if you break on 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.500
 fracture of the back comes when the back of the lute 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.390
 sound to that backward bend you 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.980
 feel like you have such a loins 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.680
 the fire is this moment for us 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.370
 catch us exactly this point and how would I 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.650
 on the enemy further you give here 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.000
 running out and he from the waist to the river 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.250
 with his body 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.400
 break back then there is such a pain 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.769
 it appears as if your backbone breaks them 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.260
 impossible by the body to hold this force 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.830
 you are tired picked up intercepted 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.829
 a little push and hit down and here's your 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.170
 the task at the end is already for refrain when 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.829
 you do it a little head down 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.989
 and hull on dry land you make him 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.670
 just moved out of you that he's stupid 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:31.190
 the enemy just in a dream let them take 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.190
 intercepted about him towers and lowered 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.109
 himself and he moved his back he broke off 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.930
 all in the literal sense of the body take and 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:44.079
 the last thing we did with the rise is 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.690
 same thing you went in 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.680
 your task as close as possible to the lower back 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.829
 make a seizure 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.500
 then with what will be closer whom it will be easier 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.849
 opponent raise that if you take 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.139
 grip on top of the floor I will not lift 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:05.480
 would eat i take lower yes without principle 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:08.239
 wrestlers deal you legs sit down 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.760
 do a little bit and semi-legged and 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.250
 capture capture on the lower back and 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.560
 then at the expense of legs 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.760
 just lift up when we already raised 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.120
 you 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.210
 one leg in the air when it stands in 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.690
 one foot under the kill it but 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.330
 in order for them to go away head 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:36.770
 head goes to the right to the left and it falls 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:37.780
 clean on the floor once again pickup sowing and he 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.020
 falls to the floor 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:45.770
 goes right to the left very effectively that 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.949
 the same fate i'm pouring my knee thrown down 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.500
 the floor with all it turns out sideways 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.690
 turned and falls from a meter height 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.400
 hard 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:01.099
 sedan and catherine quite common 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.190
 frequently used names in counter clinch 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:08.539
 reception is for the body that is, you 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:11.270
 learn or immediately from mutual to capture 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:14.710
 for the body are fighting for this capture and 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.720
 start to receive or specifically 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.090
 give him a head or model 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.000
 the situation when the enemy left the seizure 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.840
 blockages you go there in the case and already for 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.690
 the corps begin to conduct their receptions 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.720
 on this we will finish the fight before the meeting 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.720
 new video tutorials
