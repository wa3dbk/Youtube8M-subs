Nick on my blog actually I did a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.270 
Nick on my blog actually I did a
turtleneck<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.039> use

turtleneck so you can really use

whatever is in your closet you just want

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.760 
whatever is in your closet you just want
to<00:01:00.570> make<00:01:00.690> sure<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.960> fairly<00:01:01.170> fitted<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
to make sure it's fairly fitted to the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.770 
to make sure it's fairly fitted to the
body<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> next<00:01:02.820> step<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.180> putting<00:01:03.359> on

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
body because the next step is putting on

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.390 
body because the next step is putting on
a<00:01:03.809> belt<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.290> cinch<00:01:04.439> your<00:01:04.589> waist<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:05.040> way<00:01:05.189> it
