here in Nepal there were a lot of issues

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.209 
here in Nepal there were a lot of issues
about<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.230> availability<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.830> electricity

into<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.379> deforestation<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> problem<00:00:44.190> so

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
into that deforestation is a problem so

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.430 
into that deforestation is a problem so
cutting<00:00:44.550> down<00:00:44.760> trees<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.270> burn<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.780> fuel<00:00:46.020> is

cutting down trees to burn for fuel is
also<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> big<00:00:47.070> problem<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> things

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
also a big problem one of the things

when<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:39.630> coming<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.110> looking<00:01:40.350> into

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
when I was coming I was looking into

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.780 
when I was coming I was looking into
ways<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.920> might<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.189> able<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> overcome

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
ways that I might be able to overcome

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.370 
ways that I might be able to overcome
the<00:01:41.970> limited<00:01:42.420> availability<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.049> electricity

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the limited availability of electricity

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.530 
the limited availability of electricity
right<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.430> that's<00:01:44.610> when<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.790> found<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:45.180> voltaic

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
right and that's when I found my voltaic

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.050 
right and that's when I found my voltaic
bag<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.890> basically<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.340> traveling

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
bag so this is basically a traveling

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.420 
bag so this is basically a traveling
solar<00:01:48.450> panel<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.649> form<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.220> laptop

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
solar panel in the form of a laptop

solar panel in the form of a laptop
carrying<00:01:51.030> case<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:52.110> leave<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.829> out<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.070> Sun

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
carrying case so leave it out in the Sun

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.219 
carrying case so leave it out in the Sun
for<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.490> couple<00:01:53.759> hours<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.509> charges<00:01:54.810> up<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
for a couple hours and it charges up and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.389 
for a couple hours and it charges up and
I'm<00:01:55.290> gonna<00:01:55.380> show<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.680> how<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> charge<00:01:56.280> my

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
I'm gonna show you how I charge my

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
I'm gonna show you how I charge my
battery<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> bag<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.869> there's<00:01:58.530> no

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
battery with the bag so there's no

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.499 
battery with the bag so there's no
limited<00:01:59.100> note<00:01:59.340> right<00:01:59.729> now<00:01:59.850> there's<00:02:00.090> tons<00:02:00.270> of

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
limited note right now there's tons of

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.870 
limited note right now there's tons of
sunshine<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.740> there<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.250> very<00:02:02.670> limited

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
sunshine but there is very limited

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.940 
sunshine but there is very limited
electricity<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.170> leave<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.710> during

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
electricity so I leave this out during

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.319 
electricity so I leave this out during
the<00:02:05.040> day<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.430> know<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:05.969> charging

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
the day and you know that it's charging

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.809 
the day and you know that it's charging
because<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.380> lit<00:02:07.950> up<00:02:07.979> read<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
because when it's lit up read on the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.880 
because when it's lit up read on the
handle<00:02:09.209> that's<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.899> sign<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.530> taking

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
handle that's the sign that it's taking

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.320 
handle that's the sign that it's taking
in<00:02:11.009> electrics<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.879> it's<00:02:12.000> charging

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
in electrics you know that it's charging

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.970 
in electrics you know that it's charging
so<00:02:13.170> I'm<00:02:13.290> leaving<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.650> out

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
so I'm leaving this out

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.140 
so I'm leaving this out
during<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.190> day<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.459> then<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.610> come<00:02:14.849> back<00:02:14.879> in

you have your regular battery pack and
this<00:02:20.519> is<00:02:20.700> where<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.000> store<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.480> energy<00:02:21.900> is

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
this is where the store the energy is

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.170 
this is where the store the energy is
stored<00:02:22.349> so<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.040> turned<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.430> button<00:02:23.670> at<00:02:23.819> turn<00:02:24.030> on

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.710 
the power by holding it for a couple
seconds<00:02:25.860> there's<00:02:26.640> four<00:02:26.970> different<00:02:27.000> settings

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
seconds there's four different settings

seconds there's four different settings
here<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.769> know<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.159> this<00:02:29.340> battery<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.760> a

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
here and I know that this battery is a

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.000 
here and I know that this battery is a
seven<00:02:30.269> point<00:02:30.450> two<00:02:30.569> volt<00:02:30.930> battery<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.500> from

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
12 volts 220 volts I'm not quite sure

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.819 
12 volts 220 volts I'm not quite sure
why<00:02:39.510> but<00:02:39.690> that's<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.019> highest<00:02:40.379> setting<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.799> I

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
why but that's the highest setting and I

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.220 
why but that's the highest setting and I
know<00:02:40.890> that's<00:02:41.160> working<00:02:41.310> fine<00:02:41.549> so<00:02:42.200> before<00:02:43.200> I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
know that's working fine so before I

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.600 
know that's working fine so before I
came<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:45.019> bought<00:02:46.019> this<00:02:46.170> car<00:02:46.410> charger<00:02:46.890> because

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
came I bought this car charger because

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.130 
came I bought this car charger because
that's<00:02:47.790> what<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:47.970> needed<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.690> do<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.110> I

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
that's what I needed to do it so I

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.050 
that's what I needed to do it so I
bought<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.379> online<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:50.099> was<00:02:50.220> about<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.700> think

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
bought it online it was about I think

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.839 
bought it online it was about I think
nine<00:02:51.299> dollars<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.109> that's<00:02:52.799> for<00:02:52.980> charging<00:02:53.400> my

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.849 
show me that my battery is actually in
the<00:03:18.090> process<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.569> charging<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.139> then<00:03:19.590> once

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
the process of charging and then once

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.129 
the process of charging and then once
it's<00:03:20.069> full<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.549> goes<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.910> green<00:03:21.120> it's<00:03:21.900> that

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
it's full it goes to green it's that

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.960 
it's full it goes to green it's that
simple<00:03:22.440> now<00:03:23.040> I've<00:03:23.190> also<00:03:23.370> been<00:03:23.579> using<00:03:23.639> the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
simple now I've also been using the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.099 
simple now I've also been using the
electricity<00:03:24.480> in<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.599> house<00:03:24.750> when<00:03:24.959> it's

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
electricity in the house when it's

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.050 
electricity in the house when it's
available<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.310> know<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.639> not<00:03:26.790> reliable

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
available but I know it's not reliable

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.360 
available but I know it's not reliable
and<00:03:27.419> it<00:03:27.660> changes<00:03:28.349> everyday<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.829> terms<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.190> when

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
and it changes everyday in terms of when

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.430 
and it changes everyday in terms of when
the<00:03:29.400> type<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.849> electricity<00:03:30.329> comes<00:03:30.540> on<00:03:30.720> so

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
the type of the electricity comes on so

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.379 
the type of the electricity comes on so
it's<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.829> simple<00:03:32.069> my<00:03:32.790> battery<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.209> now

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
it's that simple my battery is now

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.360 
it's that simple my battery is now
charging<00:03:33.750> it'll<00:03:34.470> charge<00:03:34.709> up<00:03:34.889> this<00:03:35.040> battery

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
charging it'll charge up this battery

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.920 
charging it'll charge up this battery
which<00:03:35.549> gives<00:03:35.790> me<00:03:36.000> something<00:03:36.209> like<00:03:36.510> five<00:03:36.780> or

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
which gives me something like five or

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.319 
which gives me something like five or
six<00:03:37.109> hours<00:03:37.410> worth<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.680> shooting<00:03:38.060> take<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.180> with

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
six hours worth of shooting take it with

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.729 
six hours worth of shooting take it with
me<00:03:39.450> anywhere<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.750> go<00:03:39.930> I've<00:03:40.109> been<00:03:40.230> strapping<00:03:40.650> it

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
me anywhere I go I've been strapping it

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.409 
me anywhere I go I've been strapping it
on<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:40.950> top<00:03:41.099> of<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.280> bus<00:03:41.489> sometimes<00:03:41.760> I'll

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
on the top of the bus sometimes I'll

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.449 
on the top of the bus sometimes I'll
leave<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.959> know<00:03:43.049> just<00:03:43.290> out<00:03:43.349> in<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.530> Sun<00:03:43.769> so

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
leave it you know just out in the Sun so

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.800 
leave it you know just out in the Sun so
when<00:03:44.609> I'm<00:03:44.700> traveling<00:03:45.090> on<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.239> bus<00:03:45.419> you<00:03:45.780> know

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
when I'm traveling on the bus you know

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.809 
when I'm traveling on the bus you know
it's<00:03:46.019> busy<00:03:46.319> charging<00:03:46.769> sometimes<00:03:47.549> during<00:03:47.730> the

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
it's busy charging sometimes during the

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.099 
it's busy charging sometimes during the
day<00:03:47.910> I'm<00:03:48.150> out<00:03:48.269> shooting<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.840> I'll<00:03:48.900> come<00:03:49.079> back

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
day I'm out shooting and I'll come back

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.289 
day I'm out shooting and I'll come back
and<00:03:49.319> I<00:03:49.560> know<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.919> this<00:03:50.069> cell<00:03:50.370> has<00:03:50.790> charged<00:03:51.150> up

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
and I know that this cell has charged up

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.000 
and I know that this cell has charged up
the<00:03:51.389> battery<00:03:51.690> inside<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.290> then<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.440> transfer

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
the battery inside and then I transfer

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:01.039 
the battery inside and then I transfer
so<00:03:55.220> WETA<00:03:57.169> Rita<00:03:58.549> this<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.609> a<00:03:59.730> guita<00:04:00.150> this<00:04:00.629> is<00:04:00.810> one

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
so WETA Rita this is a guita this is one

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.110 
so WETA Rita this is a guita this is one
form<00:04:01.319> of<00:04:01.440> energy<00:04:01.799> that's<00:04:01.950> used<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.280> Nepal<00:04:02.579> but

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
form of energy that's used in Nepal but

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.150 
form of energy that's used in Nepal but
my<00:04:03.269> guess<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.959> world<00:04:04.169> over<00:04:04.590> as<00:04:04.799> solar

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
my guess is that the world over as solar

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.069 
my guess is that the world over as solar
energy<00:04:05.250> becomes<00:04:05.940> cheaper<00:04:06.209> we're<00:04:06.810> gonna<00:04:06.930> be

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
energy becomes cheaper we're gonna be

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.569 
energy becomes cheaper we're gonna be
using<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.470> in<00:04:07.500> lots<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.859> different<00:04:07.919> ways<00:04:08.190> and

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
using it in lots of different ways and

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.729 
using it in lots of different ways and
here<00:04:09.209> in<00:04:09.329> this<00:04:09.450> portable<00:04:09.810> bag<00:04:10.109> to<00:04:10.379> charge<00:04:10.590> my

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
here in this portable bag to charge my

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.770 
here in this portable bag to charge my
video<00:04:11.010> cameras<00:04:11.370> as<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.549> filmmaker<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.480> one<00:04:12.720> of
