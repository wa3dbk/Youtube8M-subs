00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.210 
started to notice that I was feeling a
little<00:01:45.310> bit<00:01:45.550> lightheaded<00:01:46.410> but<00:01:47.410> after<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.010> it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
little bit lightheaded but after that it

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.490 
little bit lightheaded but after that it
was<00:01:48.340> lunchtime<00:01:48.610> for<00:01:49.120> Issa<00:01:49.300> and<00:01:49.540> so<00:01:50.140> we<00:01:50.350> went

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
was lunchtime for Issa and so we went

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.430 
was lunchtime for Issa and so we went
off<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.160> food<00:01:51.580> court<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.150> Rhys<00:01:52.930> had<00:01:53.200> sushi

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
off to the food court and Rhys had sushi

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.680 
off to the food court and Rhys had sushi
and<00:01:53.860> Colin<00:01:54.400> and<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.610> just<00:01:54.880> sat<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.180> watched<00:01:55.420> and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
and Colin and I just sat and watched and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.040 
and Colin and I just sat and watched and
drank<00:01:56.140> our<00:01:56.320> water<00:01:56.759> which<00:01:57.759> was<00:01:57.940> funny<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.509> that

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
drank our water which was funny and that

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.070 
drank our water which was funny and that
we<00:01:59.170> did<00:01:59.350> that<00:01:59.560> because<00:01:59.740> I<00:02:00.670> thought<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.900> worst

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
we did that because I thought the worst

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.200 
we did that because I thought the worst
place<00:02:02.350> I<00:02:02.500> could<00:02:02.650> possibly<00:02:02.979> be<00:02:03.220> when<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:03.490> was<00:02:03.729> on

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
place I could possibly be when I was on

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.760 
place I could possibly be when I was on
a<00:02:04.270> fast<00:02:04.570> would<00:02:04.900> be<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.140> food<00:02:05.320> court<00:02:05.619> but

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
a fast would be the food court but

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.320 
a fast would be the food court but
interestingly<00:02:06.040> enough<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.670> actually<00:02:06.820> didn't

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
interestingly enough it actually didn't

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.969 
interestingly enough it actually didn't
bother<00:02:07.450> me<00:02:07.660> at<00:02:07.750> all<00:02:07.930> although<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.590> have<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.860> say

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
bother me at all although I have to say

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.790 
bother me at all although I have to say
the<00:02:09.280> smells<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.790> food<00:02:10.060> did<00:02:10.330> smell<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.770> much

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
the smells of the food did smell so much

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.870 
the smells of the food did smell so much
more<00:02:13.080> enticing<00:02:14.080> than<00:02:14.410> normal<00:02:14.980> but<00:02:15.430> I've<00:02:15.640> made

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
more enticing than normal but I've made

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.490 
more enticing than normal but I've made
the<00:02:15.970> decision<00:02:16.090> inside<00:02:16.660> myself<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.290> wasn't

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
the decision inside myself that I wasn't

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.590 
the decision inside myself that I wasn't
going<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.920> eat<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.580> was<00:02:18.700> fine<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.330> we<00:02:19.420> left

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
going to eat so it was fine and we left

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.710 
going to eat so it was fine and we left
from<00:02:19.720> there<00:02:19.930> it's<00:02:20.830> now<00:02:22.739> 6<00:02:23.739> o'clock<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.720> I'm

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
from there it's now 6 o'clock and I'm

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.440 
from there it's now 6 o'clock and I'm
pretty<00:02:26.140> hungry<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:27.640> time<00:02:27.940> for<00:02:28.120> Greece's

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.279 
have to say I've really enjoyed today
I'm<00:04:15.219> surprised<00:04:16.090> but<00:04:16.419> once<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.780> got<00:04:16.900> over<00:04:16.959> their

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
I'm surprised but once I got over their

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.099 
I'm surprised but once I got over their
initial<00:04:17.680> kind<00:04:17.829> of<00:04:18.009> hunger<00:04:18.370> pangs<00:04:19.109> which

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
initial kind of hunger pangs which

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.080 
initial kind of hunger pangs which
wasn't<00:04:20.680> even<00:04:20.919> really<00:04:21.130> that<00:04:21.310> intense<00:04:21.699> I<00:04:21.910> just

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
wasn't even really that intense I just

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.689 
wasn't even really that intense I just
stayed<00:04:22.389> focused<00:04:22.419> on<00:04:23.199> everything<00:04:23.889> except<00:04:24.370> my

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
stayed focused on everything except my

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.610 
stayed focused on everything except my
stomach<00:04:25.090> just<00:04:25.360> not<00:04:25.539> listening<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.229> anything

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
stomach just not listening to anything

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.830 
stomach just not listening to anything
that's<00:04:26.889> going<00:04:27.130> on<00:04:27.340> in<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.550> way<00:04:27.849> and<00:04:28.539> so<00:04:28.720> it's

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
that's going on in that way and so it's

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.230 
that's going on in that way and so it's
been<00:04:29.020> very<00:04:29.050> very<00:04:29.470> easy<00:04:29.710> for<00:04:30.070> me<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.910> do<00:04:31.060> this

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
been very very easy for me to to do this

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.029 
been very very easy for me to to do this
a<00:04:31.300> phone<00:04:31.660> so<00:04:31.900> far<00:04:32.139> it's<00:04:32.380> only<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.710> end<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:32.919> day

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.740 
a phone so far it's only the end of day
one<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.610> then<00:04:33.759> I<00:04:33.789> really<00:04:34.060> noticed<00:04:34.419> that<00:04:34.539> I<00:04:34.599> was

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.719 
one and then I really noticed that I was
really<00:04:34.930> smelly<00:04:35.320> like<00:04:35.919> my<00:04:36.099> armpits

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
really smelly like my armpits
