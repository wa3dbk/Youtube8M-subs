00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello I show you today as with only 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.600
 five minutes running 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.970
 with the new press 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.519
 I wish you a lot of fun with that 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.139
 Video 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.929
 Now you have the agony of choice between 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.859
 lots of great designs and also 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.869
 to dye 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.510
 I think there is something for everyone 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.510
 also different lengths 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:34.410
 First, I would like the nails first 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:36.030
 file a bit and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.390
 Of course, in a home too 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.390
 decided 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.510
 on this pack is also behind 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.940
 in three steps how to do it all 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.340
 how she attaches me now 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.019
 the sweet yet variant decided in 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.750
 This park had a few spare parts 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.120
 Stick particles but in principle 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.220
 not the rule out of the pack 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.839
 measures whether the needle trust and set 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.839
 the on the nobility and presses 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.080
 that's how a first one looks like 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.729
 interim result of the whole goes then 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:26.150
 Of course, so on from the store 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:29.960
 Put on and stick to it first 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.509
 hand is already done now wants 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.580
 I like to introduce against variation 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.170
 these are now the impress network too 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.600
 it's back on track like that 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.190
 whole works with one 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.710
 Special feature here you have one more 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:48.080
 cleaning cloth and a small 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.300
 Milly nail file initially bore something similar 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:56.149
 and remove all the debris to mine 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:58.070
 Nails and the glass parts I take 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.080

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.300
 and arrow my rent back into shape 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.600
 Of course, the new main will be here 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.300

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.290
 out of the packaging here again 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.470
 let your size off with the special feature 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.480
 that there is a little film left 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.650
 it is your turn to remove before you 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.650
 you put the ball on 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.630
 the 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.860

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.879
 all do that with water under 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:25.690
 water hand grass or with oil 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.690
