in the words of Norman Borlaug you can't
build<00:03:58.519> a<00:03:58.639> peaceful<00:03:58.849> world<00:03:59.180> on<00:04:00.079> empty<00:04:00.379> stomachs

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
build a peaceful world on empty stomachs

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.390 
build a peaceful world on empty stomachs
and<00:04:00.980> human<00:04:01.639> misery<00:04:02.019> we<00:04:03.019> need<00:04:03.319> a<00:04:03.680> second<00:04:04.189> green

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
and human misery we need a second green

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.690 
and human misery we need a second green
revolution<00:04:04.579> and<00:04:05.530> photosynthesis<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:07.069> one<00:04:07.459> key

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
revolution and photosynthesis is one key

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:19.820 
revolution and photosynthesis is one key
which<00:04:08.359> cannot<00:04:08.750> be<00:04:08.810> left<00:04:09.200> unturned

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.610 

you<00:04:20.830> you<00:04:21.640> mentioned<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:22.470> photosynthesis<00:04:23.470> is

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
you you mentioned that photosynthesis is

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.820 
you you mentioned that photosynthesis is
a<00:04:23.830> process<00:04:24.400> where<00:04:25.170> genetic<00:04:26.170> modification

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
a process where genetic modification

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.880 
a process where genetic modification
could<00:04:26.980> help<00:04:27.250> enhance<00:04:27.990> improve<00:04:28.990> efficiency<00:04:29.710> I

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
could help enhance improve efficiency I

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.350 
could help enhance improve efficiency I
actually<00:04:30.310> it's<00:04:30.610> not<00:04:30.790> just<00:04:31.030> genetic

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
actually it's not just genetic

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.270 
actually it's not just genetic
modification<00:04:31.930> so<00:04:32.350> I'm<00:04:32.860> talking<00:04:33.100> about

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
modification so I'm talking about

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.040 
modification so I'm talking about
natural<00:04:33.970> genetic<00:04:34.180> variation

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
natural genetic variation

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.280 
natural genetic variation
so<00:04:35.530> in<00:04:36.100> all<00:04:36.610> species<00:04:36.910> including<00:04:37.540> humans<00:04:37.810> there

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
so in all species including humans there

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.360 
so in all species including humans there
is<00:04:38.380> variation<00:04:38.650> that's<00:04:39.010> why<00:04:39.130> we<00:04:39.250> look

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
is variation that's why we look

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.610 
is variation that's why we look
different<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.270> can<00:04:40.480> use<00:04:40.780> this<00:04:40.990> variation

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
different and you can use this variation

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.550 
different and you can use this variation
to<00:04:42.190> alter<00:04:42.940> traits<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.360> can<00:04:43.390> breed<00:04:43.750> for<00:04:44.020> it<00:04:44.140> so

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
to alter traits you can breed for it so

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.470 
to alter traits you can breed for it so
it's<00:04:44.710> not<00:04:44.830> just<00:04:44.890> GMOs<00:04:45.460> it's<00:04:45.790> also<00:04:46.000> natural

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
it's not just GMOs it's also natural

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.380 
it's not just GMOs it's also natural
breeding<00:04:46.660> GMOs<00:04:47.440> is<00:04:47.650> also<00:04:47.950> an<00:04:48.100> avenue<00:04:48.460> but<00:04:49.210> we

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
breeding GMOs is also an avenue but we

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.360 
breeding GMOs is also an avenue but we
should<00:04:49.570> use<00:04:49.690> everything<00:04:49.990> we've<00:04:50.230> got<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.710> I'm

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
should use everything we've got and I'm

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.740 
should use everything we've got and I'm
looking<00:04:51.670> at<00:04:51.760> natural<00:04:51.970> variation<00:04:52.630> which<00:04:52.720> is

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
looking at natural variation which is

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.810 
looking at natural variation which is
present<00:04:53.200> in<00:04:53.290> species<00:04:53.710> trying<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.370> find<00:04:54.610> one<00:04:54.790> of

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
present in species trying to find one of

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.940 
present in species trying to find one of
these<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.660> genetic<00:04:56.050> basis<00:04:56.650> for<00:04:56.830> these

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
these the genetic basis for these

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.890 
these the genetic basis for these
differences<00:04:57.460> we<00:04:57.610> see<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:58.000> then<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:58.450> use<00:04:58.690> this

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
differences we see and then to use this

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.200 
differences we see and then to use this
hopefully<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.560> increase<00:05:00.210> photosynthetic

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
hopefully to increase photosynthetic

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.710 
hopefully to increase photosynthetic
outputs<00:05:02.610> isn't<00:05:03.610> photosynthesis<00:05:04.270> already<00:05:04.630> a

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
outputs isn't photosynthesis already a

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.660 
outputs isn't photosynthesis already a
very<00:05:04.990> efficient<00:05:05.530> biological<00:05:06.310> process

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
very efficient biological process

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.670 
very efficient biological process
however<00:05:06.970> can<00:05:07.420> we<00:05:07.540> improve<00:05:07.810> any<00:05:08.230> further<00:05:08.470> on

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
however can we improve any further on

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.590 
however can we improve any further on
nature<00:05:09.040> yeah<00:05:09.430> well<00:05:09.670> that's<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.150> that's<00:05:10.390> that's

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
nature yeah well that's it that's that's

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.340 
nature yeah well that's it that's that's
I<00:05:10.900> like<00:05:11.260> that<00:05:11.440> question<00:05:11.590> um<00:05:11.970> so<00:05:13.020> so<00:05:14.020> lots<00:05:14.260> of

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
I like that question um so so lots of

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.840 
I like that question um so so lots of
people<00:05:14.410> lots<00:05:14.740> of<00:05:14.890> scientists<00:05:15.400> actually<00:05:15.490> said

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
people lots of scientists actually said

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.100 
people lots of scientists actually said
you<00:05:15.940> can't<00:05:16.180> do<00:05:16.300> this<00:05:16.450> because<00:05:16.750> there's<00:05:16.960> been

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
you can't do this because there's been

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.710 
you can't do this because there's been
you<00:05:17.260> know<00:05:17.290> 2<00:05:18.130> 3<00:05:18.430> billion<00:05:18.940> years<00:05:19.090> of<00:05:19.210> evolution

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
you know 2 3 billion years of evolution

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.720 
you know 2 3 billion years of evolution
optimizing<00:05:20.410> this<00:05:20.500> process<00:05:20.920> we<00:05:21.070> surely<00:05:21.370> can't

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
optimizing this process we surely can't

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.580 
optimizing this process we surely can't
improve<00:05:22.030> that<00:05:22.210> but<00:05:22.780> that's<00:05:22.930> not<00:05:23.140> true

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
improve that but that's not true

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.370 
improve that but that's not true
ok<00:05:24.330> agricultural<00:05:25.330> systems<00:05:25.750> are<00:05:25.930> very

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
ok agricultural systems are very

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.500 
ok agricultural systems are very
different<00:05:26.680> from<00:05:27.400> that<00:05:29.580> things<00:05:30.580> compete<00:05:31.000> so

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
different from that things compete so

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.420 
different from that things compete so
their<00:05:32.080> main<00:05:32.380> goal<00:05:32.620> is<00:05:32.890> to<00:05:32.920> produce<00:05:33.160> offspring

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
their main goal is to produce offspring

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.120 
their main goal is to produce offspring
but<00:05:34.180> in<00:05:34.300> agriculture<00:05:34.870> our<00:05:35.050> main<00:05:35.410> goal<00:05:35.620> is<00:05:35.800> that

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
but in agriculture our main goal is that

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.770 
but in agriculture our main goal is that
they<00:05:36.250> produce<00:05:36.400> food<00:05:36.820> so<00:05:37.390> we<00:05:37.480> can<00:05:37.630> actually

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
they produce food so we can actually

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.080 
they produce food so we can actually
make<00:05:38.050> plants<00:05:38.440> more<00:05:38.620> cooperative<00:05:39.250> also

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
make plants more cooperative also

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.490 
make plants more cooperative also
they're<00:05:40.780> living<00:05:41.020> in<00:05:41.110> very<00:05:41.260> stressful

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
they're living in very stressful

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.320 
they're living in very stressful
conditions<00:05:42.130> so<00:05:42.790> it's<00:05:42.970> kind<00:05:43.120> of<00:05:43.180> like<00:05:43.270> a

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
conditions so it's kind of like a

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.860 
conditions so it's kind of like a
Ferrari

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
Ferrari

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.270 
Ferrari
you<00:05:43.990> know<00:05:44.110> Ferraris<00:05:44.350> gonna<00:05:44.800> run<00:05:44.980> very<00:05:45.190> well

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
you know Ferraris gonna run very well

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.640 
you know Ferraris gonna run very well
but<00:05:45.820> it's<00:05:45.940> not<00:05:46.060> gonna<00:05:46.210> do<00:05:46.420> well<00:05:46.810> offroad

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
but it's not gonna do well offroad

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.350 
but it's not gonna do well offroad
so<00:05:47.980> sometimes<00:05:48.370> you<00:05:48.490> need<00:05:48.610> to<00:05:48.700> compromise<00:05:49.030> on

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
so sometimes you need to compromise on

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.210 
so sometimes you need to compromise on
speed<00:05:49.690> so<00:05:50.230> that<00:05:50.350> you<00:05:50.410> can<00:05:50.530> do<00:05:50.650> well<00:05:50.860> in<00:05:50.890> more

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
speed so that you can do well in more

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.220 
speed so that you can do well in more
rough<00:05:51.430> environments<00:05:52.420> like<00:05:52.690> a<00:05:52.720> jeep<00:05:52.960> for

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
rough environments like a jeep for

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.660 
rough environments like a jeep for
example<00:05:53.620> it's<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:54.310> same<00:05:54.520> with

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
example it's the same with

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.420 
example it's the same with
photosynthesis<00:05:55.390> plants<00:05:56.230> that<00:05:56.800> live<00:05:57.220> in<00:05:57.340> the

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
photosynthesis plants that live in the

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.340 
photosynthesis plants that live in the
wild<00:05:57.730> they<00:05:58.030> for<00:05:58.390> example<00:05:58.720> they<00:05:58.900> need<00:05:58.930> to<00:05:59.230> be

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
wild they for example they need to be

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.510 
wild they for example they need to be
able<00:05:59.470> to<00:05:59.680> deal<00:05:59.830> with<00:05:59.980> multiple<00:06:00.130> environments

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
able to deal with multiple environments
