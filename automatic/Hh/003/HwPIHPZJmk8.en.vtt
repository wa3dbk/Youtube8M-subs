and welcome back so we've had a lot of
emails<00:00:47.819> asking<00:00:48.120> about<00:00:48.629> salt<00:00:49.049> and<00:00:49.350> asking

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
emails asking about salt and asking

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.399 
emails asking about salt and asking
about<00:00:50.249> sugar<00:00:50.549> and<00:00:50.909> a<00:00:51.719> lot<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.079> want<00:00:52.289> to

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
about sugar and a lot of you want to

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.949 
about sugar and a lot of you want to
know<00:00:52.579> which<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.059> better<00:00:54.089> or<00:00:54.659> worse<00:00:54.929> for

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:54.959 
know which one is better or worse for

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:55.579 
know which one is better or worse for
you

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
you

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.770 
you
it's<00:00:56.039> actually<00:00:56.549> a<00:00:56.579> complicated<00:00:57.239> answer<00:00:57.420> so

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
it's actually a complicated answer so

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.209 
it's actually a complicated answer so
first<00:00:58.019> let's<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.319> talk<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.709> little<00:00:58.979> bit<00:00:59.190> about

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
first let's just talk a little bit about

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.799 
first let's just talk a little bit about
salt<00:01:00.089> and<00:01:00.329> sugar<00:01:00.690> specifically<00:01:01.969> we<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.269> here

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
salt and sugar specifically we have here

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.350 
salt and sugar specifically we have here
this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> sea<00:01:04.440> salt<00:01:04.470> now<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.610> conventional

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
this is sea salt now your conventional

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.950 
this is sea salt now your conventional
regular<00:01:07.320> table<00:01:07.890> salt<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:09.300> reason<00:01:09.570> why<00:01:09.720> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
regular table salt the reason why that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.350 
regular table salt the reason why that
is<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.320> has<00:01:10.620> worked<00:01:10.980> for<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.400> as<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.180> sea

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
is not has worked for you as the sea

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.960 
is not has worked for you as the sea
salt<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.960> because<00:01:13.230> it's<00:01:13.380> more<00:01:13.620> processed<00:01:14.400> so

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
salt is because it's more processed so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.450 
salt is because it's more processed so
any<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> minerals<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.500> are<00:01:16.560> left<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.160> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
any of the minerals that are left in the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.170 
any of the minerals that are left in the
salt<00:01:18.020> are<00:01:19.100> extracted<00:01:20.100> during<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.790> procedure

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
salt are extracted during the procedure

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.570 
salt are extracted during the procedure
as<00:01:21.780> well<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.470> salt<00:01:22.770> comes<00:01:23.040> from<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.370> mine

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
as well that salt comes from a mine

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.670 
as well that salt comes from a mine
where<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.720> obviously<00:01:25.320> isn't<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.010> sea<00:01:26.790> salt<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
where this obviously isn't a sea salt is

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.230 
where this obviously isn't a sea salt is
extracted<00:01:28.680> from<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> sea<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.400> what<00:01:29.820> happens

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
extracted from the sea and what happens

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.210 
extracted from the sea and what happens
is<00:01:30.480> you<00:01:30.690> get<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.990> nice<00:01:31.200> little<00:01:31.260> gray<00:01:31.830> color

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
is you get this nice little gray color

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.130 
is you get this nice little gray color
that's<00:01:32.700> because<00:01:32.970> there's<00:01:33.210> minerals<00:01:33.720> left<00:01:33.990> in

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that's because there's minerals left in

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.870 
that's because there's minerals left in
it<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.440> there's<00:01:34.650> actually<00:01:34.800> health<00:01:35.280> benefits

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
it so there's actually health benefits

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.710 
it so there's actually health benefits
to<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.780> salt<00:01:37.610> touching<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.700> sugar<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.300> this

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
to the salt touching of sugar now this

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.880 
to the salt touching of sugar now this
is<00:01:39.930> brown<00:01:40.440> sugar<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.360> this<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.510> organic<00:01:42.960> sugar

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
is brown sugar and this is organic sugar

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.860 
is brown sugar and this is organic sugar
so<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.850> difference<00:01:45.210> between<00:01:45.300> your

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
so the difference between your

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.010 
so the difference between your
conventional<00:01:46.830> white<00:01:47.400> sugar<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.120> organic

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
conventional white sugar and organic

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.420 
conventional white sugar and organic
sugar<00:01:49.260> once<00:01:49.560> again<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> way<00:01:50.280> it's

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
sugar once again in the way it's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.080 
sugar once again in the way it's
processed<00:01:51.090> there's<00:01:51.870> a<00:01:51.960> lot<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.400> nutrients

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
processed there's a lot of the nutrients

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.990 
processed there's a lot of the nutrients
extracted<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.230> to<00:01:56.010> give<00:01:56.190> this<00:01:56.490> sugar<00:01:56.820> that

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
extracted and to give this sugar that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.450 
extracted and to give this sugar that
nice<00:01:57.210> white<00:01:57.630> color<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.290> actually<00:01:58.710> bleach<00:01:59.100> as

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
nice white color it's actually bleach as

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
nice white color it's actually bleach as
well<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.750> organic<00:02:00.900> then<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
well if it's not organic then the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.070 
well if it's not organic then the
sugarcane<00:02:02.040> plant<00:02:02.430> itself<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.720> sprayed

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
sugarcane plant itself can be sprayed

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.830 
sugarcane plant itself can be sprayed
with<00:02:04.350> pesticides<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:05.490> soil<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.120> grows<00:02:06.479> in

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
with pesticides the soil that grows in

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.290 
with pesticides the soil that grows in
can<00:02:07.470> contain<00:02:07.920> all<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.280> those<00:02:08.429> chemicals<00:02:08.849> as

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
can contain all of those chemicals as

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.839 
can contain all of those chemicals as
well<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.170> ultimately<00:02:10.920> ends<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.609> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
well and that ultimately ends up in the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.320 
well and that ultimately ends up in the
sugar<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.659> that's<00:02:13.139> why<00:02:13.409> we<00:02:13.739> go

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
sugar so that's why we go

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.610 
sugar so that's why we go
organic<00:02:15.330> Fairtrade<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:15.990> terms<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.350> sugar

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
organic Fairtrade in terms of the sugar

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.370 
organic Fairtrade in terms of the sugar
and<00:02:16.950> sea<00:02:17.760> salt<00:02:17.970> versus<00:02:18.420> conventional<00:02:19.140> salt

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
and sea salt versus conventional salt

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.220 
and sea salt versus conventional salt
which<00:02:19.890> one<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.670> better<00:02:21.030> or<00:02:21.300> worse<00:02:21.510> well

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
which one is is better or worse well

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.980 
which one is is better or worse well
here<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.800> have<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:24.030> about<00:02:24.270> one<00:02:24.660> teaspoon

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
here we have this is about one teaspoon

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.770 
here we have this is about one teaspoon
so<00:02:25.980> here's<00:02:26.190> here's<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.640> teaspoon<00:02:27.120> 1<00:02:27.750> teaspoon

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.630 
of salt and that is about the equivalent
of<00:02:32.430> roughly<00:02:32.880> 2,400<00:02:33.660> milligrams<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:35.250> sodium

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
at the sodium content and see so you

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.850 
at the sodium content and see so you
want<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.850> be<00:03:02.910> careful<00:03:03.300> about<00:03:03.420> how<00:03:04.290> much<00:03:04.500> salts

in<00:03:07.560> about<00:03:07.680> four<00:03:08.130> thousand<00:03:09.120> milligrams<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.810> day

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
in about four thousand milligrams a day

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.199 
in about four thousand milligrams a day
and<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.650> believe<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.250> US<00:03:11.640> it's<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.970> little

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
and I believe in the US it's a little

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.660 
and I believe in the US it's a little
bit<00:03:12.330> higher<00:03:12.540> around<00:03:12.890> 5,000<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.100> lot<00:03:14.550> of

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
bit higher around 5,000 so a lot of

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.809 
bit higher around 5,000 so a lot of
people<00:03:15.030> are<00:03:15.269> taking<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.840> way<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.739> myself<00:03:17.220> so

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
people are taking in way to myself so

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.569 
people are taking in way to myself so
what<00:03:17.970> does<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.150> mean<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.890> are<00:03:20.010> taking<00:03:20.459> in

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
what does that mean if you are taking in

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.270 
what does that mean if you are taking in
too<00:03:20.850> much<00:03:21.120> sodium<00:03:21.540> then<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.680> are<00:03:22.829> having<00:03:23.040> a

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
too much sodium then you are having a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.699 
too much sodium then you are having a
direct<00:03:23.489> effect<00:03:23.940> on<00:03:24.329> your<00:03:24.780> heart<00:03:25.140> too<00:03:25.530> much

going to go more in the direction of

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.010 
going to go more in the direction of
salt<00:05:24.789> because<00:05:25.060> it's<00:05:25.389> important<00:05:25.900> and

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
salt because it's important and

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
electrolyte balance and it is much more

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.339 
electrolyte balance and it is much more
