00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
Rizla miles and it's in here because it

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.410 
Rizla miles and it's in here because it
died<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.030> man<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.750> Friday<00:00:50.030> not<00:00:51.030> too<00:00:51.180> far

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
died on the man on Friday not too far

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.770 
died on the man on Friday not too far
from<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:52.370> we<00:00:53.370> towed<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:56.780> basically

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
from here we towed it in and basically

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.250 
from here we towed it in and basically
what's<00:00:57.960> happening<00:00:58.289> soluz<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.800> fuel<00:00:58.980> pressure

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
what's happening soluz and fuel pressure

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.060 
what's happening soluz and fuel pressure
and<00:01:01.260> at<00:01:01.829> least<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> cylinders<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
and at least one of the cylinders and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.289 
and at least one of the cylinders and
the<00:01:05.070> fuel<00:01:05.280> pump<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.670> freaking<00:01:06.119> out<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the fuel pump is freaking out and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.399 
the fuel pump is freaking out and
pumping<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> filling<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.530> full<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.860> fuel

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
pumping the filling is full of fuel

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.300 
pumping the filling is full of fuel
trying<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.530> keep<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> pressure<00:01:11.040> up

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
trying to keep the pressure up

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.920 
trying to keep the pressure up
so<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.970> flooding<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.390> out<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.570> there's<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
so it's flooding it out and there's a

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.990 
so it's flooding it out and there's a
couple<00:01:16.140> other<00:01:16.320> things<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:17.400> was<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.580> really

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
couple other things there was a really

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.830 
couple other things there was a really
bad<00:01:18.240> vacuum<00:01:18.990> leak<00:01:19.170> which<00:01:19.350> already<00:01:19.710> fixed<00:01:20.100> it

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
bad vacuum leak which already fixed it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.170 
bad vacuum leak which already fixed it
was<00:01:21.840> under<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> cab<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.860> then<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> needs<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
was under the cab and then it needs a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.289 
was under the cab and then it needs a
throttle<00:01:24.750> position<00:01:24.869> sensor<00:01:25.909> which<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.090> this

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
throttle position sensor which on this

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.359 
throttle position sensor which on this
is<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.140> back<00:01:32.420> just<00:01:33.420> thought<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:34.369> by

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
is in the back just thought I think by

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.069 
is in the back just thought I think by
the<00:01:35.430> transmission<00:01:36.439> back<00:01:37.439> there<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.920> think<00:01:39.079> I'll

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
the transmission back there I think I'll

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.359 
the transmission back there I think I'll
have<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> look<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> back<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.250> this

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
have to look it's in the back on this

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.889 
have to look it's in the back on this
one<00:01:43.040> but<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.280> are<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.729> pull<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.420> fuel

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
one but we are going to pull the fuel

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.260 
one but we are going to pull the fuel
injectors<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.770> pulled<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:50.270> spark

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
injectors and see we pulled the spark

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.730 
injectors and see we pulled the spark
plug<00:01:51.450> coils<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:53.930> we<00:01:54.930> got<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.619> get

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
plug coils and we got to do that to get

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.999 
plug coils and we got to do that to get
to<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.579> skills<00:01:56.729> arrow<00:01:57.270> off<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.719> then

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
to the get skills arrow off and then

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.230 
to the get skills arrow off and then
we're<00:01:59.009> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.310> pull<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> fuel<00:01:59.820> injection

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
we're going to pull the fuel injection

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.510 
we're going to pull the fuel injection
rail<00:02:00.509> off<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> fuel<00:02:01.920> injector<00:02:02.310> still

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
rail off with the fuel injector still

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.030 
rail off with the fuel injector still
attached<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.649> we're<00:02:04.740> going<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.890> put

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
attached and then we're going to put

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.119 
attached and then we're going to put
some<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.280> glass<00:02:05.579> jars<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.149> meats<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.649> we're

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
some in glass jars and meats and we're

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.249 
some in glass jars and meats and we're
going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> prime<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> fuel<00:02:08.940> system<00:02:09.149> turn<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
going to prime the fuel system turn the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.949 
going to prime the fuel system turn the
key<00:02:10.379> off<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.890> wait<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.849> that's<00:02:12.510> how<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.720> find

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
key off and wait and that's how you find

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.730 
key off and wait and that's how you find
that<00:02:13.140> which<00:02:13.349> you're<00:02:13.560> in

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
that which you're in

injection test but we know it's leaking
because<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:25.800> know<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.070> losing<00:02:26.280> field

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
because we know it's losing field
