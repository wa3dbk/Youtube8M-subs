00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.920 
going to plant all the fall crop now
that<00:02:06.430> would<00:02:06.610> include<00:02:06.939> all<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.420> cabbage

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
that would include all the cabbage

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.400 
that would include all the cabbage
family<00:02:08.439> we<00:02:08.590> need<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.890> start<00:02:09.189> those<00:02:09.399> right<00:02:09.670> now

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
family we need to start those right now

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.560 
family we need to start those right now
and<00:02:10.590> we've<00:02:10.800> started<00:02:11.100> my<00:02:11.430> seeds<00:02:11.760> out<00:02:12.210> of<00:02:12.240> doors

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
and we've started my seeds out of doors

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.690 
and we've started my seeds out of doors
and<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.770> think<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.040> all<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> different

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
and just think of all the different

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.330 
and just think of all the different
colored<00:02:15.090> cabbages<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.900> have<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.410> then<00:02:17.130> we

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
colored cabbages you have and then we

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.960 
colored cabbages you have and then we
have<00:02:17.550> broccoli<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.360> cauliflower<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.970> that

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
have broccoli and cauliflower and that

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.400 
have broccoli and cauliflower and that
whole<00:02:21.150> family<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:21.780> go<00:02:21.960> in<00:02:22.140> now

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
whole family can go in now

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.100 
whole family can go in now
and<00:02:22.860> as<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.670> sprouts<00:02:24.030> then<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.570> move<00:02:24.810> them

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and as it sprouts then you move them

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.280 
and as it sprouts then you move them
into<00:02:25.440> individual<00:02:26.220> squares<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:27.030> your<00:02:27.840> that's

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
into individual squares and your that's

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.480 
into individual squares and your that's
all<00:02:28.530> there<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:29.010> do

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
all there is to do

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.730 
all there is to do
there's<00:02:29.700> no<00:02:29.880> pots<00:02:30.210> there's<00:02:30.660> no<00:02:30.810> potty<00:02:31.140> enough

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
there's no pots there's no potty enough

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.680 
there's no pots there's no potty enough
there's<00:02:32.340> no<00:02:32.490> carrying<00:02:33.030> them<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.300> we<00:02:33.510> don't

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
there's no carrying them in we don't

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.630 
there's no carrying them in we don't
have<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.900> harden<00:02:34.260> them<00:02:34.440> because<00:02:34.800> nature's

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
have to harden them because nature's

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.060 
have to harden them because nature's
going<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.000> gradually<00:02:36.510> get<00:02:36.780> cooler<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.560> that's

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
going to gradually get cooler and that's

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.950 
going to gradually get cooler and that's
the<00:02:38.340> hardening<00:02:38.790> process<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.780> they<00:02:39.900> do

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
the hardening process that they do

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.770 
the hardening process that they do
exactly<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.130> plant<00:02:41.550> as<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:42.000> grows<00:02:42.210> it's<00:02:42.600> just

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
exactly the plant as it grows it's just

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.050 
exactly the plant as it grows it's just
gonna<00:02:43.020> acclimate<00:02:43.740> itself<00:02:44.100> or<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.700> current

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
gonna acclimate itself or the current

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.600 
gonna acclimate itself or the current
temperature<00:02:45.570> as<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.780> gets<00:02:46.260> cooler<00:02:46.470> right<00:02:46.860> why

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
temperature as it gets cooler right why

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.210 
temperature as it gets cooler right why
do<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.910> think<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.450> people<00:02:49.230> kind<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.620> cut

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
do you think that people kind of cut

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.490 
do you think that people kind of cut
their<00:02:50.580> growing<00:02:50.850> season<00:02:51.030> off<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.870> live

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
their growing season off because I live

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.200 
their growing season off because I live
in<00:02:52.530> New<00:02:52.770> England<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.400> have<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.580> much<00:02:53.910> shorter

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
in New England I have a much shorter

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.900 
in New England I have a much shorter
growing<00:02:54.600> season<00:02:54.780> than<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.860> lot<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.340> people<00:02:56.760> in

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
growing season than a lot of people in

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.050 
growing season than a lot of people in
the<00:02:57.000> country<00:02:57.210> and<00:02:57.800> a<00:02:58.800> lot<00:02:59.460> of<00:02:59.580> people<00:02:59.820> just

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
the country and a lot of people just

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.420 
the country and a lot of people just
kind<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.510> stop<00:03:00.840> after<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.380> August<00:03:01.740> harvest

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
kind of stop after the August harvest

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.300 
kind of stop after the August harvest
well<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.270> comes<00:03:03.570> from<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:04.470> old<00:03:04.620> method<00:03:05.190> of

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
well it comes from the old method of

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.370 
well it comes from the old method of
gardening<00:03:05.790> single<00:03:06.240> rows<00:03:06.480> they're<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.140> tired

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
gardening single rows they're so tired

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.590 
gardening single rows they're so tired
of<00:03:07.650> weeding<00:03:08.340> they're<00:03:08.520> single<00:03:08.880> row<00:03:09.030> gardening

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
of weeding they're single row gardening

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.420 
of weeding they're single row gardening

that they've given up and said well

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.430 
that they've given up and said well
maybe<00:03:11.700> next<00:03:11.970> year<00:03:12.270> right<00:03:12.780> one<00:03:13.080> quick<00:03:13.290> question

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
maybe next year right one quick question

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.330 
maybe next year right one quick question
when<00:03:14.370> we're<00:03:15.230> starting<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.500> seeds<00:03:16.740> in<00:03:17.280> the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
when we're starting the seeds in the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.610 
when we're starting the seeds in the
squares<00:03:18.030> grows<00:03:18.360> are<00:03:18.540> we<00:03:18.720> adding<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.230> scoop

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
squares grows are we adding that scoop

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.440 
squares grows are we adding that scoop
of<00:03:19.890> compost<00:03:20.460> as<00:03:20.670> well<00:03:20.700> yes

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
of compost as well yes

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.960 
of compost as well yes
every<00:03:21.810> time<00:03:22.080> you<00:03:22.260> replant<00:03:22.740> a<00:03:23.040> square<00:03:23.370> foot<00:03:23.640> you

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
every time you replant a square foot you

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.120 
every time you replant a square foot you
add<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.420> compost<00:03:24.960> to<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.890> just

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
add the compost to it and that just

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.400 
add the compost to it and that just
keeps<00:03:26.370> enriching<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.150> now<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:28.020> you<00:03:28.050> miss<00:03:28.380> one

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
keeps enriching it now if you miss one

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.080 
keeps enriching it now if you miss one
once<00:03:28.920> or<00:03:29.070> well<00:03:29.220> it's<00:03:29.460> not<00:03:29.610> gonna<00:03:29.790> make<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> big

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
once or well it's not gonna make a big

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.840 
once or well it's not gonna make a big
difference<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.840> compost<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.800> basically<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
difference and compost is basically the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.910 
difference and compost is basically the
fertilizer<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.840> we<00:03:33.960> use<00:03:34.170> that's<00:03:34.470> what<00:03:34.770> is

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
fertilizer that we use that's what is

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.950 
fertilizer that we use that's what is
going<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.430> feed<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.970> plants<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.600> give<00:03:36.840> us

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
going to feed the plants and give us

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.630 
going to feed the plants and give us
those<00:03:37.490> amazing<00:03:38.490> green<00:03:39.080> rich<00:03:40.459> nutrient<00:03:41.459> rich
