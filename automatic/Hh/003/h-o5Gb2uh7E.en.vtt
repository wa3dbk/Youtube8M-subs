00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
8 and this is a position without major

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.950 
8 and this is a position without major
weaknesses<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.070> black<00:01:14.570> but<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.780> quite

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
weaknesses for black but it's quite

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.100 
weaknesses for black but it's quite
passive<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.909> white<00:01:17.909> could<00:01:18.210> continue<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> put

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
passive and white could continue to put

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.929 
passive and white could continue to put
pressure<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> move<00:01:20.040> f4<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:22.759> this<00:01:23.759> is

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
pressure with the move f4 and this is

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.940 
pressure with the move f4 and this is
probably<00:01:24.360> something<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.900> black<00:01:25.439> was<00:01:25.619> afraid

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
probably something that black was afraid

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850 
probably something that black was afraid
fail<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:26.939> she<00:01:27.479> didn't<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.470> kind<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
fail or she didn't like this kind of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.620 
fail or she didn't like this kind of
position<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:30.720> instead<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.700> she<00:01:32.700> defended

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
position so instead of that she defended

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.660 
position so instead of that she defended
the<00:01:34.049> pawn<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.650> h6<00:01:35.130> indirectly<00:01:35.880> by<00:01:36.509> taking<00:01:37.670> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the pawn on h6 indirectly by taking the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.530 
the pawn on h6 indirectly by taking the
rukon<00:01:38.939> e5

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
rukon e5

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.940 
rukon e5
and<00:01:41.730> now<00:01:42.730> if<00:01:43.300> white<00:01:43.660> takes<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:44.080> pollen<00:01:44.860> age

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
and now if white takes the pollen age

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.720 
and now if white takes the pollen age
six<00:01:45.250> black<00:01:45.790> will<00:01:45.970> simply<00:01:46.410> take<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:48.040> one<00:01:48.190> on<00:01:48.220> e5

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
six black will simply take the one on e5

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.380 
six black will simply take the one on e5
and<00:01:49.230> this<00:01:50.230> position<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:50.800> okay<00:01:51.100> for<00:01:51.130> black<00:01:51.520> so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
and this position is okay for black so

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
and this position is okay for black so
that<00:01:53.290> was<00:01:53.470> her<00:01:53.620> idea<00:01:53.770> but<00:01:54.660> by<00:01:55.660> playing<00:01:55.960> rookie

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
that was her idea but by playing rookie

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.080 
that was her idea but by playing rookie
five<00:01:56.590> shows<00:01:56.830> change<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.400> character<00:01:57.820> of<00:01:57.850> the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
five shows change the character of the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.500 
five shows change the character of the
position<00:01:59.610> because<00:02:00.610> now<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:02.500> turns<00:02:02.770> out<00:02:02.979> that

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
position because now it turns out that

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.040 
position because now it turns out that
this<00:02:04.510> pawn<00:02:04.780> on<00:02:04.930> d5<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.900> be<00:02:08.020> a

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
this pawn on d5 is going to be a

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.640 
this pawn on d5 is going to be a
headache<00:02:08.320> for<00:02:08.679> black<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:10.540> D<00:02:10.780> file<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.200> open

headache for black the D file is open

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.100 
headache for black the D file is open
and<00:02:11.920> after<00:02:12.280> Bishop<00:02:12.430> b3<00:02:12.820> there<00:02:13.600> is<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> pin<00:02:14.080> on

and after Bishop b3 there is a pin on

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.590 
and after Bishop b3 there is a pin on
the<00:02:14.380> spot<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:17.080> black<00:02:17.670> will<00:02:18.670> be<00:02:18.700> obliged<00:02:19.300> to

protect the spawn with all his pieces

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.830 
protect the spawn with all his pieces
and<00:02:24.060> white<00:02:25.060> now<00:02:25.270> play<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.690> nice

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
soon as black gets a good counter play

has to play Bishop c6 now we reach a

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.990 
has to play Bishop c6 now we reach a
very<00:02:51.840> instructive<00:02:52.840> movement<00:02:53.760> because<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.880> is

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
very instructive movement because it is

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.460 
very instructive movement because it is
clear<00:02:55.209> that<00:02:55.239> white<00:02:55.570> has<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.840> strong<00:02:56.230> pressure

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
clear that white has a strong pressure

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.039 
clear that white has a strong pressure
on<00:02:56.890> d5<00:02:58.769> but<00:02:59.790> there<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:00.820> an<00:03:01.239> important<00:03:01.660> question

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
on d5 but there is an important question

on d5 but there is an important question

fortunately<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.660> answer<00:03:07.960> this<00:03:08.170> question<00:03:08.710> we

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
fortunately to answer this question we

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.940 
fortunately to answer this question we
don't<00:03:09.160> have<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.550> invent<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:10.030> wheel<00:03:10.950> because

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
don't have to invent the wheel because

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.570 
don't have to invent the wheel because
just<00:03:12.460> theory<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:13.510> practice<00:03:14.220> tells<00:03:15.220> us<00:03:15.400> that

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
just theory and practice tells us that

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.790 
just theory and practice tells us that
the<00:03:15.760> best<00:03:15.940> solution<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.630> such<00:03:16.840> cases<00:03:17.110> is<00:03:17.530> to

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
the best solution in such cases is to

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.170 
the best solution in such cases is to
look<00:03:17.920> for<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.520> second<00:03:18.910> weakness<00:03:20.460> and<00:03:21.460> invites

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
look for the second weakness and invites

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.170 
look for the second weakness and invites
position<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:23.230> court<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.680> first<00:03:24.160> weaknesses<00:03:24.670> d5

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.140 
position of court of first weaknesses d5
and<00:03:25.800> what<00:03:26.800> do<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.010> think<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:27.520> second

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
and what do you think is the second

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.060 
and what do you think is the second
weakness<00:03:29.970> well<00:03:30.970> if<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.240> look<00:03:31.390> more<00:03:31.780> closely

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
weakness well if you look more closely

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.220 
weakness well if you look more closely
you<00:03:33.070> will<00:03:33.100> notice<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:33.880> white<00:03:34.570> has<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.810> pawn

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
you will notice that white has a pawn

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.580 
you will notice that white has a pawn
majority<00:03:35.410> on<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.040> King<00:03:36.640> side<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.530> there<00:03:38.530> are

blacks king like f6 age 6 and so on so

the game he will need to combine the

Chinese Grand Master gives us a great
practical<00:04:05.260> example<00:04:05.890> of<00:04:05.980> how<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.220> do<00:04:06.490> that

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
practical example of how to do that

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.040 
practical example of how to do that
first<00:04:08.020> she<00:04:08.200> plays<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.800> quiet<00:04:09.540> but<00:04:10.540> powerful

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
first she plays a quiet but powerful

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.550 
first she plays a quiet but powerful
move<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.470> 3<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:12.840> we<00:04:13.840> can<00:04:14.020> see<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.230> she's

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
move a 3 and we can see that she's

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.760 
move a 3 and we can see that she's
planning<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:14.950> maneuver<00:04:15.490> for<00:04:15.670> Bishop<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:17.320> the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
attacking potential black plays a 5 and

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.360 
attacking potential black plays a 5 and
after<00:04:27.730> Bishop<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:28.210> 2<00:04:28.270> there<00:04:28.450> is<00:04:28.720> another

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
after Bishop a 2 there is another

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.340 
after Bishop a 2 there is another

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
potential threat for black which is

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.610 
potential threat for black which is
before<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:33.340> attack<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.420> root<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:34.870> she<00:04:34.930> plays<00:04:35.410> a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
before to attack the root so she plays a

4

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.850

and<00:04:37.750> now<00:04:38.740> white<00:04:39.070> plays<00:04:39.370> another<00:04:39.760> quiet<00:04:40.180> move

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
and now white plays another quiet move

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.560 
and now white plays another quiet move
that<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:42.040> actually<00:04:42.520> a<00:04:42.850> signal<00:04:43.360> for<00:04:43.570> attack

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
that is actually a signal for attack

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.150 
that is actually a signal for attack
white<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:46.750> definitely<00:04:47.230> planning<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.680> push<00:04:47.890> his

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
white is definitely planning to push his

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.030 
white is definitely planning to push his
pieces<00:04:48.460> forward<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.240> he<00:04:49.660> spawns<00:04:49.960> and<00:04:50.290> that's

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
pieces forward and he spawns and that's

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.880 
pieces forward and he spawns and that's
why<00:04:51.220> his<00:04:51.520> king<00:04:51.760> is<00:04:51.910> safer<00:04:52.390> on<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.990> h<00:04:53.260> 2<00:04:53.530> square

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
why his king is safer on the h 2 square

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.130 
why his king is safer on the h 2 square
rather<00:04:54.250> than<00:04:54.580> g1<00:04:56.280> now<00:04:57.280> black<00:04:57.610> is<00:04:58.600> not<00:04:58.810> in<00:04:59.050> a

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
rather than g1 now black is not in a

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.080 
rather than g1 now black is not in a
very<00:05:00.330> great<00:05:01.330> position<00:05:02.400> his<00:05:03.400> pieces<00:05:03.640> are<00:05:03.850> quite

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
very great position his pieces are quite

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.930 
very great position his pieces are quite
passive<00:05:04.600> and<00:05:05.130> again<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.280> problem<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.760> this

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
passive and again the problem is this

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.860 
passive and again the problem is this
weakness<00:05:07.300> on<00:05:07.630> d5<00:05:08.100> but<00:05:09.100> she<00:05:09.490> plays<00:05:09.700> it<00:05:09.730> a<00:05:10.210> move

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
weakness on d5 but she plays it a move

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.260 
weakness on d5 but she plays it a move
that's<00:05:11.080> a<00:05:11.320> sign<00:05:11.560> that<00:05:12.060> she's<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.090> little

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
that's a sign that she's a little

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.940 
that's a sign that she's a little
disoriented<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:15.580> Queen<00:05:15.820> f5<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.680> white<00:05:17.680> will
