John<00:00:00.390> talk<00:00:00.810> about<00:00:01.050> our<00:00:01.829> cognitive<00:00:02.340> health

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
John talk about our cognitive health

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.940 
John talk about our cognitive health
with<00:00:03.720> so<00:00:03.959> much<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.200> our<00:00:04.290> population

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
with so much of our population

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.070 
with so much of our population
population<00:00:05.490> growing<00:00:05.670> older<00:00:06.120> how<00:00:06.750> much<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.020> a

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
population growing older how much of a

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.190 
population growing older how much of a
priority<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.250> maintain<00:00:08.929> that<00:00:09.929> part

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
priority is that to maintain that part

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.799 
priority is that to maintain that part
of<00:00:10.320> our<00:00:10.440> health<00:00:10.650> as<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:10.980> age<00:00:11.360> well<00:00:12.360> Scott<00:00:12.630> it's

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
of our health as we age well Scott it's

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.189 
of our health as we age well Scott it's
interesting<00:00:13.080> because<00:00:13.910> years<00:00:14.910> ago<00:00:15.049> we<00:00:16.049> were

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
interesting because years ago we were

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.490 
interesting because years ago we were
dying<00:00:16.529> sooner<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.480> wasn't<00:00:18.750> quite<00:00:19.289> as

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
dying sooner and this wasn't quite as

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.490 
dying sooner and this wasn't quite as
much<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.740> an<00:00:19.949> issue<00:00:20.160> as<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.939> today<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
much of an issue as it is today and the

health<00:00:59.910> how<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.949> think<00:01:01.949> better<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
health how can I think better in the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.340 
health how can I think better in the
moment<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.750> more<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.450> remember<00:01:06.450> my

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
moment be more in the now remember my

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.240 
moment be more in the now remember my
to-do<00:01:07.890> list<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.610> today<00:01:09.530> know<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:10.799> I'm<00:01:10.920> going

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
to-do list for today know what I'm going

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
to-do list for today know what I'm going
to<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.549> three<00:01:11.909> weeks<00:01:12.150> from<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.869> remember

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to do three weeks from now and remember

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.399 
to do three weeks from now and remember
what<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.470> did<00:01:13.710> three<00:01:14.070> weeks<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> past<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.409> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
what I did three weeks in the past and I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.300 
what I did three weeks in the past and I
think<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:18.080> opportunities<00:01:19.080> there

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
think that there are opportunities there

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
think that there are opportunities there
both<00:01:20.310> scientifically<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> from<00:01:22.320> a

both scientifically and from a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.800 
both scientifically and from a
commercial<00:01:23.070> standpoint<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:24.090> products<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.780> be

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
commercial standpoint if products can be

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.710 
commercial standpoint if products can be
developed<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:26.009> direction<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.420> comes

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
developed that direction when it comes

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.880 
developed that direction when it comes
to<00:01:27.900> cognitive<00:01:28.560> health
