00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 It was April 2, 1998, it was a Friday 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.540
 point was a day that was recorded in my 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.210
 memory forever my parents always 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.400
 they were with me I had gotten used to 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.799
 not being alone almost never since he was a son 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.379
 unique and they did not leave me so much time alone 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.300
 more because he was a boy that day in the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.910
 tomorrow I went to a plaza and found a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.590
 video game store did not have many 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.019
 gameboy cartridges since my dads 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.300
 they never bought me but seeing one that 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.609
 I was at a low price I insisted to my 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.949
 daddy who bought it that afternoon my 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.290
 parents had to go out to 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.630
 a small working meeting the truth 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.850
 is that he was very scared and always 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 I'm just imagine that something will happen to me 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.410
 but on the other hand that way they would not bother me 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.020
 telling me to turn off that thing you already have 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.760
 many hours the night came and it was untied 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.770
 a heavy rain that started me 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.140
 scare not only for that but because the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.899
 light began to twinkle as if it were 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.360
 about to leave a milestone in the end 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.030
 it took me a long time to play was my only way 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.820
 to distract myself and not think about things 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.159
 a game pokemon network I always wanted it already 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.470
 had the blue had a link cable and at 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.960
 next day I would lend the cartridge to 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.000
 my friend so that we would fight for 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.580
 be a cheap cartridge was very good 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.250
 I was also wondering how it is 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.430
 that could be so cheap would be used 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.380
 in that store they have everything I said to myself 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.320
 that did not matter and then I started 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.570
 play the game and the typical animations 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.820
 they were charged I was excited because I did not 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.940
 I knew that pokémons could be in that 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.950
 edition had a game already done I to 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.110
 Sometimes it was very loose and I did not like it 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.759
 play from the beginning I thought that what 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.360
 better the other owner had developed 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.530
 already half and had interesting things 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.080
 I recognize that really in those times 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.970
 I was a newbie in pokemon and I always thought 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.750
 that this edition would have very 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.990
 different 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.800
 I started the game saved the player will 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.940
 called tom appeared in town the band 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.890
 really the music of the band 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.110
 scared and more if it was at night and with 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.990
 this rain so lower the volume and 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.210
 check his status he had three medals and 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.819
 nothing else possessed a pokemon 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.709
 maybe he should have left the others on the pc 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.880
 saved so I went and there was not 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.290
 absolutely nothing look at your pokemon 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.540
 incredibly he had a level of 50 and 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.910
 it was a gen gar what I thought was strange 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.380
 since according to I knew how to play, not what 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.540
 you could get unless you 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.819
 exchange as he may change 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.160
 something and it evolved in their 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.950
 objects did not have anything just a potion and 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.050
 he scopesi and one more fuji object he knew 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.569
 who was fuji the old man who gave you the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.940
 poke flute but what the hell was he doing 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.830
 in my objects I gave him to see if what 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.840
 I could use and I laughed imagined that 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.269
 the old man would come out like a pokemon 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.760
 when I said fuji it can not be 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.220
 used here also when I came back to 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.780
 my objects I found more than 20 and 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.260
 they all had names like 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.560
 trainers girl kid trainer jgr 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.420
 super foolish mechanical player I gave to 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.730
 each one and he told me that you could not 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.640
 to use there the truth I got scared and 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.290
 Then the fucking light went away I was screwed 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.840
 of fear but foolishly I kept playing 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.730
 and when I tried to leave the town the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.430
 band on the route to blue city 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.099
 they had 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.109
 edges that did not let you go I tried 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.090
 going to the route that I was taking where it is is 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.859
 nor the chs and the edges appeared there 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.150
 as well 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:25.060
 I finally wanted to go through the rock tunnel 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.489
 but it was closed everything was stuck 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.889
 in town the band talked to the people and 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.230
 I said help me please come for me 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.120
 I complained of fear in that some noises were 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.950
 they heard in my room and I got into my 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.049
 bed to keep playing 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.420
 I spoke with another person we are all 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.489
 condemned to be here there was more 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.549
 people in town the band that in the 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.319
 blue edition about 7 everyone will go to the 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.109
 hell and I do not want you have come to 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.209
 save us do not enter the tower there is 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.400
 If Mr. Fuji were here, 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.260
 would come the damn exorcists I have a 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.780
 spirit in my era what all the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.969
 people there suspect it was a town 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.060
 no exit and those people were about to 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:05.919
 die I entered the pokemon tower when 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.079
 I went in immediately the animation was used 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.540
 what do you do when you use the escape rope and 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.489
 transport me to another place try 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.099
 turn up the volume and the music of town 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.109
 the band was slow and inverted when 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.420
 walked the screen was deformed as 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.670
 when you use the psychic attack 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.400
 there was a person a spirit 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.050
 completely black with white eyes it 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.240
 approached and told me I come for you 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.830
 exorcist spirit appeared but the 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.010
 spirit was Machiavellian 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.840
 detailed looked like a demon when 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.260
 started instead of sending a pokémon 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.940
 He sent a coach to the train command and 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.220
 I realized that those same names 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.160
 they were the ones that appeared on my list of 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.620
 objects I sent to play the coach 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.810
 it was edited in a demonic way and 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.930
 his attack was not read just said I went in 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.260
 use the screen went black and the 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.370
 Scratch animation was appearing 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.410
 practically he sent several 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.360
 coaches and I was great I was by 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.820
 weaken so use the potion and you 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.890
 He cured a little each time he sent a 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.380
 coach and spent his pivots 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.480
 they filled and kept sending all 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.090
 they had the same attack and level and they were 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.340
 edited demonically when I saw that 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.130
 the little valls supe were no longer filled 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.230
 that would be his last pokemon mingar him 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.810
 there was one of life and the coach that 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.970
 command was Mr. fuji when I checked my 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.050
 list of objects no longer had any 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.699
 coach ni 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.639
 fuck you the only thing I had left 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:33.310
 scopesi and suddenly a sign appeared 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.530
 the scopesi revealed the identity of the ghost 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.750
 Mr. fuji disappeared appeared the 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.150
 exorcist spirit and it lit up like that 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.159
 as if it were a ghosts a shadow that 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.889
 it looked like death with a sickle and very well 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:46.690
 detailed appeared something began to whip 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.360
 the door of my room as if 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.970
 They tried to open it with kicks I got into 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.009
 the sheets and turn off the game treat me 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.560
 to sleep fast and forget all that 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.990
 when I woke up my parents were not 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.150
 still and had a scratch on his back 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.759
 I was full of fear and I did not want to 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.219
 know nothing about that game I never knew what 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.199
 happened with death and my player only 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:10.449
 I can say that things started to happen 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.310
 rare in my house and my parents every time 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.590
 they came out more so I gave the cartridge to 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.629
 my friend and I told him never to play 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.389
 I wanted to keep it and I preferred not to go back 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:21.219
 buy more pokemon cartridges after 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.530
 a few years now I live alone in my 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:26.020
 apartment I have not had the opportunity 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.659
 of playing pokemon could you say that I 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.090
 has stopped liking curiously when 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.070
 I moved to this apartment I found in 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.830
 a box that game and all old 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:38.230
 of the cover were my things and toys 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.440
 childhood once again tried 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.670
 play it happening again the same 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.310
 curiously it was the same at night and with 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.500
 a strong storm arrives again at 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.420
 spirit of the exorcist and when the 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.880
 death then my player went out to 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.310
 battle since I had no more pokemon the 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.080
 battle was over and death said I know 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.810
 that you have played this now that you have more 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.570
 it was impressively said my name 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.790
 rick that childhood fear came back to 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.100
 me a thousand times stronger since it seemed 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.170
 that the game was talking to me 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.030
 spirits are real people who are 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.430
 here and now you follow my gameboy 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.560
 he turned off maybe it was because he had no battery 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.530
 or he was old but the latter 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.720
 days I've been very nervous tired not 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.970
 I was able to sleep I went with a person 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.220
 expert in paranormal and he told me that that 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.260
 thing had a very powerful magic and that 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.600
 if I had already played it twice 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.330
 Care could open doors next 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.070
 where there would not be exits lately 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.620
 very strange things happen in my 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.230
 apartment is going light strange noises 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.940
 since that day I shot my gameboy along with 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.050
 the cartridge and from that day 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.050
 I never saw more crumb I'm going
