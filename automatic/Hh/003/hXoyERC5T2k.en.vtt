00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
personal hotspot I would go into

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.680 
personal hotspot I would go into
settings<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.649> under<00:00:38.430> there<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.660> see

personal hotspot is the third item from
the<00:00:42.270> top<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.920> haven't<00:00:44.219> enabled<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the top but if I haven't enabled it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.430 
the top but if I haven't enabled it
before<00:00:44.910> won't<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.390> there<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.780> would<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
before won't be there I would have to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560 
before won't be there I would have to
instead<00:00:46.860> go<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> general<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:48.180> network

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
instead go to general and then network

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.810 
instead go to general and then network
and<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.530> under<00:00:49.920> network<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.700> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
and then under network I would have to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.750 
and then under network I would have to
turn<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.449> personal<00:00:52.170> hotspot<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.309> turned<00:00:53.610> it

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
turn on personal hotspot if I turned it

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.580 
turn on personal hotspot if I turned it
on<00:00:53.940> right<00:00:54.210> now<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.690> simply<00:00:54.989> switch<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.379> if

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
on right now we just simply switch on if

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
on right now we just simply switch on if
I<00:00:55.920> had<00:00:56.039> never<00:00:56.340> set<00:00:56.730> up<00:00:56.760> personal<00:00:57.149> hotspot

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
I had never set up personal hotspot

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360 
I had never set up personal hotspot
before<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.199> would<00:00:58.620> give<00:00:58.920> me<00:00:58.949> some<00:00:59.190> more

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
before it would give me some more

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.490 
before it would give me some more
options<00:00:59.640> there<00:01:00.210> now<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.320> are<00:01:01.440> two

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
options there now there are two

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.680 
options there now there are two
prerequisites<00:01:02.430> first<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> your<00:01:03.420> mobile

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
prerequisites first is that your mobile

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.539 
prerequisites first is that your mobile
carrier<00:01:03.719> has<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.439> support<00:01:04.769> personal<00:01:05.189> hotspots

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
carrier has to support personal hotspots

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.820 
carrier has to support personal hotspots
many<00:01:06.240> mobile<00:01:06.450> carriers<00:01:06.869> worldwide<00:01:07.020> simply

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
many mobile carriers worldwide simply

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.310 
many mobile carriers worldwide simply
don't<00:01:08.010> offer<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.700> an<00:01:08.880> option<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.780> there's

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
don't offer this as an option so there's

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
don't offer this as an option so there's
no<00:01:10.439> nothing<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.220> no<00:01:11.549> way<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> turn<00:01:11.850> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
no nothing you can do no way to turn it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.969 
no nothing you can do no way to turn it
on<00:01:12.119> if<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:13.020> mobile<00:01:13.229> carrier<00:01:13.260> does<00:01:13.680> support

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
on if your mobile carrier does support

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.740 
on if your mobile carrier does support
it<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> enable<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.420> your

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it then you have to enable it in your

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.810 
it then you have to enable it in your
account<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.770> you'd<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.280> log<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
account so you'd have to go log on to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.520 
account so you'd have to go log on to
your<00:01:17.909> mobile<00:01:18.090> carriers<00:01:18.509> website<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.200> add

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
your mobile carriers website and add

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.980 
your mobile carriers website and add
that<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.220> feature<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.640> your<00:01:20.880> service<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that as a feature of your service or you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.929 
that as a feature of your service or you
may<00:01:22.110> actually<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.770> call<00:01:23.100> them<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.580> add<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
may actually have to call them to add it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.789 
may actually have to call them to add it
now<00:01:24.140> sometimes<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> little<00:01:25.710> more

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
now sometimes this is a little more

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.370 
now sometimes this is a little more
complex<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.640> instance<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:27.060> AT&amp;T<00:01:27.450> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
complex like for instance for AT&amp;T you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.710 
complex like for instance for AT&amp;T you
have<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.680> choose<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.070> data<00:01:29.369> plan<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:30.090> supports

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
have to choose a data plan that supports

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.380 
have to choose a data plan that supports
personal<00:01:31.290> hot<00:01:31.500> spots<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.850> my<00:01:33.180> old

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
personal hot spots so on my old

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.840 
personal hot spots so on my old
unlimited<00:01:34.170> data<00:01:34.320> plan<00:01:34.680> didn't<00:01:35.549> support

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
unlimited data plan didn't support

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.899 
unlimited data plan didn't support
personal<00:01:36.360> hot<00:01:36.509> spots<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.900> had<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> switch<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
personal hot spots I had to switch to a

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.480 
personal hot spots I had to switch to a
three<00:01:38.909> gig<00:01:39.210> per<00:01:39.750> month<00:01:39.990> plan<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:41.220> allows

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
three gig per month plan that allows

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.060 
three gig per month plan that allows
personal<00:01:42.329> hot<00:01:42.509> spots<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.990> pay<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.920> was

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
personal hot spots and pay for that was

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
personal hot spots and pay for that was
actually<00:01:44.189> more<00:01:44.490> expensive<00:01:44.579> than<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
you could surf the web like that so a

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.309 
you could surf the web like that so a
few<00:02:47.400> things<00:02:47.670> about<00:02:47.909> personal<00:02:48.480> hotspots<00:02:48.870> one

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
few things about personal hotspots one

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.750 
few things about personal hotspots one
is<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.620> course<00:02:49.799> to<00:02:50.190> keep<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.430> mind<00:02:50.639> that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
is of course to keep in mind that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.490 
is of course to keep in mind that
usually<00:02:51.269> have<00:02:51.450> bandwidth<00:02:51.870> limits<00:02:52.200> like<00:02:52.349> for

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
usually have bandwidth limits like for

usually have bandwidth limits like for
instance<00:02:52.560> mine<00:02:53.069> eyes<00:02:53.220> at<00:02:53.370> three<00:02:53.609> gig<00:02:53.849> per

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
instance mine eyes at three gig per

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.780 
instance mine eyes at three gig per
month<00:02:54.299> limit<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.680> laptop<00:02:55.950> sometimes

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
month limit and on a laptop sometimes

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.580 
month limit and on a laptop sometimes
it'd<00:02:56.879> be<00:02:56.970> very<00:02:57.030> easy<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.659> suck<00:02:57.900> down<00:02:58.049> bandwidth

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
it'd be very easy to suck down bandwidth

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.160 
it'd be very easy to suck down bandwidth
a<00:02:58.799> lot<00:02:59.250> easier<00:02:59.549> than<00:02:59.760> on<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> small<00:03:00.629> screen<00:03:00.870> on

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
a lot easier than on a small screen on

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.229 
a lot easier than on a small screen on
the<00:03:01.290> iPhone<00:03:01.739> but<00:03:02.340> you're<00:03:02.519> still<00:03:02.730> restricted

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
the iPhone but you're still restricted

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.599 
the iPhone but you're still restricted
by<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.959> speed<00:03:04.409> of<00:03:04.590> your<00:03:04.620> network<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.189> whether

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
by the speed of your network and whether

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.899 
by the speed of your network and whether
it's<00:03:05.879> 3g<00:03:06.420> or<00:03:06.629> 4g<00:03:07.459> it's<00:03:08.459> going<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.700> be<00:03:08.790> pretty

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
it's 3g or 4g it's going to be pretty

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.580 
it's 3g or 4g it's going to be pretty
slow<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.269> trying<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.840> get<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.079> those<00:03:10.230> three

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
slow so trying to get to those three

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.319 
slow so trying to get to those three
gigs<00:03:10.799> per<00:03:10.980> month<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.489> actually<00:03:11.819> kind<00:03:12.269> of

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
gigs per month is actually kind of

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.819 
gigs per month is actually kind of
difficult<00:03:12.840> unless<00:03:13.139> you're<00:03:13.349> an<00:03:13.439> area<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.709> is

difficult unless you're an area that is

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.259

excellent cellular reception and you use

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.020 
excellent cellular reception and you use
it<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.510> lot<00:03:18.780> now<00:03:19.769> keep<00:03:19.949> in<00:03:20.010> mind<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.430> new<00:03:20.579> iPad

some other device in the area another
thing<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.870> worry<00:03:33.989> about<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.349> battery<00:03:34.949> this<00:03:35.519> is

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
thing to worry about is battery this is

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.069 
thing to worry about is battery this is
going<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.819> use<00:03:35.909> a<00:03:35.940> lot<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.239> battery<00:03:36.389> power<00:03:36.569> it's

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
going to use a lot of battery power it's

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.839 
going to use a lot of battery power it's
establishing<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.739> network<00:03:38.010> with<00:03:38.220> your<00:03:38.430> mobile

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
establishing a network with your mobile

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.089 
establishing a network with your mobile
provider<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.810> it's<00:03:40.019> also<00:03:40.230> creating<00:03:40.530> on<00:03:40.739> Wi-Fi

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
provider and it's also creating on Wi-Fi

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.460 
provider and it's also creating on Wi-Fi
network<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:42.629> going<00:03:43.139> to<00:03:43.199> drain<00:03:43.379> your

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
network so it's going to drain your

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.800 
network so it's going to drain your
battery<00:03:43.590> pretty<00:03:43.979> quickly<00:03:44.269> if<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.540> have<00:03:45.690> to

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
battery pretty quickly if you have to

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.270 
battery pretty quickly if you have to
say<00:03:46.229> wait<00:03:46.440> at<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.590> airport<00:03:46.709> for<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.069> while<00:03:47.190> and

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
say wait at the airport for a while and

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.099 
say wait at the airport for a while and
you<00:03:47.370> want<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.609> use<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:47.970> try<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.690> find<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.959> place

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
you want to use this try to find a place

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.349 
you want to use this try to find a place
where<00:03:49.139> you<00:03:49.319> can<00:03:49.409> plug<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.829> your<00:03:49.949> iphone<00:03:50.359> it's

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
where you can plug in your iphone it's

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.309 
where you can plug in your iphone it's
not<00:03:51.449> the<00:03:51.569> kind<00:03:51.659> of<00:03:51.750> thing<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.930> just<00:03:52.109> want<00:03:52.260> to
