00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
would say is right here and then you go

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.190 
would say is right here and then you go
all<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> way<00:01:56.909> over<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.329> right<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.659> that's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
all the way over it right there that's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.810 
all the way over it right there that's
fastest<00:01:58.680> but<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.640> go<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
fastest but you do that you go to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.650 
fastest but you do that you go to
difficulty<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.630> stuff<00:02:08.660> the

difficulty and you do all that stuff the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.760 
difficulty and you do all that stuff the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
shifting you might want so then after

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.280 
shifting you might want so then after
you<00:02:21.030> get<00:02:21.240> all<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.780> set<00:02:22.020> up<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:23.280> oh<00:02:24.290> sorry
