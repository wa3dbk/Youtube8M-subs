bigger<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.500> look<00:00:49.710> bigger<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:51.180> know<00:00:51.300> it's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
bigger or look bigger and you know it's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.060 
bigger or look bigger and you know it's
basically<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.930> almost<00:00:52.470> like<00:00:52.560> a<00:00:52.590> closet

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
basically just almost like a closet

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.200 
basically just almost like a closet
clean<00:00:53.250> now<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.430> know<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.760> makes<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
clean now you know it just makes it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
clean now you know it just makes it
easier<00:00:54.540> for<00:00:54.780> us<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.500> leave<00:00:55.770> room<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.310> our

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
easier for us to leave room in our

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.130 
easier for us to leave room in our
wardrobe<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.090> add<00:00:57.210> more<00:00:57.510> things<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.050> you

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
wardrobe to add more things that you

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.510 
wardrobe to add more things that you
love<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.560> things<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.890> will<00:00:59.040> wear<00:00:59.220> more

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
love and things that you will wear more

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.700 
love and things that you will wear more
of<00:00:59.700> because<00:01:00.090> our<00:01:00.239> style<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.050> least<00:01:01.200> my<00:01:01.350> style

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
of because our style at least my style

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.410 
of because our style at least my style
always<00:01:01.980> keeps<00:01:02.370> growing<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.820> evolving<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
always keeps growing and evolving and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.780 
always keeps growing and evolving and
whatnot<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.140> yeah<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.040> think<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.430> makes<00:01:05.610> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
whatnot so yeah I just think it makes it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
whatnot so yeah I just think it makes it
just<00:01:05.939> easier<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.930> minimalist

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
just easier to have a more minimalist

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.440 
just easier to have a more minimalist
wardrobe<00:01:07.829> and<00:01:08.520> although<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.240> might<00:01:09.420> make

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
wardrobe and although that it might make

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.270 
wardrobe and although that it might make
your<00:01:09.840> wardrobe<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.320> little<00:01:10.380> bit<00:01:10.649> smaller<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
your wardrobe a little bit smaller it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.300 
your wardrobe a little bit smaller it
does<00:01:11.490> make<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> easier<00:01:12.259> to<00:01:13.259> pick<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.130> more

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
does make it easier to pick out more

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.910 
does make it easier to pick out more
outfits<00:01:14.700> because<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.659> ultimately<00:01:16.170> have

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
outfits because you just ultimately have

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
outfits because you just ultimately have
things<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.490> your<00:01:17.520> closet<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.120> you<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.510> that

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
things in your closet that you know that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.090 
things in your closet that you know that
you're<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.870> to<00:01:18.900> wear<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.650> know<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:20.010> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
you're going to wear you know that you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.680 
you're going to wear you know that you
just<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.090> makes<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.479> so

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
just really like and it just makes it so

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.750 
just really like and it just makes it so
much<00:01:21.750> easier<00:01:22.080> believe<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.680> or<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.220> come<00:01:23.670> up

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
much easier believe it or not to come up

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.340 
much easier believe it or not to come up
with<00:01:23.850> outfits<00:01:24.299> especially<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.170> when<00:01:25.290> you

a more minimalistic minimal wardrobe in
my<00:02:04.740> new<00:02:05.040> place<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.610> yeah<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.270> thought<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.540> was

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
my new place so yeah I thought it was

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.700 
my new place so yeah I thought it was
perfect<00:02:06.930> timing<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.200> make<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.439> video

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
perfect timing to make this video

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.770 
perfect timing to make this video
because<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.159> am<00:02:08.280> learning<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.729> lot<00:02:08.939> on<00:02:09.269> this<00:02:09.509> so

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.720 
because I am learning a lot on this so
yeah<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.170> because<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:11.039> are<00:02:11.189> creating<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
yeah just because you are creating a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.850 
yeah just because you are creating a
more<00:02:11.970> minimalist<00:02:12.599> wardrobe<00:02:13.079> doesn't<00:02:13.739> mean

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
more minimalist wardrobe doesn't mean

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.120 
more minimalist wardrobe doesn't mean
that<00:02:14.129> you<00:02:14.340> know<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.519> need<00:02:14.760> like<00:02:15.060> one

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
everything doesn't also mean that you're

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.760 
everything doesn't also mean that you're
going<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:17.660> have<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.840> wardrobe<00:02:18.260> that's<00:02:18.410> plain
