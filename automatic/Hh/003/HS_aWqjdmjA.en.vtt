players<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.200> would<00:02:01.200> assume<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.649> hot<00:02:01.799> fix

is<00:02:02.670> both<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> same<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.450> terms<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:03.990> it

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
is both the same in terms of what it

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.109 
is both the same in terms of what it
covers<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.649> believe<00:02:05.219> there<00:02:05.369> were<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> few<00:02:05.939> other

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
discrepancies there but in terms of what

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.870 
discrepancies there but in terms of what
it<00:02:08.940> what<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:09.929> changes<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.430> coming

just is so is so out of this world that

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.630 
just is so is so out of this world that
it<00:03:48.690> makes<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:48.990> pretty<00:03:49.290> tough<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.950> use<00:03:50.220> just<00:03:50.520> as

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
it makes it pretty tough to use just as

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.940 
it makes it pretty tough to use just as
a<00:03:50.670> single<00:03:51.060> weapon<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.350> great<00:03:52.740> thing

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
a single weapon the the great thing

a single weapon the the great thing
about<00:03:52.980> akimbo<00:03:53.459> was<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.090> didn't

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
about akimbo was is that you didn't

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.340 
about akimbo was is that you didn't
really<00:03:54.480> have<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.870> deal<00:03:55.050> with<00:03:55.080> all<00:03:55.320> that

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
really have to deal with all that

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.170 
really have to deal with all that
stacking<00:03:56.010> recoil<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.610> you<00:03:56.700> could<00:03:56.850> just<00:03:57.030> go

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
stacking recoil and you could just go

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.750 
stacking recoil and you could just go
rock<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.870> roll<00:03:58.080> with<00:03:58.920> your<00:03:59.070> hipfire<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.640> do

rock and roll with your hipfire and do

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.370 
rock and roll with your hipfire and do
do<00:04:00.060> work<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.570> I<00:04:00.630> think<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.900> lot<00:04:01.050> of<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.230> people

do work and I think a lot of the people
I<00:04:01.560> think<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.830> akimbo<00:04:02.400> version<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.690> fmg9

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
I think the akimbo version of the fmg9

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.350 
I think the akimbo version of the fmg9
not<00:04:04.709> necessarily<00:04:05.370> anything<00:04:05.580> inherent<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.270> the

not necessarily anything inherent to the

not necessarily anything inherent to the
fmg9<00:04:06.630> itself<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.470> what<00:04:07.920> made<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.250> gun

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
fmg9 itself is what made the gun

fmg9 itself is what made the gun
overpowered<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:09.000> don't<00:04:09.209> know<00:04:09.330> what<00:04:09.480> they're
