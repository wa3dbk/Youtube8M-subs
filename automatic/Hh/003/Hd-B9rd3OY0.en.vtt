a<00:01:09.810> bit<00:01:09.960> more<00:01:10.080> dark<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.979> I've<00:01:11.640> got<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> quite<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
a bit more dark but I've got a quite a

a bit more dark but I've got a quite a
good<00:01:12.600> feeling<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.049> there<00:01:13.170> might<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.409> bit

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
good feeling that there might be a bit

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.719 
good feeling that there might be a bit
of<00:01:13.650> romance<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:15.090> color<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.659> very<00:01:16.729> as

of romance in it the color is very as
per<00:01:18.030> say<00:01:19.220> simple<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.460> doesn't<00:01:20.759> give<00:01:20.850> too<00:01:21.000> much

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
per say simple it doesn't give too much

[Music]

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.930 

maybe<00:02:05.170> third<00:02:05.409> question<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:05.950> gas<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.520> ending

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
maybe third question is a gas the ending

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.730 
maybe third question is a gas the ending
of<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.150> book<00:02:07.210> without<00:02:07.630> reading<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.350> just

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
of this book without reading it just

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.440 
of this book without reading it just
from<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.039> summary<00:02:09.460> from<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.030> cover<00:02:10.240> of<00:02:10.360> the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
from the summary from the cover of the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.820 
from the summary from the cover of the
book<00:02:10.570> I<00:02:10.720> don't<00:02:10.780> really<00:02:10.990> get<00:02:11.140> much<00:02:11.290> from<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.680> so

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
book I don't really get much from it so

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.730 
book I don't really get much from it so
I<00:02:11.860> think<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.550> ending<00:02:12.970> might<00:02:13.150> be<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.690> girl<00:02:14.380> falls

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
I think the ending might be a girl falls

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.340 
I think the ending might be a girl falls
into<00:02:14.950> castle<00:02:15.820> transporting<00:02:16.630> her<00:02:16.780> world<00:02:16.990> into
