is I've talked to him a little bit along
the<00:03:34.130> way<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.760> some<00:03:35.450> circumstances<00:03:36.290> had

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
the way and some circumstances had

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.590 
the way and some circumstances had
changed<00:03:36.500> in<00:03:36.980> his<00:03:37.100> life<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.640> it<00:03:38.180> took<00:03:38.420> me<00:03:38.450> a

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
changed in his life and it took me a

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.750 
changed in his life and it took me a
year<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:39.080> get<00:03:39.410> him<00:03:39.590> interested<00:03:39.920> but<00:03:40.280> after<00:03:40.610> he

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
year to get him interested but after he

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.330 
year to get him interested but after he
got<00:03:40.910> interested<00:03:41.269> he<00:03:41.870> really<00:03:42.050> took<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.680> ran

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
got interested he really took it and ran

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.800 
got interested he really took it and ran
with<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.090> it's<00:03:44.480> one<00:03:44.600> of<00:03:44.690> those<00:03:44.750> things

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
with it and so it's one of those things

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.009 
with it and so it's one of those things
I<00:03:45.260> think<00:03:45.290> its<00:03:45.620> timing<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.310> people<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.630> think

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
I think its timing to people and I think

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.300 
I think its timing to people and I think
that<00:03:48.200> what<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.380> have<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.800> do<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.070> introduce

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
that what you have to do is introduce

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.880 
that what you have to do is introduce
the<00:03:49.730> information<00:03:50.330> to<00:03:50.420> people<00:03:50.600> ask<00:03:51.080> them<00:03:51.680> if

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
the information to people ask them if

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.979 
the information to people ask them if
you<00:03:52.220> can<00:03:52.400> keep<00:03:52.760> them<00:03:52.940> in<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.150> loop<00:03:53.180> by<00:03:53.750> sending

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
you can keep them in the loop by sending

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.690 
you can keep them in the loop by sending
them<00:03:54.230> some<00:03:54.709> information<00:03:54.890> periodically

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
them some information periodically

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.180 
them some information periodically
because<00:03:56.090> sometimes<00:03:56.780> people<00:03:57.080> want<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.800> see<00:03:57.950> how

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
because sometimes people want to see how

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.290 
because sometimes people want to see how
you're<00:03:58.430> going<00:03:58.580> to<00:03:58.670> do<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:58.850> if<00:03:59.090> you're<00:03:59.209> going

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
you're going to do and if you're going

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.970 
you're going to do and if you're going
to<00:03:59.360> stick<00:03:59.630> with<00:03:59.660> it<00:03:59.900> if<00:04:00.200> they're<00:04:00.709> going<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:00.920> get

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
to stick with it if they're going to get

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.220 
to stick with it if they're going to get
involved<00:04:01.370> or<00:04:01.459> not

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230

this like a business because if people

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.100 
this like a business because if people

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
treat it like a hobby hobbyist cost you

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.960 
treat it like a hobby hobbyist cost you
money<00:04:44.350> but<00:04:44.740> with<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.919> business<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:45.580> can<00:04:45.759> make

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
money but with a business you can make

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.939 
money but with a business you can make
money<00:04:46.180> so<00:04:46.570> I<00:04:46.780> think<00:04:47.080> that<00:04:47.410> you<00:04:47.530> have<00:04:47.740> to

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
money so I think that you have to

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.230 
money so I think that you have to
approach<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.490> with<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.669> fact<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.210> are

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
approach it with the fact that you are

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.150 
approach it with the fact that you are
owning<00:04:49.720> your<00:04:49.930> own<00:04:49.990> business<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:50.830> have<00:04:51.009> to
