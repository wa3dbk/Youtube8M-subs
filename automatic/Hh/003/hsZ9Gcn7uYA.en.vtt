can give different results it's worth

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.050 
can give different results it's worth
doing<00:02:18.710> some<00:02:19.040> low-light<00:02:19.400> tests<00:02:19.820> with<00:02:19.910> your

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
doing some low-light tests with your

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.270 
doing some low-light tests with your
camera<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.570> determine<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.230> highest<00:02:21.410> ISO<00:02:22.010> and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
camera to determine the highest ISO and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.400 
camera to determine the highest ISO and
subsequently<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.270> noisiest<00:02:23.630> picture<00:02:24.080> that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
subsequently the noisiest picture that

subsequently the noisiest picture that
you<00:02:24.530> can<00:02:24.710> tolerate<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:26.120> that's<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.450> for<00:02:26.570> this

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
you can tolerate so that's it for this
