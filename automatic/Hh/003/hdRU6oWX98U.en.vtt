low<00:04:09.040> bad<00:04:09.220> spectrum<00:04:09.730> is<00:04:09.940> some<00:04:10.540> kind<00:04:10.690> of

from<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.040> towers<00:04:15.430> at<00:04:15.670> because<00:04:16.390> it's<00:04:16.600> at<00:04:16.720> a

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
from the towers at because it's at a

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.060 
from the towers at because it's at a
lower<00:04:16.960> frequency<00:04:17.049> and<00:04:17.620> this<00:04:17.710> is<00:04:17.799> something

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
lower frequency and this is something

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.930 
lower frequency and this is something
that's<00:04:18.160> new<00:04:18.370> for<00:04:18.580> us

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
that's new for us

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.340 
that's new for us
and<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.210> the<00:04:19.359> other<00:04:19.390> guys<00:04:19.690> have<00:04:19.900> had<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.140> for<00:04:20.170> a

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
and so the other guys have had it for a

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.530 
and so the other guys have had it for a
long<00:04:20.500> time<00:04:20.739> we're<00:04:21.250> now<00:04:21.400> rapidly<00:04:22.000> rolling<00:04:22.450> it

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
long time we're now rapidly rolling it

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.120 
long time we're now rapidly rolling it
out<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:22.780> what<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:23.020> results<00:04:23.470> in<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:23.860> this<00:04:24.070> is

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
of coverage just in 2015 think about

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.680 
of coverage just in 2015 think about
that<00:04:30.310> we're<00:04:30.730> more<00:04:30.880> than<00:04:31.030> doubling<00:04:31.540> our

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
that we're more than doubling our

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.540 
that we're more than doubling our
footprint<00:04:32.199> and<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.770> it's<00:04:32.919> it<00:04:33.100> makes<00:04:33.370> a

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
footprint and so it's it makes a

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.280 
footprint and so it's it makes a
tremendous<00:04:33.940> difference<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.139> we

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
tremendous difference and and we

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.659 
tremendous difference and and we
announced<00:04:35.470> this<00:04:35.620> morning<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:36.340> we're

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
announced this morning to that we're

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
hitting 290 million pops that's two

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.330 
hitting 290 million pops that's two
hundred<00:04:41.050> million<00:04:41.320> two<00:04:41.889> hundred<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:42.280> ninety

Charlie Oregon yeah you know our our

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.980 
Charlie Oregon yeah you know our our
strategy<00:05:09.760> is<00:05:09.880> pretty<00:05:10.120> simple<00:05:10.419> it's<00:05:10.750> to

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
strategy is pretty simple it's to

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.140 
strategy is pretty simple it's to
position<00:05:11.560> this<00:05:11.710> company<00:05:12.220> in<00:05:12.490> order<00:05:13.030> to

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
position this company in order to

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.390 
position this company in order to
succeed<00:05:13.600> in<00:05:13.900> an<00:05:14.320> environment<00:05:14.830> that's<00:05:14.979> rapidly

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
succeed in an environment that's rapidly

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.980 
succeed in an environment that's rapidly
changing<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:16.060> mean<00:05:16.240> think<00:05:16.419> about<00:05:16.450> it<00:05:16.660> you<00:05:16.870> know

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
changing I mean think about it you know

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.310 
changing I mean think about it you know
the<00:05:17.110> all<00:05:17.860> content<00:05:18.760> of<00:05:18.940> all<00:05:19.150> kinds<00:05:19.690> is<00:05:19.810> landing

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
the all content of all kinds is landing

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.290 
the all content of all kinds is landing
on<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.530> Internet<00:05:20.950> and<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.639> Internet<00:05:22.090> is

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
on the Internet and the Internet is

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.180 
on the Internet and the Internet is
rapidly<00:05:22.780> transitioning<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.710> mobile<00:05:24.039> so

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
rapidly transitioning to mobile so

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.010 
rapidly transitioning to mobile so
there's<00:05:24.370> this<00:05:24.490> great<00:05:24.820> convergence<00:05:25.270> going<00:05:25.840> on

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
there's this great convergence going on

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.510 
there's this great convergence going on
and<00:05:26.229> that's<00:05:26.530> got<00:05:26.800> us<00:05:26.919> looking<00:05:27.190> around<00:05:27.310> going

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
and that's got us looking around going

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.790 
and that's got us looking around going
okay<00:05:27.940> how<00:05:28.120> do<00:05:28.180> we<00:05:28.530> turbocharged<00:05:29.530> this

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
okay how do we turbocharged this

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.860 
okay how do we turbocharged this
strategy<00:05:30.310> of<00:05:30.340> ours<00:05:30.610> because<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.389> strategy

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
strategy of ours because the strategy

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.080 
strategy of ours because the strategy
we've<00:05:32.050> got<00:05:32.320> is<00:05:32.590> working<00:05:33.130> we've<00:05:33.580> got<00:05:33.850> an

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
we've got is working we've got an

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.260 
we've got is working we've got an
uncarrier<00:05:34.870> movement<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.680> strategy<00:05:36.310> a<00:05:36.340> team<00:05:36.940> and

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
uncarrier movement a strategy a team and

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.420 
uncarrier movement a strategy a team and
a<00:05:37.389> brand<00:05:37.750> that<00:05:37.930> are<00:05:38.080> on<00:05:38.169> fire<00:05:38.530> and<00:05:38.830> what<00:05:39.250> that

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
a brand that are on fire and what that

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.950 
a brand that are on fire and what that
does<00:05:39.669> is<00:05:39.820> it<00:05:39.940> gives<00:05:40.030> us<00:05:40.240> lots<00:05:40.450> of<00:05:40.570> options

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
does is it gives us lots of options

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.659 
does is it gives us lots of options
because<00:05:41.320> what<00:05:41.770> we're<00:05:41.950> doing<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.460> really

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
because what we're doing is really

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.969 
because what we're doing is really
working<00:05:43.030> and<00:05:43.360> so<00:05:43.780> what<00:05:43.960> we're<00:05:44.110> looking<00:05:44.470> for<00:05:44.500> if

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
working and so what we're looking for if

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.920 
working and so what we're looking for if
we're<00:05:45.190> looking<00:05:45.340> are<00:05:45.729> things<00:05:46.090> that<00:05:46.210> can<00:05:46.450> turbo

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
we're looking are things that can turbo

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.440 
we're looking are things that can turbo
charge<00:05:47.260> that<00:05:48.010> strategy<00:05:48.490> if<00:05:48.849> there's<00:05:49.389> a

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
charge that strategy if there's a

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.730 
charge that strategy if there's a
partner<00:05:49.840> out<00:05:49.960> there<00:05:49.990> that<00:05:50.289> could<00:05:50.410> bring<00:05:50.620> us

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
partner out there that could bring us

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.770 
partner out there that could bring us
spectrum<00:05:51.430> or<00:05:51.580> other<00:05:51.760> raw<00:05:52.030> ingredients<00:05:52.660> that

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
spectrum or other raw ingredients that

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.390 
spectrum or other raw ingredients that
could<00:05:52.930> take<00:05:53.080> this<00:05:53.289> thing<00:05:53.560> that's<00:05:53.770> working<00:05:54.039> and

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
could take this thing that's working and

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.159 
could take this thing that's working and
position<00:05:55.180> us<00:05:55.300> for<00:05:55.330> where<00:05:55.599> we<00:05:55.720> want<00:05:55.750> to<00:05:55.930> go<00:05:56.020> then

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
position us for where we want to go then

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.350 
position us for where we want to go then
of<00:05:56.260> course<00:05:56.470> we'd<00:05:56.650> be<00:05:56.770> interested<00:05:56.979> so<00:05:57.910> that's

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
of course we'd be interested so that's

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.750 
of course we'd be interested so that's
that's<00:05:58.599> the<00:05:58.840> context<00:05:59.349> that's<00:05:59.470> really<00:05:59.950> good<00:06:00.190> to

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
that's the context that's really good to

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.790 
that's the context that's really good to
have<00:06:00.910> the<00:06:01.210> position<00:06:01.900> of<00:06:02.020> strength<00:06:02.440> and<00:06:02.740> a

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
have the position of strength and a

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.070 
have the position of strength and a
strategy<00:06:03.070> that's<00:06:03.490> working<00:06:04.000> you<00:06:04.419> know<00:06:04.840> when

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
strategy that's working you know when

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.839 
strategy that's working you know when
all<00:06:05.380> this<00:06:05.650> convergence<00:06:06.280> is<00:06:06.430> happening

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
all this convergence is happening
