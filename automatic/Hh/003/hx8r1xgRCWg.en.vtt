00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
on getting my squash out of this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.069 
on getting my squash out of this
here<00:02:01.560> now<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.490> I'm<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:03.079> raking

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
here now you can see I'm just raking

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.719 
here now you can see I'm just raking
this<00:02:04.229> out<00:02:04.439> with<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> fork<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.460> think<00:02:05.640> it's

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
this out with a fork I think it's

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.900 
this out with a fork I think it's
easiest<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.270> do<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> with<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> fork<00:02:07.580> just<00:02:08.580> rake

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
easiest to do it with a fork just rake

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
easiest to do it with a fork just rake
it<00:02:08.940> right<00:02:09.300> against<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.750> skin<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.769> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it right against the skin of that and it

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.540 
it right against the skin of that and it
will<00:02:11.370> come<00:02:11.700> right<00:02:11.730> out<00:02:15.800> all<00:02:16.800> right<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.190> all<00:02:17.220> of

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
will come right out all right so all of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.160 
will come right out all right so all of
my<00:02:17.670> spaghetti<00:02:17.880> squash<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.840> can<00:02:18.989> see

my spaghetti squash this and you can see
it<00:02:19.319> just<00:02:19.620> from<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.160> spaghetti<00:02:20.340> squash

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
it just from one spaghetti squash

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
keep in mind whenever you are using a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.509

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
to find something that's low in sugar

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.170 
to find something that's low in sugar
because<00:03:11.010> if<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.220> look<00:03:11.400> at<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.640> back<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:12.060> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
because if you look at the back of the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.650 
because if you look at the back of the
label<00:03:12.630> on<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.769> lot<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.100> marinara<00:03:14.430> sauces<00:03:15.000> they

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
label on a lot of marinara sauces they

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.210 
label on a lot of marinara sauces they
have<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> lot<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.200> sugar<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.680> sometimes<00:03:17.040> can

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
have a lot of sugar in it sometimes can

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.120 
have a lot of sugar in it sometimes can
even<00:03:17.280> have<00:03:17.639> to<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.840> know<00:03:18.930> 15<00:03:19.350> grams<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.889> sugar

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
even have to you know 15 grams of sugar

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.309 
even have to you know 15 grams of sugar
per<00:03:20.400> half<00:03:20.639> cup<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.569> we<00:03:21.660> really<00:03:21.930> don't<00:03:22.109> need

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
per half cup and we really don't need

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.500 
per half cup and we really don't need
that<00:03:22.560> extra<00:03:22.709> sugar<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.459> there's<00:03:23.609> no<00:03:23.790> reason<00:03:24.209> to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
that extra sugar so there's no reason to

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.240 
that extra sugar so there's no reason to
buy<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> sauce<00:03:25.200> that's<00:03:25.500> got<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.799> in<00:03:25.920> there<00:03:26.100> when

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
buy a sauce that's got it in there when

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.250 
buy a sauce that's got it in there when
it<00:03:26.340> tastes<00:03:26.549> just<00:03:26.639> as<00:03:26.850> good<00:03:26.910> about<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:28.170> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
it tastes just as good about it so the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.900 
it tastes just as good about it so the
next<00:03:28.440> thing<00:03:28.620> I'm<00:03:28.709> adding<00:03:28.859> in<00:03:29.160> is<00:03:29.190> some<00:03:29.639> cheese

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
next thing I'm adding in is some cheese

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.819 
next thing I'm adding in is some cheese
I've<00:03:30.150> got<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:30.359> half<00:03:30.630> cut<00:03:30.930> up<00:03:31.049> I'm<00:03:31.319> using<00:03:31.590> a

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
I've got a half cut up I'm using a

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.559 
I've got a half cut up I'm using a
mixture<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.310> mozzarella<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.000> cheddar<00:03:33.090> so

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
mixture of mozzarella and cheddar so

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.390 
mixture of mozzarella and cheddar so
it's<00:03:33.690> kind<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:33.930> running<00:03:34.049> low<00:03:34.290> on<00:03:34.530> both<00:03:34.709> but<00:03:35.310> you

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
it's kind of running low on both but you

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.069 
it's kind of running low on both but you
