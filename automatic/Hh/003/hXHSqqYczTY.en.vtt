a lot of people spend you know most of
their<00:00:23.900> learning<00:00:24.230> time<00:00:24.439> on<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:24.829> piste<00:00:25.070> they

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
their learning time on the piste they

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.310 
their learning time on the piste they
obviously<00:00:26.029> want<00:00:26.179> to<00:00:26.239> achieve<00:00:26.449> powder<00:00:26.929> skiing

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
obviously want to achieve powder skiing

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.929 
obviously want to achieve powder skiing
but<00:00:27.559> is<00:00:27.890> a<00:00:27.949> little<00:00:28.220> bit<00:00:28.369> of<00:00:28.519> a<00:00:28.609> different

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
but is a little bit of a different

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.849 
but is a little bit of a different
sensation<00:00:29.289> obviously<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:30.410> ground<00:00:30.649> isn't

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
sensation obviously the ground isn't

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.420 
sensation obviously the ground isn't
solid<00:00:32.500> so<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:33.590> have<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.769> be<00:00:33.890> very<00:00:34.160> sensitive

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
solid so you have to be very sensitive

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.939 
solid so you have to be very sensitive
at<00:00:35.150> how<00:00:35.329> you<00:00:35.390> put<00:00:35.720> pressure<00:00:36.050> on<00:00:36.230> those<00:00:36.409> skis<00:00:36.680> on

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
at how you put pressure on those skis on

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.340 
at how you put pressure on those skis on
the<00:00:37.730> piste<00:00:37.970> over<00:00:38.269> there<00:00:38.449> you'll<00:00:38.809> find<00:00:39.140> that

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
the piste over there you'll find that

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.500 
the piste over there you'll find that
people<00:00:39.829> will<00:00:39.949> usually<00:00:40.100> load<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.790> outside<00:00:41.150> ski

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
people will usually load the outside ski

the<00:00:41.750> downhill<00:00:42.140> skier<00:00:42.379> ends<00:00:42.620> up<00:00:42.739> as<00:00:49.000> in<00:00:50.000> powder

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.270 
the downhill skier ends up as in powder
people<00:00:51.290> tend<00:00:51.470> to<00:00:51.500> bring<00:00:51.710> that<00:00:51.830> in<00:00:51.949> here<00:00:51.979> with

people tend to bring that in here with

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.740 
people tend to bring that in here with

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
them without too much thought and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.299 
them without too much thought and
obviously<00:00:54.140> when<00:00:54.290> you<00:00:54.350> do<00:00:54.500> that<00:00:54.680> you're

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
obviously when you do that you're

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:56.649 
obviously when you do that you're
pressing<00:00:55.519> on<00:00:55.699> one<00:00:55.909> side<00:00:56.180> is<00:00:56.330> a<00:00:56.360> bit<00:00:56.540> like

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
pressing on one side is a bit like

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.649 
pressing on one side is a bit like
scales<00:00:57.019> you'll<00:00:57.259> sink<00:00:58.150> so<00:00:59.150> for<00:00:59.330> this<00:00:59.390> type<00:00:59.600> of

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
scales you'll sink so for this type of

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.509 
scales you'll sink so for this type of
snow<00:00:59.989> really<00:01:00.320> do<00:01:00.559> become<00:01:01.189> a<00:01:01.220> bit<00:01:01.400> more

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
snow really do become a bit more

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.219 
snow really do become a bit more

Germany's<00:01:03.949> speaking<00:01:04.400> you're<00:01:04.519> outside<00:01:04.850> skis

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180

should<00:01:08.210> try<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.479> do<00:01:08.689> is<00:01:09.110> try<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.409> moderate<00:01:09.950> it

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159

you<00:01:10.640> wouldn't<00:01:10.880> go<00:01:11.000> fifty-fifty<00:01:11.750> but<00:01:11.780> you'd

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
start to think about things like that to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.870 
start to think about things like that to
