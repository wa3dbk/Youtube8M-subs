00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.660
 Hello, Welcome to YouTube Digital Digging Channel. 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.400
 Today we look at the IS-2 model 1944, both in real life and in War Thunder. 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:24.360
 Like the Tiger and Panther tanks, they were designed in response to Soviet T-34 and KV-1 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.480
 so the IS tank series was a response to the Tigers and Panthers. In other words, the Soviets responded to the Germans reacting to the Soviets. 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.120
 During the development was used as a temporary solution on the battlefield tank KV-85, which while achieving good results 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.160
 but soon it was replaced by the first IS-IS-1. 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.140
 Both of these tanks used a D-5T 85 mm cannon, which was able to break the armor of the Tiger tank over a distance of one kilometer. 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:56.760
 When the D-5T cannon was mounted on T-34/85 tanks, IS-1 designers faced the need to choose a stronger armament. 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:06.340
 It was decided between two weapons - the BS-3 100 mm gun and the 122-mm A-19 gun, and their advantages and disadvantages were carefully considered 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:15.520
 Although the BS-3 achieved excellent penetration values ​​(up to 185 mm versus 160 mm penetration in A-19) 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.480
 the designers chose the A-19, which was able to fire massive three-life projectiles capable of effectively destroying enemy fortifications. 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.460
 Another factor was better availability than BS-3 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:37.580
 and surprisingly solid accuracy comparable to the KwK 43 L / 71 8.8 cm gun mounted on Königstiger tanks. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.120
 The IS-2 original version is easily recognizable thanks to its broken frontal armor 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.620
 he was replaced by a later model of monolithic one with a thickness of 120 mm, placed at an angle of 60 degrees. 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.500
 Other enhancements included an improved D-25T gun for faster charging, and a tower 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.060
 lafetovaný machine gun DŠK caliber 12.7 mm, which could be used as an anti-aircraft gun. 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.060
 Thanks to the effective armor arrangement, the IS-2 was better armored than KV series tanks, lighter and more mobile than the German Tiger and Königstiger heavy tanks. 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.440
 and had a lower ground clearance, making it a smaller target on the battlefield. 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.880
 As far as firepower is concerned, the IS-2 and Tiger tanks were able to eliminate each other at a distance of one kilometer or less. 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.080
 The game is IS-2 model 1944 tank IV. levels with BR 6.7. 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:42.200
 It reaches a maximum speed of 42 km / h in nine seconds on flat terrain, and is equipped with a D-25T cannon of 122 mm. 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.020
 Basic ammunition is able to break 185 mm armor over a distance of 100 meters 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:57.060
 177 mm at a distance of 500 meters and 164 mm at a distance of 1000 meters. The ammunition supply is 28 grenades, and the overcharging time is 24 seconds. 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.340
 Tank has two secondary weapons - coupled machine gun DT caliber 7.62 mm with ammunition supply 1890 rounds 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.340
 and the tower mounted rotary machine gun DŠK caliber 12.7 mm, having a stock of 250 rounds. 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.080
 The side armor is 90 mm thick at the sides, 60 mm at the rear and 30 mm at the top 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.480
 while the bottom faceplate is 100 mm thick and 30 mm thick replacement belt links provide additional protection. 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.560
 The top sheet is 120 mm thick, the tower front is 100 mm thick and the top of the tower is 30 mm thick. 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.700
 The basic camouflage is a standard green color, the possibility is also forest and winter camouflage. 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.580
 You can get these camouflage either for free by playing, or you can buy them for premium currency. 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.880
 But even the base color can serve you well until you add winter maps. 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.240
 I have already said in the past that heavy tanks are not my cup of coffee, but I have tried them recently 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.400
 and I particularly liked the IS series. Their cannons are capable of destroying virtually anything 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.740
 and mobility is a very pleasant advantage compared to German armor. 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.380
 As a somewhat rash player, the combination of massive cannon, solid speed, and good armor has helped many times to get out of trouble. 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.840
 This is a superb long-range blasting tank, and armor allows you to fight short distances 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.720
 however, due to the long charge it is good to have a middle tank colleague in the team to cover you while charging. 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:32.140
 A coaxial machine gun is useful for aiming a cannon, and a 12.7mm machine gun on the tower gives you the chance to defend yourself from enemy aircraft. 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.060
 Overall, it is a good part of the IS line, and paves you the way to IS-3 and IS-4 to V. 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.880
 level. In my opinion, the V level is the space where the IS tanks are in their element, and I hope to visit them soon. 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.940
 Well, that's all for today. I hope you enjoyed the video and if you want to be informed about the latest videos 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.040
 add this channel to subscriptions if you haven't already. I firmly believe I will see you again soon. 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.360
 That is all. Goodbye, have a nice day.
