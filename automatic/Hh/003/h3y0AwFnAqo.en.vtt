refer to as the tingles but they are

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.120 
refer to as the tingles but they are
both<00:02:00.280> used<00:02:00.670> better<00:02:01.090> in<00:02:01.389> the<00:02:01.569> long<00:02:01.780> run<00:02:02.049> now<00:02:02.920> as

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
both used better in the long run now as

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.099 
both used better in the long run now as
far<00:02:03.399> as<00:02:03.609> the<00:02:03.759> other<00:02:03.909> ingredients<00:02:04.539> go<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.899> main

far as the other ingredients go the main
ones<00:02:05.319> I'm<00:02:05.499> going<00:02:05.679> to<00:02:05.740> focus<00:02:05.920> on<00:02:06.249> are<00:02:06.429> both

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
ones I'm going to focus on are both

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.480 
ones I'm going to focus on are both
caffeine<00:02:07.359> and<00:02:07.600> tyrosine<00:02:08.289> so<00:02:08.890> these<00:02:09.130> are<00:02:09.190> both

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
caffeine and tyrosine so these are both

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.820 
caffeine and tyrosine so these are both
