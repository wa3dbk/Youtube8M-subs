00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
on the on the ear begin to dry out so

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.779 
on the on the ear begin to dry out so
these<00:00:27.480> are<00:00:27.630> not<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> be<00:00:28.050> very<00:00:28.170> large

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
these are not going to be very large

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.470 
these are not going to be very large
ears<00:00:29.789> or<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:31.109> lot<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.040> edible<00:00:32.399> material<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.300> here

ears or a lot of edible material on here

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.510 
ears or a lot of edible material on here
but<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.050> does<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> show<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.950> capable<00:00:35.250> of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
but it does a show that is capable of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.590 
but it does a show that is capable of
doing<00:00:35.730> there's<00:00:36.090> some<00:00:36.210> things<00:00:36.390> will<00:00:36.570> change

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
doing there's some things will change

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.100 
doing there's some things will change
when<00:00:37.579> planting<00:00:38.579> again<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.570> particular

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
when planting again in this particular

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.080 
when planting again in this particular
method<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.460> we're<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> go<00:00:42.000> ahead

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
method so we're just going to go ahead

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.520 
method so we're just going to go ahead
and<00:00:42.270> harvest<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.840> see<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.290> here

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and harvest and see what we have here

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.100 
and harvest and see what we have here
and<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.250> we'll<00:00:44.340> throw<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> corn<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
and then we'll throw the corn in the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.430 
and then we'll throw the corn in the
stocks<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> compost<00:00:47.219> pile<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:49.140> we'll<00:00:49.260> just

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
stocks in the compost pile so we'll just

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.049 
stocks in the compost pile so we'll just
pull<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.550> now<00:00:51.300> another<00:00:51.600> way<00:00:52.640> now<00:00:53.640> did<00:00:53.910> get

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
pull this now another way now did get

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.150 
pull this now another way now did get
good<00:00:54.090> pollination<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.590> key<00:00:55.800> here

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
good pollination now that's the key here

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.119 
good pollination now that's the key here
and<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> most<00:00:58.440> part<00:00:58.800> let's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
and you can see for the most part let's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.779 
and you can see for the most part let's
get<00:00:59.430> some<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.820> off<00:01:00.710> all<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.160> here

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
get some of this off all of this here

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.789 
get some of this off all of this here
got<00:01:03.660> very<00:01:03.930> good<00:01:03.989> pollination<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
got very good pollination the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.210 
got very good pollination the
pollination<00:01:05.280> comes<00:01:05.700> from<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.890> top<00:01:07.890> portion

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
pollination comes from the top portion

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.000 
pollination comes from the top portion
here<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.500> things<00:01:10.710> fall<00:01:10.979> off

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
here as the you see things fall off

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.710 
here as the you see things fall off
that's<00:01:11.430> part<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> pollination<00:01:12.270> will<00:01:12.479> fall

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that's part of the pollination will fall

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.100 
that's part of the pollination will fall
down<00:01:12.960> onto<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:14.250> ears<00:01:14.610> here<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.479> tassels<00:01:15.990> will

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
down onto the ears here the tassels will

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.170 
down onto the ears here the tassels will
fall<00:01:16.290> onto<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.220> ears<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.700> each<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.060> these

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
fall onto the ears in each one of these

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.330 
fall onto the ears in each one of these
is<00:01:18.390> connected<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.990> where<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.290> kernel<00:01:19.860> will<00:01:20.070> be

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
is connected to where a kernel will be

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.929 
is connected to where a kernel will be
formed<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.960> did<00:01:22.170> get<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> good<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:23.070> decent

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
formed so we did get a good a decent

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.240 
formed so we did get a good a decent
pollination<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.080> that's<00:01:25.200> why<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:26.100> is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
pollination here and that's why it is

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.890 
pollination here and that's why it is
encouraged<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> grow<00:01:27.119> corn<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.659> block

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
encouraged to grow corn in a block

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.990 
encouraged to grow corn in a block
because<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.680> pollinate<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.820> wind

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
because it can pollinate as the wind

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.880 
because it can pollinate as the wind
blows<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.360> any<00:01:30.570> given<00:01:31.140> direction<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.369> that's

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
blows in any given direction so that's

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.859 
blows in any given direction so that's
not<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.579> know<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:35.909> wonderful<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
not you know not wonderful but it is

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.600 
not you know not wonderful but it is
something<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.409> now<00:01:37.829> also<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.430> take

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
something there now also you can take

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.660 
something there now also you can take
your<00:01:38.759> fingernail<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.530> puncture<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> kernel

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
your fingernail and puncture the kernel

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.740 
your fingernail and puncture the kernel
and<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.420> there's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> little

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and as you can see there's a little

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.569 
and as you can see there's a little
milky<00:01:43.290> substance<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:44.009> come<00:01:44.220> out

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
milky substance that come out

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.340 
milky substance that come out
that's<00:01:44.880> an<00:01:45.000> also<00:01:45.299> an<00:01:45.329> indication<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
that's an also an indication that is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.469 
that's an also an indication that is
ready<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> harvest<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.790> let's<00:01:48.000> see<00:01:48.149> what<00:01:48.299> else

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
ready to harvest so let's see what else

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.139 
ready to harvest so let's see what else
we<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.590> came<00:01:49.799> out<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.939> one

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
we have that came out this one this one

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.149 
we have that came out this one this one
here<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.390> not<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> have<00:01:51.990> any<00:01:52.259> ear

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
here is not going to have any ear

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.630 
here is not going to have any ear
because<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> didn't<00:01:54.000> form<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:55.829> can<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.219> here

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
because it didn't form you can see here

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.170 
because it didn't form you can see here
that<00:01:57.920> it's<00:01:58.920> kind<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.280> what<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.060> can

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
that's that one didn't grow at all so

investigate when it comes to time to

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.559 
investigate when it comes to time to
replant<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.250> out<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.670> 8<00:02:59.819> years<00:02:59.849> of<00:03:00.209> corn

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
replant so out of the 8 years of corn

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.250

show what self air pruning is all about
there's<00:03:16.410> little<00:03:17.190> hairs<00:03:17.519> coming<00:03:18.030> through<00:03:18.389> the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
there's little hairs coming through the

there's little hairs coming through the
outer<00:03:19.530> portions<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.489> bag<00:03:20.760> now<00:03:21.389> let's<00:03:21.810> go

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
outer portions of this bag now let's go

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.050 
outer portions of this bag now let's go
set<00:03:22.139> in<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.290> water<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:23.400> let's<00:03:23.579> see<00:03:23.760> what<00:03:23.940> we

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
set in the water so let's see what we

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:35.659 
set in the water so let's see what we
all<00:03:30.950> right<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.190> what<00:03:32.849> we<00:03:32.970> have<00:03:33.329> is<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:35.220> can<00:03:35.400> see

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
all right so what we have is you can see

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.559 
all right so what we have is you can see
all<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.269> white<00:03:36.450> fibers<00:03:37.049> here<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:38.419> what<00:03:39.419> has

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
all the white fibers here and what has

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.240 
all the white fibers here and what has
happened<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.379> when<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.430> roots<00:03:42.239> hit<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:43.250> bag

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
happened is when that roots hit the bag

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.960 
happened is when that roots hit the bag
here<00:03:44.699> a<00:03:45.060> air<00:03:45.810> prune<00:03:46.410> which<00:03:47.220> means<00:03:47.489> they<00:03:47.760> hit

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
here a air prune which means they hit

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.879 
here a air prune which means they hit
the<00:03:48.090> side<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.449> then<00:03:48.540> they<00:03:48.660> spread<00:03:49.470> apart<00:03:49.799> and

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
the side and then they spread apart and

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.420 
the side and then they spread apart and
put<00:03:50.069> even<00:03:50.280> more<00:03:50.310> fibrous<00:03:51.090> roots<00:03:51.449> on<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.430> thick

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
put even more fibrous roots on and thick

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.309 
put even more fibrous roots on and thick
you<00:03:54.030> don't<00:03:54.060> get<00:03:54.299> a<00:03:54.359> root<00:03:54.599> down<00:03:54.810> like<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.169> would

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
you don't get a root down like you would

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:03.199 
you don't get a root down like you would
in<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.500> normal<00:03:55.530> pot<00:03:56.160> let<00:03:56.400> me<00:03:56.489> see<00:03:56.639> if<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.849> can

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.440 

you<00:04:04.209> can<00:04:04.360> see<00:04:04.599> all<00:04:05.470> these<00:04:05.890> little<00:04:06.450> fibrous

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
you can see all these little fibrous

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.410 
you can see all these little fibrous
roots<00:04:07.780> keep<00:04:08.560> expanding<00:04:09.400> out<00:04:09.700> as<00:04:10.000> soon<00:04:10.180> as<00:04:10.300> they

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
roots keep expanding out as soon as they

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.580 
roots keep expanding out as soon as they
hit<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.750> outer<00:04:11.530> portions<00:04:12.250> of<00:04:12.430> this<00:04:13.080> so<00:04:14.080> it<00:04:14.380> air

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
hit the outer portions of this so it air

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.199 
hit the outer portions of this so it air
prunes<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.160> you<00:04:15.220> get<00:04:15.370> more<00:04:15.520> root<00:04:15.790> development

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
prunes and you get more root development

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.610 
prunes and you get more root development
now<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:17.019> this<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.590> success<00:04:18.220> well<00:04:18.669> I<00:04:19.560> don't<00:04:20.560> know

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
now is this a success well I don't know

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.890 
now is this a success well I don't know
I<00:04:20.889> consider<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.820> success<00:04:21.970> because<00:04:22.389> we<00:04:22.600> do

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
I consider it a success because we do

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.840 
I consider it a success because we do
have<00:04:23.110> good<00:04:23.380> pollination<00:04:24.130> which<00:04:24.280> means<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:24.700> had
