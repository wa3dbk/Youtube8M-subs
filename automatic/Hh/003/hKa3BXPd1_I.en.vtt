00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.010
 two 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.060
 talk 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.800
 today I bring a video to talk 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.080
 tell them about some things that I 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.509
 came from the page san andrÃ©s that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.640
 they came super happy and well they 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.140
 They contacted me and offered me 15 dollars 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.020
 to get what I want from his 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.110
 page and I chose two clothes that I 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.690
 they have super super delighted and good if 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.440
 I already knew this page a long time ago 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.260
 weather 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.450
 the things they bring are precious and they are 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.450
 as super economic 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.750
 and well I'm going to start showing the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.010
 little things that you see me one of them is this 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.920
 like a bill or a long-sleeved shirt 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.730
 You can say it's gray and it's common 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.670
 of those 15 as more a little longer 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.110
 backwards it is long sleeve and the fabric is 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 quite thick so in the winter 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.479
 well, there are still some winter 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.409
 but I arrived a few weeks ago 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.630
 and what I used a lot I love because 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.220
 apart it remains like that adjusted and what 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.950
 is this part of here and a little more 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.530
 loose down then it is very 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.080
 pretty and here in chile is used a lot 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.480
 shirts are pandi then with a 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.120
 template shirt down 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.060
 a thicker vest or jacket and 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.830
 a scarf is beautiful from the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.100
 gray in color quite easy to combine 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.550
 either with jackets with with any 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.610
 Other style of shoes shoes scarves 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.460
 etc 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.650
 to my taste 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.490
 a lot of other garment here but it was my 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.610
 favorite is this as a black vest 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.409
 with this color like white cream I 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.540
 well I do not know what's going on 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.790
 reality tries to translate it but it's a 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.790
 little weird and good 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.150
 it comes to me 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.069
 a little lower than the waist is 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.159
 long sleeve too and it 's like this fabric 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.310
 like little balls like this wool like 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.590
 balls super super super rich and good 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.269
 I asked for it in black because in a high school 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.010
 in college makeup class of 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.469
 black and I do not have any black clothes 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.689
 because I do not like black but 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.760
 then I have started telling me more 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.860
 little black things and this vest really 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.640
 I loved it 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.740
 I've used it with hose with jeans 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.090
 coffee and black boots these boots as 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.100
 style 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.550
 I think those boots are called and nothing 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.500
 I love coming up with labels 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.510
 super well wrapped and delayed in 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.340
 arrive approximately one month since 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.060
 they notified me of the shipment 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.730
 Y 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.160
 nothing too super rich to use it with 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.010
 pulleys or with bread shirts and also 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.010
 in winter 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.730
 and nothing 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.049
 it looks really nice and it looks like 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.569
 great but the same is like a little 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.140
 adjusted or like that also gives you a 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.850
 little shape to your body 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.540
 it looks pretty good and they are sizes 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.540
 standard 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.520
 very tender apart I have a cap of 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.740
 bear that is black with this cream then 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.110
 I do not feel very tender when I use the 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.180
 two things together and good the method of 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.920
 payment and guides all or all 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.110
 they should know what is typical through 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.560
 Credit card through 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.980
 paypal which is a web page where you 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.780
 you associate your credit card 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.090
 to an account that you stayed in 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.970
 paypal then at checkout 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.799
 you pay with paypal and you do not give your data 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.370
 from the credit card to the page 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.930
 then it is a bit safer and also 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.720
 there is the option to pay for western 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.180
 union that our meeting can be in 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.390
 the bus are I think that also in post 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.390
 of chile that is when you send money 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.310
 to another country and if it comes out a little more 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.109
 expensive because they charge you when sending 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.660
 money but it also depends on the 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.039
 quantity and good those two things 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.139
 they left 15 dollars added with the shipment 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.840
 included that is they cost me less than 15 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.090
 dollars or less than 7 thousand 500 pesos 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.919
 those two things what I find that 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.320
 it's super cheap and if they have the 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.270
 possibility to buy 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.360
 and really that I highly recommend 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.520
 It has a lot of styles that I 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.890
 really if they were lacquer like they are 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.200
 Korean women would have asked for another style 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.960
 also of clothes but it gives me like a little 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:56.130
 of it turned out so I'm going with the things 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.930
 a little more loose so good them 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.409
 I send a giant kiss and I hope that 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.019
 I liked it 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:05.139
 I'm going to leave the page of the mls here 

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:06.639
 down to Marin and go to visit her and 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.019
 see all the interesting things that 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.479
 they have because they really have things 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:12.999
 precious especially the dresses 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:17.129
 for all kinds of occasions so 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:17.129
 again a giant kiss a video
