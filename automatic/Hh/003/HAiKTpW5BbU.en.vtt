00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 we then follow what is 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.760
 thought i do not think i'm 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.760
 animator at tf1 we are journalists 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:31.800
 tentacles tnt es in your cultural 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:35.309
 theater it's us Thursday of water will have to 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.630
 consider calming down anyway and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.399
 adventure with unspoken agree to this 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.140
 that you want you do not interest me and that's 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.430
 very annoying talent and csu tip I 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.670
 stayed there for a long time within 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.070
 of a tank and continuing and in hand going 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.210
 from the kitchen I turn around I tell him 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.210
 dad the little we get there 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:03.250
 so much the better why she saw herself 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.360
 told us the spelling is at no 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:12.640
 all girls in the same package 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:14.830
 what do you think I do not believe in France 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.259
 it's my father and Algeria is my 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.550
 mother I quarrel is already with 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.960
 some of my fellow believers who 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.380
 said the same thing for France and 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.780
 Israel 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.670
 there is no father and my mother has 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.680
 a nation and we do not have a double 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.660
 allegiance so now these people there 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.050
 either they are Algerian or they are 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.000
 French 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.830
 if they are Algerian it is very good y'a 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.300
 no problem and they are right to be 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.200
 pleased with the victory of Algeria but 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.030
 who come not to say that they are 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.179
 French or so they are French and 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:55.600
 they are not Algerian 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:59.560
 what the tree a feat too 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.789
 painful that totally useless as 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.899
 this is often the case in the 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.899
 famous guiness book of records 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.440
 moscovici summarize the year 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:24.390
 in a nutshell from September to June 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:27.250
 complicated not wrong that's gone for 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.599
 the beach weather so I do not know 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.459
 if but I think I'm on the air 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.830
 so we will look together at what will 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.670
 to spend this afternoon on the beaches 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.950
 first of the sleeve 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.290
 a shark appears and starts to spin 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.640
 around the drum 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.760
 it is only a few meters from 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.760
 we 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.129
 the predator tries in vain to eat there 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.129
 low 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.830
 suddenly he's heading towards us frustrating 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.220
 at the last second it changes 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.220
 direction 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.659
 hard to resist the temptation I 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.319
 take the danger aside and I decide to 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.319
 swim towards him 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.140
 Serious mistake the animal makes half turn 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.370
 it's Mike's camera that took me 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.370
 maybe saved the life 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.870
 I like doing this when someone 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:37.030
 told me I recognize you are you and 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:37.030
 we are leaving our young me now 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:51.370
 that's wonderful 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:54.790
 people people will be happy I 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.790
 you're just starting
