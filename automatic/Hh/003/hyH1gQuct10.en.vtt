00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.800 

some<00:02:49.520> of<00:02:49.640> these<00:02:49.730> these<00:02:50.510> are<00:02:50.690> actually

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
some of these these are actually

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.860 
some of these these are actually
cuttings<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.770> got<00:02:52.069> from<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.430> friend<00:02:52.870> makes

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
cuttings that I got from a friend makes

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.770 
cuttings that I got from a friend makes
this<00:02:54.020> even<00:02:54.380> less<00:02:54.560> expensive

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.590 

and<00:03:00.760> really<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.910> also<00:03:02.060> want<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.420> make<00:03:02.570> sure

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
and really you also want to make sure

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.690 
and really you also want to make sure
it's<00:03:03.020> not<00:03:03.200> sitting<00:03:03.560> too<00:03:03.860> high<00:03:03.890> because<00:03:04.400> if

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
it's not sitting too high because if

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.120 
it's not sitting too high because if
I've<00:03:05.090> done<00:03:05.360> this<00:03:05.570> made<00:03:06.110> this<00:03:06.260> mistake<00:03:06.500> if<00:03:06.980> your

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
I've done this made this mistake if your

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.730 
I've done this made this mistake if your
plant<00:03:07.370> sitting<00:03:07.760> too<00:03:07.940> high<00:03:08.230> then<00:03:09.230> when<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.590> go

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
plant sitting too high then when you go

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.010 
plant sitting too high then when you go
to<00:03:09.770> water<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.820> soil<00:03:11.090> will<00:03:11.360> wash<00:03:11.600> off<00:03:11.840> the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
to water it the soil will wash off the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.280 
to water it the soil will wash off the
top<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.560> we<00:03:12.710> want<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:12.980> avoid<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.430> as<00:03:13.640> well

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
top so we want to avoid that as well

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.350 
top so we want to avoid that as well
let's<00:03:15.290> do<00:03:15.470> one<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.740> these<00:03:15.860> I<00:03:16.370> love<00:03:17.209> these

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
let's do one of these I love these

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:25.200 
let's do one of these I love these
little<00:03:17.510> guys<00:03:18.160> they're<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:19.459> geometric

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.470 

I<00:03:25.270> find<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.500> mixing<00:03:27.190> different<00:03:27.610> succulents

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
I find that mixing different succulents

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.050 
I find that mixing different succulents
in<00:03:28.600> one<00:03:28.810> container<00:03:29.350> with<00:03:29.830> different<00:03:30.670> colors

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
in one container with different colors

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.240 
in one container with different colors
and<00:03:31.420> shapes<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:31.960> textures<00:03:32.320> really<00:03:32.860> adds<00:03:33.040> a

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
and shapes and textures really adds a

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:43.630 
and shapes and textures really adds a
lot<00:03:33.370> of<00:03:33.430> interest

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.190 

and<00:03:43.880> you<00:03:44.030> want<00:03:44.240> to<00:03:44.360> push<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.800> plants

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
and you want to push in the plants

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.479 
and you want to push in the plants
from<00:03:47.830> under<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.940> leaves

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.309 

with<00:03:51.790> some<00:03:52.030> firm<00:03:52.299> pressure<00:03:52.629> to<00:03:53.079> make<00:03:53.290> sure

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
with some firm pressure to make sure

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:05.339 
with some firm pressure to make sure
that<00:03:53.890> it's<00:03:54.700> well<00:03:55.000> seated

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.050 

and<00:04:05.439> then<00:04:06.040> lastly<00:04:06.489> what<00:04:06.760> you're<00:04:06.879> going<00:04:06.999> to

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
wash through the water through the soil

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.129 
wash through the water through the soil
out<00:04:12.790> through<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.269> drainage<00:04:13.510> hole<00:04:13.810> and

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
out through the drainage hole and

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.479 
out through the drainage hole and
that'll<00:04:14.560> really<00:04:14.799> kind<00:04:15.040> of<00:04:15.099> set<00:04:15.370> everything

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
that'll really kind of set everything

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:27.850 
that'll really kind of set everything

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419
