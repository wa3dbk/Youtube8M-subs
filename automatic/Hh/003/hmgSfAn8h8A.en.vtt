the vehicle
you<00:00:35.730> see<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:37.320> fans<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:40.790> plastic

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
you see are the fans and the plastic

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.959 
you see are the fans and the plastic
cover<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.440> goes<00:00:44.010> over<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.340> radiator<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
cover that goes over the radiator and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.360 
cover that goes over the radiator and
then<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.079> will<00:00:46.260> install<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.800> new<00:00:47.039> radiator

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
then we will install this new radiator

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.229 
then we will install this new radiator
and<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:48.899> bracket<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.610> right<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.059> is

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
and the bracket you see right here is

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.779 
and the bracket you see right here is
actually<00:00:51.390> laying<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:51.989> top<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> motor<00:00:52.789> is

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
actually laying on top of the motor is

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.790 
actually laying on top of the motor is
the<00:00:54.090> support<00:00:54.629> bracket<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.050> good<00:00:55.230> runs<00:00:55.530> right

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
the support bracket that good runs right

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.139 
the support bracket that good runs right
above<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> radiator<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
above the radiator so you have this

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.420 
above the radiator so you have this
bracket<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.920> plastic<00:00:59.190> piece

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
bracket then you have that plastic piece

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.920 
bracket then you have that plastic piece
that's<00:00:59.789> laying<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> floor<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.570> top<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that's laying on the floor on top of

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.860 
that's laying on the floor on top of
that<00:01:01.020> bracket<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:03.210> bolts<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.539> hold<00:01:03.690> it

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
that bracket and the bolts that hold it

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.190 
that bracket and the bolts that hold it
in<00:01:04.019> hold<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> bracket<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.159> these<00:01:05.339> two<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
in hold the bracket in or these two and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.750 
in hold the bracket in or these two and
this<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:08.490> are<00:01:08.960> some<00:01:09.960> screws

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
this one and then there are some screws

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.370 
this one and then there are some screws
Phillips<00:01:11.760> head<00:01:12.060> screws<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.720> go<00:01:12.780> across<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
Phillips head screws that go across the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.580 
Phillips head screws that go across the
top<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> hold<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> plastic

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
top of the for the hold the plastic

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.410 
top of the for the hold the plastic
piece<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:18.420> these<00:01:18.540> two<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:20.030> run<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
piece in and then these two that run the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.710 
piece in and then these two that run the
also<00:01:21.869> mount<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.740> support<00:01:23.369> bracket<00:01:23.720> other

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
also mount this support bracket other

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
also mount this support bracket other
than<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.380> pretty<00:01:25.500> simple

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
than that it's really pretty simple

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.770 
than that it's really pretty simple
pretty<00:01:26.130> straightforward

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
pretty straightforward

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.210 
pretty straightforward
you<00:01:27.780> will<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.259> there<00:01:28.439> are<00:01:28.470> two<00:01:28.710> two

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
you will see that there are two two

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.010 
you will see that there are two two
bolts<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.759> top<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.210> radiator<00:01:30.509> when<00:01:30.869> it's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
bolts on top of the radiator when it's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.870 
bolts on top of the radiator when it's
right<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.400> side<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.670> one

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
right in here one on this side and one

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.230 
right in here one on this side and one
on<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> other<00:01:33.180> side<00:01:33.409> that<00:01:34.409> mount<00:01:34.710> this

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
on the other side that mount this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.550 
on the other side that mount this
transmission<00:01:36.240> cooler<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> radiator

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
transmission cooler to the radiator

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499 
transmission cooler to the radiator
there's<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.369> top<00:01:38.549> there's<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.210> two<00:01:39.329> on

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
there's one on top there's just two on

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.910 
there's one on top there's just two on
top<00:01:39.720> there's<00:01:39.960> nothing<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> bottom<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
top there's nothing in the bottom and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
top there's nothing in the bottom and
then<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.759> lift<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
then you have to lift up the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.899 
then you have to lift up the
transmission<00:01:42.899> cooler<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:44.520> pull<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
transmission cooler and then pull the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.520 
transmission cooler and then pull the
radiator<00:01:45.090> out<00:01:45.509> from<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> bottom<00:01:45.960> because<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
radiator out from the bottom because the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.840 
radiator out from the bottom because the
transmission<00:01:46.890> cooler<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.280> actually<00:01:47.549> setting

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
transmission cooler is actually setting

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.170 
transmission cooler is actually setting
in<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> radiator<00:01:48.590> when<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> pull<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.040> out

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
in the radiator when you pull it out

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.370 
in the radiator when you pull it out
other<00:01:51.180> than<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.049> lower

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
other than that you just have a lower

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.880 
other than that you just have a lower
hose<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.310> an<00:01:53.399> upper<00:01:53.640> hose<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.030> unhook<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.890> you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
hose and an upper hose to unhook and you

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.440 
hose and an upper hose to unhook and you
can<00:01:56.100> remove<00:01:56.310> from<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.640> vehicle<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.149> took<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
can remove from the vehicle we took the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.179 
can remove from the vehicle we took the
fans<00:01:57.689> out<00:01:57.960> before<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.740> drain<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> radiator
