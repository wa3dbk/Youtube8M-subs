00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.550 
good
and<00:01:47.340> my<00:01:47.460> posing<00:01:47.970> has<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.750> come<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> long<00:01:49.320> way

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and my posing has really come a long way

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.410 
and my posing has really come a long way
I<00:01:49.770> mean<00:01:50.100> there's<00:01:50.250> still<00:01:50.430> little<00:01:50.729> things<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.119> see

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
I mean there's still little things I see

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.600 
I mean there's still little things I see
that<00:01:51.600> I'm<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.530> could<00:01:53.490> really

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that I'm like you know I could really

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.999 
that I'm like you know I could really
fix<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.119> or<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:55.320> would<00:01:55.470> look<00:01:55.560> better<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
fix this or this would look better if I

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.789 
fix this or this would look better if I
did<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.670> executed<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:58.170> overall<00:01:58.680> I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
did this as I executed it but overall I

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.069 
did this as I executed it but overall I
think<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.130> looking<00:01:59.430> much<00:01:59.759> improved<00:02:00.320> I<00:02:03.079> still

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
