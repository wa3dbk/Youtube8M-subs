00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.580
 Hello. 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.150
 I am Serizawa, an afterbeat music school guitar instructor. 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.050
 Today, when it comes to playing acoustics or chords, it is better to play better, 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.710
 I would like to practice the muting technique. 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.480
 It feels like it is now, and when you add various mute sounds, 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.250
 Because the performance itself is alive with percussive sounds, 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.640
 It will be a lot of fun if you get it right. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.020
 The playing side is also pretty fun, 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.219
 You can do a much better performance even with a duo that looks like a guitar and a singer. 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.519
 Let's do our best and practice. 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:06.229
 Well, this is the first thing I should master. 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:16.530
 I don't really make fists lightly, but I hold my hand and say, "Pack, Pack, Pack, Pack, Pack". 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.520
 It is this sound. 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.409
 So you can do this first with A code or some simple code. 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.950
 The thumb is root using four fingers. 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.630
 So the other three are all good. 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.820
 1, 2, 3 or 2, 3 or 4 strings 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.820
 Play it. 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.210
 So if you play it this sound. 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.610
 Then I played it again and this sound. 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.310
 Let's repeat. 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.450
 Ideally, it sounds percussive. 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.870
 The ideal is to have a finger on the string where you have to play each finger already when you're "pussy". 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.850
 Play it back. 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.220
 Then I just play again. 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.870
 I am preparing for picking. 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.280
 Play ... 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.500
 So, as a bad example ... 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.879
 That's why I can't just get my finger ready again after making this percussive sound. 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.219
 If it is such a simple phrase, it will be immediately as it is. 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.620
 Let's prepare to play it. 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.249
 So, let's use this phrase to make it rhythmic. 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:52.959
 Just play, mute, play and mute just as you did earlier. 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:06.959
 It has become somewhat lifelike. 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.209
 It feels like it, and putting the percussive sound makes the whole song a bit brighter, so 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.849
 I want you to master it by all means, and to incorporate it in everyone's performance. 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.409
 For now, please master the behavior of this goo and move on to the next video. 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.270
 Next, I would like to use the index finger or the middle finger to play the muted sound.
