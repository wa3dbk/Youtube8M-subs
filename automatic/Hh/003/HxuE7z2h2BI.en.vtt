been a lot of word out there you know
how<00:00:21.000> really<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.600> these<00:00:21.840> servos<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.439> know

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
how really are these servos you know

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.050 
how really are these servos you know
we're<00:00:22.740> always<00:00:22.859> saying<00:00:23.189> they're<00:00:23.670> great

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
we're always saying they're great

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.490 
we're always saying they're great
they're<00:00:24.269> excellent<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:24.810> I've<00:00:25.260> actually

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
they're excellent but I've actually

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500 
they're excellent but I've actually
taken<00:00:26.039> them<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.460> spent<00:00:27.029> time<00:00:27.180> with<00:00:27.359> these

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
taken them out and spent time with these

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.779 
taken them out and spent time with these
servos<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.080> I've<00:00:28.769> opened<00:00:28.980> them<00:00:29.279> up<00:00:29.369> I've<00:00:29.550> seen

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
servos and I've opened them up I've seen

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.099 
servos and I've opened them up I've seen
the<00:00:29.910> internals<00:00:30.420> I've<00:00:30.539> seen<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:30.900> they're

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
the internals I've seen how they're

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.380 
the internals I've seen how they're
built<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:32.189> quality<00:00:32.579> they're<00:00:32.820> very<00:00:33.120> nicely

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
built the quality they're very nicely

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.590 
built the quality they're very nicely
built<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:35.190> centering<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:35.969> incredible

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
built the centering is just incredible

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.240 
built the centering is just incredible
on<00:00:36.719> these<00:00:36.870> servos<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.350> I'm<00:00:37.440> not<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:38.040> saying

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
on these servos and I'm not just saying

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369 
on these servos and I'm not just saying
that<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.579> guys<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:38.910> shortly<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.690> how

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that you guys will see shortly just how

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.619 
that you guys will see shortly just how
great<00:00:40.620> these<00:00:40.739> servos<00:00:41.070> Center<00:00:41.430> may<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.390> know

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
great these servos Center may you know

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.840 
great these servos Center may you know
obviously<00:00:43.170> there's<00:00:43.410> different<00:00:43.829> sizes<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.520> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
obviously there's different sizes so you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.029 
obviously there's different sizes so you
know<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.450> need<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.989> servo<00:00:46.559> whether<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.920> has

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
know if you need a servo whether it has

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.610 
know if you need a servo whether it has
300<00:00:47.670> ounces<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.090> torque<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.410> you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
300 ounces of torque we have that if you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.319 
300 ounces of torque we have that if you
need<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> standard<00:00:50.340> servo<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> only<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.300> know

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
need a standard servo the only you know

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.189 
need a standard servo the only you know
has<00:00:51.600> 40<00:00:52.079> ounce<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.829> torque<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:54.199> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
has 40 ounce of torque we have that the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.750 
has 40 ounce of torque we have that the
one<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.860> I've<00:00:56.039> actually<00:00:56.250> spent<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
one I have here I've actually spent a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.410 
one I have here I've actually spent a
lot<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:56.940> time<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> solar<00:00:59.000> d77<00:01:00.000> one

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
lot of time with it is a solar d77 one

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.540 
lot of time with it is a solar d77 one
servo<00:01:00.780> I've<00:01:01.590> been<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.129> said<00:01:02.280> I've<00:01:02.370> been

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
servo I've been like I said I've been

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.969 
servo I've been like I said I've been
messing<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.359> I've<00:01:03.539> opened<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.860> up

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
messing with this one I've opened it up

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.590 
messing with this one I've opened it up
I've<00:01:05.220> seen<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> internals<00:01:06.330> they're<00:01:06.479> all

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
I've seen the internals they're all

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960 
I've seen the internals they're all
metal<00:01:06.869> gear<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.200> throughout<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:08.520> servo<00:01:08.850> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
metal gear all throughout this servo is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.450 
metal gear all throughout this servo is
a<00:01:09.000> high<00:01:09.210> voltage<00:01:09.360> servo<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.470> does<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
a high voltage servo it does have the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.429 
a high voltage servo it does have the
center<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> casing<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> aluminum<00:01:13.110> if

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
center of the casing is a aluminum if

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.620 
center of the casing is a aluminum if
I'm<00:01:13.590> correct<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.240> better<00:01:15.450> for

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
I'm correct so you know better for

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.820 
I'm correct so you know better for
cooling<00:01:15.990> when<00:01:16.140> you're<00:01:16.259> running<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.650> higher

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
cooling when you're running at higher

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.170 
cooling when you're running at higher
voltages<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.610> won't<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.939> worry<00:01:18.119> about

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
voltages you won't have to worry about

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.880 
voltages you won't have to worry about
you<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.479> overheating<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.439> any<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.740> that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you know overheating it or any of that

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.060 
you know overheating it or any of that
they<00:01:20.640> did<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.330> cooling<00:01:21.780> purposes

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
they did that just for cooling purposes

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.560 
they did that just for cooling purposes
this<00:01:23.070> servo<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.549> operate<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:24.119> four<00:01:24.360> point

servo<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.600> am<00:01:43.049> using<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.560> spectrum<00:01:44.220> or<00:01:44.430> junior

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
servo I am using a spectrum or junior

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.260 
servo I am using a spectrum or junior
receiver<00:01:45.600> right<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.310> those<00:01:47.310> will<00:01:47.520> handle

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
receiver right now and those will handle

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.289 
receiver right now and those will handle
up<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.600> eight<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.110> nine<00:01:49.290> volts<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.740> I'm<00:01:50.070> correct

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
up to eight or nine volts if I'm correct

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.850 
up to eight or nine volts if I'm correct
so<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.420> not<00:01:51.570> an<00:01:51.720> issue<00:01:51.899> here<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.500> always

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so it's not an issue here so always

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.520 
so it's not an issue here so always
remember<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.399> sure<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.759> check<00:01:54.200> your<00:01:55.200> receiver

remember be sure to check your receiver

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.889 
remember be sure to check your receiver
make<00:01:55.740> sure<00:01:55.920> we'll<00:01:56.130> handle<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> 7.2<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
make sure we'll handle the 7.2 if if you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.230 
make sure we'll handle the 7.2 if if you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
want to operate it at 7.2 but if you

seventy eight seventy inch plane but I

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.190 
seventy eight seventy inch plane but I
think<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:57.090> will<00:02:57.300> be<00:02:57.330> more<00:02:57.600> than<00:02:57.660> enough

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
and it is a digital servo which all you

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.630 
and it is a digital servo which all you
guys<00:03:36.840> know<00:03:36.989> all<00:03:37.230> digital<00:03:37.650> servos<00:03:37.980> just<00:03:38.250> Center

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
guys know all digital servos just Center

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.039 
guys know all digital servos just Center
excellent<00:03:39.299> they're<00:03:39.480> really<00:03:39.750> great<00:03:39.900> at

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
excellent they're really great at

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.080 
excellent they're really great at
centering<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:41.160> motor<00:03:41.340> in<00:03:41.519> here<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:42.030> a

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
centering and the motor in here is a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.780 
centering and the motor in here is a
cordless<00:03:42.570> motor<00:03:43.220> corliss<00:03:44.220> motor<00:03:44.430> what<00:03:44.640> that

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
cordless motor corliss motor what that

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.640 
cordless motor corliss motor what that
translates<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.019> guys<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.560> know

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
translates to you guys that you know

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.440 
translates to you guys that you know
might<00:03:46.860> not<00:03:47.070> be<00:03:47.190> too<00:03:47.340> familiar<00:03:47.519> with<00:03:47.790> its<00:03:48.060> while

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
might not be too familiar with its while

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.600 
might not be too familiar with its while
they're<00:03:48.600> operating<00:03:49.079> more<00:03:49.650> efficient<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.280> so

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
they're operating more efficient and so

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.420 
they're operating more efficient and so
faster<00:03:50.970> serval<00:03:51.380> really<00:03:52.380> quickly<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.890> made<00:03:53.400> a

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
faster serval really quickly I made a

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.120 
faster serval really quickly I made a
simple<00:03:53.820> little<00:03:54.060> test<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.600> here<00:03:54.840> again<00:03:55.620> see<00:03:56.100> I

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
simple little test and here again see I

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.340 
simple little test and here again see I
have<00:03:56.280> my<00:03:56.400> servo<00:03:56.790> have<00:03:57.450> my<00:03:57.600> arm<00:03:57.840> put

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
have my servo have my arm put

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.860 
have my servo have my arm put
double-sided<00:03:58.709> tape<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.489> little<00:04:00.090> zip<00:04:00.390> tie<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:00.780> a

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
double-sided tape a little zip tie and a

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.319 
double-sided tape a little zip tie and a
little<00:04:01.590> line<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:01.980> didn't<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:02.670> line<00:04:02.940> actually

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
little line I didn't this line actually

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.699 
little line I didn't this line actually
could<00:04:03.630> have<00:04:03.720> done<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:03.959> with<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.170> sharpie<00:04:04.530> or

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
could have done it with the sharpie or

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.319 
could have done it with the sharpie or
you<00:04:04.980> know<00:04:05.100> one<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.459> those<00:04:05.610> thick<00:04:05.880> markers<00:04:06.239> but

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
you know one of those thick markers but

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.810 
you know one of those thick markers but
I<00:04:06.390> did<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.660> with<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.810> really<00:04:07.170> thin<00:04:07.519> fine<00:04:08.519> point

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
I did it with a really thin fine point

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.910 
I did it with a really thin fine point
pen<00:04:08.989> just<00:04:09.989> so<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:10.170> guys<00:04:10.260> can<00:04:10.350> see<00:04:10.650> just<00:04:10.829> how

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
pen just so you guys can see just how

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.770 
pen just so you guys can see just how
great<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.459> centering<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:12.000> on<00:04:12.239> this<00:04:12.510> servo

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
great the centering is on this servo

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.720 
great the centering is on this servo
really<00:04:13.739> quickly<00:04:14.010> I'm<00:04:14.100> going<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.340> move<00:04:14.579> the

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
really quickly I'm going to move the

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.580 
really quickly I'm going to move the
sticks<00:04:15.000> show<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.359> guys<00:04:15.480> roughly<00:04:15.930> how<00:04:16.109> fast<00:04:16.380> it

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
sticks show you guys roughly how fast it

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.000 
sticks show you guys roughly how fast it
is<00:04:17.000> right<00:04:18.000> now<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.450> is<00:04:18.570> operating<00:04:19.049> at<00:04:19.229> 0.8

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
is right now it is operating at 0.8

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.110 
is right now it is operating at 0.8
seconds

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.440 

and<00:04:24.120> I'ma<00:04:24.930> let<00:04:25.200> go<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.440> my<00:04:25.680> my<00:04:26.670> stick<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.180> just

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
and I'ma let go of my my stick and just

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.330 
and I'ma let go of my my stick and just
watch<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.810> resolution<00:04:28.350> how<00:04:28.470> that<00:04:28.680> just<00:04:29.220> the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
watch the resolution how that just the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.640 
watch the resolution how that just the
resolution<00:04:29.520> other<00:04:29.940> thing<00:04:30.180> is<00:04:30.390> incredible<00:04:30.990> it

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
resolution other thing is incredible it

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.090 
resolution other thing is incredible it
could<00:04:31.860> actually<00:04:32.010> keep<00:04:32.370> up<00:04:32.520> with<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.760> stick

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
could actually keep up with the stick

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.710 
could actually keep up with the stick
and<00:04:35.100> now<00:04:35.250> for<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.850> centering<00:04:36.210> test<00:04:36.480> you<00:04:36.600> guys

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
and now for the centering test you guys

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.680 
and now for the centering test you guys
see<00:04:37.050> little<00:04:37.290> we<00:04:37.830> have<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.100> low<00:04:38.250> line<00:04:38.690> right

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
see little we have the low line right

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.110 
see little we have the low line right
there<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:40.530> we're<00:04:40.650> going<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.800> see<00:04:40.980> every<00:04:41.880> time

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
there so we're going to see every time

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.450 
there so we're going to see every time
it<00:04:42.870> hits<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.170> line<00:04:43.320> there's<00:04:43.680> every<00:04:44.070> no<00:04:44.280> matter

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
it hits a line there's every no matter

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.810 
it hits a line there's every no matter
how<00:04:44.640> slow<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.410> move<00:04:46.410> it<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.770> release<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.370> you

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
how slow I move it and release it you

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.720 
how slow I move it and release it you
hit<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.090> line<00:04:48.800> look<00:04:49.800> at<00:04:49.890> that<00:04:50.070> incredible

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
hit the line look at that incredible

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.490 
hit the line look at that incredible
like<00:04:51.090> I<00:04:51.180> said<00:04:51.330> I'm<00:04:51.450> really<00:04:51.720> not<00:04:51.960> just<00:04:52.200> saying

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
like I said I'm really not just saying

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.050 
like I said I'm really not just saying
these<00:04:52.920> servos<00:04:53.280> Center<00:04:53.580> great<00:04:53.760> you<00:04:53.880> guys<00:04:54.000> are

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
these servos Center great you guys are

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.890 
these servos Center great you guys are
witnessing<00:04:54.660> for<00:04:54.840> yourself<00:04:56.510> just<00:04:57.510> every<00:04:57.870> time

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
witnessing for yourself just every time

witnessing for yourself just every time
hits<00:04:58.290> a<00:04:58.410> line<00:04:58.850> I've<00:04:59.850> actually<00:05:00.090> put<00:05:00.420> this<00:05:00.570> up

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
hits a line I've actually put this up

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.280 
hits a line I've actually put this up
against<00:05:01.170> some<00:05:01.590> other<00:05:01.970> servos<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:03.930> notice

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
against some other servos and I notice

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.840 
against some other servos and I notice
that<00:05:04.560> you<00:05:04.800> know<00:05:04.920> other<00:05:05.130> branch<00:05:05.460> stores<00:05:05.700> you

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
that you know other branch stores you

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.070 
that you know other branch stores you
may<00:05:05.970> notice<00:05:06.270> sometimes<00:05:06.660> they<00:05:06.780> may<00:05:06.900> be<00:05:06.960> a

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
may notice sometimes they may be a

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.780 
may notice sometimes they may be a
little<00:05:07.290> bit<00:05:07.380> above<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.710> line<00:05:07.920> a<00:05:08.160> little<00:05:08.580> bit

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
little bit above the line a little bit

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.070 
little bit above the line a little bit
under<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.060> line<00:05:09.390> they're<00:05:09.690> just<00:05:09.900> very

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
under the line they're just very

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.630 
under the line they're just very
inconsistent<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:10.980> I<00:05:11.070> was<00:05:11.190> just<00:05:11.370> impressed

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
inconsistent and I was just impressed

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.220 
inconsistent and I was just impressed
when<00:05:12.150> I<00:05:12.180> got<00:05:12.390> these<00:05:12.510> servos<00:05:12.750> right<00:05:12.990> out<00:05:13.080> of<00:05:13.140> the

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
when I got these servos right out of the

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.530 
when I got these servos right out of the
box<00:05:13.410> just<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.830> consistency<00:05:14.550> on<00:05:14.700> these<00:05:15.330> servos

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
box just the consistency on these servos

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.870 
box just the consistency on these servos
is<00:05:15.840> really<00:05:16.200> really<00:05:16.380> nice<00:05:16.620> for<00:05:17.520> you<00:05:17.610> guys<00:05:17.760> they
