00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
Android phones and other USB devices it

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.439 
Android phones and other USB devices it
doesn't<00:00:20.320> have<00:00:20.440> a<00:00:20.470> iPhone<00:00:21.190> connector<00:00:21.940> on<00:00:22.119> board

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
doesn't have a iPhone connector on board

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.640 
doesn't have a iPhone connector on board
and<00:00:22.630> what<00:00:22.750> it<00:00:22.869> does<00:00:23.020> is<00:00:23.199> it's<00:00:23.320> got<00:00:23.470> like<00:00:23.619> a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
and what it does is it's got like a

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.920 
and what it does is it's got like a
little<00:00:23.740> 400<00:00:24.699> milliamp<00:00:25.119> battery<00:00:25.240> on<00:00:25.720> here

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
little 400 milliamp battery on here

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.900 
little 400 milliamp battery on here
that'll<00:00:26.199> give<00:00:26.350> you<00:00:26.500> maybe<00:00:26.770> like<00:00:27.070> a<00:00:27.100> 10<00:00:27.400> or<00:00:27.520> 15

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
that'll give you maybe like a 10 or 15

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.820 
that'll give you maybe like a 10 or 15
maybe<00:00:28.090> 20%<00:00:28.539> charge<00:00:29.020> on<00:00:29.230> your<00:00:29.320> phone<00:00:29.560> if<00:00:29.740> you're

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
maybe 20% charge on your phone if you're

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.149 
maybe 20% charge on your phone if you're
totally<00:00:30.789> out<00:00:30.970> but<00:00:31.630> it<00:00:31.720> also<00:00:31.869> serves<00:00:32.319> as<00:00:32.559> a<00:00:32.619> USB

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:33.159 
totally out but it also serves as a USB

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:35.520 
totally out but it also serves as a USB
cable<00:00:33.670> to<00:00:34.120> so<00:00:34.390> I<00:00:34.420> guess<00:00:34.600> they<00:00:34.749> decided<00:00:35.499> that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
cable to so I guess they decided that

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.439 
cable to so I guess they decided that
you<00:00:35.890> know<00:00:35.979> 400<00:00:36.309> milliamps<00:00:36.489> is<00:00:36.789> only<00:00:36.969> so<00:00:37.210> useful

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
you know 400 milliamps is only so useful

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:38.759 
you know 400 milliamps is only so useful
so<00:00:37.659> maybe<00:00:37.899> they'll<00:00:38.050> find<00:00:38.229> something<00:00:38.559> else<00:00:38.679> to

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
so maybe they'll find something else to

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.160 
so maybe they'll find something else to
do<00:00:38.949> with<00:00:39.039> it<00:00:39.219> so<00:00:39.399> this<00:00:39.760> is<00:00:39.819> it<00:00:40.120> it<00:00:40.329> it<00:00:40.780> is<00:00:40.929> rather

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
do with it so this is it it it is rather

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.169 
do with it so this is it it it is rather
thick<00:00:41.620> so<00:00:41.889> I<00:00:41.920> don't<00:00:42.399> think<00:00:42.550> it's<00:00:42.729> gonna<00:00:42.819> fit<00:00:43.089> in

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
thick so I don't think it's gonna fit in

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:44.610 
thick so I don't think it's gonna fit in
a<00:00:43.239> wallet<00:00:43.479> all<00:00:43.719> that<00:00:43.899> comfortably<00:00:44.379> because

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
a wallet all that comfortably because

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.930 
a wallet all that comfortably because
credit<00:00:44.799> cards<00:00:45.069> are<00:00:45.190> certainly<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.489> lot<00:00:45.699> thinner

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
credit cards are certainly a lot thinner

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.149 
credit cards are certainly a lot thinner
than<00:00:46.210> this<00:00:46.449> and<00:00:47.409> you<00:00:47.589> have<00:00:47.739> two<00:00:47.949> little

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
than this and you have two little

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.529 
than this and you have two little
connectors<00:00:48.609> that<00:00:48.639> pop<00:00:48.940> out<00:00:49.149> this<00:00:49.389> is<00:00:49.510> a

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
connectors that pop out this is a

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.169 
connectors that pop out this is a
standard<00:00:50.409> USB<00:00:50.440> connector<00:00:50.949> and<00:00:51.699> it's<00:00:51.969> very

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
standard USB connector and it's very

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.239 
standard USB connector and it's very
thin<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.929> this<00:00:53.350> will<00:00:53.499> plug<00:00:53.679> into<00:00:53.889> your

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.249 
thin and this will plug into your

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:56.129 
thin and this will plug into your
computer<00:00:54.850> or<00:00:54.879> a<00:00:55.030> power<00:00:55.299> source<00:00:55.629> and<00:00:55.899> when<00:00:56.019> it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.139 
computer or a power source and when it

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.750 
computer or a power source and when it
is<00:00:56.229> plugged<00:00:56.469> in<00:00:56.679> it'll<00:00:56.920> charge<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.370> onboard

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
is plugged in it'll charge the onboard

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.549 
is plugged in it'll charge the onboard
battery<00:00:58.089> then<00:00:58.629> on<00:00:58.749> the<00:00:58.839> other<00:00:58.869> side<00:00:59.229> here<00:00:59.440> you

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
battery then on the other side here you

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.709 
battery then on the other side here you
have<00:00:59.739> a<00:00:59.769> micro<00:01:00.280> USB<00:01:00.420> adapter<00:01:01.420> which<00:01:01.569> would

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
have a micro USB adapter which would

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.140 
have a micro USB adapter which would
plug<00:01:01.929> into<00:01:02.109> your<00:01:02.319> phone<00:01:02.589> or<00:01:02.799> other<00:01:02.859> micro<00:01:03.699> USB

with<00:01:05.800> it<00:01:05.920> too<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:07.030> know<00:01:07.120> it<00:01:07.240> can<00:01:07.330> work<00:01:07.360> as

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
with it too and you know it can work as

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.240 
with it too and you know it can work as
a<00:01:07.630> cable<00:01:08.020> it's<00:01:08.140> not<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.500> most<00:01:08.620> flexible<00:01:09.070> thing

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
a cable it's not the most flexible thing

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.980 
a cable it's not the most flexible thing
in<00:01:09.370> the<00:01:09.430> world<00:01:09.610> but<00:01:09.820> if<00:01:09.970> you're<00:01:10.090> in<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.210> bind<00:01:10.780> and

little things to take note of the first
is<00:01:18.160> a<00:01:18.310> switch<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:19.330> I<00:01:19.360> can<00:01:19.630> hit<00:01:19.900> this<00:01:20.050> little

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
is a switch so I can hit this little

or something like that you also have a

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.970 
or something like that you also have a
USB<00:01:31.570> mode<00:01:31.990> which<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.260> what<00:01:32.380> it's<00:01:32.500> set<00:01:32.650> to<00:01:32.680> right

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
USB mode which is what it's set to right

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.950 
USB mode which is what it's set to right
now<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.370> that<00:01:33.490> enables<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.570> onboard

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
now and that enables the onboard

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
start charging it so if we plug this

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.890 
start charging it so if we plug this
into<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.800> bottom<00:01:48.130> here<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:49.270> then<00:01:49.450> flick<00:01:49.720> that

some kind of charge and you can maybe

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.590 
some kind of charge and you can maybe
make<00:02:02.620> an<00:02:02.710> emergency<00:02:02.890> phone<00:02:03.310> call<00:02:03.370> or<00:02:03.729> keep
