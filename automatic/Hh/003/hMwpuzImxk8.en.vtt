literally a trail of skeletons that it's
pretty<00:01:18.119> hilarious<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.140> were<00:01:19.770> they<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.220> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
pretty hilarious and were they going to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.630 
pretty hilarious and were they going to
the<00:01:21.060> botany<00:01:22.049> class<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.650> now<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.430> was

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the botany class so now what I was

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.090 
the botany class so now what I was
thinking<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:25.170> don't<00:01:25.409> think<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.860> really

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
thinking is I don't think this is really

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.920 
thinking is I don't think this is really
considered<00:01:26.549> exploring<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.360> whatever<00:01:27.659> you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
considered exploring but whatever you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.410 
considered exploring but whatever you
would<00:01:28.259> pretty<00:01:28.470> much<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.950> sit<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.820> like

something<00:02:01.030> weird<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.540> odd<00:02:01.720> in<00:02:02.020> World<00:02:02.920> of

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
something weird and odd in World of

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.649 
something weird and odd in World of
Warcraft<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:03.610> I<00:02:03.729> heard<00:02:03.909> that<00:02:04.149> I<00:02:04.210> guess<00:02:04.420> if<00:02:04.570> a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
Warcraft and I heard that I guess if a

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.760 
bot farms I've heard somebody else true
or<00:02:06.820> not<00:02:06.880> but<00:02:07.030> if<00:02:07.750> they<00:02:07.960> don't<00:02:08.080> get<00:02:08.229> banned<00:02:08.530> for

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.410 
or not but if they don't get banned for
a<00:02:08.920> month<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.399> they<00:02:09.489> just<00:02:09.670> sit<00:02:09.850> here<00:02:10.000> in<00:02:10.119> farm

about 1 million gold a month just spam

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.090 
about 1 million gold a month just spam
in<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.880> instance<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.390> mean<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.890> did<00:02:17.890> try<00:02:18.070> to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
in this instance I mean I did try to

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.410 
in this instance I mean I did try to
influence<00:02:18.400> myself<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.180> didn't<00:02:19.330> really

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
influence myself and it didn't really

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.820 
influence myself and it didn't really
seem<00:02:19.600> like<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.900> was<00:02:19.959> anything<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.260> great<00:02:20.650> but

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
seem like it was anything that great but

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.350 
seem like it was anything that great but
I<00:02:20.890> guess<00:02:21.070> they<00:02:21.220> just<00:02:21.250> disenchant<00:02:21.940> or<00:02:22.090> whatever

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
I guess they just disenchant or whatever

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.660 
I guess they just disenchant or whatever
so<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.170> mean<00:02:23.560> although<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.070> Blizzard<00:02:24.550> Inc
