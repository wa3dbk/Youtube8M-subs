 I was that's what they did but 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.190
 cars because nothing exceeds

 fuels we know the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.459
 lady drivers they are a bit rare 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.810
 it's available on all sides 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.340
 kid I recognize that they want 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.970
 always find me I looked at myself 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.010
 price with his phenomenal series with the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.230
 price is so there you put yourself one by 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.910
 definition the fuel used in 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.500
 this car if you have what by the way 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.090
 finally on just spa massage you 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.100
 to find saas places and that's 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.270
 really good for a betting yes but that 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.280
 the problem is that today in paris 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.220
 are not connected common achieve it yeah 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.690
 to come greece to tell me parking 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.480
 saint lazare there is room for his c4 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.730
 important love it is to canes and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.100
 I think it's great I have to go 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.430
 for his country his show has nothing to 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.950
 fuck 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.030
 then no, but you are so he is 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.769
 so you these two reasons of 2.2 end 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.269
 to criticize and pull the mouth in this 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.500
 moment that's enough of thatcher sad and 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.610
 mother hen they are cons to megève 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.959
 always find that consensus and 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.970
 why because the Germans I 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.170
 do it like that you know the speed is 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.680
 so much maligned I will not go back 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.090
 in the debate 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.640
 in the background I do not care 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.010
 she has a virtue is that to drive 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.370
 quickly you must be always seated and 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.750
 therefore positions the leads 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.920
 also more demanding by size 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.920
 of nene but obviously 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.370
 I remember for example listeners 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.720
 on a German highway 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.800
 speed is free cédric leads from 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.820
 secure way 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.820
 a good little 200 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.390
 that's not why it's not at all 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.510
 does not proselytize 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.950
 it's just to show that the curtain 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.490
 and it's just laid out of faycelles 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.780
 it's his natural speed and you see 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.680
 the German engineers they manufacture 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.490
 cars that are able to hold 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.520
 naturally at these speeds there 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.700
 relay extraordinarily scene it takes 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.110
 not do that on Saturday the minimal and 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.610
 By the way, we are the first to 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:13.150
 the first go sorry to do very 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:15.830
 attention must tunic endorsement stability 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.170
 take the pharmacy extraordinarily 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.750
 stable extraordinarily secure but it's 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.810
 this limo like this is 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.660
 really his playground is she has 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.370
 been designed for that detail that was 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.380
 just interesting to selestate on 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.270
 the highway we were not at all in 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.270
 the flow of traffic was 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.690
 near in these areas of asus and forgiveness 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.690
 it's here 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.410
 the average speed revolved around 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.310
 180 th we are and we were we were 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.030
 simply in the blur another country 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.030
 other customs
