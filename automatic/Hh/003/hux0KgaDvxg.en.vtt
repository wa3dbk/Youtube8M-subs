00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
views with these sheets of plywood all

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.820 
views with these sheets of plywood all
right<00:01:23.510> now<00:01:23.660> we're<00:01:23.810> looking<00:01:23.930> for<00:01:24.260> a<00:01:24.290> perfectly

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
right now we're looking for a perfectly

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.100 
right now we're looking for a perfectly
straight<00:01:25.190> cut<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.790> could<00:01:26.330> just<00:01:26.540> make<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.869> line

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
straight cut I could just make a line

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.719 
straight cut I could just make a line
and<00:01:27.170> just<00:01:27.410> follow<00:01:27.740> my<00:01:27.979> line<00:01:28.190> down<00:01:28.430> sure

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
however it's hard to hold a straight

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.520 
however it's hard to hold a straight
line<00:01:31.280> notice<00:01:32.150> they<00:01:32.450> are<00:01:32.479> all<00:01:32.660> these<00:01:32.900> printings

okay

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
okay

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.980 
okay
matter<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.670> fact<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:34.910> says<00:01:35.119> Made<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.450> USA<00:01:35.930> so

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
matter of fact that says Made the USA so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.960 
matter of fact that says Made the USA so
it's<00:01:36.290> got<00:01:36.410> to<00:01:36.500> be<00:01:36.530> awesome<00:01:36.950> this<00:01:37.580> is<00:01:37.700> what<00:01:37.850> you

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
it's got to be awesome this is what you

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.430 
it's got to be awesome this is what you
call<00:01:38.180> your<00:01:38.300> factory<00:01:38.900> edge

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
call your factory edge

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.719 
call your factory edge
this<00:01:39.560> means<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.920> was<00:01:40.009> cut<00:01:40.220> in<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.369> machine

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
this means it was cut in the machine

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.560 
this means it was cut in the machine
that<00:01:41.660> was<00:01:41.899> like<00:01:42.880> CNC<00:01:43.880> machine<00:01:44.210> or<00:01:44.330> something

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
that was like CNC machine or something

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.469 
that was like CNC machine or something
like<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.020> that's<00:01:45.110> tough<00:01:45.380> spot<00:01:46.340> on<00:01:46.550> so<00:01:47.210> I'm
