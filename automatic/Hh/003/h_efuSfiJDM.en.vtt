is our better tool or buttress that
there<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.619> another<00:00:28.920> way<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> solve<00:00:29.519> the

there is another way to solve the

within<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.920> wall<00:00:32.099> if<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.969> push<00:00:33.180> down<00:00:33.210> more

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
within the wall if you push down more

with<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> big<00:00:34.469> weight<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.489> actually<00:00:36.059> force<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
with a big weight you actually force the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.830 
with a big weight you actually force the
thrust<00:00:36.930> line<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.710> move<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.840> increases

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
thrust line to move in that increases

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.900

the<00:00:39.960> compression<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.620> wall<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.160> prevents

the compression in the wall and prevents

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.479 
the compression in the wall and prevents
it<00:00:42.030> from<00:00:42.149> falling<00:00:42.629> over<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.890> simple<00:00:44.340> idea

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it from falling over this simple idea

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.930 
it from falling over this simple idea
actually<00:00:45.120> works

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
actually works

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.639 
actually works
that's<00:00:47.940> why<00:00:48.239> buttresses<00:00:48.960> had<00:00:49.140> turrets

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that's why buttresses had turrets

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.000 
that's why buttresses had turrets

they<00:00:55.500> kept<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.949> thrust<00:00:56.219> line<00:00:56.460> from<00:00:56.910> straying

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
they kept the thrust line from straying

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:09.930 
they kept the thrust line from straying

was<00:01:33.340> partly<00:01:33.700> a<00:01:33.820> process<00:01:34.300> of<00:01:34.420> adding<00:01:34.720> material

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
level for shops so we have to find

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
another way we can find a clue if we go

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.540 
another way we can find a clue if we go
back<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.190> our<00:05:06.490> bearing<00:05:06.970> wall<00:05:07.210> system<00:05:08.400> what<00:05:09.400> if

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
back to our bearing wall system what if

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.210 
back to our bearing wall system what if
we<00:05:09.700> make<00:05:09.910> walls<00:05:10.180> so<00:05:10.540> short<00:05:10.960> inland<00:05:11.440> that<00:05:12.130> they

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
we make walls so short inland that they

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.570 
we make walls so short inland that they
just<00:05:12.490> become<00:05:12.790> posts<00:05:13.300> in<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.780> corners<00:05:14.580> this

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
just become posts in the corners this

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.090 
just become posts in the corners this
can<00:05:15.790> be<00:05:15.910> done<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.720> what<00:05:16.900> we<00:05:17.050> have<00:05:17.320> is<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.800> post

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
can be done and what we have is a post

post a beam system comes into its own
but<00:05:40.540> what<00:05:40.690> is<00:05:40.840> different<00:05:41.020> about<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.680> way<00:05:41.830> this

well<00:05:46.480> remember<00:05:47.050> our<00:05:47.170> diagram<00:05:47.710> from<00:05:47.890> episode<00:05:48.280> 2

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.120 
well remember our diagram from episode 2
of<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.090> teeter-totter<00:05:49.650> when<00:05:50.650> we<00:05:50.770> flip<00:05:51.010> it

of the teeter-totter when we flip it
upside<00:05:51.460> down<00:05:51.490> we<00:05:52.090> can<00:05:52.270> see<00:05:52.450> that<00:05:52.600> when<00:05:52.720> the<00:05:52.750> low

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
upside down we can see that when the low

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.350 
upside down we can see that when the low
gets<00:05:53.290> nearer<00:05:53.590> to<00:05:53.740> one<00:05:53.770> column<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:55.000> column<00:05:55.030> has

they<00:06:19.379> get<00:06:19.560> narrower<00:06:19.979> and<00:06:20.099> you<00:06:20.580> end<00:06:20.759> up<00:06:20.999> needing

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
they get narrower and you end up needing
