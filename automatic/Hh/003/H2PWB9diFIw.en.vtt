00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
Southwick but yeah but of an average day

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.850 
Southwick but yeah but of an average day
his<00:05:02.830> shoulders<00:05:03.780> I'm<00:05:04.780> not<00:05:05.050> too<00:05:05.230> sure<00:05:05.500> if<00:05:05.530> it's

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
his shoulders I'm not too sure if it's

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.280 
his shoulders I'm not too sure if it's
shorter<00:05:06.160> yet<00:05:06.540> it's<00:05:07.540> hard<00:05:07.750> to<00:05:07.840> tell<00:05:08.020> he's<00:05:08.110> had<00:05:08.260> a

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
shorter yet it's hard to tell he's had a

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.710 
shorter yet it's hard to tell he's had a
lot<00:05:08.440> of<00:05:08.500> injuries<00:05:08.860> on<00:05:09.040> that<00:05:09.190> before<00:05:09.520> so<00:05:10.210> I

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
lot of injuries on that before so I

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.320 
lot of injuries on that before so I
think<00:05:11.680> might<00:05:12.460> be<00:05:12.610> just<00:05:12.820> a<00:05:12.910> bit<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.120> whiplash

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
think might be just a bit of whiplash

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.140 
think might be just a bit of whiplash
and<00:05:13.570> stuff<00:05:13.990> right<00:05:14.290> now<00:05:17.040> yeah<00:05:18.040> I've<00:05:18.310> tied<00:05:19.000> to

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
and stuff right now yeah I've tied to

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.290 
and stuff right now yeah I've tied to
tell<00:05:19.390> until<00:05:19.810> like<00:05:20.410> maybe<00:05:20.770> tomorrow<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:24.300> he's

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
tell until like maybe tomorrow so he's

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.720 
tell until like maybe tomorrow so he's
definitely<00:05:25.710> mentally<00:05:26.710> hurting<00:05:27.100> her<00:05:27.280> but<00:05:27.460> now

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
definitely mentally hurting her but now

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.750 
definitely mentally hurting her but now
it's<00:05:28.500> added<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.740> rough<00:05:29.950> season<00:05:30.400> already

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
it's added to the rough season already

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.070 
it's added to the rough season already
so<00:05:31.920> hopefully<00:05:32.920> he<00:05:33.040> can<00:05:33.660> climb<00:05:34.660> out<00:05:34.870> of<00:05:34.900> this

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
so hopefully he can climb out of this

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.140 
so hopefully he can climb out of this
and<00:05:35.410> get<00:05:35.800> back<00:05:35.830> for<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.520> rest<00:05:36.670> of<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:36.940> season
