probably about a step below the
blackberry<00:00:23.250> curve<00:00:23.460> 8900<00:00:24.410> but<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.710> more<00:00:26.070> or

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
less the same phone as the 8900

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.970 
less the same phone as the 8900
obviously<00:00:29.789> with<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.510> different<00:00:31.199> body<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
few different features namely the camera

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.319 
few different features namely the camera
and<00:00:35.850> some<00:00:36.090> hardware<00:00:37.670> but<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and some hardware but you can see it

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.660 
and some hardware but you can see it
comes<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.809> two<00:00:40.170> colors<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
comes in two colors you have the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.910 
comes in two colors you have the
standard<00:00:42.360> black<00:00:42.690> color<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:45.440> then<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.710> I

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
standard black color and then what I

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.189 
standard black color and then what I
will<00:00:46.980> call<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.730> baby<00:00:48.300> blue<00:00:48.690> color<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.020> may

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
will call a baby blue color so it may

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.260 
will call a baby blue color so it may
look<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.500> little<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:52.770> silvery<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> screen

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
look a little more silvery on the screen

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.950 
look a little more silvery on the screen
and<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.199> person<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.660> definitely<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
and it is in person but definitely a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.139 
and it is in person but definitely a
baby<00:00:58.350> blue<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:02.039> pair<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.550> quickly<00:01:02.789> to

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
baby blue and will pair it quickly to

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.420 
baby blue and will pair it quickly to
the<00:01:04.070> blackberry<00:01:05.070> curve<00:01:05.250> 8900<00:01:07.070> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.220> see

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the blackberry curve 8900 you can see

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.899 
the blackberry curve 8900 you can see
it's<00:01:08.700> slightly<00:01:09.450> smaller<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.439> not<00:01:11.369> very<00:01:11.640> much

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
it's slightly smaller but not very much

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.870 
it's slightly smaller but not very much
so<00:01:13.310> really<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> same<00:01:14.970> form<00:01:15.390> factor<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:16.880> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
so really the same form factor and the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.440 
so really the same form factor and the
8900<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> little<00:01:19.259> bit<00:01:19.380> sleeker<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:20.360> for<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
8900 is a little bit sleeker but for the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.179 
8900 is a little bit sleeker but for the
entry-level<00:01:21.930> version<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> going

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
entry-level version that this is going

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.480 
entry-level version that this is going
to<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.759> curve<00:01:24.030> family<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:25.040> nice<00:01:26.040> device

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to be to the curve family a nice device

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.240 
to be to the curve family a nice device
certainly<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.619> biggest

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
certainly you can see that the biggest

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.969 
certainly you can see that the biggest
change<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.659> optical<00:01:31.380> trackpad

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
change here is the optical trackpad

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.660 
change here is the optical trackpad
which<00:01:32.579> replaces<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:34.159> typical<00:01:35.159> blackberry

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
which replaces the typical blackberry

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.050 
which replaces the typical blackberry
trackball<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.079> e520<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.280> first<00:01:38.670> model

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
trackball so the e520 is the first model

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.410 
trackball so the e520 is the first model
with<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.810> optical<00:01:40.409> trackpad<00:01:41.270> now<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.329> going

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
with this optical trackpad now I'm going

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.480 
with this optical trackpad now I'm going
to<00:01:42.509> go<00:01:42.600> ahead<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.840> say<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.170> I've<00:01:43.500> always<00:01:44.070> been

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
to go ahead and say it I've always been

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.810 
to go ahead and say it I've always been
a<00:01:44.549> big<00:01:44.939> fan<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.240> black<00:01:45.689> bears<00:01:45.899> trackball

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
a big fan of black bears trackball

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.450 
a big fan of black bears trackball
trackball<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> way<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> feels<00:01:49.460> but

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
trackball I like the way it feels but

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.090 
trackball I like the way it feels but
the<00:01:50.939> optical<00:01:51.420> trackball<00:01:51.720> also<00:01:52.439> works<00:01:52.860> very

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the optical trackball also works very

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.450 
the optical trackball also works very
nicely<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.110> no<00:01:55.590> change<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.979> functionality

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
nicely so no change in functionality

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.209 
nicely so no change in functionality
just<00:01:57.060> feel<00:01:57.840> really<00:02:00.469> analyst<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> back<00:02:01.890> you

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
just feel really analyst on the back you

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.670 
just feel really analyst on the back you
have<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.430> 2<00:02:02.759> megapixel<00:02:02.880> camera<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:04.530> you'll

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
have a 2 megapixel camera but you'll

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.870 
have a 2 megapixel camera but you'll
notice<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.070> there

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
notice that there

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.490 
notice that there
no<00:02:06.210> flash<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.369> 8520<00:02:08.929> you'll<00:02:09.929> also<00:02:10.140> see

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
no flash on the 8520 you'll also see

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.710 
no flash on the 8520 you'll also see
that<00:02:10.709> there's<00:02:10.920> no<00:02:11.069> charging<00:02:11.730> connectors<00:02:12.360> here

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
that there's no charging connectors here

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.009 
that there's no charging connectors here
so<00:02:13.140> no<00:02:13.920> support<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.610> desktop<00:02:15.120> charging

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
so no support for a desktop charging

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.400 
so no support for a desktop charging
stand<00:02:16.319> on<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.920> 8520<00:02:20.030> screen<00:02:21.030> here<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.510> about

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
stand on the 8520 screen here is about

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:30.309 
stand on the 8520 screen here is about
2.4<00:02:23.280> 6<00:02:24.000> inches<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:25.340> 320<00:02:26.340> x<00:02:26.489> 240<00:02:27.830> resolution

2.4 6 inches and 320 x 240 resolution

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.750 
2.4 6 inches and 320 x 240 resolution
and<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.720> right<00:02:33.959> side<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.459> your

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and on the right side you have your

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.140 
and on the right side you have your
usual<00:02:36.650> volume<00:02:37.650> rocker<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.910> see<00:02:39.120> that

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
usual volume rocker but you can see that

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.850 
usual volume rocker but you can see that
it's<00:02:39.569> enclosed<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:41.160> rubbery<00:02:41.880> plastic<00:02:42.860> which

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
it's enclosed in a rubbery plastic which

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.830 
it's enclosed in a rubbery plastic which
I<00:02:44.099> i<00:02:44.400> actually<00:02:44.940> think<00:02:45.090> looks<00:02:45.360> pretty<00:02:45.720> good

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
I i actually think looks pretty good

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.970 
I i actually think looks pretty good
then<00:02:48.840> there<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.410> can<00:02:49.530> see<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.680> little
