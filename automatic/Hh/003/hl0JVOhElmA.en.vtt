00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:07.240
 Hi guys, today I show you how to make this paper plane. The realization is really simple 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.529
 take an A4 sheet 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:15.529
 and fold it in half 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.199
 now we bend this tip towards the center 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 and we do the same on the other side too 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.010
 we bend again 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.010
 this side towards the center 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:11.130
 and also on the other side 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.310
 now 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.080
 we fold in half 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.210
 now let's fold this side 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:38.210
 on this 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 we rotate and do the same also from this other part 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.510
 and here is our plane 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.210
 It has been realized 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.610
