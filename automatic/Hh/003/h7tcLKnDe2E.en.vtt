 memorization 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:18.069
 after the ibex no soloist would use scores again 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.749

 the music of 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.230
 the classical forms abandoned them 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.730

 while the nationalist evolutions failed 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.469
 his ideals remained alive in days 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.469

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.609
 one of the students passed in front of playing while linz and the others
