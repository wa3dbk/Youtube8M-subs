trying<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.549> float<00:02:39.760> fish<00:02:40.380> would<00:02:41.380> find<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.829> his

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
trying to float fish would find that his

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.130 
trying to float fish would find that his
float<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.400> being<00:02:42.610> dragged<00:02:43.000> with<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.750> wind<00:02:43.959> and

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
float is being dragged with the wind and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.289 
float is being dragged with the wind and
that<00:02:44.230> his<00:02:45.040> bait<00:02:45.310> was<00:02:45.549> trying<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:45.940> be<00:02:46.030> pulled

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
that his bait was trying to be pulled

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.300 
that his bait was trying to be pulled
with<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.840> water<00:02:47.049> that<00:02:47.230> was<00:02:47.500> more<00:02:47.709> moving

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
with the water that was more moving

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.490 
with the water that was more moving
opposite<00:02:48.700> underneath<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.320> fish

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
opposite underneath and the fish

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.280 
opposite underneath and the fish
wouldn't<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.310> fooled<00:02:51.459> by<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:52.170> because<00:02:53.170> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
wouldn't be fooled by this because the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.620 
wouldn't be fooled by this because the
natural<00:02:53.440> feed<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.820> water<00:02:55.030> would<00:02:55.269> be<00:02:55.480> going

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
natural feed in the water would be going

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.410 
natural feed in the water would be going
with<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.079> water<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:56.920> was<00:02:57.070> moving<00:02:57.420> opposite

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
with the water that was moving opposite

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.360 
with the water that was moving opposite
to<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.810> wind<00:02:59.940> this<00:03:00.940> method<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:02.290> unlock<00:03:03.220> and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
to the wind this method and unlock and

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.150 
to the wind this method and unlock and
put<00:03:03.549> out<00:03:03.700> his<00:03:03.850> bait<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:05.079> still<00:03:05.320> position<00:03:05.500> and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
put out his bait in a still position and

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.099 
put out his bait in a still position and
therefore<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.549> track<00:03:06.790> by<00:03:07.000> it's<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.389> lot<00:03:07.660> easier

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
therefore the track by it's a lot easier

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.629 
therefore the track by it's a lot easier
than<00:03:08.260> trying<00:03:08.320> to<00:03:08.650> fish<00:03:08.769> up<00:03:08.889> show<00:03:09.250> us<00:03:09.370> how<00:03:09.489> you

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
than trying to fish up show us how you

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.280 
than trying to fish up show us how you
set<00:03:09.880> that<00:03:10.000> swim<00:03:10.269> feeder<00:03:10.540> open<00:03:10.900> how<00:03:10.989> he<00:03:11.049> would

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
set that swim feeder open how he would

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.820 
set that swim feeder open how he would
put<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.470> out

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
put it out

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.730 
put it out
well<00:03:12.580> we'll<00:03:12.730> fill<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:13.780> one<00:03:13.990> feeder<00:03:14.230> lightly

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
well we'll fill this one feeder lightly

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
you're filling it with groundbait yeah

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.980 
you're filling it with groundbait yeah
in<00:03:18.460> that<00:03:18.880> ground<00:03:19.150> where<00:03:19.300> there's<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.600> few

in that ground where there's a few

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.490 
in that ground where there's a few
squats

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
squats

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.520 
squats
I<00:03:20.560> feel<00:03:20.770> Custer's<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.460> few<00:03:21.970> gauzes<00:03:22.420> or<00:03:23.110> anything

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
I feel Custer's a few gauzes or anything

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.200 
I feel Custer's a few gauzes or anything
else<00:03:23.830> that<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.370> would<00:03:24.490> like<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.730> put<00:03:25.000> in<00:03:25.120> this

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
else that you would like to put in this

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.260 
else that you would like to put in this
with<00:03:25.450> sweet<00:03:25.870> corn<00:03:26.110> worms<00:03:26.550> cheese<00:03:27.550> anything

that<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.570> would<00:03:28.690> like<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.050> use<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.620> can<00:03:29.680> use

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
that you would like to use you can use

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.500 
that you would like to use you can use
in<00:03:30.160> your<00:03:30.190> groundbait<00:03:30.700> on<00:03:30.850> yours<00:03:31.060> into<00:03:31.390> your

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
in your groundbait on yours into your

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.920 
in your groundbait on yours into your
swing<00:03:31.720> feeder<00:03:32.550> a<00:03:33.550> lot<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.150> mistakes<00:03:34.480> are<00:03:34.780> made

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
swing feeder a lot of mistakes are made

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.010 
swing feeder a lot of mistakes are made
by<00:03:35.170> packing<00:03:35.710> it<00:03:35.830> in<00:03:35.980> too<00:03:36.220> tightly<00:03:36.550> and

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
by packing it in too tightly and

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.970 
by packing it in too tightly and
therefore<00:03:38.020> it<00:03:38.110> takes<00:03:38.230> too<00:03:38.500> long<00:03:38.530> for<00:03:38.740> it<00:03:38.920> to

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
therefore it takes too long for it to

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.040 
therefore it takes too long for it to
come<00:03:39.070> out<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.550> sometimes<00:03:39.730> when<00:03:40.660> you've<00:03:40.840> cast

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
come out and sometimes when you've cast

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.530 
come out and sometimes when you've cast
into<00:03:41.410> your<00:03:41.530> swim<00:03:41.770> and<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.100> decided<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:43.180> pull

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
into your swim and you decided to pull

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.910 
into your swim and you decided to pull
back<00:03:43.720> if<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:43.960> hadn't<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.290> bite

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
back if you hadn't a bite

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.600 
back if you hadn't a bite
you<00:03:45.340> will<00:03:45.520> then<00:03:46.980> spread<00:03:47.980> your<00:03:48.220> ground<00:03:48.430> way

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
you will then spread your ground way

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.090 
you will then spread your ground way
through<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.090> swim<00:03:49.360> over<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.320> large<00:03:50.530> distance

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
through you swim over the large distance

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.920 
through you swim over the large distance
and<00:03:51.310> this<00:03:51.640> is<00:03:51.850> exactly<00:03:52.420> what<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.660> don't<00:03:52.780> want

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
and this is exactly what you don't want

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.390 
and this is exactly what you don't want
don't<00:03:53.110> work<00:03:53.320> you<00:03:53.410> want<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.680> concentrate<00:03:53.980> yeah

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
don't work you want to concentrate yeah

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.550 
don't work you want to concentrate yeah
this<00:03:54.850> is<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.240> idea<00:03:55.570> of<00:03:55.690> using<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:56.110> swim<00:03:56.320> feeder

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
this is the idea of using a swim feeder

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.800 
this is the idea of using a swim feeder
to<00:03:56.770> concentrate<00:03:57.460> your<00:03:57.700> feed<00:03:57.880> into<00:03:58.330> an<00:03:58.450> area

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
to concentrate your feed into an area

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.390 
to concentrate your feed into an area
and<00:03:58.990> therefore<00:03:59.140> concentrate<00:03:59.950> your<00:04:00.070> fishing

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
and therefore concentrate your fishing

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.510 
and therefore concentrate your fishing
in<00:04:00.490> that<00:04:00.520> area<00:04:04.560> now<00:04:05.560> that's<00:04:05.770> a<00:04:05.890> custom<00:04:06.130> maybe

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
in that area now that's a custom maybe
