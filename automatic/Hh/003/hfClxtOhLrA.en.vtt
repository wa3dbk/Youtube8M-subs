on/off button this light will illuminate

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.510 
on/off button this light will illuminate
whenever<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.300> machine's<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:29.070> other<00:01:29.250> side

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
whenever the machine's on to other side

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
whenever the machine's on to other side
you<00:01:29.730> do<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.180> green<00:01:30.450> illumination<00:01:31.200> light

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you do have the green illumination light

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.140 
you do have the green illumination light
that<00:01:31.560> lets<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.860> know<00:01:31.890> when<00:01:32.040> your<00:01:32.190> machine<00:01:32.820> is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that lets you know when your machine is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.760 
that lets you know when your machine is
up<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:33.420> temperature<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.170> boiler<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
up to temperature the boiler of the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.740 
up to temperature the boiler of the
machine<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> thermal<00:01:35.880> block<00:01:36.030> boiler<00:01:36.450> so

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
machine is a thermal block boiler so

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.180 
machine is a thermal block boiler so
it's<00:01:36.900> actually<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.260> to<00:01:37.350> heat<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.830> less

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
it's actually going to heat up in less

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.510 
it's actually going to heat up in less
than<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.400> minute<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.940> very<00:01:39.600> fast<00:01:39.840> heat<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.229> time

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
than a minute so very fast heat up time

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.680 
than a minute so very fast heat up time
below<00:01:41.520> those<00:01:41.729> controls<00:01:42.120> you<00:01:42.240> will<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.570> the

controls and the housing of the ICI 109
in<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.360> housing<00:02:34.750> let's<00:02:35.230> actually<00:02:35.440> brew<00:02:35.800> a

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
in the housing let's actually brew a

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.830 
in the housing let's actually brew a
shot<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.400> see<00:02:36.700> what<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.910> can<00:02:36.940> do<00:02:37.120> all<00:02:37.780> right

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
shot and see what it can do all right

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.910 
shot and see what it can do all right
when<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:38.080> get<00:02:38.200> ready<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.410> brew<00:02:38.620> you're<00:02:38.799> going

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
when you get ready to brew you're going

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.080 
when you get ready to brew you're going
to<00:02:38.980> want<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.190> choose<00:02:39.370> what<00:02:39.580> basket<00:02:39.970> you're

to want to choose what basket you're
going<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.269> use<00:02:40.450> we<00:02:40.900> are<00:02:40.930> going<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.230> use<00:02:41.380> an<00:02:41.500> ESC

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
going to use we are going to use an ESC

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.960 
going to use we are going to use an ESC
pod<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.220> we're<00:02:42.310> going<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.489> use<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.760> single

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
pod so we're going to use the single

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.509 
pod so we're going to use the single
shot<00:02:43.239> basket<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.950> you'll<00:02:45.069> actually<00:02:45.220> notice

shot basket and you'll actually notice

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.979 
shot basket and you'll actually notice
with<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:45.910> portafilter<00:02:46.330> there<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.720> notch

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
with this portafilter there is a notch

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.259 
with this portafilter there is a notch
right<00:02:47.440> here<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.920> there's<00:02:48.489> actually<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.880> bump

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
right here and there's actually a bump

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.410 
right here and there's actually a bump
on<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.510> exterior<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:51.010> basket<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:52.060> bump

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
on the exterior of the basket that bump

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.210 
on the exterior of the basket that bump
fits<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:52.989> knotch

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.670 

and<00:02:57.220> then<00:02:58.150> you're<00:02:58.299> going<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.510> twist<00:02:58.690> it<00:02:58.900> and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
and then you're going to twist it and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.720 
and then you're going to twist it and
that's<00:02:59.980> going<00:03:00.099> to<00:03:00.160> make<00:03:00.250> sure<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.459> doesn't

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
that's going to make sure that doesn't

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.050 
that's going to make sure that doesn't
fall<00:03:00.940> out<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.590> three<00:03:03.310> simple<00:03:03.580> steps<00:03:03.819> you<00:03:04.030> just

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
fall out so three simple steps you just

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.900 
fall out so three simple steps you just
pop<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.959> lock<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:06.099> you<00:03:06.250> drop<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:08.910> place

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
machines actually releasing the pressure

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.820 
machines actually releasing the pressure
off<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.020> system<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:01.110> now<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.290> we<00:04:01.470> brood
