00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.910
 and later natural faver for use in a wide range of 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.600

 at our nineteen application centers worldwide. 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.740
 Let's give you just three examples. 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.970
 Take cheese. 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.640
 This woman works in a large dairy company 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.540
 and she would like to find a way to get more cheese 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.680
 out of every unit milk she uses. 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.250
 By combining their own knowledge and insight 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.040

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.460

 produce up to three percent more tasty cheese 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.000
 out of each unit of milk. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.510
 Take soft drinks. 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.170
 This man works for a large global beverage company. 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.960
 He would find a natural alternative 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.380
 to the synthetic color used in their 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.210
 top selling clear colored soft drinks. 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.580
 But he needed to make sure the soda 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.530
 would still appeal to 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.360
 the consumer and it was important to choose one 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.500
 supplier who could live up to the highest 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.280
 technical and quality requirements. 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.050
 After all, the color is the first one 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.650
 ingredient that meets the eye. 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.920
 He came to Chr. Hansen with his challenge 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.100

 Take probiotics 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.330
 Probiotics have been shown to have a positive effect on health. 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.300
 This man wants to develop a product containing probiotics. 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.810
 He wants it to be healthy and he wants to expel 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.360

 Thats it, 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.610
