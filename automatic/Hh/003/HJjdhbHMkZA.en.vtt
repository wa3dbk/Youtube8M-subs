and<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.090> medium<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:44.720> kind<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.440> an<00:02:45.530> awkward

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
and the medium is kind of an awkward

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.290

the<00:02:59.060> medium<00:02:59.510> for<00:02:59.780> me<00:02:59.900> will<00:03:00.500> hold<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:00.860> ponytail

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
the medium for me will hold it ponytail

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.130 
the medium for me will hold it ponytail
but<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.670> kind<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:02.000> slides<00:03:02.480> down<00:03:02.810> like<00:03:03.020> it's

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
but it kind of slides down like it's

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.440 
but it kind of slides down like it's
almost<00:03:03.290> just<00:03:03.710> a<00:03:04.010> little<00:03:04.250> too<00:03:04.400> big<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:05.210> will

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
almost just a little too big so will

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.810 
almost just a little too big so will
hold<00:03:05.630> like<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.810> weird<00:03:06.080> like<00:03:06.290> flip<00:03:06.830> thing<00:03:07.190> but<00:03:07.790> I

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
hold like a weird like flip thing but I

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.490 
hold like a weird like flip thing but I
can't<00:03:08.030> do<00:03:08.180> updos<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:08.990> it's<00:03:09.140> like<00:03:09.320> in

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
can't do updos it so it's like in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.660 
can't do updos it so it's like in
between<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.920> ponytail<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.640> updo<00:03:11.420> for<00:03:11.450> me<00:03:11.750> so

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670
