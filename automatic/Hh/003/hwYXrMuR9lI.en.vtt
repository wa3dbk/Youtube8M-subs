00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello my name is alexey in this 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.179
 lesson in the program sony vegas pro 13 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.799
 I want to show 2 ways to get rid 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.049
 from sony vegas missions with 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.379
 adding sequences let's see 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.930
 on planted in this case 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:23.550
 this butterfly have sequins and from photos 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.550
 about this method I wanted to tell in 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.869
 the end of the lesson, the first way to show 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.240
 standard standard way 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.360
 what is our program now 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.460
 at the moment in Russian then 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.080
 is if we are constantly english 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.870
 then all without problems 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.940
 the sequence is set on the timeline 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.920
 the program will work let's face it 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.750
 now I'll show you make a small 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.690
 installation 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.980
 so the classification we changed back to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.989
 English 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.989
 let's sequence 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.079
 here is our button select the first 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.770
 photo put a tick click 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.860
 open here do not change anything 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.479
 note that the definition of fields 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.670
 set progressive in the second way 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.630
 we just pay attention and that's it 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.930
 I 'll show you this line so click 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:27.320
 ok here i say no so the project is mine 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:32.530
 1920 1080 sequence itself have 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.530
 1586 resolution at 892 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:41.710
 so let's see what we have 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:44.320
 that's our sequence 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.980
 that is, turning off the classification and 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.720
 setting back to English 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.220
 everything works fine without any 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.870
 departures 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.610
 Well, now let's show you the second 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.870
 option as many work with 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.420
 Russified versions 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.530
 In the English version, many are uncomfortable 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.200
 so now i 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.350
 the program language with the menu and the lesson will continue 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.840
 farther 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.369
 so I changed russification let's again 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.369
 add a sequence 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.250
 so here is our folder select 1 photo 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.100
 put a tick 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.600
 click open in the first case I tell you 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.230
 said that the order of the fields there was 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.300
 written progressive 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.230
 that is, it turns out that the same as in 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.739
 we freak how everything is correct but 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.340
 Now we will change instead of progressive 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.870
 set the top margin if desired 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.670
 you can put the bottom here without a difference 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.530
 let's take the top one 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.530
 the main thing is not progressive 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.080
 alpha channel us written right transparent 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.950
 click ok here i say no since 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.930
 we have a project 1920 1080 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.890
 and the sequence is 1586 at 890 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.890
 let's see what happened 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.790
 secret we all work nothing 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.790
 fly out 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.780
 so now as we have in the properties on 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.280
 The field order is now set. 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.659
 first up is not a bullet 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.459
 here is a progressive project 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.860
 there is nothing wrong there since 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.920
 Initially, if you are in the project 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.480
 progressive respectively and when rendering 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.440
 you'll make progressive too 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.660
 and in this field they are just 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.800
 just something they will remain the same 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.510
 progressive 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.510
 so let's take a butterfly look closer 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.230
 here we have all the same smooth project 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.200
 us 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.520
 progressive everything is beautiful let's end 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.710
 the composition itself 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.069
 what we started holidays on fly 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.209
 a little bit 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.209
 go to the pan 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.440
 slightly reduce the cursor here right 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.940
 will become 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.940
 that is, create such a movement 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:20.010
 well here is our sequence openly 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.010
 Russian language program sony vegas 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.280

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.890
 something incomprehensible please write in
