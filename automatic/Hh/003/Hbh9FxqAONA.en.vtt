00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
based on the original rather than a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.100 
based on the original rather than a
brand-new<00:01:13.080> sculpt<00:01:13.500> anyway<00:01:14.340> he<00:01:15.030> stands<00:01:15.630> just

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.300 
split a little bit but I don't think
it's<00:01:47.880> too<00:01:48.060> much<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.240> worry<00:01:48.600> about<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:50.009> webbing

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
it's too much to worry about the webbing

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.980 
it's too much to worry about the webbing
is<00:01:50.430> all<00:01:50.610> sculpted<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> spider<00:01:51.479> logo<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
is all sculpted the spider logo is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.450 
is all sculpted the spider logo is
sculpted<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> front<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.310> back

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
sculpted on the front and on the back

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.789 
sculpted on the front and on the back
this<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.630> from<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.990> time<00:01:55.229> period<00:01:55.259> where<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
this is from that time period where the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.950 
this is from that time period where the
paint's<00:01:56.130> weren't<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> best<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:57.719> some

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
paint's weren't the best but for some

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.170 
paint's weren't the best but for some
reason<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.560> still<00:01:59.039> works<00:01:59.399> he's<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> little

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
reason it still works he's a little

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.240 
reason it still works he's a little
faded<00:02:00.570> at<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> top<00:02:00.990> too<00:02:01.289> but<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.770> not<00:02:01.829> super

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
faded at the top too but it's not super

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.760 
faded at the top too but it's not super
noticeable<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.390> live<00:02:03.570> with<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.780> he's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
noticeable so I can live with it he's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.399 
noticeable so I can live with it he's
got<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.189> butterfly<00:02:06.119> joint<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.840> double

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
got this butterfly joint a double

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.290 
got this butterfly joint a double
butterfly<00:02:07.890> joint<00:02:08.190> alright<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.820> swivels

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
butterfly joint alright so it swivels

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.130 
butterfly joint alright so it swivels
front<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.289> back<00:02:10.820> so<00:02:11.820> that's<00:02:12.000> pretty<00:02:12.330> nice<00:02:12.690> it's

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
front to back so that's pretty nice it's

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.130 
front to back so that's pretty nice it's
got<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:14.180> lateral<00:02:15.180> let's<00:02:15.780> call<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
got the the lateral let's call it a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.700 
got the the lateral let's call it a
lateral<00:02:16.560> butterfly<00:02:17.160> joint<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:19.080> vertical

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
lateral butterfly joint and the vertical

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.950 
lateral butterfly joint and the vertical
butterfly<00:02:20.370> joint<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.210> I've<00:02:21.360> never<00:02:21.600> seen<00:02:21.930> a

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
butterfly joint so I've never seen a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.400 
butterfly joint so I've never seen a
figure<00:02:22.320> with<00:02:22.590> more<00:02:23.010> articulation<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:23.850> that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
figure with more articulation in that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.980 
figure with more articulation in that
look<00:02:25.100> at<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.820> does<00:02:26.090> look<00:02:26.270> goofy<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.780> some

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
look at that it does look goofy and some

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.540 
look at that it does look goofy and some
angles<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.500> other<00:02:27.680> angles<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.310> looks

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
angles but in other angles it looks

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.450 
angles but in other angles it looks
really<00:02:29.150> good<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.380> very<00:02:30.680> Elyria<00:02:31.370> ly

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
really good and it is very Elyria ly

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.000 
really good and it is very Elyria ly
effective<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.300> that's<00:02:33.170> really<00:02:33.530> an<00:02:33.740> impressive

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
effective so that's really an impressive

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.740 
effective so that's really an impressive
joint<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.640> think<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:35.030> guys<00:02:35.210> if<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.570> don't

sure<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.210> lot<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.690> would<00:02:59.810> just<00:02:59.990> pose<00:03:00.170> and

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
sure a lot of you would just pose and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.410 
sure a lot of you would just pose and
flipping<00:03:00.650> people<00:03:00.800> off<00:03:01.100> but<00:03:01.940> that's<00:03:02.030> not<00:03:02.270> my

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
flipping people off but that's not my

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.810 
flipping people off but that's not my
thing<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:03.230> does<00:03:03.380> have<00:03:03.530> an<00:03:03.620> ab<00:03:03.800> crunch<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.280> only

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
thing it does have an ab crunch the only

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.430 
thing it does have an ab crunch the only
bad<00:03:05.060> thing<00:03:05.090> about<00:03:05.300> his<00:03:05.510> ab<00:03:05.660> crunch<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.140> it's<00:03:06.350> a

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
bad thing about his ab crunch is it's a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.950 
bad thing about his ab crunch is it's a
little<00:03:06.830> bit<00:03:06.980> low<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.580> think<00:03:08.120> if<00:03:08.210> it<00:03:08.330> was<00:03:08.480> like<00:03:08.690> up

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
little bit low I think if it was like up

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.520 
little bit low I think if it was like up
another<00:03:09.550> another<00:03:10.550> abdominal<00:03:11.360> muscle<00:03:11.750> that

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
another another abdominal muscle that

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.960 
another another abdominal muscle that
would<00:03:12.680> have<00:03:12.770> been<00:03:12.920> good<00:03:13.100> but<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.490> still<00:03:13.580> does

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
would have been good but it still does

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.910 
would have been good but it still does
work<00:03:14.210> pretty<00:03:14.270> darn<00:03:14.930> well<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.410> sculpt<00:03:15.740> and

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
work pretty darn well in the sculpt and

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.650 
work pretty darn well in the sculpt and
paints<00:03:16.250> continue<00:03:16.700> throughout<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:17.390> it's<00:03:17.540> not

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
paints continue throughout so it's not

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.920
