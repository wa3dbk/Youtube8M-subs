throughout the development cycle so
that's<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.350> Microsoft<00:01:28.770> had<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.070> say<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.369> all

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700

this<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.570> their<00:01:30.659> job<00:01:30.900> listing<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:32.159> is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
this for their job listing so there is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.399 
this for their job listing so there is
going<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.790> as<00:01:32.939> some<00:01:33.150> sort<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.479> Xbox<00:01:34.200> one

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409

avatar look
I<00:02:13.920> find<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.400> really<00:02:14.490> cool<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.090> I'm<00:02:15.420> glad<00:02:15.660> that

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
I find it really cool and I'm glad that

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.270 
I find it really cool and I'm glad that
they're<00:02:15.930> adding<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.470> Xbox<00:02:16.800> one<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
they're adding it to the Xbox one in a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.100 
they're adding it to the Xbox one in a
much<00:02:17.460> bigger<00:02:17.640> way<00:02:17.790> than<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.270> 360<00:02:18.630> because<00:02:18.930> on

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
much bigger way than the 360 because on

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.230 
much bigger way than the 360 because on
the<00:02:19.200> 360<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.650> mean<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.920> was<00:02:20.010> already<00:02:20.220> pretty<00:02:20.459> big

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
the 360 I mean it was already pretty big

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.820 
the 360 I mean it was already pretty big
the<00:02:21.569> avatars<00:02:21.930> looked<00:02:22.140> pretty<00:02:22.350> good<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.709> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
the avatars looked pretty good on the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.949 
the avatars looked pretty good on the
360<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.550> can't<00:02:23.819> imagine<00:02:23.910> on<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.330> Xbox<00:02:24.750> one

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
360 so I can't imagine on the Xbox one

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.199 
360 so I can't imagine on the Xbox one
how<00:02:25.080> nice<00:02:25.290> they're<00:02:25.470> gonna<00:02:25.560> look<00:02:25.970> visually<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
how nice they're gonna look visually and

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.530 
how nice they're gonna look visually and
hopefully<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:29.040> them<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:30.030> more<00:02:30.209> interactive

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
hopefully have them be more interactive

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.400 
hopefully have them be more interactive
hopefully<00:02:31.290> just<00:02:32.510> make<00:02:33.510> them<00:02:33.630> more<00:02:33.780> relevant<00:02:34.020> I

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
hopefully just make them more relevant I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.800 
hopefully just make them more relevant I
suppose<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:35.550> what<00:02:35.850> I'm<00:02:35.940> trying<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.209> say<00:02:36.360> but

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
suppose is what I'm trying to say but

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.810 
suppose is what I'm trying to say but

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
anyways this is another thing Microsoft

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.490 
anyways this is another thing Microsoft
had<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.060> say<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.240> this<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:40.050> now<00:02:40.170> read<00:02:40.350> you

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.259 
fidelity and a bigger stage in new Xbox
experiences<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.440> they're<00:03:02.190> really<00:03:02.880> trying<00:03:03.090> not

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
experiences so they're really trying not

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.090 
experiences so they're really trying not
to<00:03:03.330> only<00:03:03.600> have<00:03:03.840> avatars<00:03:04.350> on<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> Xbox<00:03:05.010> one

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
to only have avatars on the Xbox one

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.150 
to only have avatars on the Xbox one
become<00:03:05.670> relevant<00:03:06.050> much<00:03:07.050> more<00:03:07.290> relevant<00:03:07.980> but

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
become relevant much more relevant but

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.040 
become relevant much more relevant but
also<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:09.090> looks<00:03:09.330> like<00:03:09.390> they're<00:03:09.600> trying<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.870> put

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
avatars not only on Xbox one but it

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.750 
avatars not only on Xbox one but it
looks<00:03:52.320> like<00:03:52.440> across<00:03:52.680> all<00:03:52.950> Microsoft<00:03:53.459> devices

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
looks like across all Microsoft devices

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.539 
looks like across all Microsoft devices
which<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.239> find<00:03:54.570> really<00:03:54.959> cool<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:56.519> looks

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
which I find really cool and it looks

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.920 
which I find really cool and it looks
like<00:03:56.730> they're<00:03:57.180> not<00:03:57.299> just<00:03:57.510> trying<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.780> make

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
like they're not just trying to make

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.840 
like they're not just trying to make
them<00:03:58.079> look<00:03:58.200> pretty<00:03:58.650> or<00:03:58.890> visually<00:03:59.430> with<00:03:59.610> more

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
them look pretty or visually with more

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.850 
them look pretty or visually with more
polygons<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.660> stuff<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:01.019> that<00:04:01.260> but<00:04:01.709> it

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
polygons and stuff like that but it

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.280 
polygons and stuff like that but it
looks<00:04:01.890> like<00:04:02.070> they're<00:04:02.280> also<00:04:02.400> trying<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:03.290> make

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
looks like they're also trying to make

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.259 
looks like they're also trying to make
it<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:04.980> there<00:04:05.760> are<00:04:05.850> more<00:04:06.000> intelligent

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
it so there are more intelligent

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.150 
it so there are more intelligent
hopefully<00:04:06.959> more<00:04:07.079> interactive<00:04:07.680> with<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:07.890> user

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
hopefully more interactive with the user

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.640 
hopefully more interactive with the user
that'd<00:04:08.430> be<00:04:08.549> pretty<00:04:08.700> cool<00:04:09.170> but<00:04:10.170> anyways<00:04:10.440> let<00:04:10.620> me

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650
