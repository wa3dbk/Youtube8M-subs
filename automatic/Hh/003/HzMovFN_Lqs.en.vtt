00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
half and maybe we took it a little bit

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.279 
half and maybe we took it a little bit
to<00:00:22.619> ease<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.039> second<00:00:23.430> half<00:00:23.580> too<00:00:23.850> much

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
to ease in the second half too much

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.500 
to ease in the second half too much
controlling<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> game<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:26.369> really<00:00:26.480> tried<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
controlling the game not really tried to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.900 
controlling the game not really tried to
dominate<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.470> try<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> score<00:00:29.220> more<00:00:29.429> calls<00:00:29.699> i

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
dominate and try to score more calls i

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.700 
dominate and try to score more calls i
think<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.599> was<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:30.960> good<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> second

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
think that was not good in the second

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.520 
think that was not good in the second
half<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.430> shall<00:00:32.669> because<00:00:33.180> they<00:00:33.329> get<00:00:33.510> they<00:00:34.350> got

half you shall because they get they got

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.040 
half you shall because they get they got
a<00:00:34.559> big<00:00:35.010> chance<00:00:35.250> by<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.550> kneel<00:00:35.940> down<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.210> and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
and that was also import the to know

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.420 
and that was also import the to know
what<00:02:04.140> was<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> second<00:02:04.890> half<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.340> you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
what was it in the second half that you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.249 
what was it in the second half that you
weren't<00:02:05.610> quite<00:02:05.820> pleased<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:07.049> forward

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
weren't quite pleased with going forward

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.719 
weren't quite pleased with going forward
I<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:07.590> we've<00:02:07.950> played<00:02:08.160> too<00:02:08.459> much<00:02:08.610> back

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
I think we've played too much back

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.330 
I think we've played too much back
we<00:02:10.450> have<00:02:10.659> to<00:02:10.810> play<00:02:11.019> more<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.440> more<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.950> attack

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
we have to play more and more to attack

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.399 
we have to play more and more to attack
and<00:02:12.610> then<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.030> it's<00:02:13.450> always<00:02:13.659> difficult<00:02:13.989> it's

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
and then and it's always difficult it's

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.759 
and then and it's always difficult it's
always<00:02:14.650> dangerous<00:02:14.830> if<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.379> control

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
always dangerous if you like to control

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.910 
always dangerous if you like to control
the<00:02:17.920> game<00:02:18.099> it's<00:02:18.819> in<00:02:19.150> your<00:02:19.209> mind<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:19.959> defending
