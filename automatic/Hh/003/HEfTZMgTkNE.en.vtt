00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
now the first Hobbit film I enjoyed I

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.190 
now the first Hobbit film I enjoyed I
did<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.660> could<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.870> been<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> little

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
did think it could have been a little

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.450 
did think it could have been a little
bit<00:00:43.320> better<00:00:43.469> some<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> pacing<00:00:44.309> was<00:00:44.399> a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
bit better some of the pacing was a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.619 
bit better some of the pacing was a
little<00:00:44.670> bit<00:00:44.789> lacking<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.270> there<00:00:45.360> were<00:00:45.420> things

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
little bit lacking and there were things

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.700 
little bit lacking and there were things
that<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.870> thought<00:00:46.079> could<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.379> been<00:00:46.469> improved

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that I thought could have been improved

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.139 
that I thought could have been improved
so<00:00:47.010> when<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> went<00:00:47.370> into<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.640> film<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.030> had

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
so when I went into this film I had

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.420 
so when I went into this film I had
slightly<00:00:48.510> muted<00:00:49.020> expectations<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.039> my<00:00:50.129> first

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
slightly muted expectations but my first

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.130 
slightly muted expectations but my first
initial<00:00:50.730> thought<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> left<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> theater

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
initial thought when I left the theater

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.770 
initial thought when I left the theater
was<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:53.190> more<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.449> it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
was that's more like it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.290 
was that's more like it
this<00:00:55.140> film<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.590> tremendously<00:00:56.370> better<00:00:56.640> vastly

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
this film is tremendously better vastly

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.150 
this film is tremendously better vastly
improved<00:00:57.780> everything<00:00:58.199> about<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.739> film

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
improved everything about this film

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.130 
improved everything about this film
I<00:00:59.190> thought<00:00:59.640> flowed<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.449> much<00:01:00.660> better<00:01:00.930> there

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I thought flowed so much better there

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.720 
I thought flowed so much better there
was<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> lot<00:01:01.530> more<00:01:01.559> action<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.699> action

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
was a lot more action and the action

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.939 
was a lot more action and the action
felt<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.750> was<00:01:03.899> filmed<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.619> way<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
felt like it was filmed in a way that

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:05.840 
felt like it was filmed in a way that
was<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.220> much<00:01:05.339> more<00:01:05.400> interesting

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
was so much more interesting

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.630 
was so much more interesting
particularly<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.900> barrel<00:01:07.619> sequence<00:01:08.100> early<00:01:08.520> on

interesting to me see where most films

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.270

possibly<00:02:51.609> could<00:02:52.180> have<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.480> think<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.750> film

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
possibly could have I think the film

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.240 
possibly could have I think the film
looks<00:02:53.079> great<00:02:53.290> in<00:02:53.410> 2d<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.769> wasn't<00:02:54.160> distracted

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
looks great in 2d I wasn't distracted

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.160 
looks great in 2d I wasn't distracted
the<00:02:54.760> special<00:02:55.060> effects<00:02:55.390> thus<00:02:55.660> looked<00:02:55.930> better

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
the special effects thus looked better

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.259 
the special effects thus looked better
and<00:02:56.410> more<00:02:56.859> realistic<00:02:57.280> because<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.879> that<00:02:58.030> also

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
and more realistic because of that also

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.839 
and more realistic because of that also
there<00:02:58.780> seem<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.019> be<00:02:59.140> more<00:02:59.470> prosthetic<00:03:00.250> orcs<00:03:00.640> in

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
there seem to be more prosthetic orcs in

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.729 
there seem to be more prosthetic orcs in
this<00:03:01.030> film<00:03:01.269> with<00:03:01.480> makeup<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.200> things<00:03:02.620> like

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
this film with makeup and things like

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.009 
this film with makeup and things like
that<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:03.010> made<00:03:03.609> it<00:03:03.760> more<00:03:03.970> realistic<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.840> me

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
that that made it more realistic to me

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.030 
that that made it more realistic to me
and<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.440> was<00:03:05.530> something<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:05.769> I<00:03:05.890> could

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
and that was something that I could

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.800 
and that was something that I could
enjoy<00:03:06.310> more<00:03:06.489> because<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.940> lot<00:03:07.329> of<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.480> orcs<00:03:07.780> in

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
enjoy more because a lot of the orcs in

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.660 
enjoy more because a lot of the orcs in
the<00:03:07.900> first<00:03:08.140> one<00:03:08.319> we're<00:03:08.500> like<00:03:08.620> all<00:03:08.769> CGI<00:03:09.250> and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
the first one we're like all CGI and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.490 
the first one we're like all CGI and
speaking<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.180> CGI<00:03:10.510> there<00:03:10.959> are<00:03:11.079> a<00:03:11.109> few

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
speaking to the CGI there are a few

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.110 
speaking to the CGI there are a few
shots<00:03:11.829> in<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.099> movie<00:03:12.430> where<00:03:12.579> you<00:03:12.609> can<00:03:12.819> really

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
shots in this movie where you can really

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.059 
shots in this movie where you can really
tell<00:03:13.359> it's<00:03:13.540> CGI<00:03:13.930> namely<00:03:14.470> there's<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.709> few<00:03:14.859> shots

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.780 
where they replace Legolas with a CGI
human<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.829> generally<00:03:18.250> when<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.459> tend<00:03:18.700> to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
human and generally when you tend to

fully<00:03:19.000> CGI<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.569> human<00:03:20.169> being<00:03:20.410> even<00:03:20.769> though<00:03:20.859> he

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
fully CGI a human being even though he

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.379 
fully CGI a human being even though he
isn't<00:03:21.130> health<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.700> tends<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.269> look

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
isn't health it tends to look

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.059 
isn't health it tends to look
unrealistic<00:03:22.900> also<00:03:23.319> there's<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.590> romance<00:03:23.950> in

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
unrealistic also there's a romance in

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.740 
unrealistic also there's a romance in
the<00:03:24.190> film<00:03:24.400> between<00:03:24.579> Evangeline<00:03:25.419> Lilly's

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
the film between Evangeline Lilly's

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.390 
the film between Evangeline Lilly's
character<00:03:26.169> and<00:03:26.349> another<00:03:26.769> character<00:03:26.980> which<00:03:27.310> I

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
character and another character which I

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.830 
character and another character which I
won't<00:03:27.549> spoil<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.209> I<00:03:28.239> felt<00:03:28.510> was<00:03:28.599> kind<00:03:28.750> of

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
won't spoil that I felt was kind of

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.629 
won't spoil that I felt was kind of
cheesy<00:03:29.169> and<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.680> little<00:03:29.859> bit<00:03:29.980> shoehorned<00:03:30.519> in

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
cheesy and a little bit shoehorned in

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.220 
cheesy and a little bit shoehorned in
there<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.060> know<00:03:31.120> her<00:03:31.299> character<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.870> added

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
there and I know her character is added

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.990 
there and I know her character is added
to<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.470> movie<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:32.919> it<00:03:33.250> seemed<00:03:33.579> kind<00:03:33.819> of<00:03:33.879> like

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
to the movie and it seemed kind of like

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.699 
to the movie and it seemed kind of like
they<00:03:34.120> just<00:03:34.269> added<00:03:34.510> her<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:35.139> create<00:03:35.500> this

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
they just added her to create this

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.860 
they just added her to create this
romance<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.489> film<00:03:36.730> could<00:03:36.970> have<00:03:37.180> a<00:03:37.419> romance

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
romance so the film could have a romance

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.930 
romance so the film could have a romance
which<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.739> seems<00:03:39.010> like<00:03:39.190> all<00:03:39.370> sweeping

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
which it seems like all sweeping

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.939 
which it seems like all sweeping
adventures<00:03:40.359> need<00:03:40.629> nowadays<00:03:40.840> but<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.739> didn't

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
adventures need nowadays but it didn't

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:43.289 
adventures need nowadays but it didn't
really<00:03:42.099> feel<00:03:42.400> like<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.669> needed<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:42.940> be<00:03:43.000> there

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
really feel like it needed to be there

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.909 
really feel like it needed to be there
although<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.629> did<00:03:43.930> like<00:03:44.109> her<00:03:44.319> character<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:44.859> I

although I did like her character and I

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.589 
although I did like her character and I
thought<00:03:45.099> she<00:03:45.370> was<00:03:45.519> really<00:03:45.849> awesome<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.329> drama

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
thought she was really awesome the drama

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.509 
thought she was really awesome the drama

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
just felt more rich the characters felt

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.030 
just felt more rich the characters felt
more<00:03:48.699> realized<00:03:49.209> Thorin<00:03:49.870> again<00:03:50.260> is<00:03:50.530> definitely

replacement speaking of Thorin I will
say<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.419> it<00:03:58.599> seemed<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:59.109> lot<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.470> times

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
say that it seemed a lot of the times

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
some people may be upset by that because

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.199 
some people may be upset by that because
obviously<00:04:05.769> Bilbo<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.669> main<00:04:06.819> character<00:04:07.180> of

The<00:04:07.389> Hobbit<00:04:07.540> book<00:04:07.870> but<00:04:08.139> here<00:04:08.470> he<00:04:08.620> kind<00:04:08.919> of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
The Hobbit book but here he kind of

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.099 
The Hobbit book but here he kind of
feels<00:04:09.250> second<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.329> Thorin<00:04:10.599> which<00:04:10.959> is

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
feels second to Thorin which is

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.869 
feels second to Thorin which is
something<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.560> maybe<00:04:11.980> might<00:04:12.340> bother<00:04:12.519> some

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
something that maybe might bother some

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.339 
something that maybe might bother some
but<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.209> didn't<00:04:13.480> mind<00:04:13.690> because<00:04:13.959> I<00:04:13.989> liked<00:04:14.230> the

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
but I didn't mind because I liked the
