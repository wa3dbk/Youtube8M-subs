00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
make the strips in the beginning and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.620 
make the strips in the beginning and
here's<00:02:05.310> what<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.550> could<00:02:05.790> look<00:02:05.970> like<00:02:06.000> if<00:02:06.300> you<00:02:06.450> did

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
here's what I could look like if you did

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.980 
here's what I could look like if you did
the<00:02:07.440> strips<00:02:08.100> of<00:02:08.220> hair<00:02:08.459> thinner<00:02:08.820> in<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
the strips of hair thinner in the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.610 
the strips of hair thinner in the
beginning<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.490> much<00:02:12.140> thinner<00:02:13.140> little

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
beginning it's a much thinner little

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.380 
beginning it's a much thinner little
pulled<00:02:13.860> back<00:02:14.070> section<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.700> think<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.360> looks

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
pulled back section I think it looks

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.290 
pulled back section I think it looks
good<00:02:15.750> both<00:02:16.050> ways<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.970> next

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
good both ways so this is the next

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
that and then of course from the front

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.320 
that and then of course from the front
so<00:02:31.770> this<00:02:32.010> hairstyle<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.670> obviously<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.120> lot

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
so this hairstyle is obviously a lot

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.630 
so this hairstyle is obviously a lot
more<00:02:33.540> complicated<00:02:33.989> than<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.620> last<00:02:34.800> one<00:02:35.010> but

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
more complicated than the last one but

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.600 
more complicated than the last one but
it's<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:37.470> course<00:02:37.680> you're<00:02:37.890> going<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.100> brush<00:02:38.430> in

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
it's of course you're going to brush in

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.880 
it's of course you're going to brush in
the<00:02:38.640> beginning<00:02:38.850> again<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:40.050> same<00:02:40.410> start<00:02:40.709> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
the beginning again so same start and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.840 
the beginning again so same start and
then<00:02:42.620> your<00:02:43.620> i'm<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.160> going<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.340> turn<00:02:44.519> her<00:02:44.640> on

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
then your i'm just going to turn her on

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.910 
then your i'm just going to turn her on
i<00:02:45.090> already<00:02:45.780> kind<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.230> did<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.560> but<00:02:46.769> you're

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
i already kind of did this but you're

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.770 
i already kind of did this but you're
going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.130> split<00:02:47.370> their<00:02:47.610> hair<00:02:47.850> into<00:02:48.209> three

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
going to split their hair into three

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.530 
going to split their hair into three
sections<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:50.040> try<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.580> make<00:02:50.790> them<00:02:51.030> even<00:02:51.239> but

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
sections and try to make them even but

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.850 
sections and try to make them even but
they<00:02:51.600> don't<00:02:51.750> have<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.959> be<00:02:51.989> exact<00:02:52.440> because<00:02:52.620> in

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
they don't have to be exact because in

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.380 
they don't have to be exact because in
the<00:02:52.980> end<00:02:53.010> they're<00:02:53.760> all<00:02:53.850> going<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.150> come

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the end they're all going to come

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.390 
the end they're all going to come
together<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:55.350> um<00:02:55.760> then<00:02:56.760> within<00:02:57.330> each<00:02:57.570> section

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
together but um then within each section

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.540 
together but um then within each section
we're<00:02:59.400> going<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.940> split<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.420> into<00:03:00.630> another

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
we're going to split it into another

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.500 
we're going to split it into another
three<00:03:02.550> parts<00:03:02.970> actually<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.880> split<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.239> and

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
three parts actually so you split it and

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.960 
three parts actually so you split it and
then<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:08.670> just<00:03:09.620> braid<00:03:10.620> each<00:03:10.920> little<00:03:11.790> section

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
then you just braid each little section

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.899 
then you just braid each little section
like<00:03:14.970> this

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.660 

and<00:03:20.909> then<00:03:21.090> once<00:03:21.659> once<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.349> finish<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:23.430> braid

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
and then once once you finish the braid

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.349 
and then once once you finish the braid
you're<00:03:23.879> just<00:03:24.150> gonna<00:03:24.560> take<00:03:25.560> either<00:03:26.099> a<00:03:26.609> draw

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
you're just gonna take either a draw

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.970 
you're just gonna take either a draw
clip<00:03:27.780> like<00:03:28.379> this<00:03:29.120> one<00:03:30.120> or<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:31.200> rubber<00:03:31.379> band<00:03:31.680> I'm

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
clip like this one or a rubber band I'm

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.240 
clip like this one or a rubber band I'm
going<00:03:32.099> to<00:03:32.189> use<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> clip<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:33.359> just<00:03:34.250> secure

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
going to use a clip and then just secure

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.270 
going to use a clip and then just secure
the<00:03:35.519> braid<00:03:35.819> in<00:03:36.090> place<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.530> thought<00:03:38.010> that's

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
the braid in place so I thought that's

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.130 
the braid in place so I thought that's
how<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.459> would<00:03:38.640> do<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.879> back<00:03:39.060> one<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.540> then

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
how you would do the back one and then

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.059 
how you would do the back one and then
for<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:40.950> side<00:03:41.159> ones<00:03:41.840> same<00:03:42.840> thing<00:03:43.139> pretty<00:03:43.319> much

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.520 

put<00:03:47.069> in<00:03:47.250> three<00:03:47.549> parts<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.150> then<00:03:48.359> bring<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.959> and

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
put in three parts and then bring it and

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.899 
put in three parts and then bring it and
you<00:03:49.620> probably<00:03:50.010> want<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.370> braid<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.760> little

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
you probably want to braid it a little

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.789 
you probably want to braid it a little
bit<00:03:51.090> out<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.269> their<00:03:51.510> face<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.500> way

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
bit out of their face so that way

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.270 
bit out of their face so that way
there's<00:03:53.180> no<00:03:54.620> extra<00:03:55.620> hair<00:03:55.799> in<00:03:55.919> their<00:03:56.069> face<00:03:56.250> when

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
there's no extra hair in their face when

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:06.320 
there's no extra hair in their face when
you're<00:03:56.579> done<00:03:56.790> with<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.090> style<00:03:57.299> so

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.140 

so<00:04:07.330> once<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.080> have<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:09.100> three<00:04:09.580> braids<00:04:09.850> then

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
so once you have the three braids then

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.450 
so once you have the three braids then
and<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:11.140> forgot<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.530> mention<00:04:11.560> actually<00:04:12.280> that

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
and I forgot to mention actually that

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.880 
and I forgot to mention actually that
you<00:04:12.610> have<00:04:12.820> um<00:04:13.320> well<00:04:14.320> you<00:04:14.500> don't<00:04:14.650> have<00:04:14.710> to

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
you have um well you don't have to

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.430 
you have um well you don't have to
better<00:04:15.220> how<00:04:15.520> do<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.700> recommend<00:04:16.120> going<00:04:16.930> as<00:04:17.170> far

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
better how do you recommend going as far

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.729 
better how do you recommend going as far
down<00:04:17.500> as<00:04:17.860> you<00:04:18.190> can<00:04:18.640> and<00:04:19.630> their<00:04:20.080> hair<00:04:20.320> makes<00:04:20.590> it

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
down as you can and their hair makes it

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.420 
down as you can and their hair makes it
a<00:04:20.800> lot<00:04:20.950> easier<00:04:21.010> for<00:04:21.640> this<00:04:22.390> step<00:04:22.600> so<00:04:23.400> make<00:04:24.400> sure

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
a lot easier for this step so make sure

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.460 
a lot easier for this step so make sure
they're<00:04:24.790> these<00:04:25.210> little<00:04:25.270> droplets<00:04:26.050> as<00:04:26.200> far

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
they're these little droplets as far

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.490 
they're these little droplets as far
down<00:04:26.500> as<00:04:26.740> they<00:04:27.370> can<00:04:27.580> be<00:04:28.050> without<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.260> braids

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
down as they can be without the braids

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.590 
down as they can be without the braids
looking<00:04:29.860> bad<00:04:30.040> or<00:04:30.190> falling<00:04:30.430> out<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.730> then<00:04:31.330> this

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
looking bad or falling out and then this

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.880 
looking bad or falling out and then this
part<00:04:32.100> you're<00:04:33.100> just<00:04:33.280> going<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.460> take<00:04:33.700> each

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
part you're just going to take each

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.150 
part you're just going to take each
strand<00:04:35.890> afraid<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:37.740> you're<00:04:38.740> going<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:38.950> braid

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
strand afraid and you're going to braid

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.160 
strand afraid and you're going to braid
all<00:04:39.400> three<00:04:39.700> of<00:04:39.760> them<00:04:39.970> together<00:04:41.280> something<00:04:42.280> a

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
all three of them together something a

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.440 
all three of them together something a
little<00:04:44.170> bit<00:04:44.440> like<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:44.950> and<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:46.150> won't<00:04:46.300> turn

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
little bit like this and it won't turn

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.270 
little bit like this and it won't turn
out<00:04:46.630> perfect<00:04:47.050> mine<00:04:47.440> have<00:04:47.710> never<00:04:47.890> turned<00:04:48.070> out

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
out perfect mine have never turned out

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.690 
out perfect mine have never turned out
perfect<00:04:48.640> actually<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:49.240> that's<00:04:49.960> fine<00:04:50.200> because

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
perfect actually and that's fine because

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.740 
perfect actually and that's fine because
then<00:04:51.700> you're<00:04:51.970> just<00:04:52.000> going<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.390> take<00:04:52.510> these

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
then you're just going to take these

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.630 
then you're just going to take these
little<00:04:53.050> draw<00:04:53.290> clips<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:53.860> you're<00:04:54.130> going<00:04:54.520> to

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
little draw clips and you're going to
