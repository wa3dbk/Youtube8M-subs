and<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:52.360> thing<00:00:52.600> which<00:00:52.780> caught<00:00:53.140> my<00:00:53.170> eyes<00:00:53.579> was

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and one thing which caught my eyes was

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.139 
and one thing which caught my eyes was
the<00:00:55.600> size<00:00:55.870> of<00:00:56.050> divorce<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.430> if<00:00:57.550> you<00:00:57.670> compared

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
the size of divorce so if you compared

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.900 
the size of divorce so if you compared
with<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:58.840> box<00:00:59.680> of<00:00:59.829> the<00:01:00.010> Nokia<00:01:00.629> n95

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
with the box of the Nokia n95

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.980 
with the box of the Nokia n95
this<00:01:03.910> is<00:01:04.090> pretty<00:01:04.510> thin<00:01:05.520> and<00:01:06.930> small<00:01:07.930> too<00:01:09.300> so<00:01:10.300> one

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
this is pretty thin and small too so one

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.590 
this is pretty thin and small too so one
reason<00:01:11.170> for<00:01:11.950> this<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.310> maybe<00:01:12.520> also<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.330> size

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
reason for this is maybe also the size

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.030 
reason for this is maybe also the size
of<00:01:13.870> the<00:01:13.990> e51<00:01:14.500> which<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.550> will<00:01:16.000> show<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:16.300> now
