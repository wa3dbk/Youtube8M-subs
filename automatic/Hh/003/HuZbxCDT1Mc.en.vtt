00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
yeah I will be using funky Kong flame

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.529 
yeah I will be using funky Kong flame
runner<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.289> demonstration<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.550> it's

because<00:01:21.310> um<00:01:22.410> otherwise<00:01:23.410> I<00:01:24.509> am<00:01:25.509> this<00:01:25.720> half<00:01:25.990> pipe

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
because um otherwise I am this half pipe

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.460 
because um otherwise I am this half pipe
is<00:01:26.560> you<00:01:26.890> know<00:01:26.950> half<00:01:27.280> pipe<00:01:27.550> so<00:01:28.020> pretty<00:01:29.020> much<00:01:29.200> if

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
is you know half pipe so pretty much if

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.990 
is you know half pipe so pretty much if
you're<00:01:29.619> over<00:01:29.830> here<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.220> could<00:01:30.460> throw<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.759> off

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
you're over here it could throw you off

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.760 
you're over here it could throw you off
it<00:01:31.180> could<00:01:31.360> like<00:01:31.509> cause<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.440> be<00:01:32.560> slightly

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
it could like cause you to be slightly

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.230 
it could like cause you to be slightly
off<00:01:33.039> by<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.280> time<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.580> actually<00:01:33.729> get<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.119> the

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
off by the time you actually get to the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.060 
off by the time you actually get to the
goose<00:01:34.479> panels<00:01:34.810> it's<00:01:35.020> like<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.289> bike<00:01:35.560> length<00:01:35.860> of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
goose panels it's like a bike length of

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.359 
goose panels it's like a bike length of
distance<00:01:36.550> but<00:01:37.390> um<00:01:37.539> yeah<00:01:38.470> when<00:01:38.890> you're<00:01:39.039> in<00:01:39.190> the

distance but um yeah when you're in the

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.010 
distance but um yeah when you're in the
air<00:01:39.520> all<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.270> need<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.479> do<00:01:40.570> is<00:01:40.690> hold<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.960> you

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.760 
you feel like your alignment slightly
off<00:01:48.850> but<00:01:49.660> I'm<00:01:49.869> most<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.200> time<00:01:50.350> I<00:01:50.380> don't<00:01:50.649> do

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
off but I'm most the time I don't do

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.350 
off but I'm most the time I don't do
that<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.539> you<00:01:52.830> need<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.950> hold<00:01:54.130> down<00:01:54.610> on<00:01:55.030> your

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
that and you need to hold down on your

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.359 
that and you need to hold down on your
analog<00:01:55.750> stick<00:01:56.049> in<00:01:56.229> midair<00:01:56.439> this<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:56.920> important

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
analog stick in midair this is important

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.880 
analog stick in midair this is important
because<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:58.570> makes<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:58.990> so<00:01:59.200> you<00:01:59.229> get<00:01:59.500> enough

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
because it makes it so you get enough

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.780 
because it makes it so you get enough
height<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.790> lot<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.840> times<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:02.409> it<00:02:03.220> helps

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
height a lot of the times and it helps

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.070 
height a lot of the times and it helps
it<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.060> you're<00:02:04.450> facing<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.900> right<00:02:05.049> direction

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
it so you're facing the right direction

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.319 
it so you're facing the right direction
when<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:05.830> land<00:02:06.220> from<00:02:06.579> doing<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.970> good<00:02:07.150> so

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
when you land from doing a good so

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.479 
when you land from doing a good so
you're<00:02:07.450> not<00:02:07.509> hitting<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.960> wall<00:02:08.110> head-on<00:02:08.489> so

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
you're not hitting the wall head-on so

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.610 
you're not hitting the wall head-on so
yeah

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
yeah

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.470 
yeah
I'm<00:02:11.770> like<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.400> know<00:02:12.520> give<00:02:13.150> another<00:02:13.360> example

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
I'm like you know give another example

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.150 
I'm like you know give another example
real<00:02:14.020> quick<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.440> then<00:02:15.130> oh<00:02:16.830> yeah<00:02:17.830> right<00:02:18.099> there

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
real quick and then oh yeah right there

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.010 
real quick and then oh yeah right there
see<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.730> was<00:02:19.000> gonna<00:02:19.120> hit<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.420> wall<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.870> can

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
see I was gonna hit the wall so you can

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.059 
see I was gonna hit the wall so you can
do<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.290> what<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.620> did

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
do that what I just did

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.370 
do that what I just did
slow<00:02:21.310> down<00:02:21.459> but<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:21.940> not<00:02:22.209> doesn't<00:02:23.110> save<00:02:23.230> as

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
slow down but it's not doesn't save as

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.540 
slow down but it's not doesn't save as
much<00:02:23.470> it's<00:02:23.800> probably<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.099> little<00:02:24.250> bit<00:02:24.430> better

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
much it's probably a little bit better

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.820 
much it's probably a little bit better
than<00:02:24.670> hitting<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:24.910> wall<00:02:25.650> but<00:02:26.650> yeah

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
than hitting the wall but yeah

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.949 
than hitting the wall but yeah
occasionally<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:28.120> if<00:02:28.269> you<00:02:28.390> use<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.690> shroom

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
occasionally just if you use the shroom

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.050 
occasionally just if you use the shroom
like<00:02:29.170> too<00:02:29.440> late<00:02:29.650> or<00:02:29.830> something<00:02:30.250> or<00:02:30.730> just<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
like too late or something or just the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.720 
like too late or something or just the
way<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:31.330> go<00:02:31.690> off<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.170> halfpipe<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.550> can

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
way you go off the halfpipe it just can

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.860 
way you go off the halfpipe it just can
make<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.269> you're<00:02:34.480> gonna<00:02:34.540> hit<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.840> wall

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
make it so you're gonna hit the wall

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.150 
make it so you're gonna hit the wall
it's<00:02:35.650> really<00:02:35.739> random<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:37.110> yeah<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:39.069> the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
it's really random but yeah and the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.990 
it's really random but yeah and the
other<00:02:39.280> thing<00:02:39.459> is<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.670> want<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.849> make<00:02:39.940> sure

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
other thing is you want to make sure

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000 
other thing is you want to make sure
like<00:02:40.180> Donkey<00:02:40.630> Kong's<00:02:40.810> head<00:02:41.080> is<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.739> right

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
like Donkey Kong's head is to the right

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.910 
like Donkey Kong's head is to the right
of<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.370> corner<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.060> boost<00:02:43.269> pad<00:02:43.450> up<00:02:43.630> there

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
of that corner of the boost pad up there

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.240 
of that corner of the boost pad up there
that's<00:02:44.920> important<00:02:45.370> as<00:02:45.489> well<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:47.040> yeah<00:02:48.040> this

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
that's important as well and yeah this

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.009 
that's important as well and yeah this
time<00:02:48.430> I'm<00:02:48.610> going<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.790> tilt<00:02:49.060> right<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.510> tiny<00:02:49.810> bit

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
time I'm going to tilt right a tiny bit

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.320 
time I'm going to tilt right a tiny bit
as<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.470> go<00:02:50.500> off<00:02:50.739> there<00:02:51.030> sometimes<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.120> gives<00:02:52.239> me

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
as I go off there sometimes it gives me

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.180 
as I go off there sometimes it gives me
like<00:02:52.480> more<00:02:52.660> distance<00:02:53.080> oh<00:02:53.290> yeah<00:02:53.620> I'm<00:02:53.920> just

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
like more distance oh yeah I'm just

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.630 
like more distance oh yeah I'm just
going<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.400> be<00:02:54.489> up

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
going to be up

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.360 
going to be up
Oh<00:02:56.650> barely<00:02:57.650> okay<00:02:58.330> but<00:02:59.330> yeah<00:02:59.590> I'm<00:03:00.590> gonna<00:03:00.740> give<00:03:01.340> a

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
Oh barely okay but yeah I'm gonna give a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.310 
Oh barely okay but yeah I'm gonna give a
few<00:03:01.610> more<00:03:01.640> examples<00:03:01.760> here<00:03:02.330> showing<00:03:03.020> getting

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
few more examples here showing getting

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.570 
few more examples here showing getting
through<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.620> wall<00:03:03.770> if<00:03:03.980> you're<00:03:04.100> just<00:03:04.310> if<00:03:04.490> you

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
through the wall if you're just if you

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.320 
through the wall if you're just if you
just<00:03:04.610> want<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:04.970> practice<00:03:05.120> uh<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:07.160> know<00:03:07.330> just

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
just want to practice uh you know just

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.520 
just want to practice uh you know just
the<00:03:08.540> first<00:03:08.750> part<00:03:08.960> of<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.170> not<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.350> whole

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
the first part of it not the whole

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.410 
the first part of it not the whole
landing<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:10.220> getting<00:03:10.520> above<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.180> through

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
landing just getting above and through

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.860 
landing just getting above and through
the<00:03:11.540> wall

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
the wall

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.300 
the wall
you<00:03:12.140> don't<00:03:12.290> need<00:03:12.410> shrooms<00:03:12.710> you<00:03:12.830> could<00:03:13.040> just<00:03:13.160> be

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
you don't need shrooms you could just be

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.610 
you don't need shrooms you could just be
practicing<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:13.940> this<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.450> go<00:03:15.080> up<00:03:15.230> like<00:03:15.440> that

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
practicing like this and go up like that

oh I just did it journalist haha that's
funny

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
funny

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.960 
funny
um<00:03:19.810> seats<00:03:20.810> rimless<00:03:21.260> like<00:03:21.470> it's<00:03:21.760> possible<00:03:22.760> but

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
um seats rimless like it's possible but

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.020 
um seats rimless like it's possible but
it's<00:03:23.150> it's<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:24.560> random<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.520> would<00:03:25.850> not

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
it's it's so random so I would not

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.640 
it's it's so random so I would not
attempt<00:03:26.420> this<00:03:26.630> room<00:03:26.840> less<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.200> way<00:03:27.290> I'm<00:03:27.380> doing

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
attempt this room less the way I'm doing

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.710 
attempt this room less the way I'm doing
it<00:03:27.770> I<00:03:27.890> have<00:03:28.040> no<00:03:28.310> especially<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.209> funky<00:03:29.570> Hall

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
it I have no especially a funky Hall

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.030 
it I have no especially a funky Hall
it's<00:03:29.959> even<00:03:30.140> harder<00:03:30.320> a<00:03:30.350> phone<00:03:30.590> be<00:03:30.740> with<00:03:30.860> Daisy

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
it's even harder a phone be with Daisy
