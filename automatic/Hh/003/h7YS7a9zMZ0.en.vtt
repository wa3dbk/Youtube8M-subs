the<00:04:22.770> modern<00:04:23.460> armor

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
the modern armor

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.939 
the modern armor

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
because it's just really really

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.820 
because it's just really really
cool-looking<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.020> could<00:04:48.139> even<00:04:48.469> be<00:04:48.800> a

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
cool-looking and it could even be a

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.670 
cool-looking and it could even be a
movie<00:04:49.219> figure<00:04:49.569> if<00:04:50.569> they<00:04:50.750> wanted<00:04:51.110> them<00:04:51.319> to<00:04:51.530> be

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
so as you can see the colors are very

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.469
