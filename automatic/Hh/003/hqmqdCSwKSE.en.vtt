here's<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.170> basic<00:02:01.320> sautee<00:02:02.009> method<00:02:02.430> step<00:02:03.149> one

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
here's the basic sautee method step one

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.100 
here's the basic sautee method step one
in<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.689> saute<00:02:04.140> method

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
in a saute method

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.260 
in a saute method
hot<00:02:05.680> first<00:02:07.229> that's<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.619> hot<00:02:08.890> pan<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.759> know<00:02:09.820> if<00:02:10.119> the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
hot first that's a hot pan I know if the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.740 
hot first that's a hot pan I know if the
water<00:02:10.509> evaporates<00:02:11.320> at<00:02:11.790> 212<00:02:12.790> degrees<00:02:13.000> and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
water evaporates at 212 degrees and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.340 
water evaporates at 212 degrees and
proteins<00:02:14.530> coagulate<00:02:14.890> at<00:02:15.460> 165<00:02:16.300> this<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.140> now

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
proteins coagulate at 165 this is now

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.880

thing I notice about my chicken breast

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.050 
thing I notice about my chicken breast
is<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.470> starts<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.890> turn<00:03:15.070> white<00:03:15.400> around<00:03:15.910> the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
is it starts to turn white around the

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.150 
is it starts to turn white around the
edges<00:03:16.480> right<00:03:16.720> we've<00:03:16.930> all<00:03:17.080> seen<00:03:17.350> this<00:03:17.620> that's

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
edges right we've all seen this that's

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.699 
edges right we've all seen this that's
the<00:03:18.459> coagulation<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.390> proteins<00:03:19.989> beginning

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
the coagulation of proteins beginning

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.770 
the coagulation of proteins beginning
that's<00:03:21.040> our<00:03:21.280> stiffening<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.000> shrinking<00:03:22.540> and

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
that's our stiffening and shrinking and

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.500 
that's our stiffening and shrinking and
after<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.140> certain<00:03:23.440> amount<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.920> time<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:25.239> speed

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
after a certain amount of time to speed

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.390 
after a certain amount of time to speed
things<00:03:25.720> along<00:03:25.900> I'm<00:03:26.410> gonna<00:03:26.650> take<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:27.010> out<00:03:27.130> and

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
look what's left in the pan brown bits

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.449 
look what's left in the pan brown bits
it's<00:03:30.489> called<00:03:30.760> fond<00:03:31.120> fo<00:03:31.780> ND<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.590> I'm<00:03:32.830> very<00:03:33.070> fond
