00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
the other very large so just take a

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.069 
the other very large so just take a
bunch<00:04:20.070> here<00:04:20.510> yep<00:04:21.510> looks<00:04:21.780> like<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.930> took<00:04:22.019> a

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
bunch here yep looks like you took a

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.620 
bunch here yep looks like you took a
bunch<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:22.830> block<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:24.270> wants<00:04:24.450> to

bunch and in that block and wants to

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.660 
bunch and in that block and wants to
solve<00:04:24.900> on<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.229> other<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:26.130> far<00:04:26.539> another<00:04:27.539> cell

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
solve on the other so far another cell

of land if any of those dies it's a

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.340 
of land if any of those dies it's a

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
bunch of drawers and the one solemn is

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.100 
bunch of drawers and the one solemn is
66<00:04:38.380> I'd<00:04:39.380> probably<00:04:40.090> with<00:04:41.090> that<00:04:41.270> o-ring<00:04:41.420> hit<00:04:41.900> the

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
66 I'd probably with that o-ring hit the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.190 
66 I'd probably with that o-ring hit the
image<00:04:43.330> that's<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:45.530> would<00:04:45.650> make<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:46.840> solemn<00:04:47.840> CD

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
image that's it would make the solemn CD

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.460 
image that's it would make the solemn CD
box<00:04:48.440> earlier<00:04:49.450> that<00:04:50.450> sees<00:04:50.690> him<00:04:50.870> to<00:04:51.020> life<00:04:51.230> and

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
box earlier that sees him to life and

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.120 
box earlier that sees him to life and
then<00:04:51.620> he<00:04:51.680> hits<00:04:51.860> those<00:04:52.460> overhang<00:04:52.880> on<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.270> image

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
then he hits those overhang on the image

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.200 
then he hits those overhang on the image
you're<00:04:55.130> saving<00:04:55.430> yourself<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.760> bunch<00:04:56.000> of<00:04:56.060> life

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
you're saving yourself a bunch of life

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.680 
you're saving yourself a bunch of life
here<00:04:57.730> that's<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:58.880> only<00:04:59.030> thing<00:04:59.150> I<00:04:59.360> would<00:04:59.540> do

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
here that's the only thing I would do

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.280 
here that's the only thing I would do
differently<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:01.610> looks<00:05:01.820> like<00:05:02.150> he<00:05:02.840> has<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:02.990> beast

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
differently it looks like he has a beast

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.710 
differently it looks like he has a beast
within<00:05:03.680> also<00:05:05.440> hard<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.500> tell<00:05:07.630> again<00:05:08.630> I

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
within also hard to tell again I

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.060 
within also hard to tell again I
probably<00:05:08.900> blocked<00:05:09.290> earlier<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.770> then<00:05:09.860> played

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
probably blocked earlier and then played

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.790 
probably blocked earlier and then played
all<00:05:10.250> right<00:05:10.400> on<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.760> image<00:05:11.150> so<00:05:12.140> you<00:05:12.500> know

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
all right on the image so you know

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.930 
all right on the image so you know
you're<00:05:12.920> not<00:05:13.040> facing<00:05:13.280> with<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.760> silver<00:05:14.030> heart

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
you're not facing with a silver heart

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.640 
you're not facing with a silver heart
but<00:05:16.940> you<00:05:17.390> know<00:05:17.480> and<00:05:17.660> you<00:05:17.930> could<00:05:18.050> beast<00:05:18.380> within

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
but you know and you could beast within

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.110 
but you know and you could beast within
in<00:05:18.860> response<00:05:21.340> yeah<00:05:22.340> he<00:05:22.700> would<00:05:22.820> have<00:05:22.910> enough

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
in response yeah he would have enough

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.030 
in response yeah he would have enough
mana<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.420> do<00:05:23.570> that<00:05:23.750> and<00:05:24.350> you'd<00:05:24.560> be<00:05:24.710> sitting<00:05:24.890> in

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
mana to do that and you'd be sitting in

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.190 
mana to do that and you'd be sitting in
response<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.730> like<00:05:25.850> a<00:05:25.880> swing<00:05:26.240> hold<00:05:26.900> up<00:05:27.050> some

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
response to like a swing hold up some

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.500 
response to like a swing hold up some
blockers<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:28.100> next<00:05:28.400> turn<00:05:28.490> play<00:05:28.810> silver<00:05:29.810> heart

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
blockers the next turn play silver heart

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.900 
blockers the next turn play silver heart
and<00:05:32.510> I'm<00:05:32.690> staxus<00:05:33.200> land<00:05:33.440> up<00:05:33.670> looks<00:05:34.670> like<00:05:34.820> you

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
and I'm staxus land up looks like you

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
and I'm staxus land up looks like you
might<00:05:35.060> be<00:05:35.090> playing<00:05:35.270> something<00:05:35.570> big<00:05:35.720> here

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
might be playing something big here

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.490 
might be playing something big here
maybe<00:05:36.110> a<00:05:36.200> warm<00:05:36.410> oil<00:05:36.650> engine<00:05:38.260> Fanning<00:05:39.260> it<00:05:39.350> out

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
maybe a warm oil engine Fanning it out

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.870 
maybe a warm oil engine Fanning it out
there's<00:05:39.770> two<00:05:40.070> there's<00:05:40.550> three<00:05:42.940> four<00:05:45.880> don't

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
there's two there's three four don't

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.220 
there's two there's three four don't
think<00:05:47.090> it<00:05:47.150> matters<00:05:47.240> too<00:05:47.480> much<00:05:47.600> what<00:05:47.750> color<00:05:47.990> she

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
think it matters too much what color she

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.600 
think it matters too much what color she
leaves<00:05:48.530> up<00:05:48.740> here<00:05:49.690> there's<00:05:50.690> tap<00:05:51.050> 614<00:05:52.010> no<00:05:52.190> it's<00:05:52.520> a

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
leaves up here there's tap 614 no it's a

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.040 
leaves up here there's tap 614 no it's a
frost<00:05:52.820> titan<00:05:53.090> tapping<00:05:53.420> one<00:05:53.570> of<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:53.780> silver

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
frost titan tapping one of the silver

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.530 
frost titan tapping one of the silver
hearts<00:05:54.320> and<00:05:54.530> then<00:05:55.430> he<00:05:55.490> swings<00:05:55.760> out<00:05:55.940> I<00:05:55.970> don't

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540

think James have enough to block here I

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.730 
think James have enough to block here I
think<00:05:59.120> it's<00:05:59.240> just<00:05:59.390> going<00:05:59.510> to<00:05:59.540> be<00:05:59.600> enough<00:05:59.930> James

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
think it's just going to be enough James

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.320 
think it's just going to be enough James
