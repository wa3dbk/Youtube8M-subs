it's<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.859> great<00:03:44.099> finish<00:03:44.489> for<00:03:44.519> pine

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.809 

especially<00:03:50.769> on<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:50.920> molding<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.370> can<00:03:51.519> take<00:03:51.700> it

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
especially on the molding I can take it

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.550 
especially on the molding I can take it
back<00:03:51.939> a<00:03:51.999> little<00:03:52.180> bit<00:03:52.389> you<00:03:52.510> can<00:03:52.659> see<00:03:52.719> the<00:03:53.170> wood

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
back a little bit you can see the wood

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.569 
back a little bit you can see the wood
showing<00:03:53.829> through<00:03:54.249> and<00:03:55.920> maybe<00:03:56.920> on<00:03:57.069> edges<00:03:57.430> as

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
showing through and maybe on edges as

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:58.920 
showing through and maybe on edges as
well<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:57.939> see<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> little<00:03:58.389> bit<00:03:58.510> there<00:03:58.719> if<00:03:58.810> you

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
well you see a little bit there if you

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.759 
well you see a little bit there if you
want<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.109> have<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.290> little<00:03:59.499> bit<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.650> a

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
want to have a little bit of a

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.649 
want to have a little bit of a
distressed<00:04:00.189> look<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.639> can<00:04:00.879> take<00:04:01.389> it<00:04:01.510> right

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
distressed look you can take it right

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.500 
distressed look you can take it right
back<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.170> pine<00:04:05.879> now<00:04:06.879> this<00:04:07.030> sample<00:04:07.389> was<00:04:07.480> a

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
back to the pine now this sample was a

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.030 
back to the pine now this sample was a
little<00:04:07.750> bit<00:04:07.900> rough<00:04:08.079> here<00:04:08.349> anyway<00:04:08.680> but<00:04:08.859> that's

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
little bit rough here anyway but that's

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
little bit rough here anyway but that's
actually<00:04:09.219> lends<00:04:09.670> itself<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:12.700> overall

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
actually lends itself to the overall

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.460 
actually lends itself to the overall
finish<00:04:14.909> weather<00:04:15.909> you<00:04:16.000> can<00:04:16.180> see<00:04:16.419> that's<00:04:16.599> buffed

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
finish weather you can see that's buffed

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.849 
finish weather you can see that's buffed
up<00:04:17.680> really<00:04:17.919> nicely<00:04:18.130> with<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:19.690> wax<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.289> you're

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
up really nicely with the wax and you're

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.680 
up really nicely with the wax and you're
showing<00:04:21.099> a<00:04:21.130> little<00:04:21.250> bit<00:04:21.400> of<00:04:21.639> the<00:04:21.820> pine<00:04:22.419> wood

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
showing a little bit of the pine wood

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.710 
showing a little bit of the pine wood
through<00:04:26.820> I'm<00:04:27.820> going<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:28.030> put<00:04:28.150> those<00:04:28.300> samples

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
through I'm going to put those samples

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.390 
through I'm going to put those samples
to<00:04:28.780> one<00:04:28.960> side<00:04:29.169> I<00:04:29.380> will<00:04:29.740> just<00:04:30.009> show<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:30.190> one

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
to one side I will just show you one

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.930 
to one side I will just show you one
thing<00:04:30.639> you<00:04:31.599> can<00:04:31.870> use<00:04:32.199> fine<00:04:33.160> while<00:04:33.430> we'll<00:04:33.639> just

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
thing you can use fine while we'll just

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.830 
thing you can use fine while we'll just
a<00:04:34.060> buff<00:04:34.410> finally<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:37.810> is<00:04:39.690> stock<00:04:40.690> of

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
a buff finally this is stock of

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.270 
a buff finally this is stock of
finishing<00:04:41.259> why<00:04:41.410> will<00:04:41.680> it<00:04:41.710> surf

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
finishing why will it surf

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.610 
finishing why will it surf
triple<00:04:43.150> nought<00:04:45.419> that's<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.599> one<00:04:46.750> Chris<00:04:47.410> gives

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
triple nought that's the one Chris gives

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.499 
triple nought that's the one Chris gives
another<00:04:47.860> another<00:04:48.190> sort<00:04:48.490> of<00:04:48.610> buffing

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
another another sort of buffing

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.810 
another another sort of buffing
dimension<00:04:50.169> to<00:04:50.289> that<00:04:50.470> as<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.370> can<00:04:51.460> see<00:04:51.580> from

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
dimension to that as you can see from

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.839 
dimension to that as you can see from
this<00:04:52.000> sample<00:04:52.270> I've<00:04:53.229> used<00:04:53.590> more<00:04:53.919> wax<00:04:54.340> finish

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
this sample I've used more wax finish

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.290 
this sample I've used more wax finish
varnish<00:04:55.389> and<00:04:55.630> less<00:04:55.840> emulsion<00:04:56.789> in<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:57.909> mixture

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
varnish and less emulsion in the mixture

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.749 
varnish and less emulsion in the mixture
and<00:04:58.479> that<00:04:58.599> allows<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.320> timber<00:04:59.770> to<00:05:00.580> show

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
and that allows the timber to show

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:08.340 
and that allows the timber to show
through

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:22.310 

oh<00:05:15.240> yeah<00:05:17.820> it<00:05:18.820> feels<00:05:19.090> really<00:05:19.330> nice<00:05:19.620> very<00:05:20.620> waxy

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
oh yeah it feels really nice very waxy

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.900 
oh yeah it feels really nice very waxy
lose<00:05:23.320> to<00:05:23.470> one<00:05:23.620> side

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.470 

now<00:05:27.910> this<00:05:28.060> little<00:05:28.270> shelf<00:05:28.540> unit<00:05:30.480> I've

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
now this little shelf unit I've

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.810 
now this little shelf unit I've
decorated<00:05:31.690> in<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.170> same<00:05:32.410> way<00:05:32.680> with<00:05:33.580> a<00:05:33.610> wood

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
decorated in the same way with a wood

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.400 
decorated in the same way with a wood
wash<00:05:34.530> using<00:05:35.530> a<00:05:35.710> set<00:05:35.860> of<00:05:35.890> purple<00:05:36.400> color<00:05:36.640> and<00:05:37.410> it

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
wash using a set of purple color and it

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.310 
wash using a set of purple color and it
took<00:05:38.560> about<00:05:38.830> an<00:05:39.220> hour<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.640> do<00:05:39.850> I<00:05:40.170> did<00:05:41.170> it<00:05:41.260> in

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
took about an hour to do I did it in

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.800 
took about an hour to do I did it in
sections<00:05:42.780> so<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:43.990> wash<00:05:44.500> didn't<00:05:44.800> overlap<00:05:45.810> and

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
sections so the wash didn't overlap and

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.370
