easier<00:03:11.919> if<00:03:11.980> everyone<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.730> everything<00:03:13.000> were

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
easier if everyone and everything were

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.789 
easier if everyone and everything were
just<00:03:13.510> destroyed<00:03:16.079> zelo's<00:03:17.079> how<00:03:17.260> can<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.560> say
