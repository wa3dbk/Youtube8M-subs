which looks like it which is a bunch of

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:40.790 
which looks like it which is a bunch of
islands<00:00:39.390> was<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:39.720> shaped<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.379> shape<00:00:40.710> of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
islands was just shaped in the shape of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.040 
islands was just shaped in the shape of
a<00:00:40.890> world<00:00:41.070> uh<00:00:41.309> he<00:00:41.940> did<00:00:42.120> he<00:00:42.330> is<00:00:42.449> under

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
a world uh he did he is under

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
a world uh he did he is under
construction<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.650> that<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.550> soon<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.790> he

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
construction to that and as soon as he

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.750 
construction to that and as soon as he
completes<00:00:45.540> it<00:00:45.750> i<00:00:45.839> will<00:00:46.019> show<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.519> he<00:00:47.519> makes<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
completes it i will show it he makes a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.310 
completes it i will show it he makes a
lot<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> good<00:00:47.969> maps<00:00:48.210> most<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.020> based<00:00:49.140> in

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
lot of good maps most of it based in

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.900 
lot of good maps most of it based in
Dubai<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.280> based<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.670> Dubai<00:00:50.879> as

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
pretty like lake in the middle or kind

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.570 
pretty like lake in the middle or kind
of<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> river<00:01:23.520> thing<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.340> light<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
of a river thing with the light so a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.969 
of a river thing with the light so a
very<00:01:27.030> cool<00:01:27.270> design<00:01:27.509> very<00:01:27.720> cool<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
very cool design very cool and then you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.999 
very cool design very cool and then you
can<00:01:29.100> go<00:01:29.189> over<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.610> well<00:01:30.020> let's<00:01:31.020> go<00:01:31.200> below

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
can go over here as well let's go below

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.719 
can go over here as well let's go below
let's<00:01:32.820> shop<00:01:33.210> over<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:33.960> uh<00:01:34.549> then<00:01:35.549> there's

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
let's shop over here uh then there's

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.940 
let's shop over here uh then there's
another<00:01:35.790> corridor<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.380> guess<00:01:37.770> because

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
another corridor with I guess because

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.249 
another corridor with I guess because
it's<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.340> nice<00:01:38.490> biome<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.360> covered<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.720> ice<00:01:39.930> uh

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it's a nice biome it's covered in ice uh

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.810 
it's a nice biome it's covered in ice uh
which<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.130> good<00:01:41.159> um<00:01:42.860> but<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.250> turn<00:01:44.579> no

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
which is not good um but we can turn no

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.780 
which is not good um but we can turn no
clip<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.710> give<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.829> an<00:01:46.950> arrow<00:01:47.250> view<00:01:47.579> of

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
clip on and give you an arrow view of

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.910 
clip on and give you an arrow view of
the<00:01:48.450> map<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.470> area<00:01:49.740> over

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the map so then we have this area over

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.389 
the map so then we have this area over
here<00:01:50.329> which<00:01:51.680> turns<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.920> more<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
here which turns out to be more like I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.060 
here which turns out to be more like I
guess<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> food<00:01:54.240> court<00:01:54.600> type<00:01:54.899> area<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:55.979> is

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
guess a food court type area what is

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.480 
guess a food court type area what is
this<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.630> projection<00:01:57.630> room<00:01:58.500> ooh<00:01:58.710> fiction<00:01:59.280> book

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
from one hit game mode 0 there we go

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.020 
from one hit game mode 0 there we go
step<00:02:13.980> back<00:02:14.100> um<00:02:15.170> whoa<00:02:16.170> oh<00:02:16.410> hey<00:02:17.400> that's<00:02:17.579> cool<00:02:17.790> I

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.360 
waterslide I don't know if it's based
off<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.780> real<00:03:10.900> mole<00:03:11.140> but<00:03:11.380> if<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:11.710> they<00:03:12.250> have<00:03:12.340> a

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
off a real mole but if it is they have a

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.370 
off a real mole but if it is they have a
water<00:03:12.550> slide<00:03:12.790> which<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.270> awesome<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:14.260> they

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
have a few big water slides this huge

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.050 
have a few big water slides this huge
drop<00:03:17.050> their<00:03:17.320> which<00:03:17.470> look<00:03:17.650> awesome<00:03:18.250> this<00:03:18.490> even

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
drop their which look awesome this even

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.440 
drop their which look awesome this even
larger<00:03:19.510> drop<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:21.040> even<00:03:21.370> larger<00:03:21.700> drop<00:03:21.970> so

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
larger drop and this even larger drop so

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.120 
larger drop and this even larger drop so
let's<00:03:22.660> take<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.840> ride<00:03:23.050> on<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.290> slide<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.650> do<00:03:24.040> not

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
let's take a ride on a slide that do not

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.760 
let's take a ride on a slide that do not
has<00:03:24.340> ice<00:03:24.550> as<00:03:24.970> part<00:03:25.270> of<00:03:25.330> its<00:03:25.510> thing<00:03:25.810> um<00:03:28.740> so<00:03:29.740> I

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
has ice as part of its thing um so I

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.220 
has ice as part of its thing um so I
guess<00:03:29.980> all<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.090> completely<00:03:31.600> safe<00:03:31.960> you

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
guess all that is completely safe you

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.540 
guess all that is completely safe you
can<00:03:32.380> totally<00:03:32.560> just<00:03:32.800> divide<00:03:33.070> up<00:03:33.190> into<00:03:33.250> two

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
can totally just divide up into two

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.650 
can totally just divide up into two
different<00:03:33.730> things<00:03:33.970> that's<00:03:34.240> awesome<00:03:34.660> uh<00:03:36.660> okay

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
different things that's awesome uh okay

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.500 
different things that's awesome uh okay
