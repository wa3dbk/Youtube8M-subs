things that will lead us that I can suck

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.379 
things that will lead us that I can suck
up<00:04:29.560> that<00:04:29.740> moisture<00:04:30.340> in<00:04:30.430> them<00:04:30.550> on<00:04:30.669> here<00:04:30.849> because

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
up that moisture in them on here because

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.779 
up that moisture in them on here because
I<00:04:31.599> definitely<00:04:31.900> need<00:04:32.229> that<00:04:32.259> so<00:04:32.949> this<00:04:33.610> is

I definitely need that so this is

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.270 
I definitely need that so this is
definitely<00:04:34.030> regret<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:34.960> even<00:04:35.860> if<00:04:35.949> it<00:04:36.070> did

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280

definitely regret and even if it did
work<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.759> still<00:04:36.820> think<00:04:37.210> it's<00:04:37.360> too<00:04:37.419> expensive

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970

work I still think it's too expensive
and<00:04:39.970> i<00:04:40.509> don't<00:04:40.780> think<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:41.139> it<00:04:41.650> just<00:04:42.039> doesn't

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310
