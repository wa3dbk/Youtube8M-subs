where<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.119> guy's<00:01:24.330> lagging<00:01:25.189> but<00:01:26.189> um<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:27.170> know

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
where this guy's lagging but um I know

on<00:02:16.830> their<00:02:16.980> team<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.340> lagging<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.880> nobody<00:02:18.240> on

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
on their team is lagging and nobody on

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.630 
on their team is lagging and nobody on
my<00:02:18.570> team<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.960> lagging<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:19.560> obviously<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.460> guy

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
my team is lagging so obviously this guy

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.460 
my team is lagging so obviously this guy
has<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.880> have<00:02:21.120> some<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.720> worst<00:02:21.990> internet

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
has to have some of the worst internet

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.890 
has to have some of the worst internet
connection<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:23.850> lagging<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.450> bad<00:02:24.690> and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
connection to be lagging that bad and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.810 
connection to be lagging that bad and
invisible<00:02:25.350> but<00:02:25.800> even<00:02:26.100> then<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.280> still<00:02:26.670> don't

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
invisible but even then I still don't

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.670 
invisible but even then I still don't
think<00:02:26.910> he's<00:02:27.210> lagging<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.750> I'm<00:02:28.140> still<00:02:28.500> think

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
think he's lagging that I'm still think

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.810 
think he's lagging that I'm still think
he's<00:02:28.770> lagging<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.160> just<00:02:29.340> think<00:02:29.490> he's<00:02:29.640> just

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
he's lagging I just think he's just

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.810 
he's lagging I just think he's just
doing<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.210> on<00:02:30.510> purpose<00:02:31.190> because<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.400> don't

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820
