00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.960 
build up some of the scaling inside
that's<00:01:03.739> what<00:01:03.799> they<00:01:03.949> consider<00:01:04.400> they<00:01:04.640> call<00:01:04.820> it

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
that's what they consider they call it

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.240 
that's what they consider they call it
corrosion<00:01:05.510> inside<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.990> radiator<00:01:06.350> when<00:01:07.130> it

corrosion inside the radiator when it
starts<00:01:07.520> building<00:01:07.760> up<00:01:07.970> like<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.570> start

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
starts building up like this you start

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.410 
starts building up like this you start
getting<00:01:08.930> fluid<00:01:09.350> loss<00:01:09.560> flow<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:10.460> if<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.030> can't

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
getting fluid loss flow and if it can't

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.090 
getting fluid loss flow and if it can't
flow<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:11.900> cannot<00:01:12.140> dissipate<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.650> heat<00:01:12.770> out<00:01:12.950> of

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
flow it cannot dissipate the heat out of

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.350 
flow it cannot dissipate the heat out of
the<00:01:13.220> radiator<00:01:13.520> like<00:01:13.760> it<00:01:13.880> should<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:14.240> the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
the radiator like it should so the

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.940 
the radiator like it should so the
engine<00:01:14.600> can<00:01:14.630> maintain<00:01:14.869> a<00:01:15.140> lower<00:01:15.560> temperature

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
engine can maintain a lower temperature

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.160 
engine can maintain a lower temperature
and<00:01:16.580> keep<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:16.850> from<00:01:16.940> overheating

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.100 

this<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:21.070> an<00:01:21.189> example<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:22.030> radiator<00:01:22.479> that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
this is an example of a radiator that

this is an example of a radiator that
has<00:01:23.290> been<00:01:23.470> totally<00:01:23.799> neglected<00:01:24.340> due<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.759> lack

of having cooling system flushes this
radiator<00:01:28.150> is<00:01:28.330> probably<00:01:28.600> going<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.840> set<00:01:28.990> a
