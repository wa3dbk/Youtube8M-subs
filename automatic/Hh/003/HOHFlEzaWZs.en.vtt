00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
the Costa Rican tiger around so I guess

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.400 
the Costa Rican tiger around so I guess
we'll<00:00:21.359> start<00:00:21.600> off<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.869> tiger<00:00:22.260> room

yeah they're Stella right now that's

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.200 
yeah they're Stella right now that's
probably<00:01:22.080> around<00:01:22.530> how<00:01:23.370> would<00:01:23.580> say<00:01:23.790> two<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
probably around how would say two and a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.460 
probably around how would say two and a
half<00:01:24.360> inches<00:01:26.810> growth<00:01:27.810> rates<00:01:28.080> are<00:01:28.229> pretty

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
half inches growth rates are pretty

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.350 
half inches growth rates are pretty
quick<00:01:29.300> they<00:01:30.300> probably<00:01:31.140> will<00:01:31.380> mature<00:01:31.619> upped<00:01:31.979> in

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
quick they probably will mature upped in

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.810 
quick they probably will mature upped in
two<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.479> three<00:01:33.510> years<00:01:33.900> time<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.440> a<00:01:34.590> female

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
two to three years time if it's a female

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.460 
two to three years time if it's a female
probably<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:35.940> it's<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> male<00:01:36.420> helping<00:01:37.080> take<00:01:37.229> one

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
probably if it's a male helping take one

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.710 
probably if it's a male helping take one
or<00:01:37.590> two<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:39.440> just<00:01:40.440> like<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> tiger<00:01:41.369> rump<00:01:41.720> very

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
or two and just like the tiger rump very

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.370 
or two and just like the tiger rump very
similar<00:01:43.399> tarantula<00:01:44.399> doors<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.940> called<00:01:45.350> me<00:01:46.350> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
similar tarantula doors it's called me a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.420 
similar tarantula doors it's called me a
trio<00:01:46.649> Palma<00:01:47.190> zipper<00:01:47.580> atom<00:01:47.970> which<00:01:48.869> looks

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
trio Palma zipper atom which looks

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.920 
trio Palma zipper atom which looks
identical<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.700> specimen<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.810> only

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
identical to this specimen but the only

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.820 
identical to this specimen but the only
difference<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.780> fashion<00:01:55.259> has<00:01:55.800> a

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
difference is that the fashion has a

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.700 
difference is that the fashion has a
pink<00:01:56.100> hair<00:01:56.369> pace<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.750> zipper<00:01:58.050> adam<00:01:58.440> has

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
pink hair pace and the zipper adam has

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.090 
pink hair pace and the zipper adam has
an<00:01:59.100> orange<00:01:59.490> one<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.960> hopefully<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.619> find<00:02:01.979> one

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
an orange one so hopefully if I find one

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.859 
an orange one so hopefully if I find one
has<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> broad<00:02:02.970> I'm<00:02:03.119> probably<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.720> near

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
has a broad I'm probably in the near

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.199 
has a broad I'm probably in the near
future<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.610> probably<00:02:05.610> will<00:02:06.539> get<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.930> just<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
future I probably will get it just to

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.170 
future I probably will get it just to
see<00:02:09.209> what<00:02:09.390> their<00:02:09.539> although<00:02:10.850> that's<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:11.970> very

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
see what their although that's a very

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.610 
see what their although that's a very
cool<00:02:12.420> T<00:02:13.910> now<00:02:14.910> if<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.239> look<00:02:15.390> closely<00:02:15.750> I'm<00:02:16.320> just

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
cool T now if you look closely I'm just

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.220 
cool T now if you look closely I'm just
going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.890> zoom<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.720> able<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.019> see

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
going to zoom in you can be able to see

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.390 
going to zoom in you can be able to see
the<00:02:19.470> epigastric<00:02:20.220> furrow<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.830> has<00:02:23.070> and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
the epigastric furrow that it has and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.190 
the epigastric furrow that it has and
this<00:02:23.519> indicates<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.420> female<00:02:24.870> that's

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
this indicates it's the female that's

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
this indicates it's the female that's
the<00:02:25.320> debentures<00:02:25.739> shot

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.309 

so

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.589 

I<00:02:37.379> know<00:02:38.129> if<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.549> can<00:02:38.700> see<00:02:38.879> between<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.329> first

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
I know if you can see between the first

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.080 
I know if you can see between the first

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
making it sometime soon so here's one of

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.280 
making it sometime soon so here's one of

up with scorpions but they seem to be
private<00:05:00.550> animals<00:05:01.150> so<00:05:01.660> they<00:05:02.140> just<00:05:02.470> don't<00:05:03.100> like

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340
