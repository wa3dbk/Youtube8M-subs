00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
let's go for the front so we've got to

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.420 
let's go for the front so we've got to
remove<00:01:04.899> this<00:01:05.080> back<00:01:05.350> in<00:01:05.560> shape<00:01:05.800> first<00:01:06.160> of<00:01:06.340> all

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
remove this back in shape first of all

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.240 
remove this back in shape first of all
and<00:01:07.140> let's<00:01:08.140> just<00:01:08.229> make<00:01:08.560> sure<00:01:08.619> there's<00:01:09.070> no

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
and let's just make sure there's no

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.150 
and let's just make sure there's no
additional<00:01:09.789> dust<00:01:10.119> on<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.539> part<00:01:11.520> looks<00:01:12.520> good

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
additional dust on this part looks good

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
additional dust on this part looks good
let's<00:01:15.160> remove<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.850> backing<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.909> quite<00:01:19.119> a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
let's remove the backing it's quite a

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.130 
let's remove the backing it's quite a
rigid<00:01:19.780> material<00:01:20.560> so<00:01:20.710> it's<00:01:20.799> not<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.979> flimsy<00:01:21.310> film

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
rigid material so it's not a flimsy film

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.289 
rigid material so it's not a flimsy film
so<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.200> should<00:01:23.500> be<00:01:23.710> fairly<00:01:24.100> easy<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.880> position

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
so it should be fairly easy to position

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.450 
so it should be fairly easy to position
let's<00:01:26.080> move<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.650> out<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.930> way<00:01:29.079> so<00:01:29.619> that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
let's move this out of the way so that

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:39.020 
let's move this out of the way so that
we<00:01:30.670> can<00:01:30.820> concentrate<00:01:31.090> on<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:31.840> installation

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.210 

let's<00:01:39.659> actually<00:01:39.840> go<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.560> home<00:01:40.770> button<00:01:41.010> in

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
let's actually go for the home button in

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.680 
let's actually go for the home button in
first<00:01:41.549> because<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.060> looks<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.330> there's<00:01:42.600> a

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
first because it looks like there's a

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.240 
first because it looks like there's a
little<00:01:42.810> bit<00:01:42.990> more<00:01:43.200> leeway<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:43.890> top<00:01:44.250> edge

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
little bit more leeway on that top edge

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:55.820 
little bit more leeway on that top edge
just<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.640> into<00:01:48.000> place

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.420 

and<00:01:56.370> there<00:01:56.580> we<00:01:56.760> go<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.830> just<00:01:58.830> have<00:01:59.010> a<00:01:59.040> closer

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and there we go I just have a closer

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.700 
and there we go I just have a closer
look<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.570> that's<00:02:00.690> perfectly<00:02:01.440> lined

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
look at that so that's perfectly lined

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.340 
look at that so that's perfectly lined
up<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.220> home<00:02:02.460> button<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.810> let's<00:02:04.020> just

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
up on that home button so let's just

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.450 
up on that home button so let's just
press<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.130> into<00:02:05.340> place<00:02:07.009> make<00:02:08.009> sure<00:02:08.040> that

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
press this into place make sure that

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.590 
press this into place make sure that
everything<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.210> stuck<00:02:09.750> down<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.450> that's

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
everything is stuck down so that's

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.440 
everything is stuck down so that's
really<00:02:16.080> cool<00:02:16.320> now<00:02:16.920> as<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.100> mentioned<00:02:17.130> there<00:02:17.880> is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
really cool now as I mentioned there is

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.260 
really cool now as I mentioned there is
a<00:02:19.730> plastic<00:02:20.730> film<00:02:21.090> on<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.390> top<00:02:21.600> as<00:02:21.780> well<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:23.430> we

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270
