00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
a motor in the middle in the side the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.890 
a motor in the middle in the side the
hub<00:00:21.810> there's<00:00:22.350> uh<00:00:22.789> you<00:00:23.789> know<00:00:23.939> blades<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.660> like

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
hub there's uh you know blades that like

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.500 
hub there's uh you know blades that like
spin<00:00:25.380> around<00:00:25.500> there's<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> frame<00:00:26.250> what<00:00:27.060> all<00:00:27.240> can

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
spin around there's a frame what all can

be done in order to innovate all fans
well<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.090> we've<00:00:30.510> seen<00:00:30.840> over<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.260> last

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
well I think we've seen over the last

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.040 
well I think we've seen over the last
couple<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.920> years<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.850> lot<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.719> be<00:00:33.930> done

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
couple of years that a lot can be done

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.680 
couple of years that a lot can be done
to<00:00:34.649> innovate<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.070> fans<00:00:35.460> higher<00:00:36.120> quality

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
to innovate on fans higher quality

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.030 
to innovate on fans higher quality
bearings<00:00:37.050> will<00:00:37.680> reduce<00:00:38.010> noise<00:00:39.620> more<00:00:40.620> better

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
bearings will reduce noise more better

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.529 
bearings will reduce noise more better
design<00:00:41.610> than<00:00:42.590> okay<00:00:43.590> better<00:00:43.980> design<00:00:44.430> into<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
design than okay better design into the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.709 
design than okay better design into the
exact<00:00:46.350> shape<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.070> design<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> blades<00:00:48.059> can

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
exact shape the design of the blades can

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.619 
exact shape the design of the blades can
improve<00:00:49.379> air<00:00:49.649> flow<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.239> also<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
improve air flow and you can also do a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
improve air flow and you can also do a
bunch<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.899> other<00:00:51.989> stuff<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.440> Corsair<00:00:52.949> has<00:00:52.980> okay

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
bunch of other stuff so Corsair has okay

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.420 
bunch of other stuff so Corsair has okay
check<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.320> replaced<00:00:55.800> what

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
check this out they have replaced what

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.490 
check this out they have replaced what
would<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.270> traditional<00:00:58.020> just

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
would be the more of a traditional just

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.099 
would be the more of a traditional just
either<00:00:58.770> closed<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.550> open<00:00:59.850> corner<00:01:00.120> fan<00:01:00.690> design

the<00:01:18.780> case<00:01:18.840> may<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.290> mean<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.740> take<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the case may be I mean it's take a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.230 
the case may be I mean it's take a
little<00:01:20.130> bit<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.340> work<00:01:20.490> at<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:20.790> there<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
little bit of work at it but there you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.300 
little bit of work at it but there you
go<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:22.080> they've<00:01:22.200> also<00:01:22.439> put<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.040> noise

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
go and then they've also put in noise

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310 
go and then they've also put in noise
dampening<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.150> noise<00:01:24.330> dampening<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> huge

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
dampening so noise dampening is a huge

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.020 
dampening so noise dampening is a huge
thing<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.560> fans<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.310> no<00:01:26.580> matter<00:01:26.759> how

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
thing for fans because no matter how

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.020 
thing for fans because no matter how
smooth<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.650> rotation<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.310> fan<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.850> no

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
smooth the rotation of your fan is no

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.420 
smooth the rotation of your fan is no
matter<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.540> awesome<00:01:31.409> your<00:01:31.920> bearing<00:01:32.280> is

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
matter how awesome your bearing is

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.010 
matter how awesome your bearing is
there's<00:01:32.939> always<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.659> little<00:01:33.840> bit

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
there's always going to be a little bit

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
there's always going to be a little bit
of<00:01:34.110> vibration<00:01:34.229> pass<00:01:34.860> along<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> case<00:01:35.640> so

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
of vibration pass along to the case so

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.050 
of vibration pass along to the case so
using<00:01:36.180> rubber<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.000> here

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
using rubber here here here and here

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.359 
using rubber here here here and here
means<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.350> pretty<00:01:40.619> difficult<00:01:40.950> for

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
means that it's pretty difficult for

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.889 
means that it's pretty difficult for
that<00:01:41.610> vibration<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.270> passed<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.689> case

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that vibration to be passed to your case

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.960 
that vibration to be passed to your case
you<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.500> also<00:01:43.649> see<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.579> touches

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you can also see little little touches

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.480 
you can also see little little touches
like<00:01:45.180> using<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.810> black<00:01:46.259> connectors<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.070> all

supplies to really set them apart from
the<00:01:52.710> competition<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.399> terms<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.850> aesthetics

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the competition in terms of aesthetics

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.510 
the competition in terms of aesthetics
Corsair<00:01:55.470> has<00:01:55.500> also<00:01:55.710> done<00:01:56.009> something<00:01:56.219> kind<00:01:56.430> of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
Corsair has also done something kind of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.730 
Corsair has also done something kind of
cool<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.960> implementation<00:01:58.619> of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
cool and that is the implementation of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.520 
cool and that is the implementation of
this<00:01:59.040> multi<00:01:59.549> ring<00:01:59.790> system<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.420> every<00:02:01.020> Corsair

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
this multi ring system so every Corsair

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770 
this multi ring system so every Corsair

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
replaceable I've never done this before

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.610 
replaceable I've never done this before
so

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
so

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.470 
so
kind<00:02:12.799> of<00:02:12.890> guessing<00:02:13.099> right<00:02:13.370> now<00:02:13.519> but<00:02:13.790> maybe

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
kind of guessing right now but maybe

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.699 
kind of guessing right now but maybe
yeah<00:02:15.040> like<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.640> or<00:02:16.849> something

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
yeah like that or something

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.380 
yeah like that or something
so<00:02:18.709> guys<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:18.920> just<00:02:19.190> use<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.340> screwdriver<00:02:19.519> put

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
so guys you just use a screwdriver put

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.979 
so guys you just use a screwdriver put
it<00:02:20.480> in<00:02:20.599> here

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
it in here

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.020 
it in here
pop<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.709> one<00:02:21.890> clip<00:02:22.159> out<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.549> then<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.849> rest

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
pop the one clip out and then the rest

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.640 
pop the one clip out and then the rest
of<00:02:23.150> them<00:02:23.269> will<00:02:23.569> follow<00:02:23.780> very<00:02:23.900> easily<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:24.590> you

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
of them will follow very easily and you

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.220 
of them will follow very easily and you
can<00:02:24.709> easily<00:02:25.129> replace<00:02:25.549> it<00:02:25.849> with<00:02:26.030> white<00:02:26.299> blue<00:02:26.959> or

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
can easily replace it with white blue or

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.649 
can easily replace it with white blue or
red<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:28.129> I'm<00:02:28.220> sure<00:02:28.790> Coursera<00:02:29.239> will<00:02:29.390> look<00:02:29.510> into

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
red and I'm sure Coursera will look into

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.930 
red and I'm sure Coursera will look into
the<00:02:29.810> possibility<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:30.530> doing<00:02:30.680> other<00:02:31.099> colors<00:02:31.730> in

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
the possibility of doing other colors in

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.089 
the possibility of doing other colors in
the<00:02:31.970> future<00:02:32.420> whatever<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.049> case<00:02:33.230> may<00:02:33.440> be<00:02:33.470> so

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
the future whatever the case may be so

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.199 
the future whatever the case may be so
there<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.280> go<00:02:34.430> that's<00:02:34.670> yet<00:02:35.180> another

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
there you go that's yet another

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.180 
there you go that's yet another
innovation<00:02:35.840> where<00:02:36.140> instead<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.620> releasing

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
innovation where instead of releasing

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.039 
innovation where instead of releasing
like<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.640> boatload<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.239> different<00:02:38.750> SKUs<00:02:39.019> and

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
like a boatload of different SKUs and

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.420 
like a boatload of different SKUs and
different<00:02:39.470> colors<00:02:39.739> course<00:02:40.010> there's<00:02:40.190> just

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
different colors course there's just

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.100 
different colors course there's just
included<00:02:40.819> everything<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.269> need<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.870> put<00:02:42.079> a

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
included everything you need to put a

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.899 
included everything you need to put a
nice<00:02:42.379> little<00:02:42.560> accent<00:02:43.099> color<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.459> go<00:02:43.579> with<00:02:43.610> your

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
nice little accent color to go with your

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.509 
nice little accent color to go with your
build<00:02:44.180> on<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.569> fan<00:02:44.780> right<00:02:45.410> out<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:46.099> box<00:02:46.310> so

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
build on the fan right out of the box so

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.250 
build on the fan right out of the box so
I<00:02:46.579> think<00:02:46.640> that's<00:02:46.910> kind<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.090> neat<00:02:47.299> so<00:02:47.750> what<00:02:48.109> else

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
I think that's kind of neat so what else

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.860 
I think that's kind of neat so what else
can<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.500> innovate<00:02:48.799> on<00:02:49.010> well<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:50.660> can

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
can you innovate on well you can

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.500 
can you innovate on well you can
innovate<00:02:51.140> on<00:02:51.470> whatever<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.370> can<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:53.000> optimal

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
innovate on whatever this can is optimal

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.300 
innovate on whatever this can is optimal
kit<00:02:53.629> we<00:02:53.720> got<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.959> sorry<00:02:54.620> about<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:54.769> guys<00:02:54.920> the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
kit we got it sorry about that guys the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.460 
kit we got it sorry about that guys the
door<00:02:55.489> was<00:02:55.700> open<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.239> sound<00:02:56.599> was<00:02:56.780> passing<00:02:57.170> right

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
door was open so sound was passing right

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.890 
door was open so sound was passing right
through<00:02:57.500> anyway<00:02:58.129> um<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:58.819> you<00:02:58.879> can<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.870> can

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
through anyway um so you can you can

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.509 
through anyway um so you can you can
innovate<00:03:00.230> on<00:03:00.470> what<00:03:00.709> they're<00:03:00.859> optimized<00:03:01.310> for

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
innovate on what they're optimized for

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.849 
innovate on what they're optimized for
so<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.879> AF<00:03:02.269> series<00:03:02.659> is<00:03:02.840> optimized<00:03:03.349> for<00:03:03.500> air

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
so the AF series is optimized for air

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.550 
so the AF series is optimized for air
flow<00:03:04.099> much<00:03:04.700> like<00:03:05.030> competing<00:03:05.659> fans<00:03:05.989> such<00:03:06.349> as

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
flow much like competing fans such as

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.380 
flow much like competing fans such as
no-no-no<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:07.280> an<00:03:07.370> outlet<00:03:07.670> over<00:03:07.790> here<00:03:08.000> it's

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
no-no-no of an outlet over here it's

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.660 
no-no-no of an outlet over here it's
much<00:03:08.629> like<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.140> Antec<00:03:09.500> true<00:03:09.709> part<00:03:09.980> true<00:03:10.370> quiet

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
much like the Antec true part true quiet

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.210 
much like the Antec true part true quiet
pro<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.510> what<00:03:11.900> does<00:03:12.079> that<00:03:12.109> mean<00:03:12.530> that<00:03:12.739> means

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
pro so what does that mean that means

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.550 
pro so what does that mean that means
these<00:03:13.549> are<00:03:13.609> for<00:03:14.299> situations<00:03:14.930> like<00:03:15.049> in<00:03:15.440> the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
these are for situations like in the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.259 
these are for situations like in the
front<00:03:15.859> or<00:03:16.069> back<00:03:16.310> in<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.609> case<00:03:16.819> where<00:03:17.090> there's

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
front or back in the case where there's

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.809 
front or back in the case where there's
very<00:03:17.329> little<00:03:17.959> restriction<00:03:18.650> if<00:03:18.799> you<00:03:19.370> wanted<00:03:19.700> to

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
very little restriction if you wanted to

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.390 
very little restriction if you wanted to
use<00:03:20.060> an<00:03:20.269> AF<00:03:20.840> series<00:03:21.260> fan<00:03:21.530> on<00:03:21.829> something<00:03:22.250> like<00:03:22.340> a

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
use an AF series fan on something like a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.819 
use an AF series fan on something like a
radiator<00:03:23.030> or<00:03:23.180> heat<00:03:23.569> sink<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:24.319> wouldn't<00:03:24.680> get

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
radiator or heat sink you wouldn't get

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.740 
radiator or heat sink you wouldn't get
the<00:03:24.980> optimal<00:03:25.340> performance<00:03:25.519> because<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.540> way

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
the optimal performance because the way

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.080 
the optimal performance because the way
the<00:03:26.989> fans<00:03:27.260> are<00:03:27.560> scooping<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.609> air<00:03:28.790> and

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
the fans are scooping the air and

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.789 
the fans are scooping the air and
blowing<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:29.810> out<00:03:29.870> towards<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.410> back<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.739> the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
what you're trying to move through out

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.140 
what you're trying to move through out
around<00:03:38.599> the<00:03:39.019> in<00:03:39.410> between<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:40.010> fins<00:03:40.220> whereas

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
if you have a completely open air

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.759 
if you have a completely open air

less overall dead zone is what it's

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.979

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
you can also get them in a variety of

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.090 
you can also get them in a variety of
different<00:05:18.780> configurations<00:05:19.080> so<00:05:19.770> we've<00:05:19.920> got

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
different configurations so we've got

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.630 
different configurations so we've got
140<00:05:21.000> millimeter<00:05:21.330> quiet<00:05:21.720> pans<00:05:22.280> 120<00:05:23.280> millimeter

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
140 millimeter quiet pans 120 millimeter

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.000 
140 millimeter quiet pans 120 millimeter
quiet<00:05:24.240> fans<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:24.930> 120<00:05:25.680> millimeter

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
quiet fans and 120 millimeter

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.000 
quiet fans and 120 millimeter
performance<00:05:26.940> fans<00:05:27.150> so<00:05:27.660> these<00:05:27.930> are<00:05:28.320> actually

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
performance fans so these are actually

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.820 
performance fans so these are actually
using<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.700> same<00:05:30.030> overall<00:05:30.540> blade<00:05:30.960> design<00:05:31.350> it's

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
using the same overall blade design it's

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.290 
using the same overall blade design it's
pretty<00:05:32.160> much<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.520> same<00:05:32.550> thing<00:05:32.940> but<00:05:33.180> the

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
pretty much the same thing but the

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.630 
pretty much the same thing but the
difference<00:05:33.330> is<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.560> default<00:05:34.920> rpm<00:05:35.400> the

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
difference is the default rpm the

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.030 
difference is the default rpm the
default<00:05:36.000> noise<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:37.320> amount<00:05:37.530> of<00:05:37.650> airflow

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
default noise and the amount of airflow

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.580 
default noise and the amount of airflow
that<00:05:38.310> obviously<00:05:38.910> they<00:05:39.330> will<00:05:39.540> use<00:05:39.810> so<00:05:40.140> what

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
that obviously they will use so what

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.780 
that obviously they will use so what
would<00:05:40.680> you<00:05:40.800> want<00:05:40.980> to<00:05:41.070> quiet<00:05:41.280> fan<00:05:41.550> for

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
would you want to quiet fan for

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.820 
would you want to quiet fan for
personally<00:05:42.390> I<00:05:42.540> would<00:05:42.960> use<00:05:43.080> a<00:05:43.110> quiet<00:05:43.410> Edition

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
personally I would use a quiet Edition

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.180 
personally I would use a quiet Edition
fan<00:05:44.070> for<00:05:44.700> running<00:05:45.420> even<00:05:45.720> quieter<00:05:46.290> you<00:05:46.950> know<00:05:47.040> in

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
fan for running even quieter you know in

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.210 
fan for running even quieter you know in
a<00:05:47.310> super<00:05:47.820> silent<00:05:48.480> PC<00:05:49.080> kind<00:05:49.410> of<00:05:49.500> configuration

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
a super silent PC kind of configuration

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.530 
a super silent PC kind of configuration
that<00:05:50.250> was<00:05:50.490> what<00:05:50.640> that's<00:05:50.970> what<00:05:51.150> I<00:05:51.180> would<00:05:51.360> want

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
that was what that's what I would want

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.180 
that was what that's what I would want
that<00:05:51.600> for<00:05:51.750> what<00:05:52.410> would<00:05:52.560> you<00:05:52.680> use<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:53.010> higher

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
that for what would you use the higher

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.400 
that for what would you use the higher
speed<00:05:53.490> one<00:05:53.640> for<00:05:53.880> well<00:05:54.090> if<00:05:54.360> you<00:05:54.900> were<00:05:55.110> if<00:05:55.350> you

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
speed one for well if you were if you

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.690 
speed one for well if you were if you
say<00:05:55.650> for<00:05:55.830> example<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:56.220> had<00:05:56.310> an<00:05:56.400> asus

speed<00:06:09.000> when<00:06:09.150> things<00:06:09.360> are<00:06:09.510> getting<00:06:09.720> hot<00:06:09.900> and<00:06:10.110> to

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
speed when things are getting hot and to

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.080 
speed when things are getting hot and to
turn<00:06:10.530> down<00:06:10.740> to<00:06:10.920> very<00:06:11.130> low<00:06:11.340> speeds<00:06:11.670> when<00:06:11.880> things

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
turn down to very low speeds when things

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.300 
turn down to very low speeds when things
are<00:06:12.270> getting<00:06:12.510> not<00:06:13.080> as<00:06:13.290> hot<00:06:13.500> so<00:06:13.770> that's<00:06:13.980> uh

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
are getting not as hot so that's uh

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.620 
are getting not as hot so that's uh
that's<00:06:14.670> why<00:06:14.790> I<00:06:14.820> eat<00:06:14.940> one<00:06:15.120> of<00:06:15.150> our<00:06:15.390> higher

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
that's why I eat one of our higher

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.850 
that's why I eat one of our higher
performance<00:06:16.080> one<00:06:16.230> also<00:06:16.350> if<00:06:16.530> you're<00:06:16.620> not<00:06:16.710> as

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
performance one also if you're not as

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.620 
performance one also if you're not as
sensitive<00:06:17.250> to<00:06:17.370> noise<00:06:17.550> personally<00:06:18.390> on<00:06:18.510> the

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
sensitive to noise personally on the

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.240 
sensitive to noise personally on the
silence<00:06:19.020> freak<00:06:19.230> when<00:06:19.410> it<00:06:19.500> comes<00:06:19.680> to<00:06:19.830> fans<00:06:20.040> and

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
silence freak when it comes to fans and

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.400 
silence freak when it comes to fans and
cooling<00:06:20.550> so<00:06:20.700> I<00:06:20.730> have<00:06:20.940> zero<00:06:21.750> interest<00:06:22.050> in<00:06:22.290> this

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
cooling so I have zero interest in this

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.710 
cooling so I have zero interest in this
one<00:06:22.620> and<00:06:22.860> I<00:06:23.370> am<00:06:23.400> all<00:06:23.790> about<00:06:23.820> this<00:06:24.390> quiet

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
one and I am all about this quiet

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.150 
one and I am all about this quiet
addition<00:06:25.200> one<00:06:25.350> here<00:06:25.620> because<00:06:25.770> I'm<00:06:25.980> going<00:06:26.100> to

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
addition one here because I'm going to

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.980 
addition one here because I'm going to
turn<00:06:26.310> it<00:06:26.430> down<00:06:26.460> even<00:06:26.820> lower<00:06:27.180> and<00:06:27.450> see<00:06:27.690> just<00:06:27.870> how

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
turn it down even lower and see just how

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.780 
turn it down even lower and see just how
quiet<00:06:28.200> I<00:06:28.380> can<00:06:28.530> get<00:06:28.680> it<00:06:28.800> they<00:06:29.190> also<00:06:29.310> show<00:06:29.670> an

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
quiet I can get it they also show an

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.490 
quiet I can get it they also show an
example<00:06:29.880> of<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.510> system<00:06:30.690> configured<00:06:31.320> with

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
example of the system configured with

example of the system configured with
their<00:06:31.650> fans<00:06:31.890> so<00:06:32.370> you<00:06:32.400> can<00:06:32.580> see<00:06:32.730> here<00:06:32.940> with<00:06:33.060> the

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
their fans so you can see here with the

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.170 
their fans so you can see here with the
radiator<00:06:33.630> there's<00:06:33.930> a

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
radiator there's a

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.550 
radiator there's a
push<00:06:34.240> pull<00:06:34.449> configuration<00:06:35.169> they're<00:06:35.289> using

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
push pull configuration they're using

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.870 
push pull configuration they're using
pressure<00:06:35.800> fans<00:06:36.130> you<00:06:36.340> can<00:06:36.460> tell<00:06:36.639> from<00:06:36.729> the

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
pressure fans you can tell from the

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.640 
pressure fans you can tell from the
shape<00:06:37.030> of<00:06:37.150> the<00:06:37.240> blades<00:06:37.479> for<00:06:38.110> the<00:06:38.229> front<00:06:38.470> of<00:06:38.560> the

shape of the blades for the front of the

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.560 
shape of the blades for the front of the
case<00:06:38.830> they're<00:06:39.070> using<00:06:39.400> airflow<00:06:39.880> fans<00:06:40.180> you<00:06:40.449> can

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
case they're using airflow fans you can

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.879 
case they're using airflow fans you can
tell<00:06:40.750> from<00:06:40.900> the<00:06:41.050> shape<00:06:41.199> of<00:06:41.320> the<00:06:41.410> blades<00:06:41.590> again

tell from the shape of the blades again

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:44.100 
tell from the shape of the blades again
just<00:06:42.370> because<00:06:42.669> it's<00:06:42.850> more<00:06:43.060> free<00:06:43.570> flow<00:06:43.810> more

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
just because it's more free flow more

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.600 
just because it's more free flow more
open<00:06:44.440> air<00:06:44.560> same<00:06:44.800> thing<00:06:45.009> with<00:06:45.130> the<00:06:45.250> top<00:06:45.400> of<00:06:45.580> the

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
open air same thing with the top of the

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.550 
open air same thing with the top of the
case<00:06:45.850> so<00:06:46.419> really<00:06:46.720> that<00:06:47.050> is<00:06:47.229> where<00:06:47.410> you're

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
case so really that is where you're

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.379 
case so really that is where you're
concerned<00:06:47.740> with<00:06:48.009> pressure<00:06:48.250> although<00:06:48.940> for<00:06:49.300> me

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
concerned with pressure although for me

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.120 
concerned with pressure although for me
personally<00:06:49.630> I<00:06:49.960> find<00:06:50.199> there<00:06:50.410> to<00:06:50.470> be<00:06:50.590> advantages

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
personally I find there to be advantages

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.469 
personally I find there to be advantages
to<00:06:51.250> pressure<00:06:51.460> fans<00:06:51.789> in<00:06:52.030> many<00:06:52.240> different

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 
to pressure fans in many different

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:55.170 
to pressure fans in many different
scenarios<00:06:52.919> even<00:06:53.919> even<00:06:54.580> in<00:06:54.729> the<00:06:54.820> front<00:06:55.030> of<00:06:55.120> a

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
scenarios even even in the front of a

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.670 
scenarios even even in the front of a
case<00:06:55.330> for<00:06:55.539> example<00:06:55.660> where<00:06:56.139> a<00:06:56.169> lot<00:06:56.380> of<00:06:56.500> cases

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
case for example where a lot of cases

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.159 
case for example where a lot of cases
don't<00:06:56.979> just<00:06:57.220> have<00:06:57.400> free<00:06:58.210> mesh<00:06:58.600> in<00:06:58.810> the<00:06:58.930> front

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169 
don't just have free mesh in the front

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.900 
don't just have free mesh in the front
so<00:06:59.530> if<00:06:59.680> you<00:06:59.770> have<00:06:59.919> a<00:06:59.949> case<00:07:00.190> say<00:07:00.400> sorry<00:07:00.820> about

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
so if you have a case say sorry about

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.580 
so if you have a case say sorry about
that<00:07:01.000> guy's<00:07:01.240> battery<00:07:01.630> died<00:07:01.810> but<00:07:02.050> if<00:07:02.259> you<00:07:02.380> have

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
that guy's battery died but if you have

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.439 
that guy's battery died but if you have
a<00:07:02.620> case<00:07:03.009> where<00:07:03.250> the<00:07:03.370> front<00:07:03.669> panel<00:07:04.000> is<00:07:04.060> actually

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
a case where the front panel is actually

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:05.939 
a case where the front panel is actually
quite<00:07:04.630> restrictive<00:07:05.229> then<00:07:05.650> you're<00:07:05.800> going<00:07:05.889> to

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:05.949 
quite restrictive then you're going to

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:07.170 
quite restrictive then you're going to
want<00:07:06.070> to<00:07:06.190> look<00:07:06.280> at<00:07:06.400> maybe<00:07:06.610> using<00:07:06.820> pressure

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180
