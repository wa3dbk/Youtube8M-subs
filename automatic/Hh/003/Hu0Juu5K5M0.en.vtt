 minister has a distinctive style but 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.850
 this new Pentecost came about by chance is 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.710
 because on the first cd they put my 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.240
 name and put a cd logo name 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.130

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.400

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.500
 watching you watching you sing and 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.960
 really delighted about that 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.940
 It 's because you 're ministering to the 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.320
 what does it mean to you and this one? 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:45.210

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.990
 Wind talk will make both souls and I 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.700
 I put this in my life, it was good to leave. 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.340
 since I could not choose my 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.350
 ministry movie present or with it 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.770
 so I 'm going for the ide for everybody and 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.930
 preach the gospel through praise and 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.620
 I believe that God has touched the lives of 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.450
 Many 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.760

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:18.630
 now it's me I was given with her 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:22.080
 Because it's more or less 167 years ago, I 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:25.860
 I also suffered on about it also with this 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:28.650
 Well, then, well, the problem with health 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.740
 with this then as well as the woman who 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:35.970
 is not a problem so neither house has is 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:39.950
 blood flow is high and this 

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:42.870
 song was given so I sing 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.390
 showing the flow person and woman 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.670
 blood was also cured and the same 

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:51.180
 jesus who acted on her life in the past 

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:53.940
 in our life today and yes there is more 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.880
 How can you not see one? 

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.830
 And then, where are you at your house, no? 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.280
 I know how you are, how's your life? 

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:04.170
 But believe in god is passing there touch 

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.090
 At the time of his dress you will be 

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.840
 healed in the name of jesus 

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.840
