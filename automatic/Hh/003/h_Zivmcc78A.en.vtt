00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
this new format which is really going to

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.340 
this new format which is really going to
be<00:00:14.670> really<00:00:14.969> slow<00:00:15.269> there<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.900> nothing<00:00:16.109> much

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
be really slow there is nothing much

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.900 
be really slow there is nothing much
draw<00:00:16.560> power<00:00:17.630> probably<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.810> top<00:00:19.619> decks<00:00:19.980> like<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
draw power probably the top decks like a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.210 
draw power probably the top decks like a
summon<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.359> lot<00:00:21.600> masters<00:00:22.109> fast<00:00:22.410> or<00:00:22.859> they<00:00:23.070> can

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
summon a lot masters fast or they can

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.859 
summon a lot masters fast or they can
have<00:00:23.460> some<00:00:23.730> type<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.000> draw<00:00:24.269> power<00:00:24.449> would

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
have some type of draw power would

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.480

actually<00:00:25.230> top<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.920> format<00:00:26.930> I<00:00:28.490> actually

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
actually top this format I actually

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.389 
actually top this format I actually
thought<00:00:29.880> about<00:00:30.240> making<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.529> deck<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.130> while

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
thought about making this deck a while

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.299 
thought about making this deck a while
back<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.260> now<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.620> new<00:00:34.680> format<00:00:35.250> i

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
back but on now with this new format i

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.950 
back but on now with this new format i
just<00:00:35.670> decided<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.149> actually<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.870> would

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
just decided to actually that it would

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.400 
just decided to actually that it would
be<00:00:37.079> good<00:00:37.670> um<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.030> absolute<00:00:39.450> zero<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:39.989> um<00:00:40.140> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
be good um it is absolute zero but um it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.500 
be good um it is absolute zero but um it
