00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.869
 and there is that guys who are talking about is mc 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.730
 and I'm bringing the first video of the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:27.150
 channel nÃ© that is a review of rpk dragon 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.019
 snake that the new one has arrived there 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.550
 new update along with the wm dragon 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.219
 on fire 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.010
 I think it's something like that. 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.590
 I'll leave the names of the two and the image of the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.070
 two is not good, probably you all already 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.200
 they saw it but that's it 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.430
 I 'm good here bringing a review with a 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.180
 background play 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.870
 along with her, and I'll bring the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.800
 damage and some opinions that I 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.280
 I have about her 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.100
 good is it takes away the head without right 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.250
 of course without helmet and helmet she 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:15.720
 You can give away is influenced in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:23.840
 on the chest it draws 31 on the arm 32 in the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:27.390
 belly 37 on leg 21 and foot 22 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.390
 these are the damages that this weapon 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.280
 without your opponent is using 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.329
 good vest 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.150
 My opinions on this weapon are me. 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.490
 I thought she was a weapon that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.450
 Who likes to blast it is perfect is 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.020
 she's 170 bullets, that's you. 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.460
 You can go out with her for that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.560
 Hold stage, I'm not going to 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.409
 sure you're going to kill because I 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.040
 I found her record a little large or 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.390
 Be it is a little hard to hit the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.729
 shots right? 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.979
 But when you hit, you kill more or 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.129
 least a three four shots depending 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.370
 where you hit good time 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.879
 loading it 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.760
 out of 2.13 seconds right 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.220
 Only I find it a little difficult to 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.209
 someone recharge it right it the question 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.470
 of having 170 bullets is a difficult medium to 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.190
 to charge 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:34.450
 It's up to you not to die like that. 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.790
 And I think she's a good mutant. 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.400
 I think she is very specialized for 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.980
 that kind of thing you're going to stay there 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.640
 Shooting a good time, you're not going to stay. 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.030
 killing many unb until you need to 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.910
 carry your gun down there or the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.750
 place you need to carry your 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.260
 weapon 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.560
 that is, if you like playing dar and 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.799
 likes to go out in the shootout went out on the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.750
 Egypt on a ship is not that in some 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.879
 phases more closely ne 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.799
 without being a seek and destroy it 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.129
 it would be less appropriate for you to 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.640
 need to give you some distance 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:19.480
 between the guy is I think you'd like 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.470
 to have one of them is if you play closely 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.450
 You play is slicing depends on your 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.870
 style of play, right? 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.680
 It's but if you play from afar 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.810
 likes to play is shot in such a shot 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.720
 trying to hit the head is in a way 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.360
 more competitive in a room that is 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.959
 how big the distance I think I 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.670
 I would not advise her for that kind of 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.549
 thing because it is a weapon with a record 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.280
 very big and very difficult to hit 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.110
 up close you have to know 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.250
 control a little that is half 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.890
 random 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.010
 Her record stays a little way off. 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.250
 a little harder it gets a little difficult 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.220
 to hit is even up close is a 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.220
 right choice shot a sufficient damage 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.370
 so that you can win your 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.760
 adversary or as an end result 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.250
 than I thought I found a good one is I 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.010
 can not do a cool game place 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:29.260
 is to be able to stay with legal composition 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.840
 It's between all of them that I did and but I 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.389
 I'd rather have one wrong if I were 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.450
 play a straightforward trojan or browse 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:40.780
 destroy a weapon that is a little more 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.450
 away but if you want to play the sea 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.090
 the game closely as I said 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.639
 it is entirely advisable that the 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.300
 its strong owner is a little difficult to 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:55.120
 control the record at the beginning but 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.360
 getting used to it is it good 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.150
 Okay, that's it people, this was the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.340
 first video of the channel I hope 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.389
 You like it, I hope you 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.539
 follow it and send a whole plague 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.690
 the galas educating jackass i ii and iii e 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:16.780
 I wanted to ask you is to give I liked 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.580
 sign up that probably people 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.090
 will bring more reviews 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:26.199
 We will bring and I will. 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:31.360
 peta c lot of things we will bring 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:36.449

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.449
 write there give your jewel and say
