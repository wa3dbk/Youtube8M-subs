00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.699 
than the RRR
I<00:03:02.359> felt<00:03:03.359> like<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.599> could<00:03:03.780> decimate<00:03:03.989> close<00:03:04.469> in

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
I felt like I could decimate close in

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.199 
I felt like I could decimate close in
front<00:03:04.859> of<00:03:04.950> me<00:03:05.010> right<00:03:05.040> now

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.970 

that<00:03:09.719> said<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.019> engine<00:03:10.319> in<00:03:10.439> the<00:03:10.530> triple<00:03:10.829> is

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
that said the engine in the triple is

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.089 
that said the engine in the triple is
incredibly<00:03:11.609> good<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:12.379> know<00:03:13.379> how<00:03:13.590> similar<00:03:13.890> it

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
incredibly good to know how similar it

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.309 
incredibly good to know how similar it
is<00:03:14.219> if<00:03:14.879> it's<00:03:15.120> even<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.420> same<00:03:15.689> with<00:03:15.959> an<00:03:16.049> open

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
is if it's even the same with an open

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.229 
is if it's even the same with an open
ball<00:03:16.469> or<00:03:16.590> something<00:03:16.799> much<00:03:17.099> more<00:03:17.250> maybe<00:03:18.120> a

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
ball or something much more maybe a

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.089 
ball or something much more maybe a
longer<00:03:18.450> fall<00:03:18.719> on<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.900> crank<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.439> I<00:03:19.469> won't

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
longer fall on the crank that I won't

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.520 
longer fall on the crank that I won't
speculate<00:03:20.430> sudden<00:03:20.849> idea<00:03:24.079> lean<00:03:25.079> it<00:03:25.379> is

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
speculate sudden idea lean it is

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.490 
speculate sudden idea lean it is
incredible<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:26.639> thing<00:03:26.849> it's<00:03:27.349> it's<00:03:28.349> very

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
incredible on this thing it's it's very

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.599 
incredible on this thing it's it's very
easy<00:03:29.129> to<00:03:30.139> lay<00:03:31.139> down<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.950> roll<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.459> with<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
easy to lay down to roll it with the

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.690 
easy to lay down to roll it with the
hips<00:03:32.969> it's<00:03:33.209> very<00:03:33.510> very<00:03:33.810> easy<00:03:34.459> doesn't<00:03:35.459> have<00:03:35.670> a

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
hips it's very very easy doesn't have a

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.190 
hips it's very very easy doesn't have a
whole<00:03:35.879> lot<00:03:35.909> of<00:03:36.090> weight<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.450> on<00:03:36.659> the<00:03:36.750> top<00:03:36.959> end

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
whole lot of weight to it on the top end

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.280 
whole lot of weight to it on the top end
so<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.969> feel<00:03:38.969> like<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.209> can<00:03:39.359> lay<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.659> in<00:03:39.810> nice<00:03:40.049> and

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
so I feel like I can lay it in nice and

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.050 
so I feel like I can lay it in nice and
easy<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:43.290> instrument<00:03:43.769> panel<00:03:43.799> why<00:03:44.669> not<00:03:44.879> let's

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
easy the instrument panel why not let's

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.099 
easy the instrument panel why not let's
have<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.180> look<00:03:45.329> at<00:03:45.389> that<00:03:45.510> that's<00:03:45.720> pretty<00:03:45.900> good

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
have a look at that that's pretty good

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.740 
have a look at that that's pretty good
looking<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.879> like<00:03:47.879> that<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.269> be<00:03:48.389> fair<00:03:48.569> though

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
looking I like that to be fair though

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.140 
looking I like that to be fair though
it's<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.959> sunny<00:03:49.230> day<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.739> can't<00:03:50.069> really<00:03:50.730> see

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
it's a sunny day and I can't really see

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.300 
it's a sunny day and I can't really see
much<00:03:52.010> I'm<00:03:53.010> struggling<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.579> little<00:03:53.700> too<00:03:54.919> to<00:03:55.919> see

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
much I'm struggling a little too to see

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.500 
much I'm struggling a little too to see
some<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.909> smaller<00:03:57.419> numbers<00:03:59.209> nice<00:04:00.209> little

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
some of the smaller numbers nice little

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.909 
some of the smaller numbers nice little
touch<00:04:00.659> with<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.930> gear<00:04:01.109> shift<00:04:01.379> indicator<00:04:01.530> up

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
touch with the gear shift indicator up

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:09.429 
touch with the gear shift indicator up
here<00:04:02.129> Ruggero<00:04:02.519> same<00:04:02.879> thing<00:04:03.560> that's<00:04:04.560> nice

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.580 

so<00:04:10.439> responsive<00:04:12.019> little<00:04:13.019> bit<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.169> slack<00:04:13.319> on<00:04:13.379> the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
so responsive little bit of slack on the

you know the mirrors are actually pretty

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.900 
you know the mirrors are actually pretty
good<00:04:53.380> or<00:04:54.380> not<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.680> smallest<00:04:54.949> of<00:04:55.220> beads<00:04:55.520> I'm

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
rugby at school that kind of build so my

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.800 
rugby at school that kind of build so my

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
shoulders and I almost account quite a

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.500 
shoulders and I almost account quite a
bit<00:05:06.340> but<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:07.760> can<00:05:08.600> actually<00:05:08.930> see<00:05:09.169> quite<00:05:10.040> well<00:05:10.510> to

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
bit but I can actually see quite well to

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.360 
bit but I can actually see quite well to
be<00:05:11.630> expected<00:05:12.199> she<00:05:12.380> doesn't<00:05:12.680> really<00:05:12.860> handle

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
be expected she doesn't really handle

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.960 
be expected she doesn't really handle
the<00:05:13.460> back<00:05:13.610> very<00:05:13.789> bumps<00:05:15.070> in<00:05:16.070> that<00:05:16.400> well<00:05:16.669> the

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
the back very bumps in that well the

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.969 
the back very bumps in that well the
suspension<00:05:17.419> being<00:05:17.570> as<00:05:17.690> stiff<00:05:17.900> as<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.139> is<00:05:18.289> well

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
suspension being as stiff as it is well

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.490 
suspension being as stiff as it is well
I<00:05:19.010> wouldn't<00:05:19.340> say<00:05:19.430> that<00:05:20.060> it's<00:05:20.210> too<00:05:20.389> stiff<00:05:20.660> by

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
I wouldn't say that it's too stiff by

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.810 
I wouldn't say that it's too stiff by
any<00:05:21.650> stretch<00:05:21.860> of<00:05:21.949> the<00:05:22.100> imagination<00:05:22.190> it's<00:05:22.699> not

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
any stretch of the imagination it's not

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.430 
any stretch of the imagination it's not
too<00:05:22.970> stiff<00:05:23.240> it's<00:05:23.419> nice<00:05:23.600> it's<00:05:23.870> a<00:05:23.900> nice<00:05:24.020> balance

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
too stiff it's nice it's a nice balance

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.200 
too stiff it's nice it's a nice balance
between<00:05:24.500> comfort<00:05:24.979> and<00:05:25.250> response<00:05:26.500> it's<00:05:27.500> a

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
between comfort and response it's a

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.510 
between comfort and response it's a
little<00:05:29.210> bit<00:05:29.360> on<00:05:29.510> the<00:05:29.630> harsh<00:05:29.840> side<00:05:30.280> for<00:05:31.280> rates

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
little bit on the harsh side for rates
