00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
megahertz laptop memory this is the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.830 
megahertz laptop memory this is the
HyperX<00:00:18.660> memory<00:00:19.369> we<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.550> our<00:00:20.850> Dell<00:00:21.390> laptop

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
HyperX memory we have our Dell laptop

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.349 
HyperX memory we have our Dell laptop
here<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> highbacks<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.180> see

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
here this is the highbacks you can see

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.540 
here this is the highbacks you can see
it's<00:00:24.539> got<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> cool<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.289> there<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.400> can

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
it's got the cool in there so you can

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.990 
it's got the cool in there so you can
actually<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:27.000> some<00:00:28.010> coffee<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.460> this

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
actually do some coffee with this this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.479 
actually do some coffee with this this
also<00:00:30.359> came<00:00:30.869> down<00:00:30.929> clock<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.740> thirteen<00:00:32.189> hundred

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
also came down clock to thirteen hundred

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.190 
also came down clock to thirteen hundred
megahertz<00:00:34.219> 1333<00:00:35.219> megahertz<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.940> yeah<00:00:36.270> qu<00:00:36.719> your

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
megahertz 1333 megahertz so yeah qu your

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.840 
megahertz 1333 megahertz so yeah qu your
system<00:00:37.559> will<00:00:37.739> automatically<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.430> for

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
system will automatically do that for

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.569 
system will automatically do that for
you<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.840> memory<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.530> capable<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.190> doing

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you and the memory is capable of doing

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.819 
you and the memory is capable of doing
that<00:00:41.790> also<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:43.050> let's<00:00:43.290> take<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> look<00:00:43.620> at<00:00:43.710> our

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that also so let's take a look at our

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.540 
that also so let's take a look at our
memory<00:00:44.190> chip<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> sounds<00:00:46.280> see<00:00:47.280> it's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
memory chip here for the sounds see it's

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.880 
memory chip here for the sounds see it's
got<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:48.270> heatsink<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.170> both<00:00:49.410> sides

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
got your heatsink on both sides

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.150 
got your heatsink on both sides
very<00:00:50.640> nice<00:00:50.850> has<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> high<00:00:51.360> back<00:00:51.570> logo<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:53.070> also

we<00:05:14.380> have<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.590> couple<00:05:14.950> applications<00:05:15.190> open

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.110 

let's<00:05:21.260> see<00:05:21.410> so<00:05:21.740> we<00:05:21.890> have<00:05:22.010> two<00:05:22.430> living<00:05:22.730> sensor

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
let's see so we have two living sensor

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.810 
let's see so we have two living sensor
applications<00:05:23.570> we<00:05:23.690> open<00:05:23.960> with<00:05:24.280> photo<00:05:25.280> director

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
applications we open with photo director

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.490 
applications we open with photo director
and<00:05:26.060> power<00:05:26.330> director<00:05:26.780> which<00:05:26.930> used<00:05:27.200> to<00:05:27.260> eat<00:05:27.470> a

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
and power director which used to eat a

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.530 
and power director which used to eat a
lot<00:05:27.740> of<00:05:27.800> memory<00:05:28.190> and<00:05:28.370> RAM<00:05:28.550> I<00:05:28.880> have<00:05:29.240> two

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
lot of memory and RAM I have two

lot of memory and RAM I have two
browsers<00:05:29.990> open<00:05:30.320> quickly<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:31.420> so<00:05:32.420> far<00:05:32.720> so<00:05:32.990> good

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
browsers open quickly and so far so good

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.480 
browsers open quickly and so far so good
seems<00:05:35.180> to<00:05:35.420> be<00:05:35.960> open<00:05:36.230> up<00:05:36.350> well<00:05:36.530> of<00:05:37.010> course<00:05:37.100> you

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
seems to be open up well of course you

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.070 
seems to be open up well of course you
know<00:05:37.610> you<00:05:37.670> see<00:05:38.090> more<00:05:38.300> of<00:05:38.420> this<00:05:38.600> especially

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
know you see more of this especially

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.860 
know you see more of this especially
when<00:05:39.680> you<00:05:39.920> are<00:05:40.190> like<00:05:40.580> in<00:05:40.940> my<00:05:41.180> case<00:05:41.390> editing

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
when you are like in my case editing

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.370 
when you are like in my case editing
video<00:05:42.340> pushing<00:05:43.340> 1080p<00:05:43.880> content<00:05:44.170> doing<00:05:45.170> a<00:05:45.230> lot

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
video pushing 1080p content doing a lot

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.020 
video pushing 1080p content doing a lot
of<00:05:45.470> multitasking<00:05:45.800> and<00:05:46.430> that's<00:05:46.610> where<00:05:46.880> your

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
of multitasking and that's where your

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.260 
of multitasking and that's where your
memory<00:05:47.360> will<00:05:47.540> come<00:05:47.690> to<00:05:47.900> play<00:05:48.100> especially<00:05:49.270> with

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
memory will come to play especially with

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.700 
memory will come to play especially with
the<00:05:50.360> heatsink<00:05:50.810> here<00:05:50.960> with<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.140> HyperX<00:05:51.410> you

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
the heatsink here with the HyperX you

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.010 
the heatsink here with the HyperX you
get<00:05:51.890> better<00:05:52.160> efficiency<00:05:52.570> cools<00:05:53.570> down<00:05:53.660> better

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
get better efficiency cools down better

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.500 
get better efficiency cools down better
more<00:05:54.260> efficient<00:05:54.680> also<00:05:55.430> reduces<00:05:55.910> less<00:05:56.090> heat<00:05:56.330> on

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
more efficient also reduces less heat on

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.080 
more efficient also reduces less heat on
your<00:05:56.660> system<00:05:57.170> so<00:05:57.650> let's<00:05:58.520> pretty<00:05:58.670> much<00:05:58.760> it<00:05:58.910> and

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
your system so let's pretty much it and

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.820 
your system so let's pretty much it and
