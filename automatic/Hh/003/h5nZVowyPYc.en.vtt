they<00:01:17.800> had<00:01:18.009> over<00:01:18.310> their<00:01:18.990> courses<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.020> lot<00:01:20.110> of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
they had over their courses a lot of

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.999 
they had over their courses a lot of
RPGs<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:21.009> stuff<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:23.470> we<00:01:23.619> didn't<00:01:23.890> get

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
RPGs and stuff that that we didn't get

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.910 
RPGs and stuff that that we didn't get
over<00:01:24.250> here<00:01:24.550> but<00:01:24.729> anyways<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.440> like<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.560> system

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
over here but anyways I like the system

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.410 
over here but anyways I like the system
personally<00:01:27.399> just<00:01:27.700> because<00:01:28.000> of<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.180> way<00:01:28.300> it

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
personally just because of the way it

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.910 
personally just because of the way it
looks<00:01:28.450> I<00:01:28.750> think<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:28.990> looks<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.290> lot<00:01:29.410> better<00:01:29.680> than

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
looks I think it looks a lot better than

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.450 
looks I think it looks a lot better than
our<00:01:30.330> Super<00:01:31.330> Nintendo<00:01:31.680> I'm<00:01:32.680> basically<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
our Super Nintendo I'm basically the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.800 
our Super Nintendo I'm basically the
same<00:01:33.670> thing<00:01:33.910> you<00:01:34.000> got<00:01:34.090> your<00:01:34.270> two<00:01:34.390> controller

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
same thing you got your two controller

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.840 
same thing you got your two controller
ports<00:01:35.140> on<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.380> front<00:01:35.649> they<00:01:36.369> are<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.640> same

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
ports on the front they are the same

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.520 
ports on the front they are the same
controller<00:01:37.300> ports<00:01:37.660> that<00:01:37.869> come<00:01:38.020> on<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.290> Super

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
controller ports that come on the Super

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.950 
controller ports that come on the Super
Nintendo<00:01:39.149> so<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.240> can<00:01:40.420> use<00:01:40.600> your<00:01:40.720> Super

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
Nintendo so you can use your Super

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.490 
Nintendo so you can use your Super
Nintendo<00:01:41.080> controllers<00:01:41.890> on<00:01:42.040> their<00:01:43.500> power

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
Nintendo controllers on their power

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.899 
Nintendo controllers on their power
switch<00:01:45.040> on<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.909> left<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:47.370> reset<00:01:48.370> button<00:01:48.729> on

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
switch on the left and reset button on

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.870 
switch on the left and reset button on
the<00:01:49.000> right<00:01:49.299> very<00:01:50.110> similar<00:01:50.620> the<00:01:51.460> eject<00:01:51.790> button

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
the right very similar the eject button

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.390 
the right very similar the eject button
is<00:01:52.180> cool<00:01:52.420> because<00:01:52.720> on<00:01:53.500> ours<00:01:53.799> it's<00:01:54.070> kind<00:01:54.340> of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
is cool because on ours it's kind of

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.330 
is cool because on ours it's kind of
like<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.930> a<00:01:55.990> lever<00:01:56.290> you<00:01:56.740> can<00:01:56.890> tell<00:01:57.070> that<00:01:57.190> it's

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
like like a lever you can tell that it's

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.550 
like like a lever you can tell that it's
pivoting<00:01:57.729> at<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.940> back<00:01:58.150> and<00:01:58.420> just<00:01:59.020> pushing

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
pivoting at the back and just pushing

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.840 
pivoting at the back and just pushing
the<00:01:59.740> forks<00:02:00.369> up<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.930> one<00:02:02.080> they<00:02:02.229> must<00:02:02.380> have<00:02:02.850> you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
the forks up this one they must have you

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.460 
the forks up this one they must have you
know<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.000> couple<00:02:04.180> extra<00:02:04.630> moving<00:02:04.900> parts<00:02:05.200> inside

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
know a couple extra moving parts inside

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.020 
know a couple extra moving parts inside
because<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.860> eject<00:02:06.220> button<00:02:06.280> just<00:02:06.640> pushes

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
because the eject button just pushes

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.050 
because the eject button just pushes
straight<00:02:07.330> down<00:02:08.519> it's<00:02:09.519> not<00:02:09.729> levered

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
straight down it's not levered

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.080 
straight down it's not levered
so<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:12.020> feels<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.350> little<00:02:12.470> more<00:02:13.030> high<00:02:14.030> quality

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
so it feels a little more high quality

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.970 
so it feels a little more high quality
with<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.080> eject<00:02:15.440> system<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.590> back<00:02:18.740> you

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
with the eject system on the back you

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.970 
with the eject system on the back you
have<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.310> same<00:02:19.580> multi<00:02:20.540> AV<00:02:20.959> output<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.860> we

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
have the same multi AV output that we

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.340 
have the same multi AV output that we
have<00:02:22.130> on<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.400> Super<00:02:22.640> Nintendo<00:02:22.760> over<00:02:23.270> here<00:02:23.510> so

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
have on the Super Nintendo over here so

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.930 
have on the Super Nintendo over here so
you'll<00:02:24.530> be<00:02:24.860> able<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.100> use<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.400> same<00:02:25.610> a/v

have<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:39.020> channel<00:02:39.319> 1<00:02:39.620> over<00:02:39.890> here<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.340> think<00:02:40.940> it

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
have a channel 1 over here I think it

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.150 
have a channel 1 over here I think it
ends<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.600> being<00:02:41.810> something<00:02:42.110> like<00:02:42.260> channel<00:02:42.830> now

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
ends up being something like channel now

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.060 
ends up being something like channel now
I<00:02:43.190> D<00:02:43.310> something<00:02:44.050> r60<00:02:45.050> it's<00:02:45.080> really<00:02:45.709> high<00:02:45.890> up

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
I D something r60 it's really high up

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.120 
I D something r60 it's really high up
there<00:02:46.280> but<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.239> can<00:02:47.600> get<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.080> RF<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.650> work<00:02:48.830> on

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
there but you can get the RF to work on

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.210 
there but you can get the RF to work on
our<00:02:49.519> televisions<00:02:50.380> but<00:02:51.380> it's<00:02:51.530> not<00:02:51.680> it's<00:02:51.950> not

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
our televisions but it's not it's not

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.759 
our televisions but it's not it's not
like<00:02:52.400> channel<00:02:52.790> 2<00:02:52.970> 3<00:02:53.330> like<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.050> on<00:02:54.290> them<00:02:54.500> on

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
like channel 2 3 like it is on them on

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.190 
like channel 2 3 like it is on them on
most<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.220> our<00:02:55.340> systems<00:02:55.819> but<00:02:56.569> you<00:02:56.630> can<00:02:56.900> use<00:02:57.170> it

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
most of our systems but you can use it

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.380 
most of our systems but you can use it
of<00:02:57.590> course<00:02:57.860> I'm<00:02:58.069> not<00:02:58.190> going<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.670> cut<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.150> a/v

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
of course I'm not going to cut the a/v

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.430 
of course I'm not going to cut the a/v
cables<00:02:59.860> which<00:03:00.860> are<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.190> same<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.900> RF<00:03:03.170> things

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
cables which are the same the RF things

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.470 
cables which are the same the RF things
obviously<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:04.100> same<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:05.090> only<00:03:05.150> thing<00:03:05.269> they

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
obviously the same the only thing they

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.620 
obviously the same the only thing they
changed<00:03:05.900> unfortunately<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.940> input

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
changed unfortunately is the the input

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.100 
changed unfortunately is the the input
for<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.930> DC<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.590> power<00:03:09.769> input<00:03:10.069> here<00:03:11.050> so<00:03:12.050> you

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
for the DC the power input here so you

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.920 
for the DC the power input here so you
can't<00:03:12.500> use<00:03:13.300> even<00:03:14.300> though<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.480> would<00:03:14.720> imagine

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
can't use even though I would imagine

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.400 
can't use even though I would imagine
they<00:03:15.230> both<00:03:15.410> run<00:03:15.680> off<00:03:15.799> 10<00:03:16.100> volts<00:03:16.430> DC<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:18.140> can't

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
they both run off 10 volts DC you can't

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.590 
they both run off 10 volts DC you can't
plug<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:18.920> Super<00:03:19.310> Nintendo<00:03:19.400> power<00:03:19.910> supply<00:03:20.269> into

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
plug a Super Nintendo power supply into

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.530 
plug a Super Nintendo power supply into
here<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.430> kind<00:03:22.700> of<00:03:22.760> sucks<00:03:23.030> because<00:03:23.269> if

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
here so that kind of sucks because if

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.060 
here so that kind of sucks because if
you<00:03:23.660> find<00:03:23.930> one<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.140> these<00:03:24.290> of<00:03:24.530> course<00:03:24.739> without

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
you find one of these of course without

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.590 
you find one of these of course without
the<00:03:25.190> power<00:03:25.370> brick<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:25.880> might<00:03:26.030> think<00:03:26.299> that<00:03:26.390> you

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
the power brick you might think that you

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.340 
the power brick you might think that you
can<00:03:26.750> just<00:03:26.959> use<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:28.180> Super<00:03:29.180> Nintendo<00:03:29.350> power

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
can just use the Super Nintendo power

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.509 
can just use the Super Nintendo power
supply<00:03:30.680> but<00:03:31.489> you<00:03:31.640> won't<00:03:31.820> be<00:03:31.940> able<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:33.519> so

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
supply but you won't be able to so

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.340 
supply but you won't be able to so
anyways<00:03:34.820> I<00:03:35.530> got<00:03:36.530> it<00:03:36.620> with<00:03:36.709> a<00:03:36.739> few<00:03:36.980> games<00:03:37.190> I<00:03:38.350> have

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
anyways I got it with a few games I have

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.800 
anyways I got it with a few games I have
no<00:03:39.500> idea<00:03:39.739> what<00:03:39.890> this<00:03:40.010> game<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:40.760> just<00:03:41.600> picked

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
no idea what this game is I just picked

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.479 
no idea what this game is I just picked
it<00:03:41.870> up<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.140> haven't<00:03:42.410> even<00:03:42.500> had<00:03:42.709> time<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.190> look<00:03:43.310> on

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
absolutely no problem with that the only

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.160 
absolutely no problem with that the only
difference<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.390> on<00:04:38.540> this<00:04:38.660> Super<00:04:38.990> Famicom

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
difference is on this Super Famicom

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.700 
difference is on this Super Famicom
controller<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:41.150> buttons<00:04:41.540> are<00:04:41.690> colored<00:04:42.170> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
controller the buttons are colored the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.100 
controller the buttons are colored the
Super<00:04:43.010> Famicom<00:04:43.160> logo<00:04:43.940> color<00:04:44.180> so<00:04:44.570> blue<00:04:44.810> red

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
Super Famicom logo color so blue red

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.020 
Super Famicom logo color so blue red
yellow<00:04:45.410> green<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:46.250> colors<00:04:46.640> on<00:04:46.880> the

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
yellow green the colors on the

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.240 
yellow green the colors on the
controller<00:04:47.750> buttons<00:04:48.050> match<00:04:48.320> that's<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.070> only

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
controller buttons match that's the only

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.290 
controller buttons match that's the only
difference<00:04:51.010> so<00:04:52.010> here's<00:04:52.190> my<00:04:52.340> multiple<00:04:52.910> cable

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
difference so here's my multiple cable

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.320 
difference so here's my multiple cable
that<00:04:53.419> I<00:04:53.450> use<00:04:53.690> for<00:04:54.550> everything<00:04:55.550> so<00:04:56.120> I'll<00:04:56.210> just

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
that I use for everything so I'll just

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.420 
that I use for everything so I'll just
plug<00:04:56.570> that<00:04:56.600> in<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:58.450> then<00:04:59.450> the<00:04:59.930> power<00:05:00.140> I<00:05:00.470> did

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
plug that in and then the power I did

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.830 
plug that in and then the power I did
get<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.700> power<00:05:01.910> supply<00:05:02.240> with<00:05:02.419> it<00:05:02.540> of<00:05:02.630> course

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
get the power supply with it of course

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.110 
get the power supply with it of course
like<00:05:03.080> I<00:05:03.169> said<00:05:03.380> you'll<00:05:03.560> need<00:05:03.710> that<00:05:05.290> and<00:05:07.120> I'll

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
like I said you'll need that and I'll

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:20.020 
like I said you'll need that and I'll
put<00:05:08.300> top<00:05:08.510> racer<00:05:08.900> in

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.070 

once<00:05:21.030> again<00:05:21.210> it's<00:05:21.660> basically<00:05:22.320> all<00:05:22.590> English

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
once again it's basically all English

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.710 
once again it's basically all English
which<00:05:25.080> is<00:05:25.230> really<00:05:25.530> common<00:05:25.740> on<00:05:26.150> you<00:05:27.150> know<00:05:27.270> Super

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
which is really common on you know Super

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.920 
which is really common on you know Super
Famicom<00:05:27.870> games<00:05:29.300> you'd<00:05:30.300> think<00:05:30.540> being<00:05:30.780> a

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
Famicom games you'd think being a

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.110 
Famicom games you'd think being a
Japanese<00:05:31.380> game<00:05:31.680> that<00:05:31.920> it<00:05:32.040> would<00:05:32.160> be<00:05:32.310> mostly

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
Japanese game that it would be mostly

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.140 
Japanese game that it would be mostly
Japanese<00:05:33.390> but<00:05:34.100> as<00:05:35.100> most<00:05:35.400> of<00:05:35.580> you<00:05:35.670> know<00:05:35.790> English

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
Japanese but as most of you know English

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.910 
Japanese but as most of you know English
is<00:05:36.180> probably<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.840> most<00:05:36.990> common<00:05:37.440> language<00:05:37.770> in

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
is probably the most common language in

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.780 
is probably the most common language in
Japan<00:05:38.280> if<00:05:38.940> not<00:05:39.480> like<00:05:39.810> 50/50<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:41.070> pretty<00:05:41.640> much

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
Japan if not like 50/50 and pretty much

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.120 
Japan if not like 50/50 and pretty much
everyone<00:05:42.180> in<00:05:42.300> Japan<00:05:42.450> can<00:05:42.810> speak<00:05:43.080> English<00:05:46.130> so

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
everyone in Japan can speak English so

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.200
