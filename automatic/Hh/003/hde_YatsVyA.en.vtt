you guys as to what I'm finding with
this<00:00:32.379> because<00:00:32.710> I<00:00:32.859> I'm<00:00:33.550> kind<00:00:33.879> of<00:00:33.940> blown<00:00:34.120> away

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
this because I I'm kind of blown away

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.420 
this because I I'm kind of blown away
with<00:00:34.539> some<00:00:34.690> of<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:34.840> things<00:00:35.020> I'm<00:00:35.170> saying<00:00:35.430> first

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
with some of the things I'm saying first

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.040 
with some of the things I'm saying first
off<00:00:36.899> I'm<00:00:37.899> a<00:00:37.960> fact<00:00:38.710> that<00:00:39.700> turn<00:00:40.630> this<00:00:40.750> down<00:00:40.899> a<00:00:40.960> bit

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
off I'm a fact that turn this down a bit

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.510 
off I'm a fact that turn this down a bit
I<00:00:41.410> love<00:00:41.950> the<00:00:42.070> fact<00:00:42.340> that<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:44.410> disc<00:00:44.739> setting

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
I love the fact that the disc setting

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.420 
I love the fact that the disc setting
and<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.780> all<00:00:46.930> metal<00:00:47.140> setting<00:00:47.829> on<00:00:48.070> two

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
and the all metal setting on two

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.040 
and the all metal setting on two
different<00:00:48.579> controls<00:00:49.570> in<00:00:49.750> other<00:00:49.840> words

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
different controls in other words

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.229 
different controls in other words
there's<00:00:50.590> a<00:00:50.680> switch<00:00:50.950> here<00:00:50.980> I<00:00:51.399> can<00:00:51.790> be<00:00:51.910> in<00:00:52.000> disc

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
there's a switch here I can be in disc

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.590 
there's a switch here I can be in disc
mode<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:52.809> I<00:00:53.469> don't<00:00:53.770> have<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:54.039> you<00:00:55.000> know<00:00:55.090> change

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
mode and I don't have to you know change

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.540 
mode and I don't have to you know change
my<00:00:55.899> setting<00:00:56.649> now<00:00:56.770> I<00:00:56.800> don't<00:00:56.950> have<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.190> go<00:00:57.340> down

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
my setting now I don't have to go down

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.279 
my setting now I don't have to go down
and<00:00:57.850> go<00:00:57.940> into<00:00:58.149> all<00:00:58.270> metal<00:00:58.570> mode<00:00:58.600> by<00:00:58.899> turning

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
and go into all metal mode by turning

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.410 
and go into all metal mode by turning
this<00:00:59.410> I<00:00:59.649> can<00:01:00.070> leave<00:01:00.219> this<00:01:00.399> fixed<00:01:00.879> set<00:01:01.300> it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
this I can leave this fixed set it

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.119 
this I can leave this fixed set it
forget<00:01:01.629> it<00:01:01.840> and<00:01:02.140> I<00:01:02.530> go<00:01:02.649> over<00:01:02.800> here<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:02.949> the

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
forget it and I go over here to the

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.550 
forget it and I go over here to the
switch<00:01:03.370> and<00:01:03.579> go<00:01:03.670> on<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.850> all<00:01:04.000> metal<00:01:04.329> non<00:01:05.079> motion

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
switch and go on to all metal non motion

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.739 
switch and go on to all metal non motion
or<00:01:06.100> all<00:01:06.340> metal<00:01:06.609> motion<00:01:06.969> of<00:01:07.119> them<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.479> center

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:07.749 
or all metal motion of them the center

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:10.319 
or all metal motion of them the center
position<00:01:08.139> which<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.350> on<00:01:08.499> metal<00:01:08.740> is<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.329> all

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
position which is on metal is the all

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.469 
position which is on metal is the all
metal<00:01:10.889> non<00:01:11.889> motion<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.549> means<00:01:13.029> that<00:01:13.240> you

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
metal non motion and that means that you

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.539 
metal non motion and that means that you
can<00:01:13.630> hold<00:01:13.779> the<00:01:13.869> coils<00:01:14.170> dead<00:01:14.590> center<00:01:15.069> steady

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
can hold the coils dead center steady

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.219 
can hold the coils dead center steady
over<00:01:15.999> your<00:01:16.119> target<00:01:16.509> and<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:16.749> continues<00:01:17.139> to

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
over your target and it continues to

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.129 
over your target and it continues to
sing<00:01:17.469> you<00:01:18.310> have<00:01:18.429> an<00:01:18.549> auto<00:01:18.880> position<00:01:19.179> and<00:01:20.020> what

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:20.139 
sing you have an auto position and what

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:22.199 
sing you have an auto position and what
that<00:01:20.289> means<00:01:20.529> that<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.859> it<00:01:21.189> it's<00:01:21.759> a<00:01:21.909> motion

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:22.209 
that means that it it it's a motion

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.179 
that means that it it it's a motion
detector<00:01:22.479> in<00:01:23.049> all<00:01:23.349> metal<00:01:23.709> so<00:01:23.829> you<00:01:23.889> have<00:01:24.039> to<00:01:24.099> be

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
detector in all metal so you have to be

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.010 
detector in all metal so you have to be
moving<00:01:24.459> the<00:01:24.520> coil<00:01:24.759> if<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:24.969> stop<00:01:25.270> it

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
moving the coil if you stop it

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.929 
moving the coil if you stop it
automatically<00:01:26.649> goes<00:01:26.889> down<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.490> threshold

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
automatically goes down to the threshold

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.929 
automatically goes down to the threshold
level<00:01:27.999> that<00:01:28.299> you<00:01:28.389> preset<00:01:29.459> okay<00:01:30.459> so<00:01:30.520> out<00:01:30.759> of<00:01:30.789> the

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
level that you preset okay so out of the

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.019 
level that you preset okay so out of the
gate<00:01:31.139> really<00:01:32.139> nice<00:01:32.409> feature<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.889> love<00:01:33.130> it

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:34.029 
gate really nice feature I love it

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:36.149 
gate really nice feature I love it
the<00:01:34.419> compression<00:01:35.049> of<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.259> ground<00:01:35.950> balance

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
the compression of the ground balance

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.889 
the compression of the ground balance
and<00:01:36.579> the<00:01:36.700> dis<00:01:36.969> settings<00:01:37.389> and<00:01:37.569> I'm<00:01:37.630> using<00:01:37.779> the

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
and the dis settings and I'm using the

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.080 
and the dis settings and I'm using the
word<00:01:38.020> compression<00:01:38.590> maybe<00:01:39.219> not<00:01:39.459> totally

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
word compression maybe not totally

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.690 
word compression maybe not totally
correctly<00:01:40.509> but<00:01:40.689> what<00:01:40.840> I'm<00:01:40.959> saying<00:01:41.229> is<00:01:41.409> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
correctly but what I'm saying is that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.819 
correctly but what I'm saying is that
they<00:01:42.700> seem<00:01:43.029> to<00:01:43.179> be<00:01:43.299> finer<00:01:43.689> adjustments<00:01:44.649> than

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
they seem to be finer adjustments than

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.889 
they seem to be finer adjustments than
on<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.069> back<00:01:45.189> arrow<00:01:45.429> which<00:01:46.299> means<00:01:46.539> anything

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
on the back arrow which means anything

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.109 
on the back arrow which means anything

turn the dials a little bit further to
get<00:01:49.239> the<00:01:49.359> same<00:01:49.599> degree<00:01:49.899> of<00:01:50.139> adjustment<00:01:50.979> on

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
get the same degree of adjustment on

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.699 
get the same degree of adjustment on
both<00:01:51.579> of<00:01:51.909> these<00:01:51.999> and<00:01:52.209> I'll<00:01:52.299> show<00:01:52.569> you<00:01:52.630> that<00:01:53.499> can

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
both of these and I'll show you that can

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.999 
both of these and I'll show you that can
be<00:01:54.569> the<00:01:55.569> disc<00:01:55.869> really<00:01:56.349> blew<00:01:56.499> me<00:01:56.560> away<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:56.859> I'll

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
be the disc really blew me away and I'll

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.499 
be the disc really blew me away and I'll
show<00:01:57.189> you<00:01:57.249> what<00:01:57.669> happened<00:01:57.999> with<00:01:58.119> that<00:01:58.149> when<00:01:58.479> I

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
show you what happened with that when I

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.789 
show you what happened with that when I
when<00:01:58.809> I<00:01:58.869> was<00:01:58.959> playing<00:01:59.259> with<00:01:59.319> it<00:01:59.469> but<00:01:59.619> for

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
when I was playing with it but for

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.069 
when I was playing with it but for
ground<00:02:00.579> balancing<00:02:01.059> very<00:02:01.389> simple<00:02:01.779> you<00:02:01.899> turn

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
ground balancing very simple you turn

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.359 
ground balancing very simple you turn
the<00:02:02.200> machine<00:02:02.499> on<00:02:02.590> make<00:02:02.859> sure<00:02:02.979> it's<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:03.219> Auto

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
the machine on make sure it's in Auto

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.120 
the machine on make sure it's in Auto
that<00:02:04.179> your<00:02:04.419> your<00:02:04.659> pole<00:02:05.139> position<00:02:05.590> switch<00:02:05.799> your

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
that your your pole position switch your

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.400 
that your your pole position switch your
toggle<00:02:06.459> switch<00:02:06.609> is<00:02:06.759> all<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:06.939> way<00:02:06.999> in<00:02:07.090> Auto

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
toggle switch is all the way in Auto

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.740 
toggle switch is all the way in Auto
turn<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.530> on

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.140 

that's<00:02:12.590> your<00:02:12.740> battery<00:02:13.010> check<00:02:13.250> I'm<00:02:13.760> gonna<00:02:13.880> set

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
that's your battery check I'm gonna set

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:25.710 
that's your battery check I'm gonna set
a<00:02:14.180> threshold<00:02:14.390> level<00:02:17.560> there's<00:02:18.560> my<00:02:18.680> threshold

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.030 

so<00:02:26.720> I'm<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> little<00:02:27.020> bit<00:02:27.260> negative<00:02:27.470> I'm<00:02:27.890> gonna

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
so I'm a little bit negative I'm gonna

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.590 
so I'm a little bit negative I'm gonna
turn<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.490> dial<00:02:28.700> here<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.390> knob<00:02:29.570> on

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
turn the dial here that the knob on

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.690 
turn the dial here that the knob on
ground<00:02:30.050> balance<00:02:30.410> slightly<00:02:30.800> positive<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:34.490> of

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
ground balance slightly positive so of

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.630 
ground balance slightly positive so of
negative<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:36.650> saved<00:02:39.370> that's<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.490> pretty

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
negative it just saved that's a pretty

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.340 
negative it just saved that's a pretty
darn<00:02:40.850> close<00:02:41.090> I'm<00:02:41.330> gonna<00:02:41.540> probably<00:02:41.870> just<00:02:42.050> leave

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
darn close I'm gonna probably just leave

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.770 
darn close I'm gonna probably just leave
it<00:02:42.500> there<00:02:42.710> it's<00:02:43.070> really<00:02:43.370> nice<00:02:43.610> what's<00:02:44.510> really

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
it there it's really nice what's really

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.949 
it there it's really nice what's really
cool<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:44.990> it<00:02:45.320> takes<00:02:45.530> more<00:02:45.920> turn<00:02:46.640> orbit<00:02:47.390> turn<00:02:47.660> to

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
cool is it takes more turn orbit turn to

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.990 
cool is it takes more turn orbit turn to
correct<00:02:48.290> for<00:02:48.980> ground<00:02:49.220> balancing<00:02:49.640> which<00:02:49.760> means

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
correct for ground balancing which means

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.199 
correct for ground balancing which means
you<00:02:50.090> it's<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.390> finer<00:02:50.690> adjustment<00:02:51.320> love<00:02:51.680> that

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
you it's a finer adjustment love that

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.970 
you it's a finer adjustment love that
alright<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:53.420> I'm<00:02:53.540> in<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:54.230> auto<00:02:54.470> mode<00:02:54.800> I'm

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
alright so I'm in the auto mode I'm

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.260 
alright so I'm in the auto mode I'm
gonna<00:02:55.070> switch<00:02:55.370> over<00:02:55.550> to<00:02:55.730> disk<00:02:58.090> I'm<00:02:59.090> gonna

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
gonna switch over to disk I'm gonna

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.150 
gonna switch over to disk I'm gonna
crank<00:02:59.720> up<00:02:59.870> my<00:02:59.900> threshold<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.530> bit<00:03:00.709> because<00:03:00.890> as

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
crank up my threshold a bit because as

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.560 
crank up my threshold a bit because as
you<00:03:01.280> know<00:03:01.430> when<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.640> turn<00:03:01.850> your<00:03:01.940> threshold<00:03:02.390> up

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
you know when you turn your threshold up

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.260 
you know when you turn your threshold up
it<00:03:03.500> actually<00:03:03.860> adds<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.610> depth<00:03:04.910> because

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
it actually adds to the depth because

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.449 
it actually adds to the depth because
you're<00:03:05.390> not<00:03:05.510> getting<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:05.900> diminishing<00:03:06.860> tone

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
you're not getting that diminishing tone

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.880 
you're not getting that diminishing tone
as<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:07.880> get<00:03:08.270> deeper<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.750> kind<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:08.990> holds<00:03:09.200> a

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
as you get deeper it kind of holds a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.910 
as you get deeper it kind of holds a
steady<00:03:10.580> volume<00:03:11.150> as<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.660> go<00:03:11.780> deeper<00:03:12.140> I'm<00:03:12.709> only

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
steady volume as you go deeper I'm only

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.680 
steady volume as you go deeper I'm only
gonna<00:03:13.100> set<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.520> on<00:03:13.730> three<00:03:14.030> right<00:03:14.209> now<00:03:14.240> but<00:03:14.660> I

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
gonna set this on three right now but I

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.780 
gonna set this on three right now but I
want<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:14.959> show<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.310> something<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:16.459> blew<00:03:16.610> me

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
want to show you something that blew me

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.600 
want to show you something that blew me
away<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.209> has<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.510> do<00:03:17.660> with<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.900> disk<00:03:18.610> on

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
away and it has to do with the disk on

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.140 
away and it has to do with the disk on
all<00:03:19.880> my<00:03:20.060> other<00:03:20.180> metal<00:03:20.510> detectors<00:03:22.000> when<00:03:23.000> I'm

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
all my other metal detectors when I'm

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.940 
all my other metal detectors when I'm
adjusting<00:03:23.690> my<00:03:23.900> gist<00:03:24.260> when<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.530> want<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.830> see

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
adjusting my gist when I want to see

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.560 
adjusting my gist when I want to see
what's<00:03:25.130> in<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.340> ground<00:03:25.550> I<00:03:25.760> usually<00:03:26.060> max<00:03:26.360> it

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
what's in the ground I usually max it

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.229 
what's in the ground I usually max it
out<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.830> get<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.010> tone<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.580> in<00:03:28.850> my<00:03:29.000> head<00:03:29.209> I

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
out and I get a tone and in my head I

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.270 
out and I get a tone and in my head I
know<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.720> it's<00:03:29.840> either<00:03:30.050> for<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.800> most<00:03:30.980> part

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
know that it's either for the most part

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.820 
know that it's either for the most part
a<00:03:31.430> quarter<00:03:31.850> or<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.030> dime<00:03:32.120> on<00:03:33.080> this<00:03:33.500> metal

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
a quarter or a dime on this metal

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.850 
a quarter or a dime on this metal
detector<00:03:34.300> this<00:03:35.300> metal<00:03:35.780> detector<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:36.680> can

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
detector this metal detector you can

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.759 
detector this metal detector you can
actually<00:03:37.070> disc<00:03:38.030> out<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.330> dime<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.900> still<00:03:39.590> have

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
actually disc out a dime and still have

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.000 
actually disc out a dime and still have
a<00:03:39.980> touch<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.430> control<00:03:40.910> left<00:03:41.200> for<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.230> quarter<00:03:42.680> so

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
a touch of control left for a quarter so

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.039 
a touch of control left for a quarter so
basically<00:03:43.790> what<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.030> means<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.450> you<00:03:44.600> can<00:03:44.630> ID

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
basically what that means is you can ID

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.770 
basically what that means is you can ID
a<00:03:45.200> dime<00:03:45.560> on<00:03:45.860> this<00:03:46.040> machine<00:03:46.190> you<00:03:46.670> can<00:03:47.540> tell

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
a dime on this machine you can tell

don't<00:04:01.040> even<00:04:01.190> know<00:04:01.370> it's<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.549> little<00:04:01.760> bit<00:04:01.850> of

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
don't even know it's a little bit of

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.789 
don't even know it's a little bit of
travel<00:04:02.299> left

let me just demo that for you real quick

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.640 
let me just demo that for you real quick
I'm<00:04:05.269> gonna<00:04:05.420> go<00:04:06.110> over<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.320> dime<00:04:06.500> first<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.810> now

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
I'm gonna go over the dime first and now

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.410 
I'm gonna go over the dime first and now
I'm<00:04:09.739> gonna<00:04:09.860> maxed<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:10.340> out<00:04:10.459> max<00:04:10.850> out<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.180> disk

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
I'm gonna maxed it out max out the disk

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.810 
I'm gonna maxed it out max out the disk
not<00:04:11.780> max<00:04:12.019> up<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.290> disk<00:04:12.530> but<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.920> disk<00:04:13.190> out<00:04:13.370> the

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
not max up a disk but the disk out the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.270 
not max up a disk but the disk out the
dime<00:04:14.080> so<00:04:15.080> that's<00:04:15.290> three<00:04:15.500> times<00:04:15.650> fast

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
dime so that's three times fast

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.420 
dime so that's three times fast
so<00:04:16.430> I'm<00:04:16.519> gonna<00:04:16.640> rotate<00:04:16.820> this<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:19.160> dimes

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
so I'm gonna rotate this and the dimes

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.690 
so I'm gonna rotate this and the dimes
gone<00:04:19.729> right<00:04:20.419> gone<00:04:21.169> I<00:04:21.440> still<00:04:21.979> have<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.310> little

gone right gone I still have a little

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.060 
gone right gone I still have a little
bit<00:04:22.820> left<00:04:23.030> on<00:04:23.240> my<00:04:23.630> my<00:04:24.020> disk

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
bit left on my my disk

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.430 
bit left on my my disk
setting<00:04:25.730> I<00:04:25.940> can<00:04:26.420> raise<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.140> bit<00:04:27.350> because

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
setting I can raise that a bit because

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.360 
setting I can raise that a bit because
watch<00:04:28.060> now<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.090> have<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.300> quarter<00:04:30.070> so<00:04:31.070> here<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.280> am

a<00:05:22.460> bit<00:05:22.670> somehow<00:05:23.000> I<00:05:23.990> can<00:05:24.350> ID<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:24.620> dime<00:05:24.890> and<00:05:26.140> if<00:05:27.140> I

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
a bit somehow I can ID a dime and if I

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.590 
a bit somehow I can ID a dime and if I
move<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.670> control<00:05:28.970> a<00:05:29.000> little<00:05:29.120> bit<00:05:29.270> further

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
move the control a little bit further

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.110 
move the control a little bit further
you<00:05:30.320> know<00:05:30.440> I<00:05:30.620> maxed<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.250> control<00:05:31.610> out<00:05:31.640> and<00:05:32.030> I

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
you know I maxed the control out and I

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.550 
you know I maxed the control out and I
can<00:05:32.270> still<00:05:32.480> pick<00:05:32.630> up<00:05:32.750> a<00:05:32.840> quarter<00:05:33.170> half<00:05:33.530> dollar

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
can still pick up a quarter half dollar

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.130 
can still pick up a quarter half dollar
dollar<00:05:34.160> whatever<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.760> high<00:05:34.910> you<00:05:35.240> know

coins<00:05:38.180> are<00:05:38.480> still<00:05:38.720> there<00:05:38.900> but<00:05:39.080> I<00:05:39.560> can<00:05:39.740> max<00:05:39.950> out

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
coins are still there but I can max out

a<00:05:40.190> dime<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.760> think<00:05:41.210> that's<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:41.600> disc<00:05:41.840> out<00:05:41.960> of

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
a dime I think that's the disc out of

I<00:05:43.460> think<00:05:44.090> that's<00:05:44.240> a<00:05:44.300> great<00:05:44.600> feature<00:05:46.300> it

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
I think that's a great feature it

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
happened on the low end as well I

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.420 
happened on the low end as well I
actually<00:05:49.160> put<00:05:49.490> a<00:05:49.520> piece<00:05:49.700> of<00:05:49.730> foil<00:05:50.060> on<00:05:50.300> here<00:05:50.600> and

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
actually put a piece of foil on here and

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.450 
actually put a piece of foil on here and
a<00:05:53.560> ring<00:05:54.560> that<00:05:54.710> I<00:05:54.770> had<00:05:55.130> and<00:05:55.460> on<00:05:55.700> my<00:05:55.910> my<00:05:56.480> target<00:05:57.110> ID

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
detectors before you went out at zero

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.420 
detectors before you went out at zero
and<00:06:01.850> the<00:06:02.570> ring<00:06:02.720> went<00:06:02.900> out<00:06:02.990> at<00:06:03.140> six<00:06:03.470> when<00:06:04.400> I

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
and the ring went out at six when I

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.100 
and the ring went out at six when I
checked<00:06:04.790> it<00:06:04.910> against<00:06:05.210> my<00:06:05.360> might<00:06:05.720> to<00:06:05.870> soar<00:06:06.080> over

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
checked it against my might to soar over

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.310 
checked it against my might to soar over
Cairo<00:06:07.150> there<00:06:08.150> was<00:06:08.270> a<00:06:08.300> slight<00:06:08.750> difference<00:06:09.170> but

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
Cairo there was a slight difference but

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.290 
Cairo there was a slight difference but
not<00:06:09.560> much<00:06:09.770> on<00:06:10.070> this<00:06:10.640> machine<00:06:11.000> it's<00:06:11.150> about

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
not much on this machine it's about

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.180 
not much on this machine it's about
twice<00:06:11.630> what<00:06:11.810> it<00:06:11.990> was<00:06:12.110> on<00:06:12.140> the<00:06:12.350> Vaquero<00:06:12.740> again

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
twice what it was on the Vaquero again

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.820 
twice what it was on the Vaquero again
is<00:06:13.370> the<00:06:13.580> separation<00:06:14.270> of<00:06:14.450> targets<00:06:15.410> with<00:06:15.650> this

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
is the separation of targets with this

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.800 
is the separation of targets with this
discrimination<00:06:16.430> knob<00:06:16.700> is<00:06:16.880> just<00:06:17.120> to<00:06:17.690> me
