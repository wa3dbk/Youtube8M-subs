00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 saddle chaton and good evening then today 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.069
 Saturday just to go out and start today 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.170
 I had another week of outfits 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.719
 made september october something of 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.120
 genre or a video a day for 7 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.539
 days starting from Saturday today to Saturday 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.730
 8 Saturday 9 no lost count anyway 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.850
 date saturday hour for seven days one 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.769
 thick per day so that I make you 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.410
 see how practically I dress all 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.109
 the week will be above all outfits 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.989
 from day that you hardly ever see 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.700
 so i guess i hope that's fine because 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.850
 however I go to study outside in the evening 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.309
 it's cold and so ascom maybe tonight 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.050
 but on another evening I will go out 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.510
 surely this day 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.000
 week and therefore will be auschwitz 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.180
 I don't know so much shawls they are 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.579
 two more new things arrive and then now 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.949
 the real cold has arrived 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.780
 serious and I have the opportunity to wear 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.160
 also things he had never been able to 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 put so far because it still is n't 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.019
 arrived not arrived the frost has nothing 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.330
 having said that we begin then for 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.060
 regarding the trick this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.520
 lipstick which is debora's number 5 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.799
 of the other line believes me if not 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.200
 mistake is the number 5 and a pure red 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.259
 you see I have already seen that you see it 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.659
 more orange however it is a beautiful red not 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.409
 deep red, just a pure red 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.110
 beautiful scarlet and this ours 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.540
 copied his own copy from the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.909
 relational which is another youtuber 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.979
 really very good talented and there 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.659
 I leave his channel below for that 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.250
 he deserves that he went to see her 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.470
 just copied the tutorial made 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.820
 on how to put this lipstick on and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.790
 next day I went to buy it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.070
 because I fell in love with his video 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.020
 you see the actual red this on which 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.820
 it is more orange orange therefore if 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.310
 you are interested in the color, go and see it 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.780
 precisely in his channel then on the eyes 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.520
 nothing i know 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.890
 black eyeliner and fold it slightly 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.400
 darkened with a gray eye shadow but then 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.549
 the accessories or these three rings that 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.920
 are three twin rings three rings 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.170
 these are the twins and they are of asus 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.069
 rings these golden gold rings 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.500
 of course it is the bought that there were i 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.780
 balances very high balances all over the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.150
 tv jewelry 12 months ago something of the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.160
 kind so I don't know if there are if there 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.959
 they are still but they are really beautiful 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.040
 however if you are interested go up 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.700
 asus dot com 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.170
 look for type with set rings found 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.239
 definitely something like that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.190
 and then there are these beautiful earrings that 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.280
 they are to accessorize these very old ones 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.819
 really that these pearls are with them 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.069
 shield around for they are light though 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.739
 they are important they seem to be heavy 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.150
 really read the very comfortable rings 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.000
 these earrings after a little bit me 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.209
 give boredom mimÃ¬ it weighs me don't make me 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.769
 bad for the ears and instead these are 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.170
 perfect coeli i love them so much e 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.700
 then I think they give light that is typical 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.430
 seriously embellish these earrings 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.250
 I absolutely love are 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.829
 accessorize I told you and buy it 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.690
 but like 34 years ago so I don't know if 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.209
 I don't think there are still I don't think 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.209
 just there are still okay i do 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.950
 see the fit then this is the outfit 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.530
 I'll show you wearing it a 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.380
 Zara's ankle boots start from the feet 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.650
 which I really believe came to you 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.299
 nausea to see them but they are warm and comfortable 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.040
 especially I wanted to put here 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.500
 very high heels but they are very bad 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.970
 and therefore opted for these boots in 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.900
 alternative because they took me on 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.070
 nervous and did not know what to choose then 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.200
 the Parisian women because it is cold 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.350
 20 denier tights stockings I bought 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.840
 from 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.910
 where as for example the cards but these 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.090
 I'm from the golden lady I bought 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.400
 at the supermarket 20 denarii you see Paris 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.710
 cas invested but I'll show you 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.310
 later because they deserve a whole thing 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.650
 then part of the scarf to that 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.050
 high school black wool scarf just at that 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.330
 to me those front in the back of those 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.090
 very large scarves that I wear 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.210
 normal so curled then the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.970
 fur coat that is science ailes not 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.570
 mistake of science mind that this 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:23.050
 lined fur-lined fur coat 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:29.980
 synthetic naturally and with pockets 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:32.650
 here long and hot very hot 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.470
 that is the neck now okay now I do 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.290
 see me leave me so this is it 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.060
 the hope with which he went out now I do 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.810
 but see the highlight because I go to 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.990
 to dance 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.500
 you see a fur coat that the neck 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.690
 round not buttons but hooks with 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:55.420
 bra type hooks in here 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:59.350
 so the bag this of of zara that is 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:02.410
 old and the record of the genre anyway 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.290
 this very simple and now I do 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.350
 see this this delight but under a 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.780
 another black cardigan but there is no 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.820
 amount is not essential simply 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.280
 when I go to speak I take it out when 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.400
 I'm holding it, but above it is the fit 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.800
 he thought with that thing about pedestrians and 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.750
 then to this dress it means what it is 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.820
 true is let's say average length 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.250
 I wear skirts too many times 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.120
 you know with two layers because what 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.310
 you see all two veiled layers 12 but in the 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.880
 complex I believe that not 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:42.450
 and transparent the material is beautiful 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.230
 there really is naturally is that is 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:49.050
 those synthetic situations but it's beautiful 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.210
 falls well I think it is cut here 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.700
 he had been lucky he fell 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.850
 precise on the breast in a port and bra 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:01.710
 because I don't need it so much and so the 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:04.740
 straight cut so a peter and then there is 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.770
 this crazy detail than this one 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.740
 network, however, in a network with the 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.320
 short sleeve and this weaving step 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.680
 which I believe is a thing about 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:20.340
 that is what is beautiful and behind it 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.230
 hinge here I don't know I 've seen 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.270
 this dress is beautiful and I took it 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.760
 on this he is inspired by I do not know exactly 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.850
 how to pronounce however one writes ch oh 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.920
 yes point with I leave the site link 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.390
 or of the product if I go to look for it 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.890
 below and I don't know what we can 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.810
 maybe the most beautiful dress I have 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.210
 at least I am in love with it 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.430
 of course to put a scarf here 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.710
 because in fact better than cold 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.900
 but this thing to go dancing is 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.400
 one thing I don't know is beautiful myself 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:56.090
 I really think it's beautiful and nothing 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.090
 see you tomorrow
