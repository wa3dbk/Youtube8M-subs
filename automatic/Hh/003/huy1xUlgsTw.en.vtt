hey<00:00:06.960> what's<00:00:07.200> up<00:00:07.319> guys<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.799> nightclub<00:00:08.160> gamer

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
hey what's up guys a nightclub gamer

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.850 
hey what's up guys a nightclub gamer
here<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.660> gonna<00:00:09.780> be<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.170> weapon<00:00:10.530> sight

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
here and this is gonna be a weapon sight

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.089 
here and this is gonna be a weapon sight
comparison<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:11.700> battlefield<00:00:12.420> 3<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.500> have

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
comparison on battlefield 3 so I have

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.310 
comparison on battlefield 3 so I have
the<00:00:14.309> holographic<00:00:15.000> sight<00:00:15.240> versus<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.929> red<00:00:16.109> dot

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
the holographic sight versus the red dot

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.340 
the holographic sight versus the red dot
sight<00:00:16.619> today<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.330> two<00:00:18.330> similar<00:00:18.810> sites<00:00:19.109> but

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
sight today and two similar sites but

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.830 
sight today and two similar sites but
they<00:00:19.470> do<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.800> some<00:00:20.100> different<00:00:20.689> specs<00:00:21.689> about

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
they do have some different specs about

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.710 
they do have some different specs about
them<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.920> holographic<00:00:23.580> sight<00:00:23.820> has<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> 1.5

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
them so the holographic sight has a 1.5

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.650 
them so the holographic sight has a 1.5
x<00:00:25.289> oom<00:00:25.619> versus<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.789> red<00:00:26.970> dot<00:00:27.150> sight<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.539> has

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
x oom versus the red dot sight that has

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.900 
x oom versus the red dot sight that has
a<00:00:27.689> 1.0<00:00:28.470> x<00:00:28.680> oon<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.550> will<00:00:29.640> play<00:00:29.789> an

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
a 1.0 x oon and that will play an

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.679 
a 1.0 x oon and that will play an
important<00:00:30.269> role

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
important role

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.500 
important role
so<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> holographic<00:00:31.830> sight<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> added

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
so the holographic sight was the added

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.780 
so the holographic sight was the added
zoom<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.440> better<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.710> mid-range<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.670> as

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
zoom it is better for mid-range but as

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.389 
zoom it is better for mid-range but as
you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.870> slows<00:00:37.290> down<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you can see here it slows down the the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.190 
you can see here it slows down the the
response<00:00:38.820> time<00:00:39.149> when<00:00:39.450> you're<00:00:39.570> zoomed<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.050> so

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
response time when you're zoomed in so

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.869 
response time when you're zoomed in so
you<00:00:40.590> can't<00:00:40.829> snap<00:00:41.070> around<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> targets<00:00:41.790> as

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
you can't snap around the targets as

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.720 
you can't snap around the targets as
quickly<00:00:42.270> which<00:00:43.050> will<00:00:43.200> affect<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:44.129> your

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
quickly which will affect the your your

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.420 
quickly which will affect the your your
play<00:00:44.969> style<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.289> red<00:00:46.469> dot<00:00:46.649> sight<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.250> it

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
play style so the red dot sight here it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.720 
play style so the red dot sight here it
has<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> 1.0<00:00:48.600> x<00:00:48.840> zoom<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.489> doesn't

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
has a 1.0 x zoom so I really doesn't

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.110 
has a 1.0 x zoom so I really doesn't
zoom<00:00:50.910> at<00:00:51.090> all<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.399> see<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.910> put

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
zoom at all so as you can see here I put

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.819 
zoom at all so as you can see here I put
up<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.390> bars<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> left<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.469> right<00:00:55.590> side

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
up some bars on the left and right side

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.549 
up some bars on the left and right side
of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.010> screen<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.610> those<00:00:57.480> bars<00:00:57.870> indicate

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
of the screen and those bars indicate

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.680 
of the screen and those bars indicate
what<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.190> wouldn't<00:00:59.520> see<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
what you wouldn't see with the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.779 
what you wouldn't see with the
holographic<00:01:01.109> sight<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> bars<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
holographic sight so the bars so the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.369 
holographic sight so the bars so the
highlighted<00:01:03.449> part<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.750> screen<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.019> what

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
highlighted part of the screen is what

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.780 
highlighted part of the screen is what
you<00:01:04.470> would<00:01:04.619> not<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:05.040> zoomed<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.549> was<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you would not see zoomed in was the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.490 
you would not see zoomed in was the
holographic<00:01:06.299> sight<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.140> that's<00:01:07.290> been

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
holographic sight so that's been

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.070 
holographic sight so that's been
considerable<00:01:08.100> area<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:09.840> will<00:01:09.930> play<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
considerable area and that will play a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.100 
considerable area and that will play a
key<00:01:10.409> role<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.710> choosing<00:01:11.189> your<00:01:11.430> sights<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.780> here

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
key role in choosing your sights so here

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
key role in choosing your sights so here
I<00:01:13.140> did<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> mid-range<00:01:13.890> test<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
I did a mid-range test I have to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.480 
I did a mid-range test I have to
Claymore<00:01:15.930> set<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.350> at<00:01:16.530> either<00:01:16.770> end<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.280> van

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
Claymore set up at either end of the van

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.109 
Claymore set up at either end of the van
there<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:19.530> holographic<00:01:20.040> sight<00:01:20.520> should

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
there and the holographic sight should

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.719 
there and the holographic sight should
do<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:22.170> bit<00:01:22.320> better<00:01:22.470> at<00:01:22.740> at<00:01:23.430> this

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
do a little bit better at at this

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.969 
do a little bit better at at this
because<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.450> mid-range<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
because it is mid-range that's what the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.429 
because it is mid-range that's what the
site<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.460> better<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.570> than<00:01:27.810> red<00:01:28.020> dot<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.380> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
site is better for than red dot and you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.350 
site is better for than red dot and you
can<00:01:28.560> see<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.100> did<00:01:29.250> pretty<00:01:29.430> well<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.909> miss

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
can see there it did pretty well I miss

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.819 
can see there it did pretty well I miss
a<00:01:30.390> shot<00:01:30.689> there<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.079> that's<00:01:31.229> not<00:01:31.380> because<00:01:31.530> of

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
a shot there but that's not because of

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.520 
a shot there but that's not because of
sight<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.400> suck<00:01:32.579> at<00:01:32.700> aiming<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.600> here's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
sight I just suck at aiming so here's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.230 
sight I just suck at aiming so here's
the<00:01:34.710> red<00:01:34.860> dot<00:01:35.070> sight<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.150> bit

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the red dot sight it is a little bit

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.420 
the red dot sight it is a little bit
harder<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.540> see<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> claymores<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:38.189> because

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
harder to see the claymores just because

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.640 
harder to see the claymores just because
I<00:01:38.579> am<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.909> fires<00:01:39.150> arranged<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.470> is

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
I am in a fires arranged this this is

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.710 
I am in a fires arranged this this is
not<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> sights<00:01:41.579> made<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.119> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
not really what the sights made for I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.139 
not really what the sights made for I
would<00:01:43.200> recommend<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.009> holographic<00:01:44.759> sight

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
would recommend the holographic sight

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.100 
would recommend the holographic sight
for<00:01:45.540> mid-range

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
for mid-range

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100 
for mid-range
if<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> guys<00:01:47.070> do<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.520> mid-range<00:01:48.060> play<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
if you guys do like mid-range play so I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.999 
if you guys do like mid-range play so I
set<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.740> another<00:01:50.070> scenario<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:51.770> I'm<00:01:52.770> gonna

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
set up another scenario here I'm gonna

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.590 
set up another scenario here I'm gonna
start<00:01:53.250> out<00:01:53.369> from<00:01:53.579> behind<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.000> bus<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.420> got<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
start out from behind this bus I got a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.300 
start out from behind this bus I got a
claymore<00:01:54.990> there<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.619> claymore<00:01:56.070> right

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
claymore there and a claymore right

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.859 
claymore there and a claymore right
there<00:01:56.549> someone's<00:01:56.939> gonna<00:01:57.090> close<00:01:57.329> range<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
there someone's gonna close range and

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.770 
there someone's gonna close range and
once<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> fires<00:01:58.320> are<00:01:58.500> back<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.820> must<00:02:00.509> say

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
once the fires are back and I must say

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.649 
once the fires are back and I must say
both<00:02:01.200> sites<00:02:01.619> did<00:02:01.950> rather<00:02:02.159> well<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.149> test

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
both sites did rather well in this test

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.630 
both sites did rather well in this test
here<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.229> didn't<00:02:04.770> really<00:02:04.950> find<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.369> big

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
here I didn't really find a big

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.609 
here I didn't really find a big
difference<00:02:06.090> between<00:02:06.240> them<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:07.380> boast

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
difference between them and they boast

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.010 
difference between them and they boast
as<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.160> see<00:02:08.280> they're<00:02:08.459> both<00:02:08.729> went<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.810> each

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
as you can see they're both went to each

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.140 
as you can see they're both went to each
target<00:02:10.500> pretty<00:02:11.039> much<00:02:11.250> at<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> same<00:02:11.550> exact

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
target pretty much at the same exact

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.520 
target pretty much at the same exact
time<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.720> there<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.319> no

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
time so there is no

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.410 
time so there is no
real<00:02:13.680> difference<00:02:14.069> there<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
real difference there but this is the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.020 
real difference there but this is the
close<00:02:15.600> range<00:02:15.870> test<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.950> red<00:02:17.550> dot<00:02:17.760> sight

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
close range test and the red dot sight

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.120 
close range test and the red dot sight
might<00:02:18.300> be<00:02:18.480> an<00:02:18.540> instant<00:02:18.810> sign<00:02:19.050> here<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
might be an instant sign here so the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.730 
might be an instant sign here so the
holographic<00:02:20.670> doesn't<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.420> bad<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.650> do

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
holographic doesn't do that bad but I do

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.800 
holographic doesn't do that bad but I do
like<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.550> red<00:02:23.700> dot<00:02:23.880> sight<00:02:24.180> more<00:02:24.450> for<00:02:24.690> this

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
like the red dot sight more for this

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.809 
like the red dot sight more for this
close<00:02:25.020> range<00:02:25.230> scenario<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.550> lot<00:02:26.670> more

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
close range scenario it's a lot more

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.240 
close range scenario it's a lot more
snappier<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:28.230> doesn't<00:02:28.530> feel<00:02:28.650> as<00:02:28.709> bulky

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
snappier and it doesn't feel as bulky

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.490 
snappier and it doesn't feel as bulky
and<00:02:29.490> if<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.030> notice<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.600> red<00:02:30.780> dot<00:02:30.959> sight<00:02:31.260> is

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
and if you notice the red dot sight is

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.770 
and if you notice the red dot sight is
orientated<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:32.670> farther<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.450> front<00:02:33.720> of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
orientated up farther to the front of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.910 
orientated up farther to the front of
your<00:02:33.900> weapon<00:02:34.200> which<00:02:34.350> gives<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.709> more

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
your weapon which gives you a more

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.100 
your weapon which gives you a more
aggressive<00:02:35.270> feeling<00:02:36.270> or<00:02:36.420> more<00:02:36.630> aggressive

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
aggressive feeling or more aggressive

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.220 
aggressive feeling or more aggressive
site<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.120> holographic<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.750> placed<00:02:40.020> back

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
site and the holographic is placed back

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.010 
site and the holographic is placed back
more<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.209> overall<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.239> would<00:02:42.450> recommend<00:02:42.900> the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
more so overall I would recommend the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.199 
more so overall I would recommend the
red<00:02:43.200> dot<00:02:43.410> sight<00:02:43.739> for<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.040> guys<00:02:44.310> if<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.090> do

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
red dot sight for you guys if you do

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.300 
red dot sight for you guys if you do
like<00:02:45.450> playing<00:02:45.750> fast<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.470> hard<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.920> would

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
like playing fast and hard I would

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.770 
like playing fast and hard I would
definitely<00:02:47.670> go<00:02:47.760> for<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:47.970> red<00:02:48.120> dot<00:02:48.330> sight<00:02:48.630> it's

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
definitely go for the red dot sight it's

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.170 
definitely go for the red dot sight it's
better<00:02:48.959> up<00:02:49.140> close<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.769> can<00:02:50.370> snap<00:02:50.910> onto

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
better up close and you can snap onto

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.850 
better up close and you can snap onto
those<00:02:51.390> targets<00:02:51.780> really<00:02:51.900> quickly<00:02:52.380> the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
those targets really quickly the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.560 
those targets really quickly the
holographics<00:02:53.519> made<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> more<00:02:54.300> mid-range

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
holographics made for a more mid-range

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.540 
holographics made for a more mid-range
combat<00:02:55.230> scenario<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.830> feel<00:02:56.010> like<00:02:56.130> men<00:02:56.310> range

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
combat scenario so I feel like men range

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.309 
combat scenario so I feel like men range
stuff<00:02:56.880> definitely<00:02:57.480> goal<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.930> holographic

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
stuff definitely goal is the holographic

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.970 
stuff definitely goal is the holographic
sight

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
sight

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.650 
sight
hopefully<00:02:59.819> that<00:02:59.970> opened<00:03:00.269> up<00:03:00.330> your<00:03:00.480> eyes<00:03:00.540> to

hopefully that opened up your eyes to

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.500 
hopefully that opened up your eyes to
