00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
noise too though right it could be a

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.020 
noise too though right it could be a
noise<00:05:26.230> because<00:05:26.770> if<00:05:26.920> it's<00:05:27.100> silence<00:05:27.610> it's

29<00:06:42.300> 35<00:06:43.879> points35<00:06:44.879> points<00:06:45.599> I<00:06:45.719> add<00:06:45.960> many<00:06:46.919> shots

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
29 35 points35 points I add many shots

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.769 
29 35 points35 points I add many shots
