see them but does have purple pants
uh-huh<00:02:08.750> there's<00:02:09.750> different<00:02:10.110> ways<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.410> they

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
uh-huh there's different ways that they

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.809 
uh-huh there's different ways that they
could<00:02:10.709> hold<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.400> wrecking<00:02:11.790> ball

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
could hold a wrecking ball

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.229 
could hold a wrecking ball
and<00:02:12.909> I<00:02:13.840> think<00:02:13.989> this<00:02:14.379> is<00:02:14.560> well<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.519> could<00:02:15.730> set

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
and I think this is well you could set

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.910 
and I think this is well you could set
it<00:02:16.269> up<00:02:16.510> with<00:02:16.659> your<00:02:16.780> imagination<00:02:17.409> but<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.769> is

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
it up with your imagination but this is

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.589 
it up with your imagination but this is
a<00:02:17.950> pretty<00:02:18.219> cool<00:02:18.549> way<00:02:18.609> to<00:02:18.819> display<00:02:19.359> them<00:02:19.480> I

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
a pretty cool way to display them I

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.869 
a pretty cool way to display them I
guess<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:20.439> you<00:02:20.650> could<00:02:20.920> set<00:02:21.069> him<00:02:21.189> up<00:02:21.280> as<00:02:21.489> hamp

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
guess like you could set him up as hamp

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.869 
guess like you could set him up as hamp
and<00:02:22.120> his<00:02:22.269> regular<00:02:22.689> version<00:02:23.760> absorbing<00:02:24.760> the
