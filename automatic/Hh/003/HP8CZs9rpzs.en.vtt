00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
okay this video is to show you how to

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.619 
okay this video is to show you how to
mount<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.720> speed<00:00:04.319> brace<00:00:04.970> onto<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.000> steel<00:00:06.270> stud

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
mount a speed brace onto a steel stud

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.419 
mount a speed brace onto a steel stud
there<00:00:06.870> are<00:00:06.930> two<00:00:07.170> methodologies<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:08.069> do<00:00:08.220> that

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
there are two methodologies to do that

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.700 
there are two methodologies to do that
first<00:00:09.150> one<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.719> use<00:00:09.780> our<00:00:10.050> custom<00:00:10.500> speed

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
first one is to use our custom speed

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.100 
first one is to use our custom speed
race<00:00:10.920> anchor<00:00:11.370> right<00:00:11.550> here<00:00:11.849> with<00:00:12.360> an<00:00:12.509> undercut

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
race anchor right here with an undercut

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.770 
race anchor right here with an undercut
head<00:00:13.410> which<00:00:14.130> allows<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.880> go<00:00:15.089> into<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.480> steel

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
head which allows you to go into a steel

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.260 
head which allows you to go into a steel
stud<00:00:16.049> number<00:00:16.379> one<00:00:16.619> but<00:00:17.220> also<00:00:17.250> then<00:00:17.820> mount<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
stud number one but also then mount the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.929 
stud number one but also then mount the
screw<00:00:18.810> flush<00:00:19.320> with<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.680> speed<00:00:19.949> brace<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.820> have

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
screw flush with the speed brace we have

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.910 
screw flush with the speed brace we have
a<00:00:20.970> special<00:00:21.480> video<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:22.140> showing<00:00:22.529> how<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.680> make

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
a special video just showing how to make

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.679 
a special video just showing how to make
that<00:00:23.070> all<00:00:23.220> happen<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:24.210> you're<00:00:24.330> mounting<00:00:24.480> a

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
that all happen but if you're mounting a

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.630 
that all happen but if you're mounting a
granite<00:00:25.140> countertop<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> speed<00:00:26.160> brace<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.609> a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
granite countertop on a speed brace on a

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.330 
granite countertop on a speed brace on a
steel<00:00:26.970> stud<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.840> might<00:00:28.199> want<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.740> little<00:00:28.769> more

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
steel stud you might want a little more

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.529 
steel stud you might want a little more
support<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.000> I'm<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.210> show<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.359> how<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
support so I'm going to show you how to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.410 
support so I'm going to show you how to
do<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.960> by<00:00:31.439> blocking<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.399> backside<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
do that by blocking the backside of the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.270 
do that by blocking the backside of the
steel<00:00:33.630> stud<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.410> let's<00:00:34.620> go<00:00:34.800> around<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.190> other

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
steel stud so let's go around the other

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.700 
steel stud so let's go around the other
side<00:00:35.570> real<00:00:36.570> quickly<00:00:36.870> before<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.350> get<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.649> on

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
side real quickly before we get going on

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.200 
side real quickly before we get going on
the<00:00:37.800> blocking<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.520> see<00:00:38.760> here's<00:00:39.090> our

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the blocking you can see here's our

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.260 
the blocking you can see here's our
anchor<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.559> spread<00:00:40.950> out<00:00:41.149> against<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
anchor and it's spread out against the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.930 
anchor and it's spread out against the
steel<00:00:42.540> stud<00:00:42.840> has<00:00:43.020> great<00:00:43.440> holding<00:00:43.920> power<00:00:44.160> but

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
steel stud has great holding power but

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.970 
steel stud has great holding power but
we<00:00:45.120> might<00:00:45.300> want<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.600> add<00:00:45.780> some<00:00:45.809> blocking<00:00:46.739> in

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
we might want to add some blocking in

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.650 
we might want to add some blocking in
the<00:00:47.100> back<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.579> let's<00:00:47.610> go<00:00:47.910> into<00:00:48.210> showing<00:00:48.450> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the back so let's go into showing you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.200 
the back so let's go into showing you
how<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.870> do<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.730> so<00:00:50.730> we're<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.000> put<00:00:51.120> our

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
how to do that so we're going to put our

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.540 
how to do that so we're going to put our
speed<00:00:51.510> brace<00:00:51.780> right<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.500> area<00:00:52.770> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
speed brace right here in this area so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
speed brace right here in this area so
we<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.850> want<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> take<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> 2x4<00:00:54.600> about<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
we just want to take a 2x4 about the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.619 
we just want to take a 2x4 about the
size<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.370> want<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> speed<00:00:57.420> race

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
size that you want to put the speed race

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
size that you want to put the speed race
in<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.109> put<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.039> like<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.250> and
