00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.969
 ah 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.070
 Hello, Carlos, how are we here? 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.040
 we were missing an ingredient with this 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.560
 today's recipe that is bread because I think 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.610
 that if I'm not wrong, you got to 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.250
 just moment and place and place don 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.340
 that we achieved the cea bread that is 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.180
 tradition of the area 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.950
 comes from our ancestors and I think that 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.650
 we make the best bread in the world and what 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.050
 means for the carlos oven 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.570
 belong to a geographical indication 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.670
 protected when they only increased it one 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.160
 of carlos but to all the products that 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.440
 we are covered under the hallmark of 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.180
 the people who open doors to you that before 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.670
 they are practically closed as they are 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.309
 zinc disposal conversion shops 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.320
 carlos and what are the ingredients that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.660
 they help you to be within the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.520
 protected geographical indication not 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.259
 we use chemical products since 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.920
 they are not authorized by the council 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.190
 regulator and the only thing it says is three 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.490
 parts of the country tribe of flour 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.590
 factory ferment natural salt and water and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.020
 how a bread is made 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.640
 for your bread is made in the first place there 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.030
 that have a lot of love and a lot of love to the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.079
 profession to make cea bread 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.350
 normally the bread said comes from 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.750
 tradition of parents and children is going to 300 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.390
 of parents and children in this case I 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.560
 practically an upstart since 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.860
 the own baker in my lord of his 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.860
 parents 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.369
 the malahÃ¡ itself coast of the parties the 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.350
 first mix of the dough for 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.329
 make a let's say the flour is 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.609
 homogeneously compatible all 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.380
 spread out and then later move to the 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.469
 second phase now what does the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.390
 kneading itself then after it is passed to 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.000
 rock the mass yet 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.039
 wooden container that is called 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.840
 artesa and there it happens what is the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.040
 The frequency of training depends on the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.770
 room temperature that we have in my 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.230
 local does this this natural does not use in 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.540
 fermenters or anything can not ricard the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.610
 fermentation and processor the informant 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.160
 and none of this is all art its the only one 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.290
 allows us the regulatory advice is what 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.480
 which is the kneader then later it 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.340
 passes the division of the mass and to achieve 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.770
 you will get what we call 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.540
 the most in road functions is divided 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.180
 depending on what a trace of 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.420
 pantic and the 100 kilos 200 occasion a 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.569
 tooth that would be 500 to 600 hours 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.790
 always turning the mass in direction in the 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.150
 software of a clock and it gets one time 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.830
 that is firm has exceeded done it gets 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.810
 in a linen cloth in one let's say in a 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.890
 wooden workshop a linen cloth and it 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.990
 puts like the close up 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.390
 he is given a rest between real beyond 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.330
 of all 15 minutes that we 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.069
 we call the child asleep it 's as if 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.850
 it was a small baby that you have to 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.460
 take care of it and pamper it 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.320
 once we have galvanic with the others 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.350
 to two human events we spend what it does 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.840
 when baking and baking is completely 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.130
 other than a baking of a bakery 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.670
 let's say industrial or traditional 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.490
 but make bread by bread and where he picks 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.470
 baker when putting in the pot in the long 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.800
 gives you a cut to work on your part 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.310
 superior that we say is the signature of the 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.180
 of the artisans and when a buoy is 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.540
 in conditions 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.810
 good optima and we see that it breeds us those 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.160
 thorns in its central upper part 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.140
 we made the batch going to wind 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.480
 what makes the whole place of the oven 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.480
 Both interior and interiors are 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.000
 more helps to maintain the temperature of the 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.000
 center 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:15.620
 Never 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:19.890
 we started 120 degrees which we took 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.630
 good with great ones as they say here 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.630
 big horse walk or bouquets 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.040
 and this sticker you are going to put here 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.800
 this is a sticker 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.240
 the bread of this and choose always costs 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.729
 stickers on the mold that is and with 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.039
 a dose 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.930
 yes to any self-respecting consumer 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.059
 for consuming cea bread has to 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.509
 present what the pot is and then you 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:51.219
 we put here is corresponding 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.349
 we are going to take to palace 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:55.509
 to know what we're going to do a plate of 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.370
 profit and hopefully everything goes well 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.969
 thank you very much for all Carmen and thank you
