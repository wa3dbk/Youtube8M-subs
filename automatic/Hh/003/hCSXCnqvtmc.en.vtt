then after that you reduce the oven

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.130 
then after that you reduce the oven
temperature<00:02:02.490> by<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> hundred<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.509> sixty-eight

degrees and cook just the hot dog by

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.460 
degrees and cook just the hot dog by
itself<00:02:08.160> for<00:02:09.090> another<00:02:09.270> six<00:02:09.750> minutes

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
itself for another six minutes

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.820 
itself for another six minutes
25<00:02:11.040> seconds<00:02:11.670> when<00:02:12.510> exactly<00:02:12.660> one<00:02:13.260> minute<00:02:13.530> has

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
25 seconds when exactly one minute has

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190 
25 seconds when exactly one minute has
passed<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.850> five<00:02:15.180> minutes<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.720> 25

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200

like out of the refrigerator so I'm

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.450 
like out of the refrigerator so I'm

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
going to turn out because the slices of

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.699 
going to turn out because the slices of
pizza<00:02:41.070> aren't<00:02:41.670> really<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.180> big<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.530> don't

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
know how I'm going to get them to stay

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.800 
know how I'm going to get them to stay
in<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.420> u-shape<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:47.070> hold<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.760> hot<00:02:47.970> dog<00:02:48.270> like<00:02:48.780> a

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
in a u-shape to hold the hot dog like a

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.449 
in a u-shape to hold the hot dog like a
hot<00:02:49.080> dog<00:02:49.320> bun<00:02:49.620> would<00:02:49.800> be<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:52.340> don't<00:02:53.340> know

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
hot dog bun would be in so I don't know

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.610 
hot dog bun would be in so I don't know
if<00:02:53.580> I'm<00:02:53.670> gonna<00:02:53.790> make<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.060> at<00:02:54.270> this<00:02:54.300> point<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.590> a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
if I'm gonna make it at this point so a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.680 
if I'm gonna make it at this point so a
little<00:02:55.860> bit<00:02:56.070> more<00:02:56.310> time<00:02:56.610> has<00:02:56.790> passed<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.450> feel

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
little bit more time has passed I feel

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.810 
little bit more time has passed I feel
I'm<00:02:57.870> not<00:02:57.900> done<00:02:58.350> with<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.620> cooking<00:02:59.010> process<00:02:59.190> as

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
I'm not done with the cooking process as

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.310 
I'm not done with the cooking process as
the<00:03:00.630> hot<00:03:00.810> dog<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.380> kind<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.010> golden<00:03:02.370> brown

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
the hot dog is kind of golden brown

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.100 
the hot dog is kind of golden brown
mostly<00:03:04.320> brown<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:06.330> pizza<00:03:06.660> cheese<00:03:06.900> is

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
mostly brown and the pizza cheese is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:19.020 
mostly brown and the pizza cheese is
melty

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.930 

so<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.180> didn't<00:03:20.540> really<00:03:20.840> work<00:03:21.430> but<00:03:22.430> on<00:03:22.550> my

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
so this didn't really work but on my

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.090 
so this didn't really work but on my
second<00:03:23.360> thought<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.690> thought<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.170> putting<00:03:24.800> it

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
second thought I thought that putting it

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.520 
second thought I thought that putting it
so<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.370> pizza<00:03:25.790> cheese<00:03:26.540> was<00:03:26.870> touching<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.380> hot

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
so the pizza cheese was touching the hot

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.340 
so the pizza cheese was touching the hot
dog<00:03:27.770> would<00:03:27.980> be<00:03:28.130> easier<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.030> eat<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:29.630> I<00:03:30.080> think

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
dog would be easier to eat and I think

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.310 
dog would be easier to eat and I think
that's<00:03:30.590> going<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:30.920> be<00:03:31.100> my<00:03:31.250> final<00:03:31.640> approach<00:03:35.320> so

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
that's going to be my final approach so

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.020 
that's going to be my final approach so
you<00:03:36.380> made<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.800> this<00:03:36.980> far<00:03:37.040> in<00:03:37.490> a<00:03:37.580> video<00:03:37.970> of

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
you made it this far in a video of

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.390 
you made it this far in a video of
somebody<00:03:38.630> putting<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.350> hot<00:03:39.560> dog<00:03:39.800> inside<00:03:40.220> of

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
somebody putting a hot dog inside of

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.660 
somebody putting a hot dog inside of
pizza<00:03:41.470> time<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.650> rethink<00:03:42.800> what<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.340> two<00:03:43.520> with

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
pizza time to rethink what you two with

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.360 
pizza time to rethink what you two with
your<00:03:43.700> spare<00:03:44.090> time
