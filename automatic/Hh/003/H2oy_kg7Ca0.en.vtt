00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.940
 hello girls in today's video I'm going to talk 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.860
 a little bit for you about the pens 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.619
 of decoration of the left and January 3 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.020
 art and a lot of people think it has 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.029
 I doubt I did a blog post but still 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.519
 There is still a lot of doubt 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.260
 to buy is how her tip as 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.939
 It works so I'll try to do 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.789
 some demonstrations show you 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.669
 It's better for the first time, this is 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.489
 here is the packaging where it comes from this 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.190
 of the rosette and she comes here 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.870
 the packaging looks with this ball and 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.489
 the first application 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.379
 the first application has to be done 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.610
 here because it releases a lot of 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.059
 first vote 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.670
 Look, I'll just try to show you 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.739
 that you need to squeeze look then get out 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.170
 enough ink that is better than you 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.690
 do it here so you do not do nails and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.359
 not strange that you have intended 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.220
 The point of it is very thin and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.619
 and after you press it first 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.549
 You can use the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.850
 lines 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.830
 She is the water base, so you? 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.710
 this allows you to make your drawing 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.299
 that if not sure give the case is is 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.630
 ugly something so you can wash 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.700
 with water and do it again when you 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.830
 The way you wanted it, just pass the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.170
 faster it will also last until 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.210
 the same enamel durability is fine 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:38.670
 I'm here with four colors look green 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:41.880
 the golden one the white and the pink I just do not 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.100
 I have silver here but I made a video 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.189
 quick to show you some 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.350
 decorations were wonderful're not 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.820
 I'm not an expert either, but you can 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.960
 you have a team for you to have a 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.960
 idea of â€‹â€‹how it works 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.340
 ah
