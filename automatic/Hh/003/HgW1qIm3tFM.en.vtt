so<00:00:43.320> basically<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> team<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.370> wanna<00:00:44.520> try<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
so basically as a team you wanna try and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.410 
so basically as a team you wanna try and
protect<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.840> boxes<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> map<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.789> ammo

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
teamwork involved too difficult emotions

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.609 
teamwork involved too difficult emotions
teammates<00:01:15.780> come<00:01:15.930> hold<00:01:16.080> down<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> part<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
teammates come hold down a part of the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.390 
teammates come hold down a part of the
map<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.360> well<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.979> time<00:01:20.220> doing

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
map then you can do well and time doing

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.100 
map then you can do well and time doing
a<00:01:20.520> great<00:01:20.790> score<00:01:21.150> line<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.630> definitely

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
a great score line that is definitely

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.560 
a great score line that is definitely
hard<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.560> think<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.950> box<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.570> should

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
hard so I think this box here should

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.960 
hard so I think this box here should
give<00:01:24.869> me<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.229> new<00:01:25.500> weapon<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.549> go<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.820> check
