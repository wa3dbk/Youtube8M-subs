00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that it that's how to get to high rounds

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.330 
that it that's how to get to high rounds
on<00:01:31.920> zombies<00:01:32.340> video<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:34.950> that's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
on zombies video and so that's that's

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.819 
on zombies video and so that's that's
pretty<00:01:35.610> much<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.240> there's<00:01:36.720> still<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.380> little

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
pretty much it there's still a little

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.789 
pretty much it there's still a little
bit<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.130> gameplay<00:01:38.400> left<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.540> I'm<00:01:40.229> using

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
bit of this gameplay left and I'm using

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.969 
bit of this gameplay left and I'm using
VSAT<00:01:41.400> lodestar<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.150> dogs<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.740> gameplay

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
VSAT lodestar and dogs in this gameplay

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.300 
VSAT lodestar and dogs in this gameplay
and<00:01:44.869> what<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.020> basically<00:01:46.140> was<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.799> joined<00:01:47.100> in

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and what it basically was I joined in

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.359 
and what it basically was I joined in
with<00:01:47.610> four<00:01:47.970> minutes<00:01:48.299> left<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> game<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.369> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
with four minutes left of the game and I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.969 
with four minutes left of the game and I
went<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> streak<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.079> ended<00:01:52.320> up<00:01:52.409> 28

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
went on a streak I think I ended up 28

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.060 
went on a streak I think I ended up 28
