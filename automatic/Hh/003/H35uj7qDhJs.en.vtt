00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.930 

so

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:06.940 
so

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.660 
so
make<00:00:07.360> sure<00:00:07.390> grip<00:00:08.109> it<00:00:08.290> all<00:00:08.350> together<00:00:08.670> risen

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
make sure grip it all together risen

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.670 
make sure grip it all together risen
okay<00:00:10.240> and<00:00:12.120> it's<00:00:13.120> like<00:00:13.180> right<00:00:13.540> there<00:00:13.809> and<00:00:14.290> then

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
okay and it's like right there and then

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.170 
okay and it's like right there and then
that's<00:00:14.920> right<00:00:15.129> little<00:00:15.219> spot<00:00:16.800> there<00:00:17.800> and<00:00:18.180> then

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
that's right little spot there and then

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:31.730 
that's right little spot there and then
make<00:00:19.810> sure<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.369> verb<00:00:21.369> is<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:28.380> jump<00:00:29.380> base<00:00:29.860> and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
make sure the verb is in jump base and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.620 
make sure the verb is in jump base and
that's<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.900> for<00:00:33.900> the<00:00:33.989> spawns<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:36.420> have

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that's it for the spawns so if you have

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.080 
that's it for the spawns so if you have
any<00:00:36.900> troubles<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> spawning<00:00:38.220> part<00:00:38.610> this

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
any troubles with the spawning part this

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.680 
any troubles with the spawning part this
is<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.739> solving<00:00:40.739> problem<00:00:41.580> so<00:00:42.120> when<00:00:42.540> you

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
is the solving problem so when you

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.200 
is the solving problem so when you
finish<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.020> move<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:44.040> map<00:00:44.250> into<00:00:44.790> lighting

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
finish that move your map into lighting

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.990 
finish that move your map into lighting
so<00:00:45.540> move<00:00:45.870> into<00:00:46.260> Maps<00:00:46.590> group<00:00:47.010> because<00:00:47.820> that's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
so move into Maps group because that's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.610 
so move into Maps group because that's
where<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.269> reads<00:00:48.449> your<00:00:48.690> maps<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.440> should

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
where it reads your maps and it should

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.490 
where it reads your maps and it should
be<00:00:49.710> gone<00:00:49.920> invisible<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.379> yeah<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.530> gone

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
be gone invisible and yeah it's gone

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.110 
be gone invisible and yeah it's gone
and<00:00:56.090> now<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:58.020> will<00:00:58.230> move<00:00:58.500> these

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.910 

and<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.800> lobby<00:01:02.800> whoops

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.810 

do<00:01:06.189> that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.960 

oh<00:01:11.909> whatever

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.870 

get<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.390> anyway

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.430

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
see of course invisible arms legs torso

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.980 
see of course invisible arms legs torso
flashlights<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.240> added<00:01:55.510> these<00:01:55.630> two<00:01:55.690> new

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
flashlights and I added these two new

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.990 
flashlights and I added these two new
tools<00:01:57.630> they're<00:01:58.630> not<00:01:58.750> necessary<00:01:59.410> just<00:02:00.000> felt

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
tools they're not necessary just felt

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.460 
tools they're not necessary just felt
like<00:02:01.090> adding<00:02:01.450> more<00:02:01.570> tools<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.050> i<00:02:02.080> tried<00:02:02.380> to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
like adding more tools so i tried to

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.370 
like adding more tools so i tried to
come<00:02:02.620> up<00:02:02.650> with<00:02:02.740> something

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
come up with something

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190 
come up with something
by<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.070> way<00:02:05.310> my<00:02:05.850> update<00:02:06.149> upgraded<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> script

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
by the way my update upgraded the script

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.830 
by the way my update upgraded the script
so<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.130> walks<00:02:08.550> faster<00:02:11.540> trying<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.660> bring

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
so that it walks faster trying to bring

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.790 
so that it walks faster trying to bring
the<00:02:12.959> coffee<00:02:13.310> sonek<00:02:14.310> offers<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.120> tutorial

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.960 

yeah<00:02:19.430> anyway<00:02:20.180> back<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.600> this<00:02:21.310> walk<00:02:22.310> faster

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
yeah anyway back to this walk faster

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.010 
yeah anyway back to this walk faster
tool<00:02:23.630> will<00:02:24.530> correct<00:02:24.950> we'll<00:02:25.250> call<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:26.630> tool

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
tool will correct we'll call this tool

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.920 
tool will correct we'll call this tool
and<00:02:27.440> drag<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.610> into<00:02:28.760> your<00:02:29.030> thing<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.720> makes

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
and drag it into your thing and it makes

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.100 
and drag it into your thing and it makes
you<00:02:30.080> walk<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.710> little<00:02:31.310> bit<00:02:31.490> walks<00:02:32.300> faster<00:02:32.930> but

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
you walk a little bit walks faster but

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.080 
you walk a little bit walks faster but
not<00:02:33.320> as<00:02:33.500> fast<00:02:33.530> as<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.160> because<00:02:34.610> if<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:34.910> walk

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
not as fast as it because if you walk

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.870 
not as fast as it because if you walk
faster<00:02:35.450> than<00:02:35.570> it<00:02:35.920> it'd<00:02:36.920> be<00:02:37.040> boring<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:39.880> where's

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
faster than it it'd be boring so where's

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.500 
faster than it it'd be boring so where's
its<00:02:41.480> rim<00:02:42.110> park<00:02:42.580> went<00:02:43.580> until<00:02:43.880> we<00:02:44.030> got<00:02:44.240> here<00:02:45.400> when

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
its rim park went until we got here when

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.270 
its rim park went until we got here when
teleported<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.990> takes<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.800> character

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
teleported it it takes the character

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.090 
teleported it it takes the character
whoever's<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.150> makes<00:02:51.050> her<00:02:51.170> walk<00:02:51.410> speed<00:02:51.740> 30

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
whoever's it and makes her walk speed 30

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.480 
whoever's it and makes her walk speed 30
I<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.520> think<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.030> should<00:02:53.270> come<00:02:54.230> edit<00:02:54.710> and<00:02:55.250> tone

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
I I think you should come edit and tone

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.460 
I I think you should come edit and tone
it<00:02:55.610> down<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.790> bit<00:02:55.910> because<00:02:56.210> when<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:56.600> did<00:02:56.930> test<00:02:57.260> it

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
it down a bit because when I did test it

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.460 
it down a bit because when I did test it
you<00:02:58.010> walk<00:02:58.220> pretty<00:02:58.730> fast<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.330> turn<00:03:00.080> it<00:03:00.170> down<00:03:00.290> it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
you walk pretty fast so turn it down it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.370 
you walk pretty fast so turn it down it
like<00:03:00.820> 125<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:04.390> maybe<00:03:05.390> if<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.750> want<00:03:06.020> your

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
like 125 and maybe if you want your

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.400 
like 125 and maybe if you want your
delight<00:03:06.890> whatever<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:08.030> edit<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.050> script

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
delight whatever and edit the script

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.540 
delight whatever and edit the script
here<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.280> make<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:11.210> check<00:03:12.110> here

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
here and make it check here

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:20.070 
here and make it check here
and<00:03:13.670> make<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.270> walk<00:03:14.450> speed<00:03:16.420> 25<00:03:17.420> less

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.530 

yeah<00:03:20.710> so

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
yeah so

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.840 
yeah so
and<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.349> remove<00:03:23.650> face

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.450 

removes<00:03:27.240> your<00:03:27.660> face<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:28.830> when<00:03:29.280> you're

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
removes your face so when you're

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.420 
removes your face so when you're
completely<00:03:29.820> invisible<00:03:30.800> your<00:03:31.800> face<00:03:32.130> won't<00:03:32.340> be

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
completely invisible your face won't be

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.520 
completely invisible your face won't be
shown<00:03:32.640> either<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.120> it's<00:03:33.270> even<00:03:33.360> twice<00:03:34.080> as<00:03:34.290> hard

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
shown either so it's even twice as hard
