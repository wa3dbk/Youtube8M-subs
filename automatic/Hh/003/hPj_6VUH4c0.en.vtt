that cherry thing that causes a clone of
you<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.969> guess<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.539> continuously<00:00:55.320> get

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
you and I guess you can continuously get

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.139 
you and I guess you can continuously get
this<00:00:55.829> cherry<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.699> tons<00:00:56.969> of

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
this cherry so you can have tons of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.209 
this cherry so you can have tons of
clothes<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.309> but<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.430> are<00:00:59.520> tricky<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:01.219> to

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
clothes of you but they are tricky to to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.160 
clothes of you but they are tricky to to
the<00:01:02.309> maneuver<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.149> saw<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.809> trailer

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the maneuver as we saw in that trailer

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.460 
the maneuver as we saw in that trailer
so<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.250> pretty<00:01:05.489> interesting

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
so that's going to be pretty interesting

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.500 
so that's going to be pretty interesting
anyways<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.680> game<00:01:07.920> looks<00:01:08.189> fantastic<00:01:08.790> can't

would<00:04:39.800> never<00:04:40.039> do<00:04:40.250> something<00:04:40.490> like<00:04:40.699> that<00:04:40.879> but<00:04:41.719> I

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
would never do something like that but I

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.230 
would never do something like that but I
guess<00:04:42.080> now<00:04:42.409> that<00:04:42.439> urea<00:04:42.949> is<00:04:43.340> booting<00:04:43.789> something

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
guess now that urea is booting something

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.480 
guess now that urea is booting something
like<00:04:44.419> that<00:04:44.689> maybe<00:04:45.349> all<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.830> companies<00:04:46.280> are

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
like that maybe all the companies are

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.670 
like that maybe all the companies are
like<00:04:46.669> hey<00:04:46.909> it<00:04:47.240> is<00:04:47.449> a<00:04:47.479> gray<00:04:47.780> area<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.349> isn't

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
like hey it is a gray area it isn't

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.890 
like hey it is a gray area it isn't
exactly<00:04:48.860> black<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:49.819> white<00:04:49.969> so<00:04:50.330> I<00:04:50.360> guess<00:04:50.689> the

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
exactly black and white so I guess the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.790 
exactly black and white so I guess the
gloves<00:04:51.139> are<00:04:51.349> off<00:04:51.379> let's<00:04:51.889> go<00:04:52.099> to<00:04:52.159> town<00:04:52.460> so
