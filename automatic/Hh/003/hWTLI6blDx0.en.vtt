00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.070 

now<00:00:01.709> we<00:00:02.340> have<00:00:02.760> traced<00:00:03.360> around<00:00:03.510> all<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:04.049> edges

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
now we have traced around all the edges

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.940 
now we have traced around all the edges
and<00:00:05.270> now<00:00:06.270> I'm<00:00:06.509> going<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.960> take<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.589> pattern

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
and now I'm going to take the pattern

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.100 
and now I'm going to take the pattern
off<00:00:08.630> the<00:00:09.630> paper<00:00:10.340> or<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.969> t-shirt<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
off the paper or the t-shirt that is the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.079 
off the paper or the t-shirt that is the
pattern<00:00:13.290> off<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.799> paper<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.309> I'm<00:00:14.849> going<00:00:15.000> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
pattern off the paper and I'm going to

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.150 
pattern off the paper and I'm going to
true<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.360> my<00:00:15.690> original<00:00:16.260> lines<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.830> there<00:00:17.010> are

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
true up my original lines and there are

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.880 
true up my original lines and there are
basic<00:00:17.640> things<00:00:19.100> that<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:21.710> take<00:00:22.710> into

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
basic things that we have to take into

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.769 
basic things that we have to take into
account<00:00:23.189> when<00:00:23.609> we're<00:00:23.760> truing<00:00:24.150> things<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.600> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
account when we're truing things up and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.779 
account when we're truing things up and
I'll<00:00:24.840> go<00:00:24.990> over<00:00:25.019> those<00:00:26.090> so<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:28.369> want<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.490> start<00:00:29.550> by

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
I'll go over those so I want to start by

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.359 
I'll go over those so I want to start by
labeling<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.539> with<00:00:31.050> an<00:00:31.199> F<00:00:31.500> or<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.189> word

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
labeling this with an F or the word

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.000 
labeling this with an F or the word
front<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:34.050> my<00:00:34.320> pattern<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.829> this

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
front so I know on my pattern that this

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.540 
front so I know on my pattern that this
is<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> front<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.920> basically<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.129> need<00:00:38.160> right

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
is the front and basically we need right

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.180 
is the front and basically we need right
angles<00:00:39.090> at<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.260> fold<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.890> we're<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
angles at the fold so we're going to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.670 
angles at the fold so we're going to
need<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> right<00:00:41.670> angle<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> top<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.440> we're

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
need a right angle at the top and we're

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.130 
need a right angle at the top and we're
just<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.420> make<00:00:45.420> sure<00:00:45.629> that's<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.960> right

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
just going to make sure that's a right

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:56.330 
just going to make sure that's a right
angle<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.600> then<00:00:52.070> we<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.370> going<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:55.190> go<00:00:56.190> ahead

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
angle and then we are going to go ahead

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.560 
angle and then we are going to go ahead
and<00:00:59.600> take<00:01:00.600> these<00:01:00.780> dotted<00:01:01.079> lines<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.570> connect

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and take these dotted lines and connect

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.469 
and take these dotted lines and connect
them<00:01:03.719> into<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:06.500> straight<00:01:07.500> line<00:01:10.250> or<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.479> more

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
them into a straight line or a more

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.030 
them into a straight line or a more
precise<00:01:12.900> line<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.390> we're<00:01:15.770> carving<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
precise line and we're carving out the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.460 
precise line and we're carving out the
shape<00:01:18.710> with<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.979> new<00:01:20.220> line<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:24.350> little<00:01:25.350> by

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
shape with this new line here little by

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.090 
shape with this new line here little by
little<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.360> connecting<00:01:28.189> these<00:01:29.390> lines<00:01:31.070> into<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
little and connecting these lines into a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.940 
little and connecting these lines into a
shape<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.329> kind<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:34.280> erase

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
shape and then we can kind of erase

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.410 
shape and then we can kind of erase
where<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> lines<00:01:38.280> meet<00:01:38.579> each<00:01:38.729> other<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
where the lines meet each other so it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.700 
where the lines meet each other so it
becomes<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:40.049> thin<00:01:40.380> line<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:44.040> erase<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:45.710> here

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
becomes one thin line and erase and here

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.760 
becomes one thin line and erase and here
we're<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.159> want<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:48.229> think<00:01:49.229> true<00:01:49.590> that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
we're going to want to I think true that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.090 
we're going to want to I think true that
up<00:01:49.920> into<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.220> straight<00:01:50.640> line<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.920> I'm<00:01:55.979> just

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
up into a straight line so I'm just

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.330 
up into a straight line so I'm just
going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.310> blend<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.310> example

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
going to blend it this is a good example

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.550 
going to blend it this is a good example
of<00:01:59.820> truing

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.400 

so<00:02:05.560> we<00:02:05.680> just<00:02:05.830> kind<00:02:06.009> of<00:02:06.070> made<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:08.259> we

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
so we just kind of made that because we

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.169 
so we just kind of made that because we
don't<00:02:08.590> want<00:02:08.800> we<00:02:09.130> don't<00:02:09.399> want<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:09.819> line<00:02:10.060> to

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
don't want we don't want this line to

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.210 
don't want we don't want this line to
come<00:02:10.330> out<00:02:10.450> like<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:10.840> because<00:02:11.740> then<00:02:11.950> at<00:02:12.100> the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
come out like this because then at the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.960 
come out like this because then at the
side<00:02:13.200> seam<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.410> going<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.590> be<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.709> point<00:02:15.100> like

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
side seam it's going to be a point like

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.340 
side seam it's going to be a point like
we<00:02:16.090> definitely<00:02:16.239> want<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.810> be<00:02:16.989> straight

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
we definitely want it to be straight

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.199 
we definitely want it to be straight
like<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.650> right<00:02:17.890> angle<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:19.120> this<00:02:19.780> line<00:02:20.080> stays

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
like a right angle so this line stays

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.160 
like a right angle so this line stays
straight<00:02:22.209> all<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.480> way<00:02:22.720> around<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.730> then<00:02:25.170> we

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
straight all the way around and then we

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.870 
straight all the way around and then we
do<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.290> same<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.739> back<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.670> then<00:02:27.790> we're

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
do the same to the back and then we're

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
do the same to the back and then we're
going<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.060> move<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.569> next<00:02:28.890> step
