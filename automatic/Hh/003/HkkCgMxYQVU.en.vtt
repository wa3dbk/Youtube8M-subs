00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
front one that way lift it up in the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:53.600 
front one that way lift it up in the
door<00:02:40.290> level

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.000 

yeah<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:54.820> we've<00:02:54.970> just<00:02:55.360> put<00:02:55.510> on<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.720> Tmax<00:02:56.350> 9,000

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
yeah so we've just put on a Tmax 9,000

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.070 
yeah so we've just put on a Tmax 9,000
pound<00:02:57.280> winch<00:02:57.580> with<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.060> wire<00:02:58.540> cable<00:02:58.840> as<00:02:59.020> you

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
pound winch with the wire cable as you

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.700 
pound winch with the wire cable as you
can<00:02:59.260> see<00:02:59.610> very<00:03:00.610> easily<00:03:00.790> if<00:03:01.000> we<00:03:01.030> put<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.630> two<00:03:01.780> of

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
can see very easily if we put on two of

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.230 
can see very easily if we put on two of
these<00:03:02.920> which<00:03:03.700> plates

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
these which plates

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.380 
these which plates
it's<00:03:05.020> simple<00:03:05.740> process<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.130> with<00:03:06.970> four<00:03:07.210> bolts

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
it's simple process of with four bolts

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.510 
it's simple process of with four bolts
from<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.990> bottom<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:09.040> that's<00:03:09.130> pretty<00:03:09.430> much

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
from the bottom and that's pretty much

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.860 
from the bottom and that's pretty much
it<00:03:09.730> really<00:03:09.850> it's<00:03:10.300> when<00:03:10.420> you're<00:03:10.540> putting<00:03:10.690> on

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
it really it's when you're putting on

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.720 
it really it's when you're putting on
the<00:03:11.020> putting<00:03:11.920> on<00:03:11.980> my<00:03:12.040> winch<00:03:12.220> make<00:03:12.430> sure<00:03:12.580> this

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
the putting on my winch make sure this

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.560 
the putting on my winch make sure this
cable<00:03:13.630> is<00:03:13.720> grass<00:03:14.170> guitar<00:03:14.920> is<00:03:15.130> ready<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.610> feed

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
cable is grass guitar is ready to feed

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.010 
cable is grass guitar is ready to feed
free<00:03:16.840> fairly<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:17.530> that's<00:03:18.250> pretty<00:03:18.550> much<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.850> so

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
free fairly and that's pretty much it so

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:28.790 
free fairly and that's pretty much it so
come<00:03:20.020> put<00:03:20.200> on<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.350> bar

Boober and this is the bottom piece that

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.360 
Boober and this is the bottom piece that
goes<00:04:49.960> inside<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:50.560> bar<00:04:50.710> so<00:04:50.920> that<00:04:50.950> won't<00:04:51.220> be
