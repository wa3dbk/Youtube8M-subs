hello<00:00:01.290> YouTube<00:00:01.829> Stefan<00:00:02.370> here<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:03.140> well<00:00:04.140> now<00:00:04.560> I

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:04.790 
hello YouTube Stefan here and well now I

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.960 
hello YouTube Stefan here and well now I
fixed<00:00:05.790> all<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.180> problems<00:00:06.330> with<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.970> command

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
fixed all the problems with the command

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.249 
fixed all the problems with the command
block<00:00:09.200> compression<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:11.389> it<00:00:12.389> works<00:00:12.750> now<00:00:12.990> I

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
block compression and it works now I

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.029 
block compression and it works now I
will<00:00:13.910> give<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.179> tool<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.990> probably<00:00:16.500> make<00:00:16.859> an

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
will give a tool I probably make an

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.250 
will give a tool I probably make an
absolute<00:00:17.550> fit<00:00:17.670> at<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.000> time<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:19.050> another

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
absolute fit at this time in another

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.870 
absolute fit at this time in another
video<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.840> but<00:00:21.840> well<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:23.189> used<00:00:23.490> for

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
video for it but well the used for

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.390 
video for it but well the used for
spawning<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.810> large<00:00:25.320> structure<00:00:27.109> has<00:00:28.109> gone<00:00:29.070> down

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
spawning a large structure has gone down

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.830 
spawning a large structure has gone down
a<00:00:29.429> little<00:00:29.760> blue<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:32.090> clone<00:00:33.090> command<00:00:33.600> has

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
a little blue as the clone command has

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.350 
a little blue as the clone command has
been<00:00:33.870> implemented<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.590> 1.8<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.090> just

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
been implemented in 1.8 and if you just

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
been implemented in 1.8 and if you just
want<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> spawn<00:00:37.020> some<00:00:37.380> structure<00:00:37.829> somewhere

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
want to spawn some structure somewhere

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.060 
want to spawn some structure somewhere
you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.520> clone<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.059> from<00:00:39.329> somewhere<00:00:39.660> else

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
you can clone it from somewhere else

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.740 
you can clone it from somewhere else
well<00:00:41.070> if<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.399> if<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.820> want<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.360> use<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
well if you if you want to use the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.389 
well if you if you want to use the
command<00:00:43.050> block<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.559> created<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> first

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
command block to created in the first

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.060 
command block to created in the first
place<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:45.059> still<00:00:45.149> ok<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> found

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
place it's still ok but I found

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.360 
place it's still ok but I found
something<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.719> clone<00:00:49.170> can't<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.010> itself

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
something that clone can't do in itself

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.189 
something that clone can't do in itself
but<00:00:51.239> only<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.410> very<00:00:52.949> many<00:00:53.250> commands

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
but only if you have very many commands

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.250 
but only if you have very many commands
there<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.320> many<00:00:55.440> clone<00:00:55.890> commands<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.390> well<00:00:57.960> I

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
there are many clone commands so well I

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.619 
there are many clone commands so well I
just<00:00:59.010> placed<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.910> command<00:01:00.239> block<00:01:00.420> here

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
just placed on this command block here

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.719 
just placed on this command block here
enter<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> command<00:01:01.850> which<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:04.070> let<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.250> let<00:01:05.580> me

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
enter a command which is let me let me

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.590 
enter a command which is let me let me
look<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:07.680> has<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> length<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.520> about<00:01:08.939> six

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
look it has a length of about six

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.140 
look it has a length of about six
thousand<00:01:09.960> characters<00:01:10.430> yeah<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
thousand characters yeah I get a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.010 
thousand characters yeah I get a
generated<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.189> whatever<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:15.720> this

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
generated it and whatever and in this

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
generated it and whatever and in this
version<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.220> command<00:01:17.580> block<00:01:17.640> compression

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
version of the command block compression

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.420 
version of the command block compression
we<00:01:18.570> need<00:01:18.750> actually<00:01:19.229> an<00:01:19.320> activator<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:19.979> top<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
we need actually an activator on top and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.290 
we need actually an activator on top and
if<00:01:20.970> i<00:01:21.060> press<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.420> button<00:01:21.960> look<00:01:22.560> what<00:01:22.770> happens

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.480 

yep

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
yep

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.330 
yep
it's<00:01:31.060> kate's<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.049> region<00:01:32.409> it<00:01:32.619> makes

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
it's kate's the region it makes

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.130 
it's kate's the region it makes
everything<00:01:33.759> twice<00:01:34.450> as<00:01:34.689> big<00:01:37.500> isn't<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:38.530> cool

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
everything twice as big isn't that cool

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.020 
everything twice as big isn't that cool
I<00:01:41.140> can<00:01:41.830> repeat<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.159> and<00:01:42.430> make<00:01:42.549> it<00:01:42.580> four<00:01:42.850> times

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
I can repeat it and make it four times

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:54.330 
I can repeat it and make it four times
as<00:01:43.270> big<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:45.119> lose<00:01:46.119> some<00:01:46.390> some<00:01:46.689> parts<00:01:47.049> though

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.510 

looks<00:01:54.969> like<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.420> tree<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:58.060> gone<00:01:58.450> oh<00:01:59.039> oh<00:02:00.039> here

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
looks like the tree is gone oh oh here

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.380 
looks like the tree is gone oh oh here
oh<00:02:03.569> not<00:02:04.569> partially<00:02:05.109> come<00:02:05.319> here<00:02:05.890> about<00:02:06.189> and<00:02:06.549> the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
oh not partially come here about and the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.160 
oh not partially come here about and the
Leafs<00:02:07.569> decay<00:02:07.960> but<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:08.769> works<00:02:09.539> I'm<00:02:10.539> writing

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
Leafs decay but it works I'm writing

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:21.820 
Leafs decay but it works I'm writing
press<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.590> button<00:02:11.830> again<00:02:12.510> haha<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:14.290> from

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.850 

ok

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.390 

it<00:02:28.430> works<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:29.200> can<00:02:30.200> quickly<00:02:30.470> explain<00:02:31.010> how<00:02:31.220> it

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
it works I can quickly explain how it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.710 
it works I can quickly explain how it
works<00:02:32.440> kind<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.700> for<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.240> will<00:02:35.420> go

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
works kind of so for that I will go

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.990 
works kind of so for that I will go
quickly<00:02:36.320> into<00:02:36.680> my<00:02:36.830> my<00:02:37.400> test<00:02:37.670> word<00:02:39.640> well<00:02:40.640> here

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
quickly into my my test word well here

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.780 
quickly into my my test word well here
I've<00:02:41.150> testator's<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:42.440> as<00:02:42.650> well<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:44.060> yeah<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.610> I

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
I've testator's it as well so yeah so I

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.510 
I've testator's it as well so yeah so I
am<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.660> basically<00:02:49.600> expand<00:02:50.890> structure<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:51.920> i<00:02:52.100> we

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
am I basically expand structure I i we

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.910 
am I basically expand structure I i we
sighs<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.940> structure<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.690> make<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.650> twice<00:02:54.860> as

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
sighs the structure I make it twice as

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.300 
sighs the structure I make it twice as
big<00:02:55.370> in<00:02:55.640> three<00:02:56.030> steps<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.630> first<00:02:57.350> make<00:02:57.800> it<00:02:57.980> twice

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
big in three steps I first make it twice

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.880 
big in three steps I first make it twice
as<00:02:58.370> big<00:02:58.940> in<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.750> y-direction<00:02:59.959> actually

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
as big in the the y-direction actually

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.430 
as big in the the y-direction actually
and<00:03:01.130> then<00:03:01.610> in<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.000> X<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.720> then<00:03:02.840> in<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.170> Z

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
and then in the X and then in the Z

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.160 
and then in the X and then in the Z
direction<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.760> end<00:03:04.880> it's<00:03:05.150> twice<00:03:06.140> as

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
direction so in the end it's twice as

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.229 
direction so in the end it's twice as
big<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.620> every<00:03:06.890> direction<00:03:07.040> well<00:03:07.640> it's

start by using the getting the last

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.180 
start by using the getting the last

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
and I clone the Weejun where I basically

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.880 
and I clone the Weejun where I basically

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
the Zika position so you could imagine I

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.640 
the Zika position so you could imagine I
would<00:03:58.580> if<00:03:58.940> this<00:03:59.239> was<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.510> structure<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.290> not

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
would if this was a structure and not

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.520 
would if this was a structure and not
just<00:04:00.830> a<00:04:00.980> line<00:04:01.130> of<00:04:01.310> blocks<00:04:01.549> I<00:04:01.760> would<00:04:02.380> flow<00:04:03.380> in

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
just a line of blocks I would flow in

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:12.150 
just a line of blocks I would flow in
this<00:04:03.799> entire<00:04:04.130> plane<00:04:08.590> 22<00:04:09.590> here<00:04:10.330> so<00:04:11.330> yeah<00:04:11.780> and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
this entire plane 22 here so yeah and

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.640 
this entire plane 22 here so yeah and
then<00:04:13.160> I<00:04:13.280> thought<00:04:13.480> well<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.720> could<00:04:15.290> make<00:04:15.620> a

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
then I thought well I could make a

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.360 
then I thought well I could make a
little<00:04:16.130> improvement<00:04:16.609> from<00:04:17.479> there<00:04:17.780> on<00:04:17.959> and

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
little improvement from there on and

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.000 
little improvement from there on and
like<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:19.790> have<00:04:20.660> only<00:04:20.930> half<00:04:21.260> as<00:04:21.410> many<00:04:21.560> clone

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
like I have only half as many clone

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.180 
like I have only half as many clone
commands<00:04:22.610> as<00:04:22.760> if<00:04:23.000> I<00:04:23.180> would<00:04:23.750> just<00:04:24.560> flown<00:04:24.800> planes

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
commands as if I would just flown planes

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.260 
commands as if I would just flown planes
and<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.850> i<00:04:26.200> am<00:04:27.200> moving<00:04:27.410> by<00:04:27.800> cloning<00:04:28.190> these<00:04:28.910> two

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
and I i am moving by cloning these two

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.680 
and I i am moving by cloning these two
adjacent<00:04:29.590> blocks<00:04:30.590> or<00:04:30.979> planes<00:04:31.479> to<00:04:32.479> this

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
adjacent blocks or planes to this

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.250 
adjacent blocks or planes to this
position<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:34.250> wet<00:04:34.430> position<00:04:35.000> on<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:36.050> wet

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
position so the wet position on the wet

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.250 
position so the wet position on the wet
will<00:04:36.770> here<00:04:37.099> max<00:04:37.640> out<00:04:37.849> from<00:04:38.270> where<00:04:38.539> to<00:04:38.660> where<00:04:38.900> it

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
will here max out from where to where it

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.200 
will here max out from where to where it
gets<00:04:39.950> teleported<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.820> so

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
gets teleported and so

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.749 
gets teleported and so
well<00:04:41.840> you<00:04:41.960> see<00:04:42.199> first<00:04:42.680> this<00:04:42.830> block<00:04:43.160> over<00:04:43.520> there

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
well you see first this block over there

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.749 
well you see first this block over there
so<00:04:44.449> and<00:04:44.810> then<00:04:44.990> these<00:04:45.500> two<00:04:45.560> blocks<00:04:46.039> over<00:04:46.280> here

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
so and then these two blocks over here

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.450 
so and then these two blocks over here
and<00:04:47.020> then<00:04:48.020> those<00:04:48.740> two<00:04:48.770> blocks<00:04:49.419> go<00:04:50.419> here<00:04:50.960> and

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
and then those two blocks go here and

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.700 
and then those two blocks go here and
then<00:04:52.460> those<00:04:52.759> two<00:04:52.789> those<00:04:53.539> two<00:04:53.599> blocks<00:04:54.080> go<00:04:54.349> go

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
then those two those two blocks go go

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.540 
then those two those two blocks go go
here<00:04:55.130> and<00:04:55.389> then<00:04:56.389> in<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.020> last<00:04:57.169> two<00:04:57.860> steps<00:04:58.190> this

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
here and then in the last two steps this

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.180 
here and then in the last two steps this
block<00:04:58.849> goes<00:04:59.030> goes<00:04:59.569> here<00:04:59.870> so<00:05:00.139> that<00:05:00.560> that<00:05:00.889> and

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
block goes goes here so that that and

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.300 
block goes goes here so that that and
well<00:05:02.120> this<00:05:02.300> year<00:05:02.569> so<00:05:02.810> am<00:05:03.020> kind<00:05:04.009> of<00:05:04.069> get<00:05:04.280> the

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
well this year so am kind of get the

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.820 
well this year so am kind of get the
idea<00:05:04.430> I<00:05:04.970> am<00:05:06.849> just<00:05:07.849> generalized<00:05:08.569> I've<00:05:08.840> like

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
idea I am just generalized I've like

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.550 
idea I am just generalized I've like
implemented<00:05:10.819> the<00:05:11.150> system<00:05:11.630> into<00:05:12.289> I<00:05:14.080> am<00:05:15.080> bored

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
implemented the system into I am bored

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.080 
implemented the system into I am bored
in<00:05:15.889> a<00:05:15.919> little<00:05:16.250> script<00:05:16.539> that<00:05:17.539> generated<00:05:18.199> me

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
in a little script that generated me

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.140 
in a little script that generated me
some<00:05:20.139> different<00:05:21.139> versions<00:05:21.590> of<00:05:21.740> these

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
some different versions of these

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.850 
some different versions of these
resizing<00:05:23.150> things<00:05:23.479> and<00:05:23.780> then<00:05:24.849> skated<00:05:25.849> up<00:05:26.120> and<00:05:26.860> I

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
resizing things and then skated up and I

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.089 
resizing things and then skated up and I
hit<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.789> limit<00:05:28.940> of<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:30.139> clone<00:05:30.380> command<00:05:30.800> so

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
hit the limit of the clone command so

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.080 
hit the limit of the clone command so
this<00:05:31.340> is<00:05:31.550> wide<00:05:32.120> under<00:05:32.690> the<00:05:32.840> limit<00:05:32.960> of<00:05:34.090> 4096

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
this is wide under the limit of 4096

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.059 
this is wide under the limit of 4096
blocks<00:05:35.860> which<00:05:36.860> can<00:05:37.220> get<00:05:37.460> cloned<00:05:37.940> at<00:05:38.120> once<00:05:39.039> so<00:05:40.039> I

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
blocks which can get cloned at once so I

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.070 
blocks which can get cloned at once so I
would<00:05:40.400> chain<00:05:40.669> I<00:05:40.880> would<00:05:41.240> have<00:05:41.389> to<00:05:41.569> change<00:05:41.599> up

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
would chain I would have to change up

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.620 
would chain I would have to change up
how<00:05:42.289> it<00:05:42.440> works<00:05:42.680> if<00:05:42.979> I<00:05:43.130> would<00:05:43.970> grow<00:05:44.150> larger<00:05:44.599> and

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
how it works if I would grow larger and

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.159 
how it works if I would grow larger and
I<00:05:44.930> can<00:05:45.139> just<00:05:45.409> build<00:05:45.740> any<00:05:46.009> structure<00:05:46.669> and<00:05:46.880> the

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
I can just build any structure and the

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.850 
I can just build any structure and the
test<00:05:48.169> word<00:05:48.380> for<00:05:48.710> example<00:05:50.259> with<00:05:51.259> the<00:05:51.380> size<00:05:51.650> of

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
test word for example with the size of

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.100 
test word for example with the size of
22<00:05:52.580> x<00:05:52.880> 22<00:05:53.360> x<00:05:53.539> 22<00:05:54.169> blocks<00:05:54.800> with<00:05:55.370> this<00:05:55.580> command

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
22 x 22 x 22 blocks with this command

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.200 
22 x 22 x 22 blocks with this command
and<00:05:58.120> well<00:05:59.120> after<00:05:59.479> I've<00:06:00.440> done<00:06:00.830> that<00:06:01.099> I<00:06:01.370> need<00:06:02.090> to

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
and well after I've done that I need to

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.920 
and well after I've done that I need to
place<00:06:03.580> plays<00:06:04.580> a<00:06:04.610> command<00:06:05.180> block<00:06:05.800> such<00:06:06.800> that<00:06:07.520> it

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
place plays a command block such that it

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.640 
place plays a command block such that it
the<00:06:08.930> structure<00:06:09.680> faces<00:06:10.300> positive<00:06:11.300> x<00:06:11.539> and<00:06:11.870> so

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
the structure faces positive x and so

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.839 
the structure faces positive x and so
east<00:06:12.949> and<00:06:13.250> positive<00:06:13.729> Z<00:06:13.969> so<00:06:14.270> south<00:06:15.460> to<00:06:16.460> the<00:06:16.610> soul

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
east and positive Z so south to the soul

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:19.029 
east and positive Z so south to the soul
and<00:06:17.030> the<00:06:17.120> structure<00:06:17.900> is<00:06:18.020> and<00:06:18.259> the<00:06:18.380> southeast

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
and the structure is and the southeast

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:20.980 
and the structure is and the southeast
of<00:06:19.280> the<00:06:19.340> command<00:06:19.789> block<00:06:19.909> and<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:20.659> command

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
of the command block and the command

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.839 
of the command block and the command
block<00:06:21.080> is<00:06:21.349> at<00:06:21.530> the<00:06:21.860> bottom<00:06:22.219> layer<00:06:22.610> of

block is at the bottom layer of
destruction<00:06:23.419> I<00:06:24.159> enter<00:06:25.159> the<00:06:25.340> command<00:06:25.580> and<00:06:26.000> I

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
destruction I enter the command and I

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.860 
destruction I enter the command and I
will<00:06:26.630> put<00:06:27.020> this<00:06:27.050> command<00:06:28.599> not<00:06:29.599> in<00:06:29.719> the

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
will put this command not in the

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.260 
will put this command not in the
description<00:06:30.500> but<00:06:30.620> I<00:06:30.680> put<00:06:30.919> a<00:06:30.949> link<00:06:31.159> to<00:06:31.520> to<00:06:32.240> a

structure and well if you resize the

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.339 
structure and well if you resize the
wayside<00:06:46.490> structure<00:06:47.000> again<00:06:47.240> it<00:06:47.509> will<00:06:47.659> get

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:48.349 
wayside structure again it will get

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:50.999 
wayside structure again it will get
bigger<00:06:48.919> so

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:51.009 
bigger so

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.809
