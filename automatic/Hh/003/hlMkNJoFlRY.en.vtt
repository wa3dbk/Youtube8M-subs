00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.780 
that down okay so that's how you measure
your<00:02:22.170> sweater<00:02:22.470> now<00:02:22.920> how<00:02:23.130> does<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.489> translate

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
your sweater now how does that translate

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.050 
your sweater now how does that translate
to<00:02:24.620> what<00:02:25.620> you're<00:02:25.800> reading<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> pattern

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
to what you're reading in the pattern

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.800 
to what you're reading in the pattern
well<00:02:27.900> patterns<00:02:28.470> vary<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.130> what<00:02:29.340> they<00:02:29.489> tell<00:02:29.730> you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.490 

some<00:02:33.810> patterns<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.670> one<00:02:36.230> will<00:02:37.230> tell

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
some patterns like this one will tell

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.100 
some patterns like this one will tell
you<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.700> fit<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.299> particular<00:02:39.660> bus

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
you that it's to fit a particular bus

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.089 
you that it's to fit a particular bus
size<00:02:41.810> which<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.319> don't<00:02:43.590> want<00:02:43.709> that

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
size which you don't want that

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.309 
size which you don't want that
information<00:02:44.880> for<00:02:45.299> using<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.810> technique

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
information for using this technique

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.789 
information for using this technique
what<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.769> want<00:02:47.069> is<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.840> information<00:02:49.349> on<00:02:49.680> this

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
what you want is the information on this

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.569 
what you want is the information on this
schematic<00:02:50.630> it's<00:02:51.630> over<00:02:51.870> here<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.860> tells<00:02:53.190> you

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
schematic it's over here this tells you

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.080 
schematic it's over here this tells you
that<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:54.569> fit<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.019> bus<00:02:55.260> size<00:02:55.530> 32<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.730> want<00:02:56.970> to

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
that to fit that bus size 32 you want to

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.199 
that to fit that bus size 32 you want to
measurement<00:02:57.599> across<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.890> front<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.459> 19

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
measurement across the front of 19

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.289 
measurement across the front of 19
inches<00:03:03.590> okay<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:05.010> schematic<00:03:05.730> numbers<00:03:06.120> are

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
inches okay so the schematic numbers are

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.970 
inches okay so the schematic numbers are
the<00:03:06.420> numbers<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.900> want<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.319> work<00:03:07.530> from<00:03:07.799> when

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the numbers you want to work from when

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.180 
the numbers you want to work from when
deciding<00:03:08.310> which<00:03:09.140> size<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.799> want<00:03:11.040> to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
deciding which size that you want to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.080 
deciding which size that you want to
make<00:03:12.019> so<00:03:13.019> for<00:03:13.590> instance<00:03:14.010> like<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.640> Diane's

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
make so for instance like in Diane's

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.140 
make so for instance like in Diane's
patterns<00:03:16.040> she<00:03:17.040> always<00:03:17.310> gives<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
patterns she always gives you the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.840 
patterns she always gives you the
finished<00:03:18.600> bust<00:03:18.930> measurement<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.430> we<00:03:20.639> know<00:03:20.819> I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
finished bust measurement so we know I

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.259 
finished bust measurement so we know I
want<00:03:21.389> a<00:03:21.480> bust<00:03:21.690> measurement<00:03:22.319> of<00:03:22.470> 37<00:03:23.280> but<00:03:24.030> since

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
want a bust measurement of 37 but since

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.590 
want a bust measurement of 37 but since
I'm<00:03:24.450> between<00:03:24.750> her<00:03:25.079> two<00:03:25.319> sizes<00:03:26.150> I'm<00:03:27.150> going<00:03:27.510> to

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
I'm between her two sizes I'm going to

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.569 
I'm between her two sizes I'm going to
aim<00:03:27.780> it's<00:03:28.170> kind<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.560> knitters<00:03:28.889> choice<00:03:29.160> but<00:03:29.459> I'm

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
aim it's kind of knitters choice but I'm

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.000 
aim it's kind of knitters choice but I'm
going<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:29.880> aim<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.359> start<00:03:30.930> for<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.350> smaller

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
going to aim to start for this smaller

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.370 
going to aim to start for this smaller
one<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.519> then<00:03:32.579> adjust<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.239> size<00:03:33.450> as<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:34.019> meant

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
one and then adjust the size as I meant

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.500 
one and then adjust the size as I meant
and<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:35.220> another<00:03:35.489> video<00:03:35.850> we'll<00:03:36.120> show<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:36.329> how

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
and in another video we'll show you how

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.580 
and in another video we'll show you how
to<00:03:36.720> adjust<00:03:37.440> those<00:03:37.620> sizes<00:03:38.600> so<00:03:39.600> that's<00:03:40.230> how<00:03:40.500> you

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
to adjust those sizes so that's how you

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.220 
to adjust those sizes so that's how you
decide<00:03:41.010> what<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.819> want<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.090> make<00:03:42.299> is<00:03:42.720> anything

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
decide what you want to make is anything

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
decide what you want to make is anything
else<00:03:43.410> I've<00:03:43.620> forgotten<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.160> an<00:03:44.630> know<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:46.560> sounds

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
else I've forgotten I an know it sounds

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.550 
else I've forgotten I an know it sounds
perfect<00:03:47.730> once<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.660> have<00:03:48.840> those<00:03:49.049> magic

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
perfect once you have those magic

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.470 
perfect once you have those magic
numbers<00:03:49.590> then<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.609> can<00:03:50.790> use<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.120> on<00:03:51.209> any

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
numbers then you can use it on any

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.199 
numbers then you can use it on any
pattern<00:03:51.989> absolutely<00:03:52.889> so<00:03:53.519> that's<00:03:53.880> great

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
pattern absolutely so that's great

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.479 
pattern absolutely so that's great
and<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:55.130> this<00:03:56.130> I'm<00:03:56.430> Terry<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:57.620> I'm<00:03:58.620> Dianne<00:03:59.069> and

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
and so this I'm Terry and I'm Dianne and

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:09.420 
and so this I'm Terry and I'm Dianne and
thanks<00:03:59.880> for<00:04:00.060> watching<00:04:00.420> have<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.569> great<00:04:00.750> day

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.479 

Thunder<00:04:10.239> rumbles<00:04:10.750> on<00:04:10.989> this<00:04:11.200> American<00:04:11.709> summer

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
Thunder rumbles on this American summer
