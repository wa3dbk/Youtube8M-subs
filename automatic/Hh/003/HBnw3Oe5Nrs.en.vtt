00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
another rare so yeah I got water energy

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.520 
another rare so yeah I got water energy
I<00:02:21.390> get<00:02:21.810> ball<00:02:21.989> in<00:02:22.019> my<00:02:22.349> rares<00:02:22.560> Oh<00:02:22.830> another<00:02:23.700> binary

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
I get ball in my rares Oh another binary

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.160 
I get ball in my rares Oh another binary
leather<00:02:25.530> next<00:02:26.400> PLP<00:02:28.250> finish<00:02:29.630> six<00:02:30.630> minutes<00:02:30.989> so

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
yeah I want to cross energy and gibble

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.170 
yeah I want to cross energy and gibble
not<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.330> good<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.959> binary<00:02:37.560> again<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:39.000> is

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
not so good and binary again this is

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.780 
not so good and binary again this is
getting<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> little<00:02:39.600> annoying<00:02:39.959> all<00:02:40.560> right

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.130 
saying as far as I'm gonna rush a
fighting<00:03:05.910> energy<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.480> pickle

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
fighting energy and a pickle

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.280 
fighting energy and a pickle
there's<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:08.099> whatever<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.930> tip<00:03:09.930> jar

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
there's I whatever the tip jar

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.509 
there's I whatever the tip jar
so<00:03:10.620> yeah<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:10.920> have<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.070> chance<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.400> getting

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
the trick so yeah

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.080 
the trick so yeah
second<00:03:24.840> energy<00:03:25.170> on<00:03:25.230> Terok<00:03:25.530> there's<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.549> weeds

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
second energy on Terok there's a weeds

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.000 
second energy on Terok there's a weeds
I'll<00:03:27.299> have<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.959> lot<00:03:28.049> in<00:03:28.140> common
