a<00:01:37.259> port<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.619> month<00:01:38.420> um<00:01:40.310> personally<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.340> think

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
a port of month um personally I think

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.810 
a port of month um personally I think
these<00:01:41.670> ones<00:01:41.820> are<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.270> better<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> yeah

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
these ones are really better so yeah

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.039 
these ones are really better so yeah
