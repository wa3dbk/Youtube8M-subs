that we weren't too impressed with was

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.570 
that we weren't too impressed with was
the<00:03:11.820> suspension<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:12.960> is<00:03:13.260> an<00:03:13.440> SUV<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.980> true<00:03:14.190> SUV

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
that technology wasn't quite there

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.410 
that technology wasn't quite there
compared<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.460> some<00:03:23.610> of<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.760> competition

then<00:04:33.630> as<00:04:33.960> you're<00:04:34.200> benchmarking<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.890> against

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
then as you're benchmarking it against

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.700 
then as you're benchmarking it against
the<00:04:35.520> competition<00:04:35.730> you'll<00:04:36.660> notice<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.110> Kia

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
the competition you'll notice that Kia

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.950 
the competition you'll notice that Kia
because<00:04:38.070> it<00:04:38.190> is<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.460> no.9<00:04:38.850> model<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.600> obviously

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
because it is a no.9 model and obviously

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.270 
because it is a no.9 model and obviously
a<00:04:40.020> lot<00:04:40.140> newer<00:04:40.320> than<00:04:40.440> some<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.950> ones<00:04:40.980> that's

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
a lot newer than some of the ones that's

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.160 
a lot newer than some of the ones that's
been<00:04:41.340> out<00:04:41.550> for<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:41.820> while<00:04:42.000> it's<00:04:42.840> gonna<00:04:42.930> have

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
been out for a while it's gonna have

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.600 
been out for a while it's gonna have
some<00:04:43.320> more<00:04:43.500> advanced<00:04:43.710> safety<00:04:43.980> features<00:04:44.160> so

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
some more advanced safety features so

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.820 
some more advanced safety features so
that's<00:04:44.850> important<00:04:45.300> then<00:04:45.810> certainly<00:04:46.230> give<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
that's important then certainly give the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.950 
that's important then certainly give the
Perego<00:04:47.100> some<00:04:47.340> consideration<00:04:48.120> Kia<00:04:48.510> really

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
Perego some consideration Kia really

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.960 
Perego some consideration Kia really
seems<00:04:49.260> to<00:04:49.470> have<00:04:49.680> learned<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.190> lessons<00:04:50.700> of

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
seems to have learned the lessons of

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.930 
seems to have learned the lessons of
others<00:04:51.600> like<00:04:51.750> Subaru<00:04:52.260> for<00:04:52.470> example<00:04:52.950> by<00:04:53.580> making

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
others like Subaru for example by making

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.330 
others like Subaru for example by making
the<00:04:54.030> front<00:04:54.300> end<00:04:54.510> just<00:04:54.690> simple<00:04:55.590> get<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.040> logo

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
the front end just simple get the logo

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.540 
the front end just simple get the logo
right<00:04:56.490> in<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.670> middle<00:04:56.820> fairly<00:04:57.600> prominent<00:04:58.050> and

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
right in the middle fairly prominent and

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.160 
right in the middle fairly prominent and
I<00:04:59.550> think<00:05:00.150> that's<00:05:00.270> important<00:05:00.690> for<00:05:00.720> Kia<00:05:00.990> they're

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
I think that's important for Kia they're

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.270 
I think that's important for Kia they're
trying<00:05:01.350> to<00:05:01.380> get<00:05:01.470> a<00:05:01.560> little<00:05:01.650> more<00:05:01.800> recognition

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
trying to get a little more recognition

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.580 
trying to get a little more recognition
out<00:05:02.610> there<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.120> there's<00:05:03.750> certainly<00:05:04.080> no<00:05:04.260> no

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
out there and there's certainly no no

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.560 
out there and there's certainly no no
reason<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.920> be<00:05:05.010> ashamed<00:05:05.100> of<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:06.030> drive<00:05:06.240> of<00:05:06.390> Kia

reason to be ashamed of the drive of Kia
it<00:05:06.780> says<00:05:06.990> I<00:05:07.200> think<00:05:07.380> it<00:05:07.530> says<00:05:07.860> it's<00:05:08.280> more<00:05:08.520> of<00:05:08.610> a

it says I think it says it's more of a

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.790 
it says I think it says it's more of a

lot and it is it's the most in the
segment<00:05:27.030> really<00:05:27.570> like<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:28.080> hood<00:05:28.920> on<00:05:29.070> this

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220

Borrego<00:05:59.370> does<00:05:59.880> extremely<00:06:00.480> well<00:06:00.660> is<00:06:00.870> have<00:06:01.020> a

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
very tight turning radius in general our

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.320 
very tight turning radius in general our
perception<00:06:04.860> is<00:06:04.980> we<00:06:05.550> like<00:06:05.730> this<00:06:05.910> vehicle

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330

aesthetically<00:06:07.050> I<00:06:07.290> think<00:06:07.800> this<00:06:07.890> car

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
aesthetically I think this car

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.430 
aesthetically I think this car
definitely<00:06:09.060> gets<00:06:09.450> a<00:06:09.570> gets<00:06:09.840> an<00:06:09.960> 8<00:06:10.140> out<00:06:10.320> of<00:06:10.350> 10

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
definitely gets a gets an 8 out of 10

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.220 
definitely gets a gets an 8 out of 10
from<00:06:10.919> us<00:06:11.130> it's<00:06:11.880> just<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.480> overall<00:06:12.900> package

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
from us it's just the overall package

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.430 
from us it's just the overall package
and<00:06:13.710> what<00:06:14.310> you<00:06:14.430> get<00:06:14.669> 36<00:06:15.600> thousand<00:06:16.169> dollars

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
and what you get 36 thousand dollars

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.040 
and what you get 36 thousand dollars
just<00:06:16.740> seems<00:06:17.400> like<00:06:18.030> a<00:06:18.090> lot<00:06:18.270> of<00:06:18.300> money<00:06:18.510> for<00:06:18.750> us<00:06:18.870> I

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
just seems like a lot of money for us I

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.200 
just seems like a lot of money for us I
would<00:06:19.169> be<00:06:19.620> patient<00:06:19.860> wait<00:06:20.700> to<00:06:20.880> see<00:06:21.060> what

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
would be patient wait to see what

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.670 
would be patient wait to see what
happens<00:06:21.390> as<00:06:21.840> it<00:06:22.230> does<00:06:22.380> with<00:06:22.530> many

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
happens as it does with many

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.800 
happens as it does with many
manufacturers<00:06:23.370> in<00:06:23.520> this<00:06:23.820> market<00:06:24.330> they're

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
manufacturers in this market they're

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.050 
manufacturers in this market they're
gonna<00:06:24.930> have<00:06:25.110> to<00:06:25.169> adjust<00:06:25.410> the<00:06:25.800> price<00:06:26.340> put<00:06:26.910> some

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
gonna have to adjust the price put some

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.760 
gonna have to adjust the price put some
incentives<00:06:27.540> on<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:27.660> vehicle<00:06:28.169> and<00:06:28.380> I<00:06:28.470> think<00:06:28.710> if

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
incentives on the vehicle and I think if

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.350 
incentives on the vehicle and I think if
you<00:06:28.890> can<00:06:29.040> get<00:06:29.490> into<00:06:29.669> one<00:06:29.760> of<00:06:29.910> these<00:06:30.090> from

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
you can get into one of these from

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.120 
you can get into one of these from
around<00:06:30.480> thirty<00:06:30.810> one<00:06:31.050> thirty<00:06:31.290> two<00:06:31.440> thousand

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
around thirty one thirty two thousand

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.520 
around thirty one thirty two thousand
you<00:06:32.550> know<00:06:32.580> equips<00:06:33.090> somewhat<00:06:33.870> like<00:06:34.050> this<00:06:34.289> I

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
you know equips somewhat like this I

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.279 
you know equips somewhat like this I
think<00:06:34.800> that<00:06:35.460> is<00:06:35.729> a<00:06:35.789> sec

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
think that is a sec

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.649 
think that is a sec
