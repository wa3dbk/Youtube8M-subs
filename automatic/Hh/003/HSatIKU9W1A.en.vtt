 Megadeth - The Right To Go Insane Megadeth - Right to go crazy 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.000
 I just arrived at the night shift on time 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.000
 after an exhausting day of nine to five 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.900
 live credit card to control spending money 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.000
 and barely, just barely, I only manage to survive 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.400
 I'm living on the edge, reality wobbles 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 my mind is at the limit 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.500
 How am I going to face tomorrow, if I can not do it today? 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.800
 I have nothing to lose, but if my sanity and the right to go crazy 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.200
 my stomach hurts for lack of money 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 my cheeks are thin and my guts writhe 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 my head rumbles 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.700
 the hunger has caused tremors 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.200
 too much misery, too much pressure, now I'm getting angry 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.300
 I'm living on the edge, my mind is at the limit 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:03.700
 How am I going to face tomorrow, if I can not do it today? 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.700
 I have nothing to lose, but if my sanity and the right to go crazy 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.500
 I have nothing to lose, only my head 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.700
 I have nothing to choose 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.800
 so I'm going crazy 

00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:43.800
 How am I going to face tomorrow, if I can not do it today? 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:54.100
 I have nothing to lose, but if my sanity and the right to go crazy 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.000
 and the right to go crazy 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:48.000
