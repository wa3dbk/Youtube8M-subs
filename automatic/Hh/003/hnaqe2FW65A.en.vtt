 1 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.230

 skates like that here it'll be hot come 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.850
 long live the most serious heads and all 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.850
 and then turn 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.980
 the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.579
 every time it's the same it will change 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.199
 never remember anything else 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.129
 we can not play with you 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.330
 you realize we can not play with 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.740
 someone who has more memory you say 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.240
 not all alone anyway be careful 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.470
 people around you every time 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.760
 start again that can not do 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.750
 anything anytime you say 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.670
 not all alone anyway there are some 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.570
 conventions to otherwise respect that does not 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.040
 can not walk we're not going 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.270
 complicated what you have to do is not 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.130
 complicated it's written what do you have to 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.360
 do is write this is 200 times that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.100
 play the show and you continue to 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.180
 forget everything and immediately and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.380
 it's at least remember what you 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.940
 just done finally it's not complicated 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 you keep doing the more it's the same 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.909
 every night and even if you forget 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.009
 everything there is one thing to remember a single 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.240
 is that the show started and 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.679
 all show begins is in the process of 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.369
 to finish here we are already 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.750
 to define 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.759
 and what do we do we lose time 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.810
 because you're a big sick man 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.280
 more memory you have more memory 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.690
 no it's not a reason it's too much 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.890
 easy gentlemen only remembers only 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.390
 what happens when it happens 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.130
 in standby so that the present in the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.869
 life in all cases around there is the future and 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.700
 the past and the future can not be 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.860
 to pass and without past has no future 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.659
 it's been 200 times that I'm telling you 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.100
