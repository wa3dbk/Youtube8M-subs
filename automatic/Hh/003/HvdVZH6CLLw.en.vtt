00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
shore instead of fighting them in the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.370 
shore instead of fighting them in the
water<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.310> lot<00:01:17.670> easier<00:01:17.960> believe<00:01:18.960> me<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.350> lot

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.400 
water it's a lot easier believe me a lot
easier<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.760> these<00:01:21.060> guys<00:01:21.270> spawn<00:01:21.780> like

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
easier because these guys spawn like
