 if rabbi sfar 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.340
 I do not have a name and on the port of Algiers in the casbah 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.030
 as a reminder it will change disaster 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.030
 it's his problem a Libyan tapestry 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.250
 the group now plans to produce this day at 5500 years and 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.400
 dust is ridiculous with carbon 14 can be found on 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.870
 typically what is said exists for billions of years later 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.350
 the salary is high plus the wicked place yes because I wanted it is 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.350
 that I am weak only with friends 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.730
 the rabbi's cat is an adaptation of the comic book by joann sfar who 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.140
 sold more than 900 thousand copies 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.090
 the story 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.990
 a cat of men and religions I am without a company of the coup director 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.400
 of the movie welcomed young woman joann sfar hello to all to be hours in 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.410
 live with us it's a big lille tv 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.410
 how did you go it has holcim ideas how was it decided 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.729
 % dropping anxiety because I do not know why this comic walk so 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.579
 I was afraid to crash with the movie 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.119
 and after fighting meet the comedians it happened 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.929
 tremendously good because it reminded me that the compound of the pieces of 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:44.920
 Molière 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.720
 and I realized that the cat is a bit of a scapin 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.730
 in a religious family he is love blow but I want to make fun of them 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.630
 and yes we felt very quickly in known grounds have to break in doing 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.940
 a play 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.350
 reacted hot on the see in 3d 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.970
 the cinema so here I am wrong the 3d has been realized in an in-between 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.740
 China since it's really a pretty exceptional 3d with a lot of 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.190
 contracts and contrasts how did it happen because in fact we tried to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.169
 embossed human 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.959
 to remember the game lisima cut out a bit that had against was 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.370
 kid with the glasses the comcom find 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.910
 and so it's not a 3d realistic stopped in relief that for me adds 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.029
 still the strangeness safa image level is a little against 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:25.299
 oriental tale 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.699
 then the story to agadir before of course he aspires before the acacia 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.699
 and there is also this famous car and citroën 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.359
 what is the story of 7 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.869
 of this car 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:41.719
 the touch neither citroën is the symbol of triumphant colonialism in 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.929
 the 20s and 30s 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.839
 and I wanted to use it to call for difficulties 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.789
 who was at that time and who incurs today when people from 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:53.809
 culture different from that of supporting each other and carrying each other 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:56.149
 humanism in the woods which considers that all men are 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:03:00.059
 also stupid so as such he finds them very sewers and he will cross 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:04.729
 the colonial route but it is visited different types of spirituality of 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:05.669
 report to 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.719
 to the other and him the tendency to find all imposed said culture 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.829
 precisely a small reference to his expectations in combo 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.089
 we meet there a moment canteen 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:18.079
 in a film in common or in Africa why this reference for 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.849
 encounters Belgian reporter who may look like tintin we do not open a 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:21.340
 trial 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.779
 equality is that 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:25.839
 even if I go to Congo in the 30s and I do not treat tintin 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.869
 in Congo I think his professional offer 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.919
 the bed and Ivorian friends who told me that the authorities hear congo 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.129
 because it reminded me how white people could not be in 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.939
 30s 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.790
 and as everyone takes for his rank in this cartoon ball is 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.839
 bleached 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.879
 and she would beat movie also speaks a lot of religions but a 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.490
 justin just way 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.959
 for me we do not make fun of it 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.019
 there is no doubt about the distensions how exactly did you treat 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.729
 this religion in life not so much if I do not care I'm not so much 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.640
 tolerant that five parks have fled I am the mans ie 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.550
 I'm trying to get a criticism of religion to be built but that comes 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.350
 from the inside as a kid who gets catechism classes that have 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.100
 explained them in the fighting feet have more work than men 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.109
 prehistoric 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.189
 and I believe that 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.169
 these actions by the company Saturday do not hate one can all be said 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.560
 we can even criticize ourselves 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.410
 which would be annoying this sum just started ideas to figure on 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.900
 I do not know either I try to 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.220
 the death of parachuter I try to make fun but both not sure that it 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.660
 is going to be useless it's not because I do not have the courage it's all right 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.960
 useless 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.760
 there is also a lot of music in your 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.910
 in your craft hand but percent and if you chose actors like 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.540
 mauritius benichou mathieu amalric began his choice worthy of casting 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.059
 by love 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:40.789
 by a word because we had a month or two of filming with the om held in iran 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.369
 talent so their candles and françois morel maurice Bénichou and many others 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.279
 then it was a shoot as for the film becomes rescue and me it's them 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:51.449
 who made me forget the comic book it's thanks to them that we were able to 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.520
 to have fun without spending our time thinking that this is the challenge of the 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.590
 what this recall had been after a while the comedians were there 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.570
 and he was wearing the subject and were 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.839
 audet who had stolen we were happy we hope very communicative 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.049
 it's very communicative hours at the end of the race but after six games they 

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:07.210
 emptied and I loved 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.310
 and for many other questions finally your book has been studied 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.669
 in colleges in high schools because we can French customers 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.540
 and in civic education in history in philosophy you believe that Switzerland with the 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:17.759
 same thing 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.319
 it is for me I intervene a lot in school to complicate life 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:22.219
 children 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.809
 to remind them as the Maghreb has been a land a thousand times conquered so 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:28.729
 where it would be futile to seek roots more Rococo seeks before anything else 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.800
 Upside down 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.840
 I would like to remake liked a little more the people of the Maghreb 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.669
 realizes that they are capable of self-criticism are able to laugh 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.870
 and that we must stop taking Jews and Muslims with 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.880
 tweezers we will not be treated as racist or anti-Semitic if we make 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.060
 hay jokes no but we can we can I believe that the 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.919
 the greatest of respects showed that she was laughing with more than 60 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:49.879
 important points 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.999
 here it is the last moments intimate absolutely go see the first 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:56.139
 choice to my first jo sorry in all the dark rooms
