00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
right here is a stock mini mano with a

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.820 
right here is a stock mini mano with a
plastic<00:00:08.610> prop<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.330> came<00:00:09.540> with<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.800> but<00:00:10.800> I

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
plastic prop that came with it but I

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:19.279 
plastic prop that came with it but I
shop<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.340> edges<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> little<00:00:17.960> so<00:00:18.960> let's<00:00:19.140> see

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
shop in the edges a little so let's see

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.630 
shop in the edges a little so let's see
what<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.439> does<00:00:19.710> if<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> grips<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> little

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
what it does if the grips a little

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
what it does if the grips a little
better<00:00:26.570> about<00:00:28.189> 40<00:00:29.189> degrees<00:00:29.279> out<00:00:29.699> what<00:00:30.510> is

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
better about 40 degrees out what is

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
better about 40 degrees out what is
probably<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> 30s<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:36.320> think<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.410> grips<00:00:37.590> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
probably in the 30s I think it grips a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:48.700 
probably in the 30s I think it grips a
lot<00:00:37.860> better

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:01:04.880 

haha<00:00:50.660> that<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:51.989> crazy

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.100 

this<00:01:05.400> means<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.729> little<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:06.330> trim<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.840> think

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
this means a little up trim I think

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:41.630 
this means a little up trim I think
it<00:01:09.650> is<00:01:09.770> kind<00:01:09.980> of<00:01:10.040> ways

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.880 

crazy<00:01:45.929> that's<00:01:46.929> what<00:01:47.140> if<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.289> have<00:01:47.530> that's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
crazy that's what if you have that's

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.560 
crazy that's what if you have that's
what<00:01:48.039> it<00:01:48.159> takes<00:01:48.340> off<00:01:48.640> like<00:01:48.850> if<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.210> show<00:01:49.420> up<00:01:49.479> in

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
what it takes off like if you show up in

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.200 
what it takes off like if you show up in
a<00:01:49.659> proper<00:01:49.990> little<00:01:53.520> there's<00:01:54.520> obviously<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.119> lot

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
a proper little there's obviously a lot

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.940 
a proper little there's obviously a lot
better

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:11.610 

that<00:02:03.520> was<00:02:03.640> easing<00:02:04.030> into<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.329> throttle<00:02:10.620> even

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
that was easing into the throttle even

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.839 
that was easing into the throttle even
looks<00:02:11.800> like<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.010> has<00:02:12.129> a<00:02:12.160> little<00:02:12.400> more<00:02:12.519> top

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
looks like it has a little more top

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.479 
looks like it has a little more top
speed<00:02:13.590> can't<00:02:14.590> even<00:02:14.800> open<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.099> up<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.400> this

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
speed can't even open it up in this

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:38.000 
speed can't even open it up in this
water

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:52.800 

the<00:02:39.010> rudder<00:02:39.250> came<00:02:39.689> undone<00:02:40.689> on<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:41.290> last<00:02:41.530> time

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.910 

so<00:02:53.810> easy<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.290> start<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.709> recovery<00:02:55.010> boat<00:02:55.430> here

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
so easy to start the recovery boat here

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.260 
so easy to start the recovery boat here
it<00:02:57.920> will<00:02:58.069> end<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.400> video<00:02:58.700> till<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.000> get<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
it will end that video till you get the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.300 
it will end that video till you get the
idea
