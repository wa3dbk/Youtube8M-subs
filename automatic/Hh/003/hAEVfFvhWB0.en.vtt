00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.359 
flow Arad see what happens Oh unless
they<00:06:56.059> change<00:06:56.329> position<00:06:57.039> what<00:06:58.039> I<00:06:58.069> saw<00:06:58.249> this

00:06:58.359 --> 00:06:58.369 
they change position what I saw this

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:00.730 
they change position what I saw this
morning<00:06:58.749> p<00:06:59.749> fish<00:06:59.959> were<00:07:00.110> top<00:07:00.319> and<00:07:00.499> down<00:07:00.589> this

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
morning p fish were top and down this

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.589 
morning p fish were top and down this
end<00:07:00.889> of<00:07:01.039> the<00:07:01.099> lake<00:07:01.279> so<00:07:02.089> they<00:07:02.209> seem<00:07:02.419> to<00:07:02.449> have

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
end of the lake so they seem to have

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:05.619 
end of the lake so they seem to have
moved<00:07:02.869> well<00:07:03.110> down<00:07:03.529> to<00:07:03.740> the<00:07:03.860> left<00:07:04.389> got<00:07:05.389> written

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:05.629 
moved well down to the left got written

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:07.719 
moved well down to the left got written
in<00:07:05.839> the<00:07:05.899> morning<00:07:06.229> so<00:07:06.349> probably<00:07:06.739> yeah<00:07:07.129> unless<00:07:07.579> I

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:07.729 
in the morning so probably yeah unless I

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:09.939 
in the morning so probably yeah unless I
see<00:07:07.879> something<00:07:08.269> else<00:07:08.389> stay<00:07:09.349> in<00:07:09.499> this<00:07:09.619> sort<00:07:09.889> of

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:09.949 
see something else stay in this sort of

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:12.939 
see something else stay in this sort of
zone<00:07:11.110> hopefully<00:07:12.110> might<00:07:12.289> get<00:07:12.469> resolved<00:07:12.739> by<00:07:12.889> the

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:12.949 
zone hopefully might get resolved by the

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.639 
zone hopefully might get resolved by the
side<00:07:13.159> pressure<00:07:13.459> it's<00:07:13.699> a<00:07:13.819> bit<00:07:13.969> a<00:07:14.379> bottom<00:07:15.379> sorts

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:15.649 
side pressure it's a bit a bottom sorts

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:17.799 
side pressure it's a bit a bottom sorts
Ida<00:07:15.860> fishing<00:07:16.249> is<00:07:16.369> like<00:07:16.550> late<00:07:16.819> late<00:07:17.329> evening

then<00:07:21.230> its<00:07:21.380> flow<00:07:22.010> at<00:07:22.130> fishing<00:07:22.460> or<00:07:22.580> Ziggy<00:07:22.870> unless

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.870 
then its flow at fishing or Ziggy unless

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.240 
then its flow at fishing or Ziggy unless
you're<00:07:24.050> lucky<00:07:24.320> over<00:07:24.500> a<00:07:24.530> bit<00:07:24.710> shallow<00:07:24.980> water

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.250 
you're lucky over a bit shallow water

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.630 
you're lucky over a bit shallow water
and<00:07:25.940> there<00:07:26.060> ain't<00:07:26.240> a<00:07:26.360> lot<00:07:26.390> of<00:07:26.630> that<00:07:26.750> in<00:07:26.870> here<00:07:27.640> so

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:28.640 
and there ain't a lot of that in here so

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.660 
and there ain't a lot of that in here so
we'll<00:07:29.180> just<00:07:29.390> have<00:07:29.480> to<00:07:29.600> see<00:07:29.630> what<00:07:29.870> happens

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:33.670 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.590 

anyway<00:07:34.670> I'm<00:07:34.910> going<00:07:34.970> to<00:07:35.060> sit<00:07:35.210> down<00:07:35.270> with<00:07:35.420> this

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:35.600 
anyway I'm going to sit down with this

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.600 
anyway I'm going to sit down with this
rod<00:07:38.290> so<00:07:39.290> I<00:07:39.320> better<00:07:39.560> chemistry<00:07:39.890> can<00:07:40.370> but<00:07:40.490> it's<00:07:40.580> a

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:40.610 
rod so I better chemistry can but it's a

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.590 
rod so I better chemistry can but it's a
long<00:07:40.790> way<00:07:40.970> up<00:07:41.180> there's<00:07:41.900> one<00:07:42.140> on<00:07:42.260> the<00:07:42.290> top<00:07:43.600> daddy

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:44.600 
long way up there's one on the top daddy

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.960 
long way up there's one on the top daddy
