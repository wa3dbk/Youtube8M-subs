00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.960
 First, I need four fat 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.719
 heavy beams of always two bars 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.250
 I need a cross in the middle 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.420
 I let the tap with it 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.580
 fit together 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.369
 they have to be very smooth at the top 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.529
 cross as the first 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.029
 and on the first cross a second one 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.029
 Cross the second two bars 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:35.120
 and they also have to be exactly on top of each other 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.260
 fit there 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.539
 so the crosses will not return 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.300
 let's go apart two thick 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.250
 screw and screw the indians 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.809
 together the crosses it has no further 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.860
 sense than that the crosses do not return 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.199
 apart fall out such namely 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:59.659
 hook and in every cross I screw 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:01:02.059
 There are four such hooks on the outside of the hook 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:06.129
 I attach with such send 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.129
 four thick steel cable 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.670
 I do not really screwed up 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.670
 with it and then stops 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.170
 then that's a cross finished and one 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.050
 big crane pulls it in the air 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.150
 it floats the first gold cross 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:29.100
 jet fighter also the car right 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.720
 car manufacturers more as well as we do that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.460
 we can let that float 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.320
 also built such an entry and that 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.470
 second cross we lift now 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.830
 united forces on top of the roof of the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830
 cars 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.500
 Do not be afraid who has to be such an old one 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.900
 scrap carrot worried about it all 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.100
 without scratching off because you know yes 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.290
 never really something like that 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.930
 the hook works from the second one 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.729
 cross also connects with such 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.549
 but you send the things and 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.890
 thick steel are customers with the 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:11.060
 Carrying stand the car is not on it 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.770
 only one corner but on all four so 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.600
 that a cross is now on the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.410
 Car roof is with the support frame 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.110
 connected 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.980
 the second cross hovers over it and what 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.950
 is only with the milk 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.900
 Well, I forgot the milk from the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.900
 We have to make milk sick first 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.650
 that takes twelve hours to get to you 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:36.220
 pretty acidified like this 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.510
 after 24 hours the other side sees 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.510
 I already like that 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.980
 and after 30 hours is out of the milk 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:51.610
 quark so I take the quark 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.770
 now and do the calf's lime 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.270
 causes in the quark that certain 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.099
 components of the quark 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.800
 be open-minded and out of the quark 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.000
 will clearly remember that with the 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.800
 takes me too long you can the quad 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.700
 Also buy in the store to the quark do 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.230
 I still have some blue color powder 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.269
 That's why I only do the blue color powder 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.959
 purely so that you can see better afterwards 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:20.880
 where the park is a stir I have the 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.260
 color still not so face boy 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.760
 Now the war is really nice blue 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.760
 and now it starts 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.150
 this quark line with the blue color 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.940
 I distribute this now first with the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.950
 spoon on the cross what on the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.180
 Car roof and now you can already see 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.430
 We did not do it in blue 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.609
 I just better see where I put the glue 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.070
 smear it down and with it everywhere 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.590
 even comes defended with the 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.930
 to a spatula but not only on the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.570
 a bar of the cross but on 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.620
 the entire four bars everywhere 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.620
 be neat when 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.420
 so finished and now we can do that 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.170
 second calls on the first cross 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.170
 drain 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.030
 Euro 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.760
 adjust a bit more that's exactly 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.640
 sits and so with neat 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.170
 can dry 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.540
 I press the two crosses of the upper one 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.540
 screw it together with so 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.020
 to wait for dice of only five hours 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.020
 until the laimburg is dried 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:09.770
 and now it's getting exciting 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.770
 once all screw off again 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:21.380
 if that works now with the glue 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.200
 then the car has to 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.310
 nothing is hanging on this cross 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.320
 kept farther than the glue 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.150
 the weight of the lower cross keeps that 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.490
 leyen but still the weight depends 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:41.820
 from the motto not if that would be fine 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.820
 help the glue whether the car hovers 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.730
 gst 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:54.669
 what stops and there floats our car there 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:58.020
 floats the car with the help of glue the 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.020
 have brought sea from the milk 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.540
 the cross is only held together by 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.630
 the glue 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.150
 the crane could still be so strong though 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.330
 the leyen did not hold the car 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.510
 never float and it does pretty much 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.270
 high up 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.580
 just kept from the glue we go over 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.910
 quark and lime brought out of the light 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.910
 to have
