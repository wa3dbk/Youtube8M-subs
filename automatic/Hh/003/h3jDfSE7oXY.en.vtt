00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:10.290
 alcohol ingested and says to the stomach 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:13.710
 there 20% is absorbed quickly others 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.160
 80% are ice creams in the small intestine 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.859
 the good heart is the aveiro glasses for 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.320
 all parts of the body including the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.300
 later the plant wants to constitute 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.170
 with the brain and by the way very well 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.789
 so soon but very fast brain - 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.689
 that is why even just after 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.640
 a race 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.110
 we can feel a sensation sometimes and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.620
 relaxation 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.960
 alcohol acts primarily on neurons and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.750
 brain cells and have made the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.920
 communication between neurons between heroes 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.230
 and other years making everything slower and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.120
 That's why even when we have few 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.480
 we have the effects of alcohol on our 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.629
 emissions judgments balance in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 memory speech levels of debt year 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.300
 just to name a few wise sisters 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.060
 that your brain is still 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.900
 develop between the ages of 20 and 25 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.520
 of age 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.040
 then you really need to feel 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 careful because alcohol causes 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.970
 damage to various parts of the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.310
 our brain for example 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.770
 excessive alcohol consumption affects the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.680
 cerebral cortex that controls our 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.410
 resident in our behaviors 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.560
 That's why when God became 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.530
 more talked about more confident years and less 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.570
 inhibited - also controls the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.090
 our thought processes 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.370
 therefore the ample supply our capacity 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.210
 to be good judgments and think for 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.520
 see the new ghosts of the brain are 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.520
 training and planning . 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.700
 ideas to make decisions and self-control 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.130
 so when alcohol affects the new 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.790
 brain is difficult for us 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.180
 control the emissions of impulses and act 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.369
 without thinking at the same time we even train 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.509
 violent and completely 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.650
 contrary to what would be our brother 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:15.830
 the secret is important to the collection 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.690
 growth and awareness so it can 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.300
 difficult to control these functions 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.670
 while alcohol affects being a sale 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.680
 This is why people affected by 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.820
 alcohol often can not walk 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.370
 or lose their balance and fall 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.860
 the hippocampus is part of observing the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.290
 images are formed by this when the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.150
 alcohol affects the hippocampus can be 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.019
 difficult to remember anything that 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.880
 He heard the worst yet have not manezinho 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.010
 if you can remember a collision with a 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.370
 offense in the showcase 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.500
 if the alcohol also touched you can 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.510
 be difficult to learn or remember 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.840
 I like things 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.510
 the hypothalamus is a small part of the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.140
 brain but who carries out the number 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.750
 incredible vital functions of the brain 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.810
 after an absurd see alcohol pressure 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.599
 arterial hunger to be urinating 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.739
 increases while the temperature of the 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.629
 body and timid heart rate and 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.180
 finally it is very good that it controls 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.120
 automatic body functions as per 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.849
 For example, the heart rhythm also 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.549
 the body temperature was because the 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.760
 alcohol affects the body of the summer alcohol in 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.220
 excess at temperatures outside 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.200
 may cause the temperature of the 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.379
 body leaves below normal 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.379
 this dangerous condition calls hypothermia
