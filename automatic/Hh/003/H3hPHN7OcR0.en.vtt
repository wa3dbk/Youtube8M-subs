00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.130 
you think it should be done certainly
and<00:02:17.940> especially<00:02:18.940> since<00:02:19.270> there<00:02:19.540> appears<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.990> be

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
and especially since there appears to be

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.190 
and especially since there appears to be
an<00:02:20.320> opportunity<00:02:21.209> for<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.420> happen<00:02:22.780> I

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
an opportunity for this to happen I

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.590 
an opportunity for this to happen I
think<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.950> should<00:02:24.160> be<00:02:24.190> pursued<00:02:24.730> there's<00:02:25.360> been

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
think it should be pursued there's been

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.199 
think it should be pursued there's been
some<00:02:26.410> restorations<00:02:27.130> started<00:02:27.580> honor<00:02:27.760> because

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
some restorations started honor because

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.820 
some restorations started honor because
so<00:02:28.450> they've<00:02:28.720> never<00:02:28.900> followed<00:02:29.350> through<00:02:29.530> on<00:02:29.560> in

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
so they've never followed through on in

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.580 
so they've never followed through on in
there<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:30.190> they<00:02:30.540> took<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.750> flues<00:02:31.990> out<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.440> it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
there but they took the flues out of it

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.490 
there but they took the flues out of it
and<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.920> super<00:02:33.250> heat<00:02:33.400> herbs<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:34.500> facto

and the super heat herbs and facto

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.690 
and the super heat herbs and facto
matter<00:02:35.709> as<00:02:35.920> they<00:02:36.100> scrapped<00:02:36.430> them<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:38.700> that's

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
matter as they scrapped them and that's

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.100
