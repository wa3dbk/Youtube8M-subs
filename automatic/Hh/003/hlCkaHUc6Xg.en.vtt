00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.009 
right so it's just cool to look back on
them<00:04:16.829> but<00:04:17.250> keeping<00:04:17.759> them<00:04:17.880> some<00:04:18.659> kind<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:18.930> a

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
them but keeping them some kind of a

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.170 
them but keeping them some kind of a
journal<00:04:19.349> I<00:04:19.560> think<00:04:20.430> it's<00:04:20.549> always<00:04:20.699> a<00:04:20.849> good<00:04:21.060> idea

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
journal I think it's always a good idea

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.269 
journal I think it's always a good idea
there's<00:04:21.599> there<00:04:21.810> aren't<00:04:21.989> any<00:04:22.109> negatives<00:04:22.620> at

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:23.279 
there's there aren't any negatives at

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.840 
there's there aren't any negatives at
all<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:24.330> keeping<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.690> journal<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.669> yeah
