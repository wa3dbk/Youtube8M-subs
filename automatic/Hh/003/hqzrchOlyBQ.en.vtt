00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello everyone with you skynet and today i 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.540
 I want to tell you about the best 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.009
 my opinion rifle for auger attack 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.400
 a3 can someone say something about me 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.410
 I argue that a cooler is a beacon of better 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.310
 he has a higher rate of fire there 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.650
 blah blah blah, and maybe it's because I personally and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.820
 I used to me a lot and I can 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.880
 say exactly what his rate of fire 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.790
 play a trick on him because of the high 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.210
 his shooting speed is just awesome 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 recoil here's the trunk horizontally and along 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.870
 verticals just huge to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.410
 fully compete with u guthrie and 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.500
 nevertheless many say that it is ration 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.540
 This is generally awesome and weapons I do not know 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.610
 somehow 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.880
 did not have to and normally use 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.750
 I do not like him but now we are talking 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.320
 pro aug so let 's continue among all 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.230
 other 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.630
 automata open from me i chose oka 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.770
 exactly according to the features 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.979
 the rate of fire is not big and not 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.010
 small that guarantees acceptable 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.620
 recoil when firing the fly as the 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.390
 when you open and you won't have 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.550
 no modules that can be 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.869
 put it all have to open 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.460
 as always everywhere 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.530
 also the aura has a good ratio 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.440
 stability and power of fire as well 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.200
 700 rate of fire damage 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.950
 shots per minute his stability 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.090
 out of 100 points is 60 accuracy at 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.250
 shooting 45 a damage 30 hp per shot 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.110
 which is very weighty for me 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.000
 argument to stop at this 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.770
 weapons and do not bathe with a choice from them 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.820
 of another playing for attack aircraft 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.930
 oog is a bullpup weapon for those 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.140
 who does not know what bullpap I will explain 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.060
 Bullpup is a form of this machine 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.820
 when the trigger is moved closer to the trunk 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.040
 holder is shifted to the place where usually 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.940
 should be located trigger example 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.950
 such a weapon is itself a guthrie 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.620
 this form does not have disadvantages to 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.239
 example in the loss of shooting accuracy and you 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.380
 increase return 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.400
 she has some 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.740
 even has some virtues 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.830
 for example, a weapon of this form is more convenient 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.790
 hold in hand due to the fact that the trigger 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.360
 move forward and its design 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.990
 itself is a grip that 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.510
 promotes good downforce 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.970
 butt to shoulder so here is 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.310
 the design should have been quite bad 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.190
 affect its recharge rate but 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.110
 it was not there that he was not so 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.930
 slow reload rate 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.390
 he can even give odds to the same ak-12 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.220
 it can save your life violent 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.970
 fight for example in realistic mode 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.590
 on the map 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.820
 the operation lock in general love this card 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:18.600
 is there always in one place all the people or 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.130
 face both were a flock of sheep and 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.560
 start stupid month 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.190
 there alone explosions sometimes from pancake so 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.340
 sags fps on in this map in these 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.570
 places with time you do a lot 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.520
 frags and you will open a laser sight 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.700
 laser target and mirror 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.470
 sight rds they need to stop so 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.000
 to boost the already excellent 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.360
 stability indicators automata 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.100
 firing from the 3-bet thigh is also possible 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.200
 put and other modules to 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.660
 equalize stability power firing 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.050
 that will let you shoot ratio 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.580
 stability power 50 to 50 what 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.800
 Will make oog 3 a great solution for 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.450
 games for attack aircraft unless of course you 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.190
 well know how to shoot you will not 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:08.190
 merge time after time well aug a3 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.410
 good single range 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.470
 long distance shots 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.240
 kill a person without even knowing it 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.930
 what 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.940
 Maybe this is how I killed a sniper 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:25.460
 sniper window at a decent distance 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.850
 just shot in with this scope 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.610
 mirror vds or in body can also 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.370
 kill shorter his firing range 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.890
 cool normal based on just 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.170
 I would recommend this to guthrie 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:43.790
 everyone who starts to play for attack and 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:46.940
 already opened this weapon is super powerful 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.290
 stable supersky coping with 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.180
 their task of weapons 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:55.640
 Well, that's all thank you for being with 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.280
 subscribe to my channel wait for me 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.280
 new videos with you were skynet all bye
