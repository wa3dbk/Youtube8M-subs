the<00:00:27.110> acid<00:00:27.590> eats<00:00:27.800> through<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.220> end<00:00:28.400> and

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
the acid eats through the end and

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.600 
the acid eats through the end and
sometimes<00:00:30.289> you'll<00:00:30.440> see<00:00:30.620> a<00:00:30.650> fungus<00:00:31.370> growing

here<00:00:31.820> looks<00:00:32.000> like<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.149> science<00:00:32.539> project<00:00:32.689> but

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
here looks like a science project but

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.729
