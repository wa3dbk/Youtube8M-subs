seems out of place around here whenever

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.600 
seems out of place around here whenever
we<00:01:12.110> need<00:01:12.260> information<00:01:12.530> it's<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.130> lot<00:01:13.280> simpler

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
we need information it's a lot simpler

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.850 
we need information it's a lot simpler
we<00:01:13.850> just<00:01:14.060> type<00:01:14.299> it<00:01:14.450> up<00:01:14.570> pop<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:14.990> up<00:01:15.290> print<00:01:15.770> it

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
we just type it up pop it up print it

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.520 
we just type it up pop it up print it
out<00:01:15.950> backs<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.580> up<00:01:16.700> it's<00:01:17.210> two<00:01:17.780> snaps<00:01:18.049> compared

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
out backs it up it's two snaps compared

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.830 
out backs it up it's two snaps compared
to<00:01:18.680> looking<00:01:19.130> through<00:01:19.159> a<00:01:19.370> paper<00:01:19.610> chart<00:01:19.970> trying

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
to looking through a paper chart trying

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.690 
to looking through a paper chart trying
to<00:01:20.930> figure<00:01:21.170> out<00:01:21.260> what<00:01:21.530> everything<00:01:21.710> says<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:22.490> it

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
to figure out what everything says on it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.020 
to figure out what everything says on it
can't<00:01:23.329> read<00:01:23.570> half<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.840> writing<00:01:24.320> on<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:25.030> yeah

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
can't read half the writing on it yeah

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.149 
can't read half the writing on it yeah
so<00:01:26.509> I<00:01:26.869> probably<00:01:27.289> wouldn't<00:01:27.710> want<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.860> go<00:01:27.979> back

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
so I probably wouldn't want to go back

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.300 
so I probably wouldn't want to go back
to<00:01:28.310> it<00:01:29.229> compute<00:01:30.229> this<00:01:30.409> is<00:01:30.560> probably<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.100> best

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
to it compute this is probably the best

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.200 
to it compute this is probably the best
way<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.520> go<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:33.380> does<00:01:33.619> everything<00:01:33.950> every<00:01:34.939> staff

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
way to go it does everything every staff

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.060 
way to go it does everything every staff

with<00:01:52.939> my<00:01:53.179> exam<00:01:53.509> I<00:01:53.750> can<00:01:53.929> go<00:01:54.079> to<00:01:54.859> her<00:01:55.820> chart<00:01:56.149> and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
with my exam I can go to her chart and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.749 
with my exam I can go to her chart and
create<00:01:56.750> her<00:01:56.929> chart<00:01:57.200> under<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.469> template<00:01:58.009> I<00:01:58.250> go

create her chart under a template I go

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.190 
create her chart under a template I go
and<00:01:58.909> I<00:01:59.000> click<00:01:59.329> a<00:01:59.359> generic<00:01:59.780> template<00:02:00.170> that

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
and I click a generic template that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.099 
and I click a generic template that
we've<00:02:00.469> created<00:02:00.740> that's<00:02:01.070> viral<00:02:01.460> syndrome<00:02:01.640> I

we've created that's viral syndrome I

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.810 
we've created that's viral syndrome I
hit<00:02:03.109> that<00:02:03.259> I<00:02:03.320> merge<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:03.859> plate<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.280> then<00:02:04.520> has<00:02:04.789> a

hit that I merge the plate it then has a

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.880 
hit that I merge the plate it then has a
physical<00:02:05.210> exam<00:02:05.659> already<00:02:05.960> charted<00:02:06.350> for<00:02:06.380> me<00:02:06.740> and

physical exam already charted for me and

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.219 
physical exam already charted for me and
I<00:02:07.249> only<00:02:07.460> change<00:02:07.880> any<00:02:08.119> of<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.270> abnormals<00:02:08.750> from

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
I only change any of the abnormals from

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.320 
I only change any of the abnormals from
that<00:02:09.440> basic<00:02:09.800> template<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:10.700> my<00:02:10.850> charting<00:02:11.240> is

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
that basic template so my charting is

that basic template so my charting is
cut<00:02:11.510> down<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.870> about<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:12.110> third

cut down to about a third

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.190 
cut down to about a third
the<00:02:12.579> time<00:02:12.790> while<00:02:13.030> I'm<00:02:13.120> with<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.359> patient<00:02:13.750> all

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
the time while I'm with the patient all

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.229 
the time while I'm with the patient all
the<00:02:14.469> practitioners<00:02:15.099> that<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:15.640> grew<00:02:16.030> up

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
the practitioners that I have grew up

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.530 
the practitioners that I have grew up
with<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.569> program<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.140> as<00:02:17.230> we<00:02:17.609> as<00:02:18.609> it<00:02:19.209> became

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
with the program and as we as it became

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.979 
with the program and as we as it became
more<00:02:19.599> useful<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.799> us<00:02:21.040> we<00:02:21.819> fine-tuned<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.780> so

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
more useful to us we fine-tuned it so

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.020 
more useful to us we fine-tuned it so
that<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.230> fits<00:02:23.439> our<00:02:23.590> practice<00:02:24.099> well<00:02:24.310> they<00:02:24.969> were

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
that it fits our practice well they were

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.330 
that it fits our practice well they were
part<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:25.629> process<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.920> templates

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
part of that process so the templates

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.780 
part of that process so the templates
have<00:02:27.459> been<00:02:27.640> set<00:02:27.909> up<00:02:27.939> with<00:02:28.540> their<00:02:28.780> input<00:02:28.989> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
have been set up with their input the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.479 
have been set up with their input the
the<00:02:30.790> addition<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.650> alert<00:02:32.980> systems

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
the addition of of the alert systems

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.849 
the addition of of the alert systems
that<00:02:33.670> we<00:02:33.790> use<00:02:33.819> were<00:02:34.389> were<00:02:35.049> talked<00:02:35.439> about<00:02:35.560> with

that we use were were talked about with

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.099 
that we use were were talked about with
them<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.250> meet<00:02:36.489> once<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.299> month<00:02:37.329> and<00:02:37.659> review<00:02:37.989> any

them we meet once a month and review any
