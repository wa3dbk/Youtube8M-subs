today we've got few is a tutorial on how
to<00:00:16.410> make<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.740> stackable<00:00:17.310> wheat<00:00:18.060> farm<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
to make a stackable wheat farm and the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.370 
to make a stackable wheat farm and the
reason<00:00:19.949> for<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.390> stack<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.510> wheat<00:00:21.750> farm<00:00:22.050> of

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
reason for this stack of wheat farm of

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.620 
reason for this stack of wheat farm of
course<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.920> closed<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.699> road<00:00:24.060> switch<00:00:24.359> wheat

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
course is closed the road switch wheat

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.230 
course is closed the road switch wheat
farm<00:00:24.960> no<00:00:25.230> longer<00:00:25.560> works<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.609> bone<00:00:27.000> meal

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
farm no longer works with the bone meal

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960 
farm no longer works with the bone meal
because<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> reboot<00:00:29.010> meal<00:00:29.279> works<00:00:29.550> but

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
because of the reboot meal works but

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.319 
because of the reboot meal works but
this<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.660> very<00:00:30.929> simple<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:32.369> all<00:00:32.730> days<00:00:33.030> is

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
this one is very simple it all days is

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
this one is very simple it all days is
35<00:00:34.050> wheat<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.800> each<00:00:35.579> side<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.710> all<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> way

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
35 wheat on each side and all the way

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040 
35 wheat on each side and all the way
comes<00:00:38.219> down<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.670> chute<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.210> no<00:00:39.450> matter<00:00:39.600> break

here we're gonna spin on their own
they're<00:02:43.970> fill-in<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> pixel<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.870> side

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
they're fill-in the pixel on the side

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.030 
they're fill-in the pixel on the side
and<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:51.000> next<00:02:51.450> level<00:02:52.079> we're<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:52.739> going<00:02:53.010> to

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
and the next level we're just going to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.039 
and the next level we're just going to
put<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.400> there<00:02:53.670> leave<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.269> one<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:54.989> one

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
put on there leave this one and this one

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:03.630 
put on there leave this one and this one
free<00:02:56.209> Corps<00:02:57.209> each<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.870> others

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.949 

and<00:03:04.440> once<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.620> have<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:05.830> done<00:03:06.959> you

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
and once you have that done you

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.460 
and once you have that done you
basically<00:03:08.940> almost<00:03:09.940> ready<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:13.840> want<00:03:14.050> to<00:03:14.200> put

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
basically almost ready you want to put

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.240 
basically almost ready you want to put
in<00:03:14.970> class<00:03:15.970> air<00:03:16.410> glasser<00:03:17.940> there<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:20.010> then<00:03:21.010> get

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
in class air glasser there and then get

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.900 
in class air glasser there and then get
a<00:03:21.280> broken<00:03:22.150> water<00:03:23.550> put<00:03:24.550> in<00:03:24.820> each<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.660> sides

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
a broken water put in each of the sides

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.910 
a broken water put in each of the sides
should<00:03:27.910> fill<00:03:28.180> up<00:03:28.300> yet<00:03:28.540> each<00:03:28.750> weight<00:03:29.440> now<00:03:29.739> what

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
should fill up yet each weight now what

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.729 
should fill up yet each weight now what
you<00:03:30.010> want<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.430> do<00:03:30.550> is<00:03:30.790> put<00:03:31.090> in<00:03:31.209> vines<00:03:31.720> from<00:03:32.200> the

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
you want to do is put in vines from the

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.500 
you want to do is put in vines from the
bottom<00:03:33.580> all<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.819> way<00:03:33.850> up<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.090> top<00:03:34.150> the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
bottom all the way up to the top the

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.180 
bottom all the way up to the top the
reason<00:03:34.750> use<00:03:34.900> vines<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.440> settle<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.830> dose<00:03:36.010> is

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
reason use vines and settle a dose is

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.650 
reason use vines and settle a dose is
because<00:03:36.459> vines<00:03:36.670> don't<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.180> collision

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
because vines don't have the collision

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.610 
because vines don't have the collision
box<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.700> won't<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:40.270> then<00:03:40.630> trapping<00:03:41.440> your

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
box and won't that then trapping your

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.440 
box and won't that then trapping your
weight<00:03:41.769> on<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:41.980> way<00:03:42.070> down<00:03:42.250> if<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.239> want<00:03:43.390> to

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
weight on the way down if you want to

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.770 
weight on the way down if you want to
make<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.870> next<00:03:44.080> level<00:03:44.590> all<00:03:45.100> you<00:03:45.550> do<00:03:45.850> is<00:03:46.090> get

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
make the next level all you do is get

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.350 
make the next level all you do is get
your<00:03:46.989> head<00:03:47.380> height<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.580> marks<00:03:48.910> one<00:03:49.090> is

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
your head height so the marks one is

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.340 
your head height so the marks one is
head<00:03:49.720> height<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:51.430> just<00:03:51.670> go<00:03:51.820> bricks<00:03:52.360> all<00:03:52.870> around

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
head height to just go bricks all around

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.880 
head height to just go bricks all around
again

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.400 

and<00:03:58.430> then<00:03:59.430> go<00:03:59.760> touch<00:04:00.240> another<00:04:00.810> layer<00:04:01.110> of<00:04:01.140> dirt

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
and then go touch another layer of dirt

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.580 
and then go touch another layer of dirt
and<00:04:01.740> you<00:04:01.770> basically<00:04:02.040> then<00:04:02.459> back<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.150> start

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
and you basically then back to the start

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:14.470 
and you basically then back to the start
where<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.770> will<00:04:04.980> have<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:09.090> will<00:04:09.170> end<00:04:10.170> up<00:04:11.010> with

push<00:04:55.110> out<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:55.530> act<00:04:55.650> as<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.830> full<00:04:56.130> block<00:04:56.370> step<00:04:56.700> in

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
push out and act as a full block step in

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.530 
push out and act as a full block step in
the<00:04:56.940> water<00:04:57.380> from<00:04:58.380> coming<00:04:58.740> out<00:05:00.410> sly<00:05:01.940> turn<00:05:02.940> right

we'll leave that off I me I'll show you

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.159 
we'll leave that off I me I'll show you
how<00:05:34.290> then<00:05:34.860> use<00:05:35.640> this<00:05:35.940> simple<00:05:36.270> way<00:05:36.540> of<00:05:36.780> growing

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
how then use this simple way of growing

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.520 
how then use this simple way of growing
up<00:05:37.380> diagonally<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.970> just<00:05:39.120> pull<00:05:39.330> up<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.780> it's

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
up diagonally you just pull up and it's

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.310 
up diagonally you just pull up and it's
just<00:05:40.950> the<00:05:41.940> reason<00:05:42.210> I<00:05:42.300> put<00:05:42.539> this<00:05:42.720> one<00:05:42.960> here<00:05:42.990> is

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
just the reason I put this one here is

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.570 
just the reason I put this one here is
so<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.740> could<00:05:44.039> move<00:05:44.190> the<00:05:45.740> touchdown<00:05:46.740> one<00:05:47.070> so<00:05:47.490> you

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
so I could move the touchdown one so you

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.760 
so I could move the touchdown one so you
can<00:05:47.640> just<00:05:47.729> do<00:05:48.539> this<00:05:48.660> I'll<00:05:48.960> show<00:05:49.320> you<00:05:49.380> over<00:05:49.680> here

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
can just do this I'll show you over here

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.050 
can just do this I'll show you over here
as<00:05:50.070> well<00:05:50.419> so<00:05:51.419> what<00:05:51.840> you<00:05:51.960> wanna<00:05:52.080> do<00:05:52.200> is<00:05:52.380> go

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
as well so what you wanna do is go

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.230 
as well so what you wanna do is go
blocks<00:05:54.169> like<00:05:55.169> this

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
blocks like this

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.059 
blocks like this
no<00:05:56.900> not<00:05:57.289> like<00:05:57.440> that<00:05:57.470> it<00:05:58.220> works<00:05:58.460> there<00:05:59.949> for<00:06:00.949> you

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
no not like that it works there for you

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.379 
no not like that it works there for you
leave<00:06:01.550> there<00:06:02.470> go<00:06:03.470> torch<00:06:03.889> on<00:06:04.160> that<00:06:04.389> and

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
leave there go torch on that and

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.409 
leave there go torch on that and
torching<00:06:05.870> this<00:06:05.990> one<00:06:06.430> and<00:06:07.430> then<00:06:07.729> your<00:06:07.940> torches

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
torching this one and then your torches

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.770 
torching this one and then your torches
will<00:06:08.630> invert<00:06:09.259> you<00:06:09.590> don't<00:06:09.740> of<00:06:09.830> this<00:06:10.009> torch<00:06:10.370> here

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
will invert you don't of this torch here

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.920 
will invert you don't of this torch here
doesn't<00:06:11.780> work<00:06:11.960> and<00:06:13.300> then<00:06:14.300> obviously<00:06:14.509> if<00:06:14.870> you

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
doesn't work and then obviously if you

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.379 
doesn't work and then obviously if you
don't<00:06:15.110> this<00:06:15.289> one<00:06:15.500> you<00:06:16.400> won't<00:06:16.610> forget<00:06:16.729> so<00:06:17.240> let

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
don't this one you won't forget so let

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.439 
don't this one you won't forget so let
me<00:06:17.479> just<00:06:17.690> them<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.169> their<00:06:19.039> torches<00:06:19.669> basically

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
me just them to their torches basically

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.510 
me just them to their torches basically
connect<00:06:20.780> are<00:06:21.169> connected<00:06:21.680> to<00:06:21.800> this<00:06:21.919> block<00:06:22.250> and

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
connect are connected to this block and

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.129 
connect are connected to this block and
it's<00:06:22.639> gonna<00:06:22.849> end<00:06:23.030> up<00:06:23.240> alone<00:06:23.630> like<00:06:23.930> that

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
it's gonna end up alone like that

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.450 
it's gonna end up alone like that
they're<00:06:24.530> in<00:06:25.039> a<00:06:25.669> zigzag<00:06:25.970> across<00:06:26.270> and<00:06:27.460> then

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
they're in a zigzag across and then

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.580 
they're in a zigzag across and then
that's<00:06:28.699> how<00:06:28.909> you<00:06:28.970> activate<00:06:29.690> each<00:06:29.960> year<00:06:30.199> levels

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
that's how you activate each year levels

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.029 
that's how you activate each year levels
and<00:06:31.780> that's<00:06:32.780> basically<00:06:33.349> if<00:06:33.620> you<00:06:33.830> have<00:06:33.919> any

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039
