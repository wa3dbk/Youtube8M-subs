this<00:00:11.129> is<00:00:11.459> a<00:00:12.240> door<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.039> that's<00:00:14.039> not<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.459> one

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:14.579 
this is a door and that's not this one

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.430 
this is a door and that's not this one
room<00:00:14.699> the<00:00:15.269> part<00:00:15.539> of<00:00:15.629> the<00:00:15.690> tutorial<00:00:15.869> i<00:00:16.139> think<00:00:16.350> is

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
room the part of the tutorial i think is

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.009 
room the part of the tutorial i think is
pretty<00:00:16.590> cool<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.519> door<00:00:18.019> only

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:19.019 
pretty cool is that this door only

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.370 
pretty cool is that this door only
detect<00:00:19.410> oops<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:20.070> only<00:00:20.910> opens<00:00:21.000> when<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.929> acts

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
detect oops it only opens when it acts

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.159 
detect oops it only opens when it acts
redstone<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.519> that's<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.779> part<00:00:24.929> that<00:00:25.019> i

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
redstone and that's the part that i

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.989 
redstone and that's the part that i
thought<00:00:25.349> was<00:00:25.470> pretty<00:00:25.589> cool<00:00:25.759> so<00:00:26.759> as<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.939> can

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:26.999 
thought was pretty cool so as you can

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.720 
thought was pretty cool so as you can
see<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> place<00:00:27.419> redstone<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.369> nothing<00:00:29.369> happens

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
see a place redstone and nothing happens

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.080 
see a place redstone and nothing happens
but<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.150> soon<00:00:30.300> as<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.509> break<00:00:30.749> it<00:00:31.669> you<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.880> see

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
but as soon as I break it you can see

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.900 
but as soon as I break it you can see
the<00:00:33.210> door<00:00:33.360> opens<00:00:33.690> which<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.380> pretty<00:00:34.500> cool<00:00:34.910> then

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
the door opens which is pretty cool then

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.080 
the door opens which is pretty cool then
I<00:00:35.970> can<00:00:36.120> come<00:00:36.240> back<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.630> here<00:00:37.080> you<00:00:37.950> know<00:00:38.070> jack<00:00:38.790> my

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
I can come back in here you know jack my

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.610 
I can come back in here you know jack my
tea<00:00:39.150> and<00:00:39.450> tea<00:00:39.600> hide<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.380> or<00:00:40.470> whatever

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
tea and tea hide it or whatever

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.330 
tea and tea hide it or whatever
obviously<00:00:41.580> it's<00:00:41.730> primarily<00:00:42.150> for<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> server

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
obviously it's primarily for a server

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.400 
obviously it's primarily for a server
and<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.700> leave<00:00:45.090> however<00:00:46.020> if<00:00:46.320> I

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and then I can just leave however if I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.200 
and then I can just leave however if I
want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.650> go<00:00:46.740> ahead<00:00:46.830> and<00:00:47.040> reclose<00:00:47.490> the<00:00:47.670> doors<00:00:47.910> I

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
want to go ahead and reclose the doors I

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.800 
want to go ahead and reclose the doors I
have<00:00:48.990> to<00:00:49.140> walk<00:00:49.470> back<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.630> pick<00:00:51.630> this

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
have to walk back in here and pick this

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.280 
have to walk back in here and pick this
up<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:53.180> then<00:00:54.180> come<00:00:54.660> back<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
up and then come back in here and

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.110 
up and then come back in here and
obviously<00:00:55.800> doors<00:00:56.250> close<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.000> press

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
obviously doors close you can just press

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
obviously doors close you can just press
this<00:00:57.300> button<00:00:58.040> and<00:00:59.040> I<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.850> out<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.620> basically

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
this button and I get out so basically

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.100 
this button and I get out so basically
right<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.640> guts<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.360> how<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.810> thing

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
right here is the guts on how the thing

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.670 
right here is the guts on how the thing
works<00:01:04.580> here<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.730> have<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> dispenser<00:01:06.750> full<00:01:07.440> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
works here we have a dispenser full of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.570 
works here we have a dispenser full of
lapis<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.730> below<00:01:09.660> we<00:01:09.690> have<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.260> torch<00:01:10.920> powering

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
lapis and below we have a torch powering

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.230 
lapis and below we have a torch powering
it<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.510> dispenser<00:01:12.870> is<00:01:13.230> already<00:01:13.710> powered

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
it so this dispenser is already powered

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.520 
it so this dispenser is already powered
Spencer's<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> weird<00:01:15.690> thing<00:01:15.900> where<00:01:16.200> they

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
Spencer's do a weird thing where they

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.810 
Spencer's do a weird thing where they
can<00:01:16.740> actually<00:01:17.360> trigger<00:01:18.360> or<00:01:18.690> determine

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
can actually trigger or determine

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
can actually trigger or determine
whether<00:01:20.820> there's<00:01:21.210> been<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.810> redstone<00:01:22.290> update

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
whether there's been a redstone update

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830 
whether there's been a redstone update
around<00:01:23.040> them<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.480> works<00:01:24.659> with

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
around them and so it works with

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.710 
around them and so it works with
dispensers<00:01:25.490> redstone<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.730> redstone<00:01:27.330> torches

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
dispensers redstone and redstone torches

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.690 
dispensers redstone and redstone torches
I<00:01:27.930> believe<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.740> also<00:01:29.010> works<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.310> pressure

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
I believe it also works with pressure

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.040 
I believe it also works with pressure
plates<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:32.210> basically<00:01:33.210> these<00:01:33.360> orange<00:01:33.750> blocks

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
plates so basically these orange blocks

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.550 
plates so basically these orange blocks
is<00:01:34.530> where<00:01:35.159> if<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.550> place<00:01:35.850> redstone<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:37.110> will

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
is where if you place redstone it will

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.040 
is where if you place redstone it will
shoot<00:01:38.010> a<00:01:38.250> block<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.300> break<00:01:39.479> redstone

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
shoot a block and if you break redstone

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.410 
shoot a block and if you break redstone
it<00:01:40.290> also<00:01:40.560> shoots<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.890> block<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.940> it<00:01:42.090> does<00:01:42.240> that

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
it also shoots a block and it does that

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.789 
it also shoots a block and it does that
they're<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.130> they're<00:01:45.650> obviously<00:01:46.650> it

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
they're there and they're obviously it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.710 
they're there and they're obviously it
does<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.070> down<00:01:47.190> here<00:01:47.430> too<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.479> makes<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
does it down here too but that makes a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.300 
does it down here too but that makes a
bit<00:01:48.870> more<00:01:48.900> sense<00:01:49.260> because<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.920> directly

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
bit more sense because it's directly

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.070 
bit more sense because it's directly
connected<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.000> torches<00:01:51.420> at<00:01:51.570> these<00:01:51.720> spots

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
connected to the torches at these spots

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.149 
connected to the torches at these spots
on<00:01:52.380> these<00:01:53.250> red<00:01:53.610> blocks<00:01:53.970> right<00:01:54.479> here<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:56.040> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
on these red blocks right here as you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.060 
on these red blocks right here as you
can<00:01:56.190> see<00:01:56.310> I'll<00:01:56.490> place<00:01:56.820> some<00:01:57.330> redstone<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
can see I'll place some redstone and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.980 
can see I'll place some redstone and
nothing<00:01:59.070> happens<00:01:59.490> however<00:02:00.180> when<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.330> break<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
nothing happens however when I break the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.280 
nothing happens however when I break the
redstone<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:02.010> goes<00:02:02.190> ahead<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.640> shoots<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:04.020> it

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
redstone it goes ahead and shoots and it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.980 
redstone it goes ahead and shoots and it
does<00:02:04.470> that<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:04.979> all<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.520> these<00:02:05.700> spaces<00:02:06.030> so

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
does that for all of these spaces so

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.369 
does that for all of these spaces so
only<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.069> these<00:02:08.459> red<00:02:08.819> spaces<00:02:09.389> is<00:02:09.629> when<00:02:10.259> it

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
only at the these red spaces is when it

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.030 
only at the these red spaces is when it
breaks<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:11.219> will<00:02:11.519> shoot<00:02:12.139> and<00:02:13.139> this<00:02:13.620> also<00:02:13.799> works

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
breaks it will shoot and this also works

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.809 
breaks it will shoot and this also works
I<00:02:14.249> believe<00:02:14.459> through

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
I believe through

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.110 
I believe through
Peters<00:02:15.499> yep<00:02:16.499> except<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.189> Peters<00:02:17.549> on<00:02:17.760> these

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
Peters yep except for Peters on these

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.489 
Peters yep except for Peters on these
red<00:02:18.329> blocks<00:02:18.599> will<00:02:18.870> actually<00:02:19.079> shoot<00:02:19.260> whether

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:19.499 
red blocks will actually shoot whether

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.589 
red blocks will actually shoot whether
you<00:02:19.739> place<00:02:20.040> them<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.670> not<00:02:21.060> when<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.359> break

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
you place them and not when you break

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.649 
you place them and not when you break
them<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.499> you<00:02:23.310> can<00:02:23.370> see<00:02:23.549> place<00:02:23.969> one<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.389> shoots

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
them so you can see place one it shoots

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.259 
them so you can see place one it shoots
break<00:02:25.200> one<00:02:25.439> doesn't<00:02:26.069> shoot<00:02:26.219> that's<00:02:27.090> how<00:02:27.209> that

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
break one doesn't shoot that's how that

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.979 
break one doesn't shoot that's how that
works<00:02:27.439> this<00:02:28.439> is<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.709> mechanism<00:02:29.010> right<00:02:29.430> here

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
works this is the mechanism right here

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.830 
works this is the mechanism right here
that<00:02:30.989> basically<00:02:31.290> controls<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.310> whole<00:02:32.459> thing

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
that basically controls the whole thing

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.259 
that basically controls the whole thing
and<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.349> have<00:02:34.469> outputs<00:02:35.120> next<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
and you can have outputs next to the

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.429 
and you can have outputs next to the
pressure<00:02:36.540> plate<00:02:36.780> right<00:02:37.650> here<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.370> here<00:02:38.819> and

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
pressure plate right here and here and

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.190 
pressure plate right here and here and
put<00:02:40.439> some<00:02:40.560> torches<00:02:40.980> there<00:02:41.189> so<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.459> can<00:02:41.669> see<00:02:42.200> so

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
put some torches there so you can see so

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.929 
put some torches there so you can see so
basically<00:02:43.560> we're<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.459> go<00:02:44.519> ahead<00:02:44.609> we

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
basically we're going to go ahead we

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.699 
basically we're going to go ahead we
place<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> block<00:02:45.450> here<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.959> we<00:02:46.439> can<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.680> a

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
place a block here and we can have a

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.720 
place a block here and we can have a
fake<00:02:47.099> pseudo<00:02:47.879> wall<00:02:48.590> whatnot<00:02:49.590> but<00:02:50.430> if<00:02:50.609> I<00:02:50.700> go

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
fake pseudo wall whatnot but if I go

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.360 
fake pseudo wall whatnot but if I go
ahead<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.180> place<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.930> redstone<00:02:52.409> nothing

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
ahead and place this redstone nothing

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.729 
ahead and place this redstone nothing
happens<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.209> as<00:02:54.269> soon<00:02:54.389> as<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.599> break<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.049> it

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
happens but as soon as I break it it

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.939 
happens but as soon as I break it it
shoots<00:02:56.449> this<00:02:57.449> piston<00:02:57.840> will<00:02:57.989> retract<00:02:58.379> so<00:02:58.889> you

00:02:58.939 --> 00:02:58.949 
shoots this piston will retract so you

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.069 
shoots this piston will retract so you
can<00:02:59.159> actually<00:02:59.280> get<00:02:59.549> down<00:02:59.819> in<00:03:00.000> here<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.480> get

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
can actually get down in here and get

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.559 
can actually get down in here and get
that<00:03:01.109> block<00:03:01.549> as<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.669> see<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.030> torches<00:03:03.389> turn

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
that block as you see the torches turn

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.979 
that block as you see the torches turn
off<00:03:03.750> because<00:03:04.079> of<00:03:04.169> the<00:03:04.290> output<00:03:05.269> so<00:03:06.269> get<00:03:06.689> down<00:03:06.840> in

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
off because of the output so get down in

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.800 
off because of the output so get down in
here<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.530> it'll<00:03:07.859> close<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:09.150> basically<00:03:09.569> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
here and it'll close so basically the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.689 
here and it'll close so basically the
reason<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.409> piston<00:03:10.919> has<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.280> push<00:03:11.489> this

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:11.699 
reason that this piston has to push this

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.899 
reason that this piston has to push this
block<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.359> front<00:03:12.599> of<00:03:12.689> this<00:03:12.780> dispenser<00:03:13.230> is

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
block in front of this dispenser is

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.839 
block in front of this dispenser is
because<00:03:14.909> let's<00:03:15.510> see<00:03:15.689> just<00:03:16.139> break<00:03:16.409> that<00:03:16.849> if

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
because let's see just break that if

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.990 
because let's see just break that if
that<00:03:18.510> piston<00:03:18.989> wasn't<00:03:19.319> there<00:03:20.000> there's

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
that piston wasn't there there's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.899 
that piston wasn't there there's
actually<00:03:21.359> a<00:03:21.389> chance<00:03:21.689> that<00:03:22.109> this<00:03:22.590> will<00:03:23.220> not<00:03:23.430> hit

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
actually a chance that this will not hit

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.689 
actually a chance that this will not hit
that<00:03:24.180> pressure<00:03:24.900> plate<00:03:25.259> and<00:03:25.560> it'll<00:03:26.430> just<00:03:26.459> go

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
that pressure plate and it'll just go

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.030 
that pressure plate and it'll just go
wherever<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.989> we<00:03:28.079> want<00:03:28.259> to<00:03:28.319> make<00:03:28.470> sure<00:03:28.500> that

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
wherever and we want to make sure that

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.360 
wherever and we want to make sure that
every<00:03:29.459> time<00:03:30.259> it<00:03:31.259> will<00:03:31.560> hit<00:03:31.919> the<00:03:32.129> pressure

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
every time it will hit the pressure

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.240 
every time it will hit the pressure
plate<00:03:32.609> so<00:03:33.359> there's<00:03:33.659> a<00:03:33.750> weird<00:03:33.989> behavior<00:03:34.620> I<00:03:34.829> use

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
plate so there's a weird behavior I use

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.039 
plate so there's a weird behavior I use
this<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.549> my<00:03:35.639> potion<00:03:35.879> room<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.540> if<00:03:36.689> you<00:03:36.810> place

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
this in my potion room that if you place

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.289 
this in my potion room that if you place
a<00:03:37.079> block<00:03:37.409> in<00:03:37.680> front<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.979> a<00:03:38.009> dispenser<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:39.120> will

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
a block in front of a dispenser it will

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.199 
a block in front of a dispenser it will
go<00:03:39.389> into<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.780> block<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.199> go<00:03:40.319> straight<00:03:40.680> down

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
go into the block and go straight down

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.539 
go into the block and go straight down
so<00:03:42.209> we'll<00:03:42.540> stand<00:03:42.750> right<00:03:42.930> here<00:03:43.310> as<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.430> see

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
so we'll stand right here as you can see

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.030 
so we'll stand right here as you can see
it<00:03:44.729> goes<00:03:44.879> straight<00:03:45.030> down<00:03:45.560> then<00:03:46.560> this<00:03:46.799> just

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
it goes straight down then this just

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.539 
it goes straight down then this just
inverts<00:03:47.609> this<00:03:48.569> torch<00:03:49.159> causing<00:03:50.159> it<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.310> pull

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
inverts this torch causing it to pull

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.729 
inverts this torch causing it to pull
back<00:03:50.729> and<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.269> get<00:03:51.569> down<00:03:51.720> there<00:03:51.780> get<00:03:52.259> it<00:03:52.439> step

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
back and I get down there get it step

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.759 
back and I get down there get it step
off<00:03:52.979> and<00:03:53.329> then<00:03:54.329> it<00:03:54.449> will<00:03:54.540> push<00:03:54.840> back<00:03:55.169> and<00:03:55.470> be

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
off and then it will push back and be

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.249 
off and then it will push back and be
ready<00:03:55.949> for<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.280> next<00:03:56.489> time<00:03:56.759> so<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.840> only<00:03:57.989> down

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:58.259 
ready for the next time so the only down

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:03.069 
ready for the next time so the only down
flaw<00:03:58.590> or<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.430> downfall<00:04:00.049> with<00:04:01.049> this<00:04:01.259> design<00:04:01.590> is

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
flaw or a downfall with this design is

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.179 
flaw or a downfall with this design is
you<00:04:04.079> know<00:04:04.199> just<00:04:04.500> like<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.650> door<00:04:04.949> over<00:04:05.159> there

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
you know just like the door over there

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.289 
you know just like the door over there
if<00:04:05.579> I<00:04:05.819> place<00:04:06.090> this<00:04:06.329> do<00:04:06.659> that<00:04:07.159> obviously<00:04:08.159> if<00:04:08.849> I

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
if I place this do that obviously if I

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.809 
if I place this do that obviously if I
go<00:04:09.629> in<00:04:09.840> attend<00:04:10.319> you<00:04:10.500> know<00:04:10.620> do<00:04:11.189> whatever<00:04:11.400> and

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
go in attend you know do whatever and
