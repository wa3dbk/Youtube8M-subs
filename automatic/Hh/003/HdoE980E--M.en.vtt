00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
cards and the ones i'm going to be using

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.650

is this loom minion and this Meg mortar
and<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.989> reason<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.469> being<00:00:52.770> um<00:00:53.809> they're

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and the reason for that being um they're

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.470 
and the reason for that being um they're
in<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> slots<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> they<00:00:56.969> don't<00:00:57.180> really<00:00:57.210> have

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
in the slots so they don't really have

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.770 
in the slots so they don't really have
an<00:00:57.570> order<00:00:57.809> right<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:59.570> they<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.600> not
