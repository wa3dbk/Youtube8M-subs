00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
deep 15 on this side and the 13 on that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.260 
deep 15 on this side and the 13 on that
side<00:02:11.350> or<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.620> could<00:02:11.800> use<00:02:12.120> boxing<00:02:13.120> wrenches<00:02:14.700> my

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.170 

thing<00:02:19.270> will<00:02:19.480> actually<00:02:20.580> pull<00:02:21.580> up<00:02:21.610> out<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.090> the

thing will actually pull up out of the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.940 
thing will actually pull up out of the
way<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.900> could<00:02:23.140> work<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.500> getting<00:02:23.860> that

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
way and I could work on getting that

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.940 
way and I could work on getting that

through now you can see that the bushing

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.490 
through now you can see that the bushing
is<00:03:12.280> broke<00:03:12.580> out<00:03:12.870> now<00:03:13.870> I'm<00:03:13.989> going<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.230> grab<00:03:14.470> it

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
the rest of the way out once I had that

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.199 
the rest of the way out once I had that
screwdriver<00:03:20.830> stuck<00:03:21.310> feeder<00:03:21.700> made<00:03:21.940> sure<00:03:22.120> it

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
screwdriver stuck feeder made sure it

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.390 
screwdriver stuck feeder made sure it
was<00:03:22.330> broke<00:03:22.600> like<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.350> just<00:03:23.800> slid<00:03:24.370> right

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
was broke like that it just slid right

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.930 
was broke like that it just slid right
out<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.930> outside<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.130> is<00:03:27.250> hard<00:03:27.580> like

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
out the outside of it is hard like

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.020 
out the outside of it is hard like
plastic<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.380> inside<00:03:29.860> of<00:03:30.070> it<00:03:30.220> is<00:03:30.340> pliable

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
plastic and the inside of it is pliable

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.229 
plastic and the inside of it is pliable
rubber<00:03:31.350> so<00:03:32.790> that's<00:03:33.790> it

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
rubber so that's it

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.540 
rubber so that's it
torn<00:03:34.540> through<00:03:34.810> I'm<00:03:35.769> going<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:35.980> go<00:03:36.070> back<00:03:36.280> in

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
torn through I'm going to go back in

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.360 
torn through I'm going to go back in
with<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.910> replacement<00:03:38.010> when<00:03:39.010> you're<00:03:39.160> going

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
with the replacement when you're going

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.030 
with the replacement when you're going
back<00:03:39.580> in<00:03:39.790> with<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.970> proper<00:03:40.450> mount<00:03:40.660> as<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:41.800> said

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
back in with the proper mount as I said

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.820 
back in with the proper mount as I said
before<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.489> got<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.730> lift<00:03:42.880> this<00:03:43.090> up<00:03:43.650> slide<00:03:44.650> the

before you got to lift this up slide the
Mountaineer<00:03:45.370> if<00:03:45.580> it's<00:03:46.150> frozen

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
Mountaineer if it's frozen

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.199 
Mountaineer if it's frozen
it'll<00:03:46.959> probably<00:03:47.110> slide<00:03:47.500> them<00:03:47.739> better<00:03:47.980> if<00:03:48.940> it's

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
it'll probably slide them better if it's

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.570 
it'll probably slide them better if it's
not<00:03:49.360> frozen<00:03:49.709> it'll<00:03:50.709> be<00:03:50.830> hard<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.100> get<00:03:51.310> in<00:03:51.430> but

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
not frozen it'll be hard to get in but

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.729 
not frozen it'll be hard to get in but
you<00:03:51.640> got<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.030> get<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.330> with<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.320> arrow

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
you got to get in with the arrow

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.680 
you got to get in with the arrow
pointing<00:03:53.920> up<00:03:54.400> now<00:03:55.000> since<00:03:55.330> I<00:03:55.450> got<00:03:55.630> a

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.870 
sandwiched in the bracket on both sides
and<00:04:25.100> as<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.090> said<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.450> had<00:04:26.570> an<00:04:26.660> arrow<00:04:26.930> on<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.470> and

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
and as I said it had an arrow on it and

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.230 
and as I said it had an arrow on it and
this<00:04:28.880> arrow<00:04:29.210> here<00:04:30.100> matches<00:04:31.100> up<00:04:31.310> with<00:04:31.670> that<00:04:31.940> dot

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
this arrow here matches up with that dot

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.170 
this arrow here matches up with that dot
in<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:33.140> bracket<00:04:33.560> there<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:34.490> that's<00:04:34.730> how<00:04:34.850> these

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.720 
in the bracket there so that's how these
mounts<00:04:35.660> have<00:04:36.050> to<00:04:36.200> be<00:04:36.320> aligned<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:37.010> that<00:04:37.490> you
