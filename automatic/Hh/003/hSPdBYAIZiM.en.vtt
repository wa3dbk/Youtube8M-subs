00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 paul allaerts new technical 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.970
 director arbitration new position i 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.610
 assume you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.830
 honored and particularly happy 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.410
 but of course I am very satisfied with it 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.289
 appointment of this new position 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.189
 I am now one of those people who 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.109
 hobby passion with work and combining 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.570
 what does the function exactly mean? 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.939
 and will exist in particular to put on at two 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.010
 surfaces on the one hand on the front 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.289
 Arbitration are the basic pie 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.910
 take the necessary actions to introduce new ones 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.040
 Referees to recruit these too 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.600
 and to optimize them 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.710
 and on the other for our 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.870
 top skaters 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.160
 top referees and also better out 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.829
 coach to coach 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.809
 as such that they are every Sunday or 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.680
 an optimal performance on Saturday 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.329
 to deliver 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.100
 the timing is also not really a coincidence t ' 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.680
 moment the arbitration a bit there 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.610
 blows mainly gets some aggression 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.579
 concerns 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.559
 That is always a good time to be in 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.480
 to step into a new position and 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.620
 then my know directly we can go 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.510
 to do 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.060
 you already have some concrete action what 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.920
 are you going to do it ah I think 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.479
 being a very bad counselor 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.939
 to go everything in the short term 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.100
 change and so I go first 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.409
 especially in the coming weeks 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.420
 observe and above all listen to 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.950
 people who can make a positive input 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.090
 to the further development of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.470
 the arbitration 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.450
 then go story with lots of people 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.159
 arbitration but we will not accept it 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.420
 the beds because I think there are others 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.619
 stakeholders in football are those 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.689
 maybe good ideas around 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.060
 may have arbitration in the short term 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.380
 then it means that the actions that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.850
 Chris reward our referee manager 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.210
 has launched that we will go further 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.829
 and that we actually do before 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.720
 the end of the season with 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.720
 come up with a coherent plan that includes the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.869
 propose appropriate actions 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.299
 for arbitration at the base if it is up 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.610
 arbitration and that these actions are complete 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.689
 fit within the policy of the gullies 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.340
 football association 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.219
 the policy of growing and winning 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.200
 and that we then go the necessary things 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.700
 launch has yet to come this year 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.480
 year than in the following year 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.790
 what with the al 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.960
 existing expertise that I say 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.960
 frank de bleeckere 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.490
 that if 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.520
 seconded for the cc present here 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.740
 is ah i always have when i'm still myself 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.480
 I was always very active 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.760
 I can gain experience from the van 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.080
 top lift and we sincerely next and it is 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.370
 therefore also very important that none 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.650
 expertise 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.570
 is lost when that some people 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.420
 we also stop to see how that we do 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.120
 who can use your expertise optimally 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.520
 and that it is completely over 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.180
 favor of our referees 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.920
 to 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.080
 moreover it is important for me too 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.640
 that we have expertise in the right place too 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.090
 I also want to use it with that 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.440
 is we are within Belgians still okay 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.000
 but I also well represented us 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.760
 also have werner helmets there 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.470
 from our physical point of view 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.090
 our disk is only optimally prepared 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.800
 He is particularly in Europe and the world 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.290
 and we have to stay with him further 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.720
 have mental work 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.730
 chief brewers who are also our arbitrators 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.240
 support mentally for 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.770
 me what does a little room for 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.090
 improvement is also saying is on it 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.440
 tactically, think of ours 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.120
 referees 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.160
 more tactical support 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.860
 give because and separates ship to level 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.870
 must really know football through and through 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.040
 striving for pro referees is that 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.320
 an ambition 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.730
 what is it is not an ambition in itself 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.580
 go to sprog arbitrarily right 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.770
 need both that time they need us that 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.230
 give time and provide optimum support 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.480
 such that they are also ready every week 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.640
 to do the contest some money you 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.980
 bring you the experience uwv 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.680
 at the choir yes so I am a member of the code 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.910
 and what they core i7 program with 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.019
 my actual promise is the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.060
 national referee 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.280
 prepared for the international 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.010
 stage is an intensive one 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.660
 program of belgium is already alex 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.850
 book about jonathan lardot to zo 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.750
 and now we bart tents there 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.459
 to it 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.680
 It is obvious that we are going to try to 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.310
 same couple program that with us 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.360
 to be able to do and see in Belgium with 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.769
 the means that we have 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.810
 how that we our talented 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.239
 referees also such 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.320
 package can pass from van van 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.239
 training and coaching 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.590
 I also think that is important 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.800
 that we also cross the border 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.299
 look at how 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.859
 other countries work with them 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.079
 referees and maybe we can 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.700
 get some good ideas there too 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.740
 So there are also the things that we like 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.410
 we all shamefully in the coming weeks 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.750
 go and also analyze and 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.550
 then incorporate the want within that plan 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.520
 something has changed since you as you 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.160
 has stopped there have changed enormously 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.450
 So on the one hand and then perk now maybe 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.780
 solidifies the provincial 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.970
 province professional level it is so 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.900
 that yes the football is so much faster 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.669
 become 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.690
 and besides, there are now the cameras that 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.710
 live 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.419
 can say directly from well 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.260
 decision of the referee or assistants 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.210
 was was correct 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.919
 what is the opposite? 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.139
 yes i am still with a team of three 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.650
 started with two assistants there 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.479
 a feather officially recovered to now in 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.460
 uefa europa champion's league 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.470
 competitions is already with a fifth and 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.280
 sixth so you see that arbitration on that 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.540
 area 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.360
 also enormously equally readers and that we watch 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.360
 really become a team teamwork 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.870
 so that it is very important 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.820
 and so it is so important that we 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.380
 further our separates with us 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.320
 support those different ones 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.390
 surfaces in such a way that they are optimally which 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.770
 can do competitions because actually it is 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.510
 it very simple 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.550
 no from the last of a referee 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.080
 against a bus was a soccer player 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.060
 Saturday and Sunday on the premises 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.470
 everything is possible 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.930
 not successfully program but you can 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.300
 want to prepare for success and you come to it 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.760
 good moment at the NFL that is in full 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.789
 development is yes i think that 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.440
 everyone now also sees with the 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.070
 Arriver from edges of Steven Martens 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.770
 that there is a positive flow through the 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.150
 the federation is to 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.550
 has a clear vision and structure 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.200
 therefore the projects are potted to you 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.620
 the launched or go launched 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.870
 being on it is therefore good and I am 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.080
 I am also pleased that I can go 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.120
 help and and work on that further 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.440
 professionalization and I think the 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.600
 appointing me as a 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.530
 textbook example of is okay a lot 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.530
 good luck and
