00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.530
 today we are here on cove beach 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.290
 the motor about riding how do you 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.210
 hit the thump how do you care 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.070
 part of that engine that the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.490
 important that the boat is not heart of 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.910
 boat is that you proceed 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.140
 For what motor turi more than the boat 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.599
 navigate better 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.790
 the first thing as you will stay 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.489
 When are you going to leave? 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:43.070
 it is important that the motor is 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:47.870
 positioned as low as possible by 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.480
 of the power trio so we have to 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.350
 Check if engine is lower 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.080
 possible 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.900
 the instrument indicating position also 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.980
 it is easy to be queried for having items 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.910
 below 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:08.020
 so it's nice to meet you 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.950
 starts making the boat flat plane has 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.320
 to take off 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.260
 always with the low engine passes a 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.700
 slightly stronger acceleration than the 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.700
 boat comes out of the water 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:02:02.930
 8a rock 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:02:06.980
 the skin is that we know that the boat 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.690
 is flat across the treadmill 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.690
 looking at the stern mat of the boat 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.390
 when the treadmill starts to take off from the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.900
 pulp we see that white water 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.180
 taking off from the stern of the boat 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.510
 the boat is planning how much greater 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.430
 speed the lower treadmill is 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.650
 decreases the size of the waves and 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.290
 ever further from the boat 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.320
 we see that behind the pulp has a 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.200
 with and start to glide whether 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.470
 keep the trio in a room 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.379
 at low cruise speed training 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.129
 usually half-way across the river 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.810
 low starting at 3,000 rpm 3 500 rpm 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:58.180
 in this band 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.150
 another very important item and take offs 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.090
 regards safety relaxed healing of the 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.900
 province or accelerate a little forgotten 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.930
 I left josÃ© frial alencar with the 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.359
 central to what happens to push too hard 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.019
 one more engine because it will raise the 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:20.379
 the higher the engine is and the more 30 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.030
 lift throw then I did is that 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.030
 procedure is wrong 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:36.830
 What happens is a shadow can be 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.760
 dangerous 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.760
 look at the difference now 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:52.340
 another issue and relax trim disrespect 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.770
 dirigibility 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.930
 because when you lower the trim 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.330
 usually the boat hangs to a board 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.990
 band to starboard so it stays the 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.540
 Which direction is good but I do not know what 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.400
 it gets heavier when you use it 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.120
 down but you have to get out you had to 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.770
 low 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.500
 as you go lifting trim 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.350
 You do not know how to stay any longer. 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.290
 Longer quiet does not weigh so much 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.570
 beyond which the boat does not pull at the door and 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.060
 tends to stay the course 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.630
 if you get up from another trio he 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.360
 begins beyond you there the direction is 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.169
 too light and it starts to pull the 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.050
 board 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:39.410
 then the question of the engine position of the 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.950
 correct height of 30 and arrow enough to 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.480
 riding comfort in Egypt 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.660
 visibility because you can 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.060
 handle better titri instigating the 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.110
 position the trend when you 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.360
 accelerate the boat is to lower the test 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.670
 So you're accelerating, you're going to win the 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.920
 hospital is going to win voting goes 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.280
 gaining speed the proof by lowering 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.050
 Then you make up by raising 30 then 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.180
 very important with your assistants 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.990
 this power 30 feature is a 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.390
 very useful tool that is part of the 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.170
 correct use of the neighborhood if you use the 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.990
 trim 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:20.380
 You'll make your engine perform better. 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:26.130
 you will get better speed better 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.130
 economy and power engine durability
