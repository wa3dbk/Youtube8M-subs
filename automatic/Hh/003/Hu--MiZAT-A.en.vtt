00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.780
 to make the texture if this side a little bit 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.100

 perfect 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.409
 ah it's not very beautiful but cons 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.209
 when you go eat your machine 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.350
 will make small pieces and that's what 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.429
 really makes me punish the true but 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.929
 really fine was like that 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.179
 ok I understood now we will do 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.560
 bananas bananas and more 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.520
 directly hands in me in 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.289
 the device but go through the butter 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.950
 it's really too good okay 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.940
 will put some sugar brown sugar 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.920
 that's the equivalent of two spoons to 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.690
 soup okay it's based on ripe 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.360
 that's fine we'll cut him off as 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.349
 that in sport mode 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.300
 so that if you like can put a 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.790
 little rum and its 20 million we will not 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.620
 put back today on high heat and we 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.180
 is doing well and caramelized okay 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.379
 with butter the sugar that really really 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.450
 very greedy in itself it starts to 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.379
 look at the mixes siegel you it will be 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.180
 better in something super 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.090
 that harmonize it crashes a little yes 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.760
 it's important if it's a bit 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.959
 effects like that we'll put them 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.569
 directly you go always 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.160
 Roughly we have molds to 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.360
 paper muffins still we liked in 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.230
 silicone footprints for not that 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.120
 it suffers with cooking 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.349
 you win them or three quarters must 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.700
 always one or two scholarships o'bannon 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.500
 world deep end and we go 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.549
 anika it'll blow okay and we'll 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.069
 go to the oven on to preheat your 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.480
 oven at 180 ° cooking 25 minutes 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.160
 and then the famous tip of the knife 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.110
 that a dry spring is that it is cooked 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.470
 this well having had the balls 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.590
