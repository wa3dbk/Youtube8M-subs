we<00:03:25.500> got<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.709> do<00:03:25.799> is<00:03:25.920> wait<00:03:26.040> thirty<00:03:26.250> minutes<00:03:26.549> and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
we got to do is wait thirty minutes and

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.589 
we got to do is wait thirty minutes and
luckily<00:03:27.060> for<00:03:27.150> you

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
luckily for you

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.640 
luckily for you
you<00:03:28.110> don't<00:03:28.260> have<00:03:28.349> to<00:03:28.500> wait<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.860> do<00:03:29.330> but<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:30.450> know

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
you don't have to wait I do but you know

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.289 
you don't have to wait I do but you know
you<00:03:31.650> guys<00:03:31.769> are<00:03:31.890> like<00:03:32.010> all<00:03:32.819> right<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.180> this

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
you guys are like all right so this

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.979 
you guys are like all right so this
second<00:03:33.690> base<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:34.110> worth<00:03:34.680> 22<00:03:35.159> trophies<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.989> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
second base is worth 22 trophies and the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.220 
second base is worth 22 trophies and the
mortars<00:03:37.890> are<00:03:38.220> protecting<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.299> good<00:03:39.959> amount<00:03:40.170> of

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
mortars are protecting a good amount of

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.149 
mortars are protecting a good amount of
building<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.590> think<00:03:40.709> I'm<00:03:40.860> going<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.069> take

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
building so I think I'm going to take

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.610 
building so I think I'm going to take
out<00:03:41.280> these<00:03:41.430> two<00:03:41.670> side<00:03:41.909> mortars<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.450> we<00:03:43.349> should

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
out these two side mortars and we should

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.649 
out these two side mortars and we should
be<00:03:43.739> good<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.890> go<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.970> may<00:03:45.090> also<00:03:45.269> notice<00:03:45.540> that

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
be good to go you may also notice that

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.570 
be good to go you may also notice that
there<00:03:46.019> aren't<00:03:46.200> too<00:03:46.379> many<00:03:46.409> empty<00:03:47.040> spaces

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
there aren't too many empty spaces

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.509 
there aren't too many empty spaces
inside<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.330> its<00:03:48.480> face<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.379> I'm<00:03:49.709> guessing<00:03:50.220> that

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
inside of its face so I'm guessing that

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.890 
inside of its face so I'm guessing that
the<00:03:50.730> giant<00:03:51.030> bombs<00:03:51.209> are<00:03:51.450> gonna<00:03:51.569> be<00:03:51.690> on<00:03:51.780> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
the giant bombs are gonna be on the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.720 
the giant bombs are gonna be on the
outside<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:52.950> we're<00:03:53.129> gonna<00:03:53.220> alert<00:03:53.549> these

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
outside so we're gonna alert these

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.030 
outside so we're gonna alert these
heroes<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.299> then<00:03:54.900> take<00:03:55.260> out<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.439> two<00:03:55.830> side

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
heroes and then take out the two side

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.119 
heroes and then take out the two side
mortars<00:03:56.459> check<00:03:57.330> for<00:03:57.510> bombs<00:03:57.689> and<00:03:58.080> start<00:03:58.920> our

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
mortars check for bombs and start our

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.979 
mortars check for bombs and start our
attack<00:03:59.250> I'm<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.299> little<00:04:00.540> bit<00:04:00.659> worried<00:04:00.959> about

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
attack I'm a little bit worried about

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.089 
attack I'm a little bit worried about
those<00:04:01.530> multi<00:04:01.920> set<00:04:02.189> inferno

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
those multi set inferno

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.220 
those multi set inferno
because<00:04:03.760> they<00:04:03.969> are<00:04:04.269> gonna<00:04:04.450> be<00:04:04.599> in<00:04:04.719> range<00:04:04.989> of

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
because they are gonna be in range of

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.890 
because they are gonna be in range of
our<00:04:06.069> barbarians<00:04:06.670> when<00:04:06.939> we<00:04:07.150> attack<00:04:07.510> those

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
our barbarians when we attack those

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.080 
our barbarians when we attack those
buildings<00:04:08.319> above<00:04:08.680> them<00:04:08.859> so<00:04:09.579> we're<00:04:09.819> gonna<00:04:09.939> have

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
buildings above them so we're gonna have

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.929 
buildings above them so we're gonna have
to<00:04:10.150> be<00:04:10.269> very<00:04:10.870> careful<00:04:11.260> there<00:04:11.730> careful<00:04:12.730> there

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
to be very careful there careful there

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.250 
to be very careful there careful there
armored<00:04:13.840> guard

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
armored guard

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.629 
armored guard
I<00:04:14.290> couldn't<00:04:14.650> spirk<00:04:14.920> ah<00:04:15.690> okay<00:04:16.690> we're<00:04:17.049> good<00:04:17.639> so

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
I couldn't spirk ah okay we're good so

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.949 
I couldn't spirk ah okay we're good so
we're<00:04:18.729> gonna<00:04:18.820> have<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:18.970> be<00:04:19.090> careful<00:04:19.389> there<00:04:19.509> so

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
we're gonna have to be careful there so

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.420 
we're gonna have to be careful there so
that<00:04:20.079> we<00:04:20.169> don't<00:04:20.289> waste<00:04:20.590> too<00:04:20.799> many<00:04:20.979> of<00:04:21.220> our

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
that we don't waste too many of our

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.469 
that we don't waste too many of our
troops<00:04:23.430> did<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.490> check<00:04:24.639> for<00:04:24.789> bombs<00:04:24.940> yet<00:04:25.090> no<00:04:25.449> I

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
troops did I check for bombs yet no I

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.900 
troops did I check for bombs yet no I
don't<00:04:25.750> think<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:25.960> did<00:04:26.020> all<00:04:26.320> right<00:04:27.009> so<00:04:27.250> let's<00:04:27.789> see

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
don't think I did all right so let's see

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.980 
don't think I did all right so let's see
if<00:04:27.970> we<00:04:28.060> can<00:04:28.180> fish<00:04:28.419> them<00:04:28.509> out<00:04:28.660> there's<00:04:28.930> one

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
if we can fish them out there's one

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.249 
if we can fish them out there's one
there's<00:04:29.860> another<00:04:29.979> one<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:32.220> third<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.699> fourth

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
there's another one a third and a fourth

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.050 
there's another one a third and a fourth
where's<00:04:35.259> the<00:04:35.440> fifth<00:04:35.650> one<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:36.190> think<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.910> last

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
where's the fifth one I think the last

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.879 
where's the fifth one I think the last
one<00:04:37.300> is<00:04:37.449> going<00:04:37.599> to<00:04:37.660> be<00:04:37.780> guarding<00:04:38.229> that<00:04:38.410> dark

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
one is going to be guarding that dark

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.300 
one is going to be guarding that dark
elixir<00:04:40.020> storage<00:04:41.020> so<00:04:41.889> we're<00:04:42.039> gonna<00:04:42.130> have<00:04:42.280> to

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
elixir storage so we're gonna have to

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.499 
elixir storage so we're gonna have to
eat<00:04:42.460> her<00:04:43.270> further<00:04:44.370> but<00:04:45.370> um<00:04:45.520> yeah<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.210> think<00:04:46.330> we

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
eat her further but um yeah I think we

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.570 
eat her further but um yeah I think we
should<00:04:46.660> be<00:04:46.750> good<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:46.990> go<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.320> take<00:04:48.250> out<00:04:48.400> these

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
should be good to go and take out these

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.180 
should be good to go and take out these
heroes<00:04:48.910> then<00:04:49.150> start<00:04:49.599> our<00:04:49.720> attack<00:04:49.840> so<00:04:50.710> we<00:04:50.979> check

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
heroes then start our attack so we check

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.159 
heroes then start our attack so we check
for<00:04:51.220> bombs<00:04:51.520> over<00:04:51.729> here<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.150> we<00:04:52.509> took<00:04:52.750> out<00:04:52.930> the

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
for bombs over here and we took out the

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.860 
for bombs over here and we took out the
Splash<00:04:53.470> Damage<00:04:53.500> so<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.430> think<00:04:54.729> this<00:04:55.030> should<00:04:55.810> be

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
Splash Damage so I think this should be

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.010 
Splash Damage so I think this should be
a<00:04:55.990> good<00:04:56.199> spot<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.710> drop<00:04:57.400> our<00:04:57.580> clan<00:04:57.789> castle<00:04:58.210> and

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
a good spot to drop our clan castle and

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.659 
a good spot to drop our clan castle and
there<00:04:59.440> were<00:04:59.500> a<00:04:59.560> few<00:04:59.620> little<00:04:59.979> bombs<00:05:00.130> but<00:05:00.400> we<00:05:00.520> got

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
there were a few little bombs but we got

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.420 
there were a few little bombs but we got
lucky<00:05:01.139> they<00:05:02.139> didn't<00:05:02.410> take<00:05:02.620> out<00:05:02.740> my<00:05:02.889> wizards

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
lucky they didn't take out my wizards

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.790 
lucky they didn't take out my wizards
out<00:05:03.789> of<00:05:03.940> it<00:05:04.060> yes<00:05:05.880> so<00:05:07.020> let<00:05:08.020> employ<00:05:08.349> a<00:05:08.409> few

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
out of it yes so let employ a few

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.510 
out of it yes so let employ a few
barbarians<00:05:09.729> over<00:05:10.539> here<00:05:11.039> but<00:05:13.320> I<00:05:14.370> think<00:05:15.370> we

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
barbarians over here but I think we

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.189 
barbarians over here but I think we
should<00:05:15.550> be<00:05:15.880> finding<00:05:16.150> them<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.780> there's

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
should be finding them and there's

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.689 
should be finding them and there's
Tesla's<00:05:17.590> at<00:05:17.680> the<00:05:17.800> top<00:05:17.979> you've<00:05:18.250> always<00:05:18.430> gotta

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
Tesla's at the top you've always gotta

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.760 
Tesla's at the top you've always gotta
deploy<00:05:19.060> more<00:05:19.330> troops<00:05:19.659> and<00:05:19.990> Tesla's<00:05:20.409> pop-up

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
deploy more troops and Tesla's pop-up

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.100 
deploy more troops and Tesla's pop-up
because<00:05:21.159> they<00:05:21.430> can<00:05:21.610> take<00:05:22.449> out<00:05:22.599> your<00:05:22.750> barbs<00:05:23.050> and

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
because they can take out your barbs and

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.820 
because they can take out your barbs and
arteries<00:05:23.500> pretty<00:05:23.740> quickly<00:05:25.110> clan<00:05:26.110> castle<00:05:26.560> is

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
arteries pretty quickly clan castle is

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.890 
arteries pretty quickly clan castle is
towards<00:05:27.789> the<00:05:27.849> bottom<00:05:28.030> once<00:05:28.509> we<00:05:28.630> started

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
towards the bottom once we started

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.420 
towards the bottom once we started
attacking<00:05:29.139> the<00:05:29.349> bottom<00:05:29.740> then<00:05:29.949> you<00:05:29.979> might<00:05:30.310> have

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
attacking the bottom then you might have

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.610 
attacking the bottom then you might have
liked<00:05:30.639> them<00:05:30.820> but<00:05:31.509> I<00:05:31.780> think<00:05:31.960> we<00:05:32.229> should<00:05:32.409> be<00:05:32.530> okay

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
liked them but I think we should be okay

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.740 
liked them but I think we should be okay
so<00:05:33.580> it<00:05:33.639> looks<00:05:33.699> like<00:05:33.970> I<00:05:34.090> ran<00:05:34.240> out<00:05:34.419> of<00:05:34.449> troops

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
so it looks like I ran out of troops

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.870 
so it looks like I ran out of troops
prematurely<00:05:35.289> and<00:05:35.680> whenever<00:05:36.250> that<00:05:36.400> happens

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
prematurely and whenever that happens

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.760 
prematurely and whenever that happens
instead<00:05:37.389> of<00:05:37.509> sprinkling<00:05:37.930> your<00:05:38.020> troops<00:05:38.380> around

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
instead of sprinkling your troops around

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.489 
instead of sprinkling your troops around
the<00:05:38.979> rest<00:05:39.159> of<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.370> buildings<00:05:39.669> that<00:05:39.729> you

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:40.499 
the rest of the buildings that you

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:42.769 
the rest of the buildings that you
you<00:05:40.889> want<00:05:41.039> to<00:05:41.099> bunch<00:05:41.279> them<00:05:41.340> up<00:05:41.520> on<00:05:41.669> one<00:05:41.879> side<00:05:42.120> so

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:42.779 
you want to bunch them up on one side so

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.330 
you want to bunch them up on one side so
that<00:05:42.810> leaves<00:05:43.139> me<00:05:43.289> four<00:05:43.590> buildings<00:05:43.979> on<00:05:44.129> this

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
that leaves me four buildings on this

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.640 
that leaves me four buildings on this
left<00:05:44.610> side<00:05:44.819> to<00:05:45.419> drop<00:05:45.719> my<00:05:45.840> barbarian<00:05:46.199> King<00:05:46.469> on

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
left side to drop my barbarian King on

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.589 
left side to drop my barbarian King on
and<00:05:46.889> he<00:05:47.490> can<00:05:47.639> give<00:05:47.759> me<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:47.999> remaining

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
and he can give me the remaining

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.510 
and he can give me the remaining
percentage<00:05:48.990> all<00:05:49.979> right<00:05:50.069> so<00:05:50.249> now<00:05:50.370> I'm<00:05:50.430> gonna
