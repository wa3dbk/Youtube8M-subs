00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
school for four years and this is it I

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.660 
school for four years and this is it I
thought<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.049> was<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.200> pretty<00:02:56.349> good<00:02:56.560> balance<00:02:56.709> but

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
thought it was a pretty good balance but

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.900 
thought it was a pretty good balance but
you<00:02:58.239> know<00:02:58.359> for<00:02:58.569> our<00:02:58.660> kids<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:59.760> think<00:03:00.760> what's

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
you know for our kids I think what's

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.309 
you know for our kids I think what's
most<00:03:01.000> important<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:01.569> that<00:03:01.599> they<00:03:01.810> have<00:03:01.989> they

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
most important is that they have they

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.229 
most important is that they have they
like<00:03:02.530> tennis<00:03:03.010> or<00:03:03.310> whichever<00:03:03.730> sport<00:03:04.090> they

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
like tennis or whichever sport they

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.650 
like tennis or whichever sport they
choose<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.840> hopefully<00:03:05.440> play<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:07.329> know<00:03:07.480> a
