haven't seen my other videos on the
blood<00:00:44.670> mod<00:00:44.909> basically<00:00:45.839> what<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.050> does<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.710> adds

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
blood mod basically what it does is adds

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.350 
blood mod basically what it does is adds
blood<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.239> your<00:00:48.270> game<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.649> hit<00:00:49.800> mobs

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
blood to your game so when you hit mobs

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
blood to your game so when you hit mobs
they<00:00:51.360> will<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.289> trail<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.649> blood<00:00:53.129> behind

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
they will have a trail of blood behind

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.569 
they will have a trail of blood behind
them<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.510> will<00:00:54.719> slowly<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.920> less<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.250> less

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
them that will slowly get less and less

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.380 
them that will slowly get less and less
as<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.930> go<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.739> i<00:00:59.730> think<00:01:00.000> that's<00:01:00.210> really

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
as they go on and i think that's really

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.070 
as they go on and i think that's really
cool<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.050> will<00:01:02.059> eventually<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.539> disappear

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
cool it will eventually just disappear

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.430 
cool it will eventually just disappear
into<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.289> ground<00:01:04.619> over<00:01:05.039> time<00:01:05.479> but<00:01:06.479> i<00:01:06.539> think<00:01:07.350> it

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
into the ground over time but i think it

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.050 
into the ground over time but i think it
looks<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:07.649> cool<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.160> it<00:01:08.610> adds<00:01:08.789> a<00:01:08.910> really

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
looks really cool and it adds a really

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.930 
looks really cool and it adds a really
nice<00:01:09.300> effect<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.140> game<00:01:10.440> makes<00:01:11.399> combat

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
nice effect to your game makes combat

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.749 
nice effect to your game makes combat
look<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.210> little<00:01:12.360> bit<00:01:12.570> more<00:01:12.750> realistic<00:01:13.759> as

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
look a little bit more realistic as

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.620 
look a little bit more realistic as
realistic<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.660> can<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.070> Minecraft<00:01:17.070> but

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
realistic as it can be for Minecraft but

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.650 
realistic as it can be for Minecraft but
I<00:01:19.009> think<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.220> really<00:01:20.369> good<00:01:20.630> addition<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
I think it's a really good addition to

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.779 
I think it's a really good addition to
the<00:01:21.869> game<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.410> it's<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.709> small<00:01:22.979> change<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
the game and it's a small change so it

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.719 
the game and it's a small change so it
pairs<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:24.300> with<00:01:24.360> lots<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.840> other<00:01:25.050> mods<00:01:25.729> but

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
pairs well with lots of other mods but

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.969 
pairs well with lots of other mods but
um<00:01:26.910> I'll<00:01:27.810> show<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.170> now<00:01:28.470> some<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
um I'll show you now some of the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.690 
um I'll show you now some of the
different<00:01:29.340> types<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.880> blood<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.959> has

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
different types of blood that it has

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.089 
different types of blood that it has
animals<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:33.509> pigs<00:01:34.190> chickens<00:01:36.410> cows<00:01:37.410> sheep

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:38.099 
animals like pigs chickens cows sheep

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.740 
animals like pigs chickens cows sheep
they<00:01:38.849> all<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.300> just<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.840> normal<00:01:40.259> red<00:01:40.530> blood

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
they all have just the normal red blood

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.729 
they all have just the normal red blood
same<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.959> the<00:01:43.110> zombies<00:01:45.140> skeletons<00:01:46.140> don't

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:46.739 
same with the zombies skeletons don't

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:48.740 
same with the zombies skeletons don't
really<00:01:46.979> give<00:01:47.160> off<00:01:47.369> blood<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:48.179> just<00:01:48.390> give<00:01:48.539> off

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
really give off blood they just give off

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.410 
really give off blood they just give off
chips<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.289> bone<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.890> fly<00:01:50.160> off<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.090> form<00:01:51.300> of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
chips a bone that fly off in the form of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.050 
chips a bone that fly off in the form of
white<00:01:51.690> particles<00:01:52.280> in<00:01:53.280> case<00:01:53.459> you<00:01:53.610> didn't<00:01:53.880> see

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
white particles in case you didn't see

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.059 
white particles in case you didn't see
that<00:01:54.090> because<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.200> fire<00:01:55.470> will<00:01:55.739> take

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
that because of the fire will take

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.729 
that because of the fire will take
another<00:01:56.340> look<00:01:56.690> white<00:01:57.690> particles<00:01:58.110> fly<00:01:58.530> off

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739 
another look white particles fly off

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.779 
another look white particles fly off
just<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.429> chips<00:01:59.910> of<00:02:00.149> bones<00:02:01.280> then<00:02:02.280> let's<00:02:02.489> take

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
just like chips of bones then let's take

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.279 
just like chips of bones then let's take
a<00:02:02.819> look<00:02:03.149> at<00:02:03.330> spider<00:02:04.050> blood<00:02:04.440> which<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.250> green

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
a look at spider blood which is green

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.650 
a look at spider blood which is green
now<00:02:07.289> I'll<00:02:07.770> no<00:02:08.369> spiders<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:09.000> green<00:02:09.300> blood<00:02:09.539> in

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
now I'll no spiders have green blood in

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.869 
now I'll no spiders have green blood in
real<00:02:09.840> life<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.200> think<00:02:10.470> they<00:02:10.679> do<00:02:10.739> but<00:02:11.459> either<00:02:11.610> way

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
real life I think they do but either way

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.640 
real life I think they do but either way
I<00:02:11.910> think<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.330> looks<00:02:12.510> really<00:02:12.569> cool<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.410> game

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
I think it looks really cool in the game

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.199 
I think it looks really cool in the game
so<00:02:14.520> spiders<00:02:15.090> have<00:02:15.420> green<00:02:16.110> blood<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:17.209> creepers

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
so spiders have green blood and creepers

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.570 
so spiders have green blood and creepers
don't<00:02:18.810> really<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.319> blood<00:02:19.680> at<00:02:19.860> all<00:02:19.980> they<00:02:20.400> just

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
don't really have blood at all they just

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.209 
don't really have blood at all they just
give<00:02:20.730> off<00:02:20.940> puffs<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.540> smoke<00:02:21.859> which<00:02:22.859> would<00:02:23.069> make

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
give off puffs of smoke which would make

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.660 
give off puffs of smoke which would make
sense<00:02:23.489> because<00:02:23.700> they<00:02:23.939> are<00:02:24.060> full<00:02:24.329> of<00:02:24.450> gunpowder

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
sense because they are full of gunpowder

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.060 
sense because they are full of gunpowder
mushrooms<00:02:26.670> give<00:02:27.570> off<00:02:27.780> normal<00:02:28.260> blood<00:02:28.500> just

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
mushrooms give off normal blood just

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.340 
mushrooms give off normal blood just
like<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.460> normal<00:02:29.610> cows<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.480> other<00:02:30.810> animals

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
like the normal cows and other animals

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.820 
like the normal cows and other animals
do<00:02:32.030> slimes<00:02:33.030> don't<00:02:33.630> have<00:02:33.840> blood<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.620> just

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
do slimes don't have blood they just

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.430 
do slimes don't have blood they just
give<00:02:35.010> off<00:02:35.220> green<00:02:35.670> chunks<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.240> slime<00:02:36.660> which

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
give off green chunks of slime which

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.680 
give off green chunks of slime which
makes<00:02:37.980> sense<00:02:38.250> because<00:02:38.430> that's<00:02:39.390> what<00:02:39.540> they're

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
makes sense because that's what they're

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.540 
makes sense because that's what they're
made<00:02:39.840> out<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:42.230> cave<00:02:43.230> spiders<00:02:43.860> just<00:02:44.220> like<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
made out of cave spiders just like the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.820 
made out of cave spiders just like the
other<00:02:44.700> spiders<00:02:45.150> give<00:02:45.750> off<00:02:45.960> green<00:02:46.440> blood

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
other spiders give off green blood

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.190 
other spiders give off green blood
endermen<00:02:49.830> give<00:02:50.280> off<00:02:50.490> purple<00:02:51.000> blood<00:02:51.240> before

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
endermen give off purple blood before

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.730 
endermen give off purple blood before
they<00:02:52.530> teleport<00:02:53.070> away<00:02:55.730> wolves<00:02:57.320> zombie<00:02:58.320> pigmen

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
they teleport away wolves zombie pigmen

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.760 
they teleport away wolves zombie pigmen
and<00:02:59.010> villagers<00:02:59.820> all<00:03:00.300> have<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.050> normal<00:03:01.290> red

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
and villagers all have the normal red

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.390 
and villagers all have the normal red
blood<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.830> blaze<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:06.260> magma<00:03:07.260> cubes<00:03:07.590> will

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
blood the blaze and magma cubes will

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.750 
blood the blaze and magma cubes will
bleed<00:03:08.670> orange<00:03:09.230> which<00:03:10.230> off<00:03:10.500> makes<00:03:11.430> sense

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
bleed orange which off makes sense

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.880 
bleed orange which off makes sense
because<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.180> magma<00:03:12.510> cubes<00:03:12.810> are<00:03:13.110> made<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.590> lava

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
because the magma cubes are made of lava

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.650 
because the magma cubes are made of lava
so<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.550> makes<00:03:14.760> sense<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.150> they<00:03:15.240> would<00:03:15.330> bleed

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
so it makes sense that they would bleed

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.280 
so it makes sense that they would bleed
orange<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:17.010> blaze<00:03:17.250> are<00:03:17.550> fiery<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.990> that

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
orange and the blaze are fiery so that

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.320 
orange and the blaze are fiery so that
makes<00:03:19.500> sense<00:03:19.590> for<00:03:19.950> them<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.760> really<00:03:21.150> like

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
makes sense for them to so I really like

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.220 
makes sense for them to so I really like
that<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:23.310> guests<00:03:24.060> don't<00:03:24.780> really<00:03:25.080> give

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
that and the guests don't really give

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.860 
that and the guests don't really give
off<00:03:25.380> any<00:03:25.620> blood<00:03:26.040> because<00:03:26.970> they<00:03:27.270> are<00:03:27.450> ghosts

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
off any blood because they are ghosts

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.840 
off any blood because they are ghosts
like<00:03:28.140> things<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:29.010> would<00:03:29.160> make<00:03:29.190> sense<00:03:29.400> that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
like things so it would make sense that

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.170 
like things so it would make sense that
they<00:03:30.120> wouldn't<00:03:30.360> bleed<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.790> last<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:32.940> not

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
they wouldn't bleed and last but not

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.770 
they wouldn't bleed and last but not
least<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.750> squid<00:03:34.280> which<00:03:35.280> gives<00:03:36.090> off<00:03:36.300> normal

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
least the squid which gives off normal

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.630 
least the squid which gives off normal
blood<00:03:36.990> but<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.290> can<00:03:37.440> see<00:03:37.710> here<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.400> blood

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
blood but you can see here the blood

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.610 
blood but you can see here the blood
will<00:03:38.850> actually<00:03:39.300> float<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.930> surface<00:03:40.260> of

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
will actually float on the surface of

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.890 
will actually float on the surface of
the<00:03:40.800> water<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.340> give<00:03:42.060> off<00:03:42.210> little<00:03:42.540> wave

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
the water and give off little wave

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.100 
the water and give off little wave
effects<00:03:43.440> like<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.430> waves<00:03:44.670> are<00:03:44.970> rippling<00:03:45.540> full

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
effects like the waves are rippling full

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.010 
effects like the waves are rippling full
of<00:03:46.380> blood<00:03:46.940> which<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.060> think<00:03:48.270> looks<00:03:48.330> pretty<00:03:48.810> cool

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
of blood which I think looks pretty cool

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.060 
of blood which I think looks pretty cool
and<00:03:49.380> then<00:03:49.770> it<00:03:49.920> will<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.100> fade<00:03:50.730> away<00:03:50.760> slowly

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
and then it will just fade away slowly

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.550 
and then it will just fade away slowly
but<00:03:53.070> not<00:03:53.220> only<00:03:53.670> mobs<00:03:54.030> bleed<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:54.960> mod<00:03:55.230> now

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
but not only mobs bleed in this mod now

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.580 
but not only mobs bleed in this mod now
the<00:03:56.220> player<00:03:56.490> will<00:03:56.730> actually<00:03:57.150> bleed<00:03:57.450> too<00:03:57.750> so

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
the player will actually bleed too so

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.040 
the player will actually bleed too so
when<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:58.980> get<00:03:59.130> hit<00:03:59.400> by<00:03:59.760> mobs<00:04:00.060> like<00:04:00.330> skeletons

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
when you get hit by mobs like skeletons

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.820 
when you get hit by mobs like skeletons
and<00:04:01.350> zombies<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:03.000> whatever<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:04.290> will<00:04:04.440> bleed

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
and zombies and whatever you will bleed

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.240 
and zombies and whatever you will bleed
and<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:06.000> can<00:04:06.150> actually<00:04:06.360> see<00:04:07.040> once<00:04:08.040> your

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
and you can actually see once your

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.930 
and you can actually see once your
health<00:04:08.490> gets<00:04:08.820> low<00:04:09.210> enough<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:10.350> will<00:04:10.500> have<00:04:10.740> a

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
health gets low enough you will have a

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.890 
health gets low enough you will have a
blood<00:04:11.940> coming<00:04:12.390> from<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.750> constantly<00:04:13.410> and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
blood coming from you constantly and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.270 
blood coming from you constantly and
wherever<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.200> walk<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.739> will<00:04:16.920> leave<00:04:17.100> a

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
wherever you walk you will leave a

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.150 
wherever you walk you will leave a
little<00:04:17.460> trail<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:18.150> blood<00:04:18.510> so<00:04:19.410> let's<00:04:19.620> head<00:04:19.920> down

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
little trail of blood so let's head down

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.470 
little trail of blood so let's head down
into<00:04:20.520> here<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:22.400> you<00:04:23.400> will<00:04:23.550> continue<00:04:23.790> to<00:04:24.120> bleed

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
into here and you will continue to bleed

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.010 
into here and you will continue to bleed
until<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:25.740> heal<00:04:26.100> up<00:04:26.340> past<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.570> certain<00:04:27.840> point

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
until you heal up past a certain point

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.330 
until you heal up past a certain point
I'm<00:04:28.410> not<00:04:28.560> exactly<00:04:29.010> sure<00:04:30.770> when<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.920> will<00:04:32.040> stop

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
I'm not exactly sure when you will stop

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.280 
I'm not exactly sure when you will stop
bleeding<00:04:32.640> if<00:04:32.940> it's<00:04:33.060> half<00:04:33.300> health<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:34.110> looks

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
bleeding if it's half health it looks

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.040 
bleeding if it's half health it looks
like<00:04:34.500> it's<00:04:34.710> about<00:04:34.950> half<00:04:35.220> health<00:04:36.020> you<00:04:37.020> will

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
like it's about half health you will

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.730 
like it's about half health you will
stop<00:04:37.440> bleeding<00:04:37.770> but<00:04:38.490> I

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
stop bleeding but I

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.980 
stop bleeding but I
that's<00:04:38.949> pretty<00:04:39.220> cool<00:04:40.889> so<00:04:41.889> now<00:04:42.789> when<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.870> are

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
that's pretty cool so now when you are

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.080 
that's pretty cool so now when you are
below<00:04:44.349> half<00:04:44.620> health<00:04:44.949> you<00:04:45.729> will<00:04:45.880> actually

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
below half health you will actually

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.409 
below half health you will actually
bleed<00:04:46.720> and<00:04:47.020> have<00:04:47.199> blood<00:04:47.889> sort<00:04:48.880> of<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.210> your

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
bleed and have blood sort of on your

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.920 
bleed and have blood sort of on your
screen<00:04:50.039> so<00:04:51.039> I<00:04:51.069> really<00:04:52.030> like<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.270> that's<00:04:52.750> one

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930

it's a nice little addition to

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.200 
it's a nice little addition to
everything<00:04:58.710> ah<00:04:59.710> one<00:05:00.190> thing<00:05:00.460> about<00:05:00.490> this<00:05:00.910> mod

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
everything ah one thing about this mod

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.140 
everything ah one thing about this mod
is<00:05:01.240> it<00:05:01.720> is<00:05:01.870> SMP<00:05:02.620> compatible<00:05:03.370> so<00:05:03.550> you<00:05:03.610> can<00:05:03.880> play

blood<00:05:07.090> mod<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:08.650> think<00:05:09.069> it<00:05:09.190> goes<00:05:09.340> really

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
blood mod and I think it goes really

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.580 
blood mod and I think it goes really
well<00:05:09.880> with<00:05:09.940> a<00:05:10.210> lot<00:05:10.449> of<00:05:10.479> other<00:05:10.870> types<00:05:11.169> of<00:05:11.380> mods

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
well with a lot of other types of mods

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.610 
well with a lot of other types of mods

where you're like fighting like anything

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.649 
where you're like fighting like anything
with<00:05:14.889> a<00:05:15.300> battles<00:05:16.300> or<00:05:16.630> like<00:05:16.930> gun<00:05:17.319> mods<00:05:18.659> those

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
with a battles or like gun mods those

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:20.999 
with a battles or like gun mods those
would<00:05:19.930> look<00:05:19.960> really<00:05:20.259> cool<00:05:20.409> if<00:05:20.770> you<00:05:20.860> have

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
would look really cool if you have

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.279 
would look really cool if you have
bloody<00:05:21.460> gun<00:05:21.819> battles<00:05:22.330> with<00:05:22.539> your<00:05:22.690> friends<00:05:23.139> on

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
bloody gun battles with your friends on

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.379 
bloody gun battles with your friends on
servers<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.009> everything<00:05:24.310> so<00:05:25.090> there<00:05:25.270> are<00:05:25.300> a

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
servers and everything so there are a

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.360 
servers and everything so there are a
lot<00:05:25.539> of<00:05:25.569> really<00:05:25.870> cool<00:05:25.900> uses<00:05:26.289> for<00:05:26.620> this<00:05:26.740> mod<00:05:27.009> and

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
lot of really cool uses for this mod and

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.580 
lot of really cool uses for this mod and
I<00:05:27.449> think<00:05:28.449> it<00:05:28.569> goes<00:05:28.750> well<00:05:28.990> with<00:05:29.169> pretty<00:05:29.440> much

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
I think it goes well with pretty much

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.439 
I think it goes well with pretty much
everything<00:05:29.919> because<00:05:30.340> it<00:05:30.520> just<00:05:30.880> adds<00:05:31.150> a<00:05:31.270> little

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
everything because it just adds a little

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.689 
everything because it just adds a little
change<00:05:31.900> to<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.229> game<00:05:32.470> that<00:05:33.069> I<00:05:33.099> think<00:05:33.430> just

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
change to the game that I think just

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.610 
change to the game that I think just
improves<00:05:34.270> it<00:05:34.479> overall<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:35.080> makes<00:05:35.259> it<00:05:35.380> look<00:05:35.409> a

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
improves it overall and makes it look a

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.450 
improves it overall and makes it look a
lot<00:05:35.740> better<00:05:36.300> so<00:05:37.300> that<00:05:37.930> is<00:05:38.289> the<00:05:38.319> blood<00:05:38.830> mod<00:05:39.069> I

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
lot better so that is the blood mod I

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.790 
lot better so that is the blood mod I
