this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.290> going<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.589> be<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.920> quick<00:00:02.220> update<00:00:02.429> on

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.110 
this is going to be a quick update on

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.499 
this is going to be a quick update on
this<00:00:04.110> red<00:00:04.410> container<00:00:04.799> trader<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:06.180> might

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
this red container trader you might

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.620 
this red container trader you might
remember<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:07.140> my<00:00:07.830> last<00:00:08.040> video<00:00:08.490> where<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:08.970> go

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
remember in my last video where I go

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.499 
remember in my last video where I go
through<00:00:09.660> all<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.260> mechanism<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:11.509> the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
through all of the mechanism that the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.620 
through all of the mechanism that the
legs<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:13.200> bit<00:00:13.700> floppy<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.880> then<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.240> say<00:00:15.389> that

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
legs a bit floppy and then I say that

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.420 
legs a bit floppy and then I say that
you<00:00:15.750> can<00:00:15.900> just<00:00:16.080> tighten<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:17.010> order<00:00:17.160> to

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
you can just tighten it here in order to

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.779 
you can just tighten it here in order to
make<00:00:17.910> them<00:00:18.060> more<00:00:18.180> foam<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.039> lazy

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
make them more foam but that is a lazy

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.800 
make them more foam but that is a lazy
and<00:00:21.330> bad<00:00:21.990> solution<00:00:22.820> it's<00:00:23.820> not<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.060> way<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.510> make

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and bad solution it's not a way to make

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.900 
and bad solution it's not a way to make
this<00:00:25.260> trailer<00:00:25.619> work<00:00:25.859> perfectly<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.730> build

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
this trailer work perfectly is to build

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.269 
this trailer work perfectly is to build
this<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:28.050> thing<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:30.920> what<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.070> pretty

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
this little thing it is a what is pretty

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.069 
this little thing it is a what is pretty
much<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.780> this<00:00:33.780> gear<00:00:35.630> and<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.719> blue<00:00:36.899> pin<00:00:37.820> so

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
much just this gear and a blue pin so

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.889 
much just this gear and a blue pin so
anywhere<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:43.550> that's<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.840> now<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
anywhere is here and that's it now the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.610 
anywhere is here and that's it now the
legs<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.309> move<00:00:47.760> freely<00:00:48.000> anymore<00:00:48.620> what's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
legs will not move freely anymore what's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.380 
legs will not move freely anymore what's
the<00:00:50.430> mechanism<00:00:50.550> mister<00:00:51.300> works<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.239> I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the mechanism mister works so that if I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.450 
the mechanism mister works so that if I
go<00:00:54.570> forwards<00:00:55.910> this<00:00:56.910> mechanism<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> middle

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
go forwards this mechanism in the middle

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
go forwards this mechanism in the middle
then<00:00:59.460> make<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> leg<00:01:00.780> turn<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:02.000> this<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:04.680> know

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
then make the leg turn up this you know

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
then make the leg turn up this you know
it's<00:01:05.010> engaged<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:08.040> when<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.939> go<00:01:09.240> backwards

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
it's engaged and when you go backwards

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.260 
it's engaged and when you go backwards
the<00:01:10.590> legs<00:01:10.799> don't<00:01:11.010> immediately<00:01:11.280> go<00:01:11.760> down<00:01:11.970> like

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the legs don't immediately go down like

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.320 
the legs don't immediately go down like
before<00:01:12.740> unless<00:01:13.740> your<00:01:13.920> Technic<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.670> now<00:01:15.119> you'd

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
before unless your Technic but now you'd

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880 
before unless your Technic but now you'd
have<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.570> wait<00:01:15.780> until<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.290> didn't<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.650> just

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
have to wait until they didn't get just

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.870 
have to wait until they didn't get just
and<00:01:17.070> also<00:01:17.369> go<00:01:17.549> down<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.770> well<00:01:19.770> that's<00:01:20.040> pretty

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and also go down and well that's pretty

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.410 
and also go down and well that's pretty
much<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:22.159> if<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.549> trouble<00:01:23.970> making<00:01:24.000> this

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
much it if you have trouble making this

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.899 
much it if you have trouble making this
mechanism<00:01:25.020> work<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.100> make<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.790> yourself

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
mechanism work if you make one yourself

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.539 
mechanism work if you make one yourself
then<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.110> might<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.439> want<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.829> replace<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
then you might just want to replace the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.240 
then you might just want to replace the
blue<00:01:29.820> pin<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.350> make<00:01:31.560> me<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:31.860> nice<00:01:32.009> here

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
blue pin in this make me so nice here

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.330 
blue pin in this make me so nice here
with<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.560> add<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.740> down<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.159> so

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
with the one that I add it down here so

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.440 
with the one that I add it down here so
you<00:01:36.000> see<00:01:36.500> this<00:01:37.500> blue<00:01:37.799> pin<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.729> friction

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you see this blue pin here as friction

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.920 
you see this blue pin here as friction
but<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> might<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:41.600> too<00:01:42.600> tight

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
but it might be if it's too tight

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.359 
but it might be if it's too tight
compared<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:44.040> everyone<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:46.009> in<00:01:47.009> here<00:01:47.340> I

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
compared to with everyone in in here I

00:01:47.369 --> 00:02:01.160 
compared to with everyone in in here I
can<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:49.820> here<00:01:56.299> this<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:59.390> if<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.630> one<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.990> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
can see here this one if this one is to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.109 
can see here this one if this one is to
do<00:02:01.380> stand<00:02:01.680> then<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.040> mechanism<00:02:02.250> doesn't<00:02:02.939> work

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
do stand then the mechanism doesn't work

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.749 
do stand then the mechanism doesn't work
so<00:02:05.119> it's<00:02:06.119> easy<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> replace<00:02:07.369> this<00:02:08.369> blue<00:02:08.580> one

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
so it's easy to replace this blue one

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.150 
so it's easy to replace this blue one
red

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
red

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:29.440 
red
the<00:02:10.580> one<00:02:10.790> in<00:02:10.910> here<00:02:11.500> no<00:02:12.500> I'll<00:02:12.770> just<00:02:28.270> let's<00:02:29.270> see

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
the one in here no I'll just let's see

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.390 
the one in here no I'll just let's see
if<00:02:29.690> it's<00:02:29.900> work<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.460> have<00:02:32.330> my<00:02:32.480> good<00:02:32.660> old

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
if it's work so I have my good old

00:02:33.400 --> 00:03:00.240 
if it's work so I have my good old
orange<00:02:34.400> truck<00:02:34.790> from

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.660 

now<00:03:00.850> going<00:03:01.060> forward<00:03:01.210> you<00:03:01.630> see<00:03:01.870> they<00:03:02.050> go<00:03:02.200> up<00:03:02.670> and

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
now going forward you see they go up and

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.100 
now going forward you see they go up and
when<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:03.940> reverse<00:03:06.330> closely<00:03:07.330> it's<00:03:07.480> easy<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.870> see

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
when I reverse closely it's easy to see

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.240 
when I reverse closely it's easy to see
I<00:03:09.390> have<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.570> reverse<00:03:10.900> quite<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:11.380> bit<00:03:11.650> before<00:03:11.890> the

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
I have to reverse quite a bit before the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:30.240 
I have to reverse quite a bit before the
legs<00:03:13.290> down<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.350> simple<00:03:29.530> update<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.130> the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
legs down so it's a simple update to the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.650 
legs down so it's a simple update to the
trainer<00:03:30.520> I've<00:03:30.820> already<00:03:31.240> updated<00:03:31.390> the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
trainer I've already updated the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.690 
trainer I've already updated the
instructions<00:03:32.560> where<00:03:32.890> so<00:03:33.040> I'm<00:03:33.100> adding<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.520> link

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
instructions where so I'm adding a link

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.670 
instructions where so I'm adding a link
for<00:03:33.910> blue<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.600> motion<00:03:34.930> making<00:03:35.110> a<00:03:35.320> reference

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
for blue and a motion making a reference

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.500 
for blue and a motion making a reference
to<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.070> old<00:03:36.220> video<00:03:36.610> so<00:03:36.790> you<00:03:36.880> can<00:03:37.000> see<00:03:37.060> all<00:03:37.480> of

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
to the old video so you can see all of

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.710 
to the old video so you can see all of
the<00:03:37.780> mechanism<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.790> truck<00:03:40.030> I'm<00:03:40.330> going<00:03:40.570> to

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
the mechanism and the truck I'm going to

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.690 
the mechanism and the truck I'm going to
add<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.260> link<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.590> that<00:03:41.800> one<00:03:41.950> as<00:03:42.160> well<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:42.400> that

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
add a link to that one as well so that

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.449 
add a link to that one as well so that
you<00:03:42.820> can<00:03:42.970> see<00:03:43.440> how<00:03:44.440> this<00:03:44.650> mechanism<00:03:45.640> works<00:03:47.459> yep

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
you can see how this mechanism works yep

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.360 
you can see how this mechanism works yep
that's<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.030> for<00:03:49.240> now
