00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:17.410
 of what is the motorola and since motor 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.780
 and since if we go to the sounds that 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.270
 we want for the ring tones then 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.750
 let's see what the factory ones are not going 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.270
 there is no option how to choose the song 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:33.220
 true then we have to choose the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.100
 predetermined as such then good 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.280
 let's 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.519
 make this change with an application 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.820
 very simple we go to plays thor in 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.920
 place thor let's find an explorer 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.690
 of files 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.149
 we look for the file explorer and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.870
 they do not leave these two options is the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.500
 case let's choose that file explorer and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.550
 then we choose it we install it we go 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.129
 to accept 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.280
 we wait for him to load and this 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.550
 it will practically allow us to see and 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.900
 see the files in which we have 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.030
 stored music and so power what is 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.220
 change the tone and choose our song 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:24.190
 our favorite tone on the call 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.270
 true then and good in this case 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.270
 let's take a look 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.890
 to what is the quick guide 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.130
 2 in this case the music will be here 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.900
 the folder with full music or it can be 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.420
 in bluetooth 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.700
 it's up to you to keep the music 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.570
 but that will allow them to be able to 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.180
 see the files true that they have the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.780
 folders since then default 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.560
 engine and bring it to us then let's 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.280
 change the ringtone 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.280
 we are going 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.720
 to the settings and then to sound 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.700
 true then the sound we choose the tone 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.690
 of call will come out that we're going to 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.940
 choose that explorer file true 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.980
 then only once do we go where 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.140
 music is stored music in 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.630
 this case is here in this folder 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.520
 music and let's choose the hello tone 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.610
