gonna<00:00:36.780> pick<00:00:36.960> three<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.380> four<00:00:37.680> stones<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.219> that

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
gonna pick three or four stones of that

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.569 
gonna pick three or four stones of that
to<00:00:38.579> start<00:00:38.850> me<00:00:38.969> off

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.169 

just<00:00:47.210> like<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:47.839> and<00:00:47.929> then<00:00:48.620> through<00:00:49.399> that<00:00:49.429> I'm

just like that and then through that I'm

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.560 
just like that and then through that I'm
gonna<00:00:50.510> add<00:00:50.780> cosmos<00:00:51.379> purity<00:00:51.920> just<00:00:52.820> tucked<00:00:53.179> into

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
gonna add cosmos purity just tucked into

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.410 
gonna add cosmos purity just tucked into
it<00:00:53.929> like<00:00:54.890> threading<00:00:55.519> it<00:00:55.760> through<00:00:55.789> a<00:00:56.089> sort<00:00:56.329> of

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
it like threading it through a sort of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.650 
it like threading it through a sort of
sieve

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.439 

I<00:01:02.690> always<00:01:03.289> have<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.530> rule<00:01:03.800> that<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:05.000> should<00:01:05.030> cut

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
I always have a rule that you should cut

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.149 
I always have a rule that you should cut
into<00:01:05.930> a<00:01:05.960> bucket<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.380> water<00:01:06.560> not<00:01:06.860> into<00:01:07.070> your

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
into a bucket of water not into your

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.910 
into a bucket of water not into your
hand<00:01:07.460> but<00:01:08.390> with<00:01:08.540> a<00:01:08.600> bridal<00:01:09.080> posy<00:01:09.380> you<00:01:09.530> kind<00:01:09.830> of

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
hand but with a bridal posy you kind of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.240 
hand but with a bridal posy you kind of
need<00:01:10.189> to<00:01:10.220> see<00:01:10.640> how<00:01:10.940> it's<00:01:11.119> how<00:01:11.509> it's<00:01:11.690> shaping

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
need to see how it's how it's shaping

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.630 
need to see how it's how it's shaping
and<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:13.820> I<00:01:14.090> am<00:01:14.299> breaking<00:01:14.750> my<00:01:14.900> own<00:01:15.049> rule<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.680> I'm

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
and so I am breaking my own rule and I'm

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.429 
and so I am breaking my own rule and I'm
just<00:01:16.880> threading<00:01:17.360> it<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:18.020> making<00:01:18.229> it

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
just threading it and making it

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.039 
just threading it and making it
literally<00:01:18.950> as<00:01:19.159> I<00:01:19.310> go<00:01:19.810> stripping<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.930> leaves

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
literally as I go stripping the leaves

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.680 
literally as I go stripping the leaves
stripping<00:01:21.680> any<00:01:21.940> side<00:01:22.940> shoots<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.479> don't

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
stripping any side shoots that I don't

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.230 
stripping any side shoots that I don't
need<00:01:24.039> just<00:01:25.039> gradually<00:01:25.490> building<00:01:25.880> up<00:01:26.060> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
need just gradually building up the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.880 
need just gradually building up the
structure<00:01:31.030> because<00:01:32.030> most<00:01:32.240> purity<00:01:32.830> is<00:01:33.830> a

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
structure because most purity is a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.760 
structure because most purity is a
half-hardy<00:01:34.520> annual<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.479> could<00:01:35.990> not<00:01:36.470> be

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
half-hardy annual and it could not be

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.800 
half-hardy annual and it could not be
easier<00:01:37.039> from<00:01:37.369> seed<00:01:37.610> with<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.360> bit<00:01:38.539> of<00:01:38.630> basil

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
easier from seed with a bit of basil

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.029 
easier from seed with a bit of basil
heat<00:01:39.550> in<00:01:40.550> a<00:01:40.700> propagator<00:01:41.179> you<00:01:41.600> can<00:01:41.750> actually<00:01:42.039> if

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
heat in a propagator you can actually if

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.279 
heat in a propagator you can actually if
you<00:01:43.190> sow<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.640> in<00:01:43.880> March<00:01:44.300> or<00:01:44.509> April<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.960> can<00:01:44.990> get

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
you sow it in March or April you can get

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.380 
you sow it in March or April you can get
it<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.530> germinate<00:01:46.009> practically<00:01:46.759> overnight<00:01:47.000> I

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
it to germinate practically overnight I

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.690 
it to germinate practically overnight I
mean<00:01:47.539> it<00:01:47.630> just<00:01:47.929> is<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:48.920> wonderful<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.610> it's

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
mean it just is it's wonderful and it's

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.540 
mean it just is it's wonderful and it's
incredibly<00:01:50.450> easy<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.929> grow<00:01:51.110> from<00:01:52.039> a<00:01:52.100> seedling

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
incredibly easy to grow from a seedling

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.300 
incredibly easy to grow from a seedling
as<00:01:52.700> well<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.899> it's<00:01:54.380> just<00:01:54.530> one<00:01:54.740> of<00:01:54.770> those<00:01:54.920> winter

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
as well so it's just one of those winter

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.240 
as well so it's just one of those winter
plants<00:01:55.850> that<00:01:56.539> is<00:01:56.690> very<00:01:56.960> stress-free<00:01:57.500> and

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
plants that is very stress-free and

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.419 
plants that is very stress-free and
gives<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.420> huge<00:02:00.020> quantities<00:02:00.860> of<00:02:00.890> cut<00:02:01.190> flower

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
gives you huge quantities of cut flower

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.730 
gives you huge quantities of cut flower
it<00:02:01.850> gives<00:02:02.060> us<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.899> highest<00:02:03.110> square<00:02:03.560> inch<00:02:03.679> of

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
it gives us the highest square inch of

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.910 
it gives us the highest square inch of
productivity<00:02:04.399> of<00:02:04.610> any<00:02:04.819> plant<00:02:05.149> that<00:02:05.240> we<00:02:05.450> grow

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
productivity of any plant that we grow

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:33.970 
productivity of any plant that we grow

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.369 

you're<00:02:34.489> just<00:02:34.700> threading<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.599> if<00:02:36.020> you<00:02:36.110> want<00:02:36.290> to

you're just threading it if you want to

you're just threading it if you want to

thread it through into the rest the

sieve of the rest and slot it in to fill
a<00:02:43.069> gap<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:44.209> so<00:02:44.450> I've<00:02:44.810> got<00:02:45.050> enough<00:02:45.440> there<00:02:45.709> now

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860
