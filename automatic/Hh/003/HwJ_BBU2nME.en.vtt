mouthful and I really think they could
give<00:00:13.289> it<00:00:13.320> something<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.769> little<00:00:13.889> more<00:00:14.010> snappy

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
to get from screen to screen but it just

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.370 
to get from screen to screen but it just
takes<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.820> few<00:01:04.850> days<00:01:05.030> of<00:01:05.360> fiddling<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:05.930> you'll

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
takes a few days of fiddling and you'll

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.640 
takes a few days of fiddling and you'll
learn<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.619> ins<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.009> outs<00:01:07.190> of<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.580> phone

as part of that it's got a little micro
SD<00:02:03.479> slot<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.070> extend<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.520> memory

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.310 

the<00:02:09.920> software<00:02:10.460> I<00:02:10.700> think<00:02:11.330> LEDs<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.690> down<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:11.930> tiny

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
the software I think LEDs it down a tiny

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.710 
the software I think LEDs it down a tiny
bit<00:02:12.590> it's<00:02:13.070> got<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> very<00:02:13.490> nice<00:02:13.730> screen<00:02:14.270> so<00:02:14.600> it

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
bit it's got a very nice screen so it

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.500 
bit it's got a very nice screen so it
shows<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.350> user<00:02:15.560> interface<00:02:15.770> very<00:02:16.310> well<00:02:16.580> but

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
shows the user interface very well but

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.010 
shows the user interface very well but
it's<00:02:17.600> clearly<00:02:18.760> designed<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.600> my<00:02:20.630> mind

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
it's clearly designed for in my mind

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.920 
it's clearly designed for in my mind
teenage<00:02:21.380> girls<00:02:21.680> it's<00:02:22.100> got<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.280> very<00:02:22.930> cartoony

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
feel the the default font looks like

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.050 
feel the the default font looks like
comics<00:02:27.500> sense<00:02:27.770> which<00:02:28.100> annoyed<00:02:28.460> me<00:02:28.700> endlessly

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
comics sense which annoyed me endlessly

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
and I had to change immediately but it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.500 
and I had to change immediately but it
does<00:02:33.800> what<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.130> needs<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.400> do<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.970> just<00:02:35.300> don't

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
does what it needs to do I just don't

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.770 
does what it needs to do I just don't
think<00:02:35.840> it's<00:02:35.960> got<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.140> business<00:02:36.380> person<00:02:36.830> in<00:02:37.070> mind

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
think it's got a business person in mind

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.300 
think it's got a business person in mind
probably<00:02:38.780> user<00:02:38.930> interface<00:02:39.410> perspective

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.540 

I<00:02:43.720> think<00:02:44.720> it's<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.989> great<00:02:45.170> little<00:02:45.470> design<00:02:45.980> phone

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
I think it's a great little design phone

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.400 
I think it's a great little design phone
it<00:02:46.849> fits<00:02:47.090> nicely<00:02:47.330> in<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.750> palm<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:47.959> your<00:02:48.110> hand

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
it fits nicely in the palm of your hand

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.080 
it fits nicely in the palm of your hand
it's<00:02:48.680> got<00:02:48.830> really<00:02:49.310> pretty<00:02:49.550> round<00:02:50.770> rounded

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
it's got really pretty round rounded

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.290 
it's got really pretty round rounded
edges<00:02:53.090> as<00:02:53.989> I<00:02:54.170> said<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.500> screen<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.300> really

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
edges as I said the screen is really

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.360 
edges as I said the screen is really
clear<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.860> crisp

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.990 

I'm<00:03:02.360> not<00:03:03.049> a<00:03:03.080> huge<00:03:03.319> fan<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.920> keyboard<00:03:04.400> it

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
I'm not a huge fan of the keyboard it

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.199 
I'm not a huge fan of the keyboard it
runs<00:03:05.390> on<00:03:05.870> these<00:03:06.680> little<00:03:06.860> bubble<00:03:07.489> keys<00:03:07.730> and

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
runs on these little bubble keys and

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.360 
runs on these little bubble keys and
it's<00:03:08.690> hard<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.049> get<00:03:09.200> up<00:03:09.230> any<00:03:09.440> real<00:03:09.680> piece<00:03:10.040> when

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
it's hard to get up any real piece when

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.869 
it's hard to get up any real piece when
you<00:03:10.549> when<00:03:11.150> you're<00:03:11.299> composing<00:03:11.599> messages

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
you when you're composing messages

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.039 
you when you're composing messages
they're<00:03:13.879> actually<00:03:14.269> very<00:03:14.299> similar<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.930> the

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
they're actually very similar to the

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.390 
they're actually very similar to the
kindle<00:03:16.659> keys<00:03:17.659> if<00:03:18.170> anyone's<00:03:18.739> used<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.040> second

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
kindle keys if anyone's used a second

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.789 
kindle keys if anyone's used a second

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
expected to rise a hell of a loss but if

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.910 
expected to rise a hell of a loss but if
you<00:03:25.670> are<00:03:25.760> say<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.390> 14<00:03:26.840> year<00:03:26.959> old<00:03:27.110> girl<00:03:27.200> using

you are say a 14 year old girl using
this<00:03:28.010> phone<00:03:28.280> you're<00:03:28.489> probably<00:03:28.760> going<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.329> be

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
this phone you're probably going to be

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.599 
this phone you're probably going to be
texting<00:03:29.720> day<00:03:30.620> in<00:03:30.829> an<00:03:30.950> art<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:32.540> i<00:03:32.989> think

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
texting day in an art and i think

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.250 
texting day in an art and i think
slightly<00:03:34.609> higher<00:03:35.000> megapixels<00:03:35.690> on<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.930> camera

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
slightly higher megapixels on the camera

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.199 
slightly higher megapixels on the camera
would<00:03:36.349> it<00:03:36.470> be<00:03:36.560> nice<00:03:36.799> especially<00:03:37.220> for<00:03:37.879> this<00:03:37.940> age

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
would it be nice especially for this age

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.449 
would it be nice especially for this age
gap<00:03:38.510> because<00:03:38.900> there<00:03:39.049> are<00:03:39.230> very<00:03:39.920> digitally

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
the design of the phone it feels very

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.699 
the design of the phone it feels very
high<00:03:57.040> end<00:03:57.340> but<00:03:57.580> it's<00:03:57.700> actually<00:03:58.260> under<00:03:59.260> two

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
high end but it's actually under two
