00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.679
 hello everyone with you palace and today I would 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:25.029
 I wanted to show after 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:28.609
 interesting traps so it looks 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:33.680
 us from the side you're so initial 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:37.309
 scheme troy based on what 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.670
 our rugs lie signs and when 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.149
 pressing the button moves porsche away 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.960
 knocks them all down but when I found out about the new 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.609
 bugs 172 everything has become much easier now 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:59.920
 Our Alushta language does not require anything 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:01:02.989
 she does not sharpen and quite and so 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.110
 required so that next to our rug 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.290
 Block was updated anything 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.330
 put fat on them or broke 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.130
 electronics has changed you defeat me 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.990
 for this we have our 2 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.730
 that is, when we press a button 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.270
 the position here is this block from from one 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.030
 from parts of the world is changing and happening 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.400
 update block first this pad 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.660
 then everything and everything falls amicably 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.900
 here it looks like 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.390
 build on a small bug 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.110
 so we need grass 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.150
 wars and bushes double flowers 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:50.210
 it can be not only flaws and he and 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.690
 Russian sprawling fern double 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.080
 high commodity and stuff and so on on 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.710
 awl do not set with do not do small 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.920
 ground platform 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:09.399
 And we will not leave our flowers only to us 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:15.490
 it remains to make it all ours 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:17.709
 rug like this and remove our roses 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.790
 the main thing that we cleaned 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:25.590
 not for the top block here and for the bottom one 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.739
 so we all remove them remove the ground 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.830
 another 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.700
 and everything and the trap is ready the pros 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.060
 trap the fact that it is very smooth 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.050
 not very cost effective at all 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.400
 and the fact that it is possible to have other forms of the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.739
 you can even have your whole room 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.250
 make 1 large pieces and office 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.140
 minute comforts or not a room he is 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.690
 not 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.140
 lines and throw on the floor in the general camp 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.319
 the floor 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.510
 broke down in any form and minus this 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.630
 that she is a one-time May and writes in 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.180
 settings and in general then this is all this 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.360
