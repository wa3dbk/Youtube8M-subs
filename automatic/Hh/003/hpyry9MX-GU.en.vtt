skinned in one is pretty awesome to me

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.610 
skinned in one is pretty awesome to me
but<00:06:36.030> I<00:06:36.270> could<00:06:36.449> see<00:06:36.690> some<00:06:36.930> people<00:06:37.080> thinking

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
but I could see some people thinking

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.950 
but I could see some people thinking
this<00:06:37.740> is<00:06:37.949> kind<00:06:38.310> of<00:06:38.400> a<00:06:38.490> hassle<00:06:38.669> having<00:06:39.240> soup

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
this is kind of a hassle having soup

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.559 
this is kind of a hassle having soup
I<00:06:39.990> don't<00:06:40.530> know<00:06:40.650> rub<00:06:40.889> every<00:06:41.160> kind<00:06:41.819> of<00:06:41.910> messy<00:06:42.300> but

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
I don't know rub every kind of messy but

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.540 
I don't know rub every kind of messy but
at<00:06:42.630> the<00:06:42.720> end<00:06:42.750> it's<00:06:43.169> really<00:06:43.319> worth<00:06:43.590> it<00:06:43.830> so<00:06:44.069> it's

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
at the end it's really worth it so it's

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.700 
at the end it's really worth it so it's
just<00:06:44.669> a<00:06:44.880> personal<00:06:45.300> thing<00:06:45.360> so<00:06:45.870> I<00:06:46.080> would

don't use not all natural products then

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.050 
don't use not all natural products then
it'll<00:06:55.650> take<00:06:55.860> a<00:06:55.889> little<00:06:56.130> bit<00:06:56.280> of<00:06:56.460> time<00:06:56.699> for<00:06:57.000> your

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
natural oils but I think in the long

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.909 
natural oils but I think in the long
term<00:07:02.729> it'll<00:07:03.030> really<00:07:03.569> benefit<00:07:04.199> your<00:07:04.289> skin<00:07:04.440> so<00:07:04.889> I
