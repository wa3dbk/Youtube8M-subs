00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
decision-making isn't as sharp and clear

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
decision-making isn't as sharp and clear
but<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.320> stuck<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.870> good<00:00:36.870> things<00:00:37.050> that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
so in a couple weeks on the old mine my

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.709 
so in a couple weeks on the old mine my
lab<00:00:43.620> results<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.250> other<00:00:44.879> thing<00:00:45.180> he<00:00:45.329> texted

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
lab results the other thing he texted

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.299 
lab results the other thing he texted
was<00:00:45.809> my<00:00:45.930> body<00:00:46.170> fat<00:00:46.379> percentage<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.160> is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
was my body fat percentage and this is

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.119 
was my body fat percentage and this is
huge<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:48.289> last<00:00:49.289> time<00:00:49.410> he<00:00:49.559> got<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.739> test<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
huge because last time he got a test it

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
huge because last time he got a test it
was<00:00:50.250> early<00:00:50.640> January<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.570> was<00:00:51.690> 23<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.199> a

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
was early January and I was 23 and a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.270 
was early January and I was 23 and a
half<00:00:52.260> percent<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.940> few<00:00:54.840> days<00:00:54.989> ago<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.320> got<00:00:55.829> tested

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
half percent a few days ago I got tested

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.010 
half percent a few days ago I got tested
and<00:00:56.399> they<00:00:56.640> tested<00:00:57.030> me<00:00:57.149> at<00:00:57.239> fourteen<00:00:57.690> point

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and they tested me at fourteen point

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.920 
and they tested me at fourteen point
nine<00:00:58.079> percent<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> that's<00:00:59.820> huge<00:01:00.180> my<00:01:00.449> progress

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930

last week I lost a pound and a half this

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.969 
last week I lost a pound and a half this
that<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:33.900> got<00:01:34.079> lost<00:01:34.369> over<00:01:35.369> five<00:01:35.610> pounds<00:01:36.150> but

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
that we got lost over five pounds but

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.789 
that we got lost over five pounds but
which<00:01:37.979> isn't<00:01:38.159> normal<00:01:38.990> but<00:01:39.990> I'll<00:01:40.530> take<00:01:40.740> it

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
which isn't normal but I'll take it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.620 
which isn't normal but I'll take it
because<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.520> was<00:01:41.640> starting<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.060> worried<00:01:42.390> after

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
because I was starting it worried after

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.060 
because I was starting it worried after
only<00:01:42.990> lost<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.259> pound<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> half<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.950> week

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
only lost a pound and a half the week

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
only lost a pound and a half the week
before<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.759> don't<00:01:45.299> plan<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.540> losing<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.960> much

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
before I don't plan on losing that much

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.770 
before I don't plan on losing that much
each<00:01:46.320> week<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.860> think<00:01:47.820> was<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.570> thing<00:01:48.720> that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
each week I think was one thing that

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.539 
each week I think was one thing that
played<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> factor<00:01:49.500> was<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.950> fact<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.399> had

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
played a factor was the fact that I had

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.990 
played a factor was the fact that I had
it<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.759> fasting<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.780> my<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:53.070> take<00:01:53.280> my<00:01:53.430> blood

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
it going fasting to my to take my blood

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.260 
it going fasting to my to take my blood
test<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.820> day<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.060> fasting

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
test and so that one day of fasting

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.480 
test and so that one day of fasting
probably<00:01:57.990> could<00:01:58.710> have<00:01:58.770> helped<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.430> that

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
probably could have helped out with that

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.580 
probably could have helped out with that
