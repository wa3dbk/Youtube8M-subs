change<00:03:13.100> in<00:03:13.340> progression<00:03:13.880> can<00:03:14.150> definitely

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
change in progression can definitely

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.810 
change in progression can definitely
make<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.780> track<00:03:15.080> engaging<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:16.550> particular

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
make a track engaging in this particular

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.060 
make a track engaging in this particular
case<00:03:17.269> I<00:03:17.540> actually<00:03:17.660> felt<00:03:18.140> like<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.590> broke<00:03:19.040> up

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
case I actually felt like it broke up

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.820 
case I actually felt like it broke up
the<00:03:19.250> momentum<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.120> song<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.630> at<00:03:21.470> no<00:03:21.800> point

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
the momentum of the song and at no point

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.580 
the momentum of the song and at no point
did<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.310> really<00:03:22.640> feel<00:03:22.880> like<00:03:22.910> things<00:03:23.390> got<00:03:23.690> going

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
did it really feel like things got going

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.759 
did it really feel like things got going
the<00:03:25.010> track<00:03:25.220> liars<00:03:25.580> slash<00:03:26.269> slash<00:03:26.720> trudge<00:03:27.380> is

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.160 
the track liars slash slash trudge is
this<00:03:28.430> moment<00:03:28.640> where<00:03:28.850> things<00:03:29.540> kind<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.840> quiet

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
this moment where things kind of quiet

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.370 
this moment where things kind of quiet
down<00:03:30.530> at<00:03:30.860> first<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:31.910> get<00:03:32.090> these<00:03:32.380> reverb

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
down at first you get these reverb

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.440 
down at first you get these reverb
guitars<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.250> sound<00:03:34.519> pretty<00:03:34.760> quiet<00:03:35.209> and

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
guitars that sound pretty quiet and

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.690 
guitars that sound pretty quiet and
these<00:03:35.660> distant<00:03:36.260> scream<00:03:36.650> vocals<00:03:37.220> kind<00:03:37.640> of

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
these distant scream vocals kind of

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.000 
these distant scream vocals kind of
obscured<00:03:38.239> behind<00:03:38.720> them<00:03:39.080> eventually<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.890> band

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
obscured behind them eventually the band

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.400 
obscured behind them eventually the band
goes<00:03:40.280> into<00:03:40.519> something<00:03:40.880> heavy<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.420> yet<00:03:42.140> again

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
goes into something heavy and yet again

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.380 
goes into something heavy and yet again
we<00:03:42.560> get<00:03:42.680> another<00:03:43.010> quiet<00:03:43.430> guitar<00:03:43.700> moment<00:03:44.299> this

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
we get another quiet guitar moment this

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.360 
we get another quiet guitar moment this
time<00:03:44.660> with<00:03:44.870> female<00:03:45.290> vocals<00:03:45.769> but<00:03:45.980> again

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
time with female vocals but again

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.940 
time with female vocals but again
distant<00:03:46.910> obscure<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:48.380> just<00:03:48.560> kind<00:03:48.709> of<00:03:48.739> felt

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
distant obscure it just kind of felt

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.500 
distant obscure it just kind of felt
like<00:03:48.980> several<00:03:49.310> different<00:03:49.459> ideas<00:03:50.000> that<00:03:50.180> happen

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
like several different ideas that happen

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.300 
like several different ideas that happen
to<00:03:50.630> make<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.810> on<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.080> same<00:03:51.290> track<00:03:51.620> in<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:52.070> sense

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
to make it on the same track in a sense

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.560 
to make it on the same track in a sense
I<00:03:52.459> kind<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.700> feel<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:52.970> same<00:03:53.000> way<00:03:53.269> about<00:03:53.299> the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
I kind of feel the same way about the

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.840 
I kind of feel the same way about the
song<00:03:53.750> colors<00:03:54.170> into<00:03:54.470> nothing<00:03:54.799> which<00:03:55.010> at<00:03:55.280> its

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
song colors into nothing which at its

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.569 
song colors into nothing which at its
start<00:03:56.209> with<00:03:56.630> some<00:03:57.049> more<00:03:57.230> very<00:03:57.500> serene<00:03:58.010> reverb

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
start with some more very serene reverb

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.670 
start with some more very serene reverb
guitars<00:03:59.060> feels<00:03:59.420> like<00:03:59.660> maybe<00:04:00.170> a<00:04:00.290> bit<00:04:00.560> of

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
guitars feels like maybe a bit of

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.099

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
it actually makes the track maybe a

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.800 
it actually makes the track maybe a
little<00:04:17.550> less<00:04:17.730> engaging<00:04:18.210> than<00:04:18.540> it<00:04:18.630> would<00:04:18.780> have

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810

the halfway point of this LP is actually
the<00:04:22.710> first<00:04:23.070> song<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.850> really<00:04:24.510> kind<00:04:24.720> of

would would definitely get into overall
I<00:05:15.420> just<00:05:15.450> thought<00:05:15.750> this<00:05:15.870> was<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.110> somewhat

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
I just thought this was a somewhat

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.760 
I just thought this was a somewhat
engaging<00:05:17.480> somewhat<00:05:18.480> solid<00:05:18.810> sludge<00:05:19.440> core

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
engaging somewhat solid sludge core

engaging somewhat solid sludge core
album<00:05:20.220> it's<00:05:20.730> a<00:05:20.850> style<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.240> I<00:05:21.420> feel<00:05:21.660> myself

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
album it's a style that I feel myself

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.050 
album it's a style that I feel myself
getting<00:05:22.170> more<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.830> more<00:05:22.890> kind<00:05:23.610> of<00:05:23.670> familiar

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
getting more and more kind of familiar

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.970 
getting more and more kind of familiar
with<00:05:24.270> more<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:24.690> more<00:05:24.840> used<00:05:25.170> to<00:05:25.380> so<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:25.650> kind<00:05:25.920> of

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
with more and more used to so I kind of

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.200 
with more and more used to so I kind of
looked<00:05:26.190> for<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.430> bands<00:05:26.610> that<00:05:26.730> continued<00:05:27.180> to

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
looked for the bands that continued to

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.320 
looked for the bands that continued to

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.840 
that I mean there's not much on this LP
that<00:05:35.850> they<00:05:36.150> didn't<00:05:36.420> already<00:05:36.570> do<00:05:36.900> on<00:05:37.190> their<00:05:38.190> EP

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
that they didn't already do on their EP

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.240 
that they didn't already do on their EP
stylistically<00:05:39.840> and<00:05:40.140> I<00:05:40.410> felt<00:05:40.650> like<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.890> vocals

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
stylistically and I felt like the vocals

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.290 
stylistically and I felt like the vocals
maybe<00:05:41.550> could<00:05:41.730> have<00:05:41.790> used<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.150> bit<00:05:42.270> more

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
maybe could have used a bit more

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.450 
maybe could have used a bit more
diversity<00:05:43.140> as<00:05:43.260> well<00:05:43.500> considering<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.430> fact

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
diversity as well considering the fact

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.820 
diversity as well considering the fact
that<00:05:44.670> there<00:05:44.880> are<00:05:44.940> two<00:05:45.180> vocalists<00:05:45.990> on<00:05:46.170> this<00:05:46.350> LP

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
that there are two vocalists on this LP

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.550 
that there are two vocalists on this LP
the<00:05:47.340> screams<00:05:47.730> sound<00:05:48.360> in<00:05:48.870> my<00:05:49.110> opinion<00:05:49.530> very

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
the screams sound in my opinion very

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.310 
the screams sound in my opinion very
similar<00:05:50.280> and<00:05:50.490> the<00:05:51.270> clean<00:05:51.570> singing<00:05:51.990> which

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
similar and the clean singing which

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.630 
similar and the clean singing which
which<00:05:52.560> was<00:05:52.770> a<00:05:52.800> nice<00:05:53.100> and<00:05:53.400> interesting

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
which was a nice and interesting

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.520 
which was a nice and interesting
addition<00:05:54.330> would<00:05:54.840> have<00:05:54.960> really<00:05:55.200> kind<00:05:55.410> of

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
addition would have really kind of

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.110 
addition would have really kind of
brought<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:55.920> album<00:05:56.280> a<00:05:56.430> little<00:05:56.790> something

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
brought the album a little something

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.460 
brought the album a little something
different<00:05:57.240> if<00:05:57.570> they<00:05:57.750> had<00:05:57.990> come<00:05:58.350> to<00:05:58.440> the

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
different if they had come to the

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.260 
different if they had come to the
forefront<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:59.130> bit<00:05:59.280> more<00:05:59.460> definitely<00:06:00.000> give<00:06:00.180> it
