well<00:02:33.790> little<00:02:34.210> little<00:02:34.720> difficult<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.110> continue

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
well little little difficult to continue

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.880 
well little little difficult to continue
go<00:02:35.620> there<00:02:36.010> yeah<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.260> course<00:02:38.440> this<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.770> like

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
go there yeah but of course this is like

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.630 
go there yeah but of course this is like
an<00:02:39.040> air<00:02:39.190> one<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:39.730> yeah<00:02:40.450> out<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.650> sky<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.190> you

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
an air one so yeah out in the sky so you

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.890 
an air one so yeah out in the sky so you
have<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.820> little<00:02:43.000> more<00:02:43.180> freedom<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.690> movement

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
have a little more freedom of movement

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.090 
have a little more freedom of movement
so<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.980> makes<00:02:45.670> sense<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:47.650> like<00:02:47.860> having

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
so it makes sense it's like having

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.220 
so it makes sense it's like having
vehicles<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.550> there<00:02:48.700> though<00:02:48.990> awesome<00:02:49.990> like
