00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 the gameboy advance can be said that the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.259
 second portable nintendo console that 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.389
 if it comes to remember you think in a 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.800
 Bob for his aesthetic so weird but 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.780
 also that you nostalgic memories 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.370
 about games that did not have the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.740
 better graphics and much less the best 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.230
 playability but the hours we spent 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.910
 brothers playing this console is not 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.010
 never forget since the gameboy advance 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.080
 has a large catalog of games and 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.740
 some horrible but others that are a 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:34.620
 Chair for video games which such 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.820
 quotas this is my top 10 of the best 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.820
 games of the game boy advance 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.719
 revel being tactical command is a game 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.610
 of role in turns to the very fire style 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.620
 emblem this game came to me for a 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.930
 exchange that I made with a child I would 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.909
 say 007 and the middle east at the beginning 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.190
 I did not understand much but then I 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.110
 loved it is about an elite army fight 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.850
 against different aliens you have to 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.350
 arm your team and take them to missions 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.390
 where you can equip them with rifles 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.530
 grenades knives or even weapons 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.360
 aliens 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.940
 You can also choose to be the Aryans 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.830
 to fight against humans is a 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.500
 very good game and it totally explodes 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.270
 your imagination I loved playing it in addition 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.310
 which has a somewhat high difficulty to 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.560
 revel be tactical command if thou 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.789
 you took to play I love you because very few 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.789
 you know this game 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.570
 super mario advance 4 osea super mario 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.460
 bros 3 we all know the game more 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.710
 popular from mario where he first came out 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.540
 Once the tanooki store this store that 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.590
 they use the foxes in the conventions 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.060
 to get attention 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.950
 this is a remake of the super nintendo 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.660
 What else can I say to explain 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.030
 maybe the most popular game mario 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.400
 it's just the super mario game 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.020
 bros 3 in the game boy advance is a 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.020
 fantastic mario experience 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.950
 the sims 2 version game boy advance 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.660
 well I am very faithful to the saga of the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.910
 sims can be said about all the old 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.520
 school of the sims 2 both in pc and 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.530
 on all of its platforms that came out and a 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.450
 of those was the game boy plus a game 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.070
 where you did your sims how you wanted and 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.750
 the beasts with what the game gave you 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.460
 the game tried to put us in the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.230
 shoes of someone who was hired 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.360
 for a television to take you to a 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.250
 people called the rarities the fans of 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.750
 the centuries know very well the joke is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.670
 that you should relate to the locals 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.500
 both helping them or doing them favors 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.510
 in style so that they are given 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.220
 hilarious situations that to the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.840
 viewers who see you find it 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.340
 fun the show the game is very 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.290
 fun and the characters with the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.330
 characteristics of the producers of 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.280
 maxis make the whole environment very 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.530
 catching the sims 2 for game boy 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.060
 advance was very fun and very good 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.060
 hours that I gave to this game 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.890
 megaman and you go to me in particular I 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.210
 Megaman love games and this one 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.580
 power by accident since I would 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.560
 I found at a bus station 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.270
 I never thought that I would initiate you so much is a 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.830
 remake of the super nintendo is like a 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.720
 mega man x but at the beginning of the game 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.640
 you can choose mega man with his 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.500
 limitations and supplies and movements 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.180
 different the story is the same as 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.800
 all mega plus a bad guy called 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.930
 night who wants to dominate the world with 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.730
 your henchmen you must pass each world and 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.680
 fight against their respective boss who at 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.500
 beat them will give you a suit or power 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.410
 special as fire or ice or do 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.210
 a complete and spend it cost me 4 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.550
 eggs and a half or as he had a game 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.550
 of megaman its difficulty is exquisite 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.690
 the legend of zelda minis cup the second 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.520
 game that I played cell and I loved it is 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.020
 same as all the link cells must 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.610
 rescue the princess zelda who was 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.650
 made stone by an enemy very well 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.420
 done here tells us about the minis a 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.100
 hidden secret town that only the 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.980
 children can see are little people 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.360
 tiny to the eyes minis cap takes us 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.670
 to an adventure of different scales 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.830
 where the dungeons and the enemies are 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.510
 very good and colorful of minis cap is 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.819
 a game that if you're a fan of the saga of 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.500
 zelda is elementary that you take care of it or 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.500
 you are simply a bitch 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.010
 the saga mega man but true 'network there 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.599
 many games of this mega man but you 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.879
 I appreciate saga since I have not played 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.709
 all but finished Majority 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.569
 game boy advance is another style 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.580
 totally different from megaman here 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.590
 we control the boy called land that 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.540
 has from electronic pet to mega man 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.549
 everyone in this world has a friend or 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.280
 electronic companion with those who 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.830
 they train and fight where they fight 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.479
 a style of cards but with chips do 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.389
 of account that is a pokÃ©mon spouse or 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.340
 with said and matrix each game has its 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.710
 story but the style of fights and the 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.539
 characters are the same I recommend them 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.270
 try some game of this saga that if 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.790
 they like pokemon or yuyo or digimon is 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.650
 very good 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.020
 the legend of zelda a link to the past 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.430
 another remake of the super nintendo and it was 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.500
 the game with which I entered the world of 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.419
 zelda and it cost me a lot of work and 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.190
 many hours to pass it also makes me 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.169
 absurd to tell you what this is about 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.580
 ancestor of zelda as it revolutionizes the 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.160
 saga a game that I have an appreciation 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.350
 because with him I entered this world called 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.389
 cell and that apart I learned that being from the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.980
 princess and not the protagonist and he does not 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.980
 I would say poor devil of cute 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.940
 Red Pokemon game the pokemon remake 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.100
 red but now also including the 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.780
 pokemons of the third generation and 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.880
 being the first remake of many that 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.800
 there is this game I love because it brings me 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.780
 memories of red pokemon and aside me 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.210
 love what you could do next 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.770
 to defeat the elite 4 and go for some 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.290
 missions to find stones like the 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.240
 emerald sapphire and ruby ââthat with them 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.500
 you could exchange pokemons with the 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.479
 new third generation 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.479
 one of my favorite pokemon games 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:40.349
 super mario advance 2 or super mario 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.330
 world the first game I had of the 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.400
 game boy advance and could not be better than 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.409
 super mario world my favorite game of 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.779
 mario until the time because it was a whole 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.069
 school for the mario that we see now is 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.319
 clear a remake of the super nintendo 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.150
 but now in the advance game boy where 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.129
 it appears for the first time I yes and that 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.779
 we can use the flying layer change what 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:00.120
 I like more than the outfit 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.499
 tanooki apart from having many secrets 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.599
 more than you hide from your parents 

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:06.060
 many missions and one difficulty 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:10.669
 cojonuda I must say that super mario 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.669
 I keep it completely in my heart 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.940
 6 although the little ones suffer it 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:20.200
 I 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.200
 the world 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.620
 when michael jackson 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:50.250
 emerald pokemon my favorite game of 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.050
 pokemon or if with the third generation and 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.300
 combining the stories of ruby ââpokemon 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.340
 and sapphire this game is a masterpiece 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.319
 of pokemon loved and adored by the 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.150
 most of the fans so much so they asked 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.430
 Shouting is already sacrificing women 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.810
 for the remake of the 3ds but this game 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.759
 is an example to follow that those of 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.500
 game should continue more because pokemon 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.419
 Emerald is good from the beginning 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.860
 until the end with many pokÃ©mon 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:13.379
 legendary to catch after 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.449
 beat the elite 4 and set aside the battle 

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:16.979
 of the border that was quite a challenge if 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.870
 you're a fan of pokemon, you know what 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:21.030
 I speak and know that Emerald Pokemon 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.740
 even if it is overrated it deserves to be 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.080
 named as one of the best games 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.639
