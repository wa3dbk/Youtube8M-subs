00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
one I had in for a month and I really

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.179 
one I had in for a month and I really
loved<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> curl<00:01:10.320> pattern<00:01:10.350> matches<00:01:11.010> my

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
loved that the curl pattern matches my

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.330 
loved that the curl pattern matches my
hair<00:01:11.369> exactly<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.720> was<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.799> tangling<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
hair exactly but it was just tangling a

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.490 
hair exactly but it was just tangling a
hot<00:01:14.549> mess<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.479> one<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.140> little<00:01:16.170> bit

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
hot mess and this one just a little bit

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.219 
hot mess and this one just a little bit
looser<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.070> more<00:01:17.159> matches<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:18.030> my<00:01:19.020> say

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
looser and more matches on my say

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.120 
looser and more matches on my say
individual<00:01:19.890> who<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.640> more<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.450> 3c<00:01:22.320> type<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
individual who is more of a 3c type of

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.420 
individual who is more of a 3c type of
texture<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.689> I'm<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.049> 3c<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
texture but because I'm a 3c for a and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.270 
texture but because I'm a 3c for a and
like<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.570> rest<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:28.020> my<00:01:28.200> hair<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> 4a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
like the rest of my hair is like a 4a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
like the rest of my hair is like a 4a
but<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.970> crown<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.570> my<00:01:30.659> hair<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.900> really

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
sections on my entire head the only

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.960 
sections on my entire head the only
problem<00:03:44.739> that<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:44.890> have<00:03:45.100> with<00:03:45.130> this<00:03:45.489> here<00:03:45.820> is

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
problem that I have with this here is

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.540 
problem that I have with this here is
that<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.750> nape<00:03:47.019> does<00:03:47.410> matte<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.280> does

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
that the nape does matte and it does

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.540 
that the nape does matte and it does
tangle<00:03:49.150> so<00:03:49.720> that's<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.470> only<00:03:50.800> part<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.430> my

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
tangle so that's the only part of my

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.820 
tangle so that's the only part of my
hair<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:51.880> have<00:03:52.000> a<00:03:52.030> hard<00:03:52.300> time<00:03:52.830> detangling

you get this tight curl pattern that

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.050 
you get this tight curl pattern that
you'll<00:04:37.840> see<00:04:38.110> here<00:04:38.140> is<00:04:38.590> actually<00:04:39.310> my<00:04:39.520> Denman

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
brush and I'll just go ahead and zoom in

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.810 
brush and I'll just go ahead and zoom in
for<00:04:44.170> you<00:04:44.230> guys<00:04:44.320> so<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:44.860> guys<00:04:45.040> can<00:04:45.220> kind<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.490> see

for you guys so you guys can kind of see
what<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.840> curl<00:04:47.080> patterns<00:04:47.590> like<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:49.360> this

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
what the curl patterns like so this

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.000 
what the curl patterns like so this
aren't<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.720> curl<00:04:49.990> patterns<00:04:50.470> like<00:04:52.650> um<00:04:53.650> it's<00:04:53.890> a

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
aren't the curl patterns like um it's a

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.920 
aren't the curl patterns like um it's a
little<00:04:54.190> bit<00:04:54.490> frizzy<00:04:54.820> cuz<00:04:55.090> I've<00:04:55.210> been<00:04:55.390> I<00:04:55.630> had<00:04:55.900> a

this<00:05:45.730> hair<00:05:45.970> came<00:05:46.210> in<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.390> 1b<00:05:47.100> like<00:05:48.100> I<00:05:48.220> said

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
this hair came in a 1b like I said

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.630 
this hair came in a 1b like I said
before<00:05:49.020> it's<00:05:50.020> a<00:05:50.200> nice<00:05:50.440> luster<00:05:50.830> I<00:05:51.070> really<00:05:51.460> don't

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
before it's a nice luster I really don't

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.450 
before it's a nice luster I really don't
have<00:05:51.700> a<00:05:51.820> hard<00:05:52.210> time<00:05:52.480> blending<00:05:52.930> with<00:05:53.500> my<00:05:54.040> real

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
have a hard time blending with my real

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.860 
have a hard time blending with my real
hair<00:05:54.700> because<00:05:54.940> I<00:05:55.030> did<00:05:55.270> an<00:05:55.390> out<00:05:55.540> girl<00:05:55.840> look

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
hair because I did an out girl look

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.440 
hair because I did an out girl look
anyway<00:05:56.710> so<00:05:56.770> it's<00:05:57.280> blonde<00:05:57.700> up<00:05:58.000> to<00:05:58.240> a<00:05:58.270> certain

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
anyway so it's blonde up to a certain

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.690 
anyway so it's blonde up to a certain
point<00:05:58.570> and<00:05:59.020> then<00:05:59.530> it's<00:05:59.740> darker<00:06:00.130> at<00:06:00.280> the<00:06:00.430> roots

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
point and then it's darker at the roots

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.160 
point and then it's darker at the roots
so<00:06:00.940> it<00:06:00.970> was<00:06:01.300> really<00:06:01.510> easy

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
so it was really easy

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.020 
so it was really easy
um<00:06:02.970> manipulating<00:06:03.970> this<00:06:04.150> hair<00:06:04.920> to<00:06:05.920> fit<00:06:06.520> me<00:06:06.820> and

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
I did add a few layers but I definitely

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.640 
I did add a few layers but I definitely
take<00:06:09.400> away<00:06:09.640> from<00:06:09.850> the<00:06:10.030> length<00:06:10.300> and<00:06:10.600> I<00:06:11.350> wanted

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650
