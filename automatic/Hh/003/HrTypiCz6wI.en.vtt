man and you cut out to cause man you got

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.620 
man and you cut out to cause man you got
a<00:01:04.199> bit<00:01:04.559> protein<00:01:05.129> man<00:01:05.549> he's<00:01:06.150> probably<00:01:06.420> getting

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
a bit protein man he's probably getting

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.210 
a bit protein man he's probably getting
anywhere<00:01:07.020> from<00:01:07.229> three<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.540> probably<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:10.220> no

certain<00:01:12.000> days<00:01:12.180> phonograms<00:01:12.900> protein<00:01:13.409> yeah<00:01:13.890> man

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
certain days phonograms protein yeah man

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.730 
certain days phonograms protein yeah man
so<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.270> got<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.509> come<00:01:15.689> back<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.990> call<00:01:16.229> increase
