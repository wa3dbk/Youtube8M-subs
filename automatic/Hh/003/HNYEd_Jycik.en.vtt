something that we've been discussing on

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.959 
something that we've been discussing on

the forum for a little while and that is

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.940 
the forum for a little while and that is
using<00:00:13.240> the<00:00:13.300> over<00:00:13.660> center<00:00:13.929> buckle<00:00:14.320> instead<00:00:14.860> of

platform to the trick I want to take a

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.069 
platform to the trick I want to take a
look<00:00:18.849> at<00:00:19.000> the<00:00:19.149> two<00:00:19.300> different<00:00:19.599> models<00:00:19.720> that

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:20.079 
look at the two different models that

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.170 
look at the two different models that
I've<00:00:20.169> been<00:00:20.259> looking<00:00:20.410> at<00:00:20.649> this<00:00:21.189> one<00:00:21.430> from<00:00:21.730> boxer

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
I've been looking at this one from boxer

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.300 
I've been looking at this one from boxer
tie-down<00:00:22.570> and<00:00:23.110> this<00:00:23.259> one<00:00:23.470> from<00:00:23.739> u.s.<00:00:24.040> cargo

tie-down and this one from u.s. cargo
controller<00:00:25.020> now<00:00:26.020> typically<00:00:26.559> people<00:00:26.829> use<00:00:26.980> a

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
controller now typically people use a

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.830 
controller now typically people use a
wrap<00:00:27.369> ratchet<00:00:27.910> strap<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.419> hook<00:00:28.540> up<00:00:28.660> their

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
wrap ratchet strap to hook up their

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.150 
wrap ratchet strap to hook up their
platform<00:00:29.290> because<00:00:29.559> they<00:00:29.739> can<00:00:29.919> get<00:00:30.040> the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
platform because they can get the

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.979 
platform because they can get the
platform<00:00:30.369> set<00:00:30.849> really<00:00:31.210> tight<00:00:31.419> on<00:00:31.599> the<00:00:31.750> tree

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
platform set really tight on the tree

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:33.900 
platform set really tight on the tree
but<00:00:32.469> the<00:00:32.619> disadvantage<00:00:33.219> of<00:00:33.340> using<00:00:33.399> a<00:00:33.730> ratchet

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
but the disadvantage of using a ratchet

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.270 
but the disadvantage of using a ratchet
strap<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.989> noise<00:00:35.170> it<00:00:35.410> makes<00:00:35.590> when<00:00:35.890> you're

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
strap is the noise it makes when you're

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.540 
strap is the noise it makes when you're
crocheting<00:00:36.790> down<00:00:37.380> now<00:00:38.380> the<00:00:38.950> advantage<00:00:39.310> of<00:00:39.400> the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
crocheting down now the advantage of the

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.280 
crocheting down now the advantage of the
over<00:00:39.790> Center<00:00:40.060> buckle<00:00:40.450> is<00:00:40.570> there's<00:00:40.780> one<00:00:40.840> motion

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
over Center buckle is there's one motion

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.830 
over Center buckle is there's one motion
that<00:00:41.800> you<00:00:41.920> can<00:00:42.070> do<00:00:42.190> very<00:00:42.220> quietly<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:43.360> you<00:00:43.660> can

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
that you can do very quietly and you can

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.570 
that you can do very quietly and you can
still<00:00:44.140> get<00:00:44.290> your<00:00:44.320> platform<00:00:44.890> it's<00:00:45.070> very<00:00:45.310> tight

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
still get your platform it's very tight

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.340 
still get your platform it's very tight
onto<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.120> tree<00:00:46.330> so<00:00:46.840> I'm<00:00:46.930> going<00:00:47.080> to<00:00:47.140> show<00:00:47.290> you

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
onto the tree so I'm going to show you

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.740 
onto the tree so I'm going to show you
both<00:00:47.560> of<00:00:47.620> these<00:00:47.860> in<00:00:48.070> action<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:48.790> we'll<00:00:49.630> go

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
both of these in action and we'll go

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.319 
both of these in action and we'll go
from<00:00:49.900> there<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.340> this<00:00:51.490> fall<00:00:51.730> I'm<00:00:51.940> going<00:00:52.150> to<00:00:52.240> be

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
from there so this fall I'm going to be

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.940 
from there so this fall I'm going to be
using<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:53.050> buckle<00:00:53.380> from<00:00:53.560> Bob<00:00:53.740> they're

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
using the buckle from Bob they're

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.550 
using the buckle from Bob they're
tie-downs<00:00:54.370> it's<00:00:54.850> smaller<00:00:55.270> it's<00:00:55.840> lighter<00:00:56.170> and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
tie-downs it's smaller it's lighter and

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.370 
tie-downs it's smaller it's lighter and
it's<00:00:56.890> simpler<00:00:57.460> it's<00:00:58.270> only<00:00:58.450> nine<00:00:58.750> ounces<00:00:59.170> as

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
it's simpler it's only nine ounces as

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.410 
it's simpler it's only nine ounces as
opposed<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.800> this<00:00:59.950> one<00:01:00.190> which<00:01:00.430> is<00:01:00.460> 22<00:01:01.060> ounces

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
opposed to this one which is 22 ounces

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.990 
opposed to this one which is 22 ounces
now<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.320> biggest<00:01:02.770> advantage<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.399> this<00:01:03.520> one<00:01:03.760> is

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
now the biggest advantage of this one is

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.670 
now the biggest advantage of this one is
that<00:01:04.360> nothing<00:01:04.780> can<00:01:04.899> get<00:01:05.019> as<00:01:05.199> tight<00:01:05.409> on<00:01:05.560> the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
that nothing can get as tight on the

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.440 
that nothing can get as tight on the
tree<00:01:05.890> at<00:01:06.009> this<00:01:06.159> one<00:01:06.399> but<00:01:06.820> this<00:01:06.939> one<00:01:07.000> still<00:01:07.420> gets

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
tree at this one but this one still gets

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.020 
tree at this one but this one still gets
really<00:01:07.990> tight<00:01:08.290> and<00:01:08.590> I'll<00:01:09.340> be<00:01:09.490> happy<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.880> use<00:01:10.000> it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
really tight and I'll be happy to use it

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.940 
really tight and I'll be happy to use it
this<00:01:10.240> fall<00:01:10.479> this<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.350> one<00:01:11.470> I'm<00:01:11.590> gonna<00:01:11.710> set

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
this fall this is the one I'm gonna set

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.070 
this fall this is the one I'm gonna set
up<00:01:11.979> first

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:26.740 

so<00:01:17.590> it's<00:01:17.740> very<00:01:17.860> simple<00:01:18.190> this<00:01:18.430> setup

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.300 

just<00:01:27.350> hook<00:01:27.530> around<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.890> tree<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:29.290> hand<00:01:30.290> tighten

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
just hook around the tree a hand tighten

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.420 
just hook around the tree a hand tighten
strap<00:01:32.970> down

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:50.390 

and<00:01:39.670> position<00:01:40.090> my<00:01:40.210> steps<00:01:40.510> where<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:40.780> want<00:01:41.020> them

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.860 

and<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:50.940> once<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.240> them<00:01:51.540> where<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> want

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
and then once I have them where I want

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.530 
and then once I have them where I want
them<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.350> pull<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.220> strap<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.850> tight<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.330> can

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
them I pull this strap as tight as I can

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.940 
them I pull this strap as tight as I can
and<00:01:55.410> I<00:01:55.680> pull<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:55.980> mechanism<00:01:56.310> around<00:01:57.950> once

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and I pull this mechanism around once

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.100 
and I pull this mechanism around once
you<00:01:59.040> get<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.370> all<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> way<00:01:59.640> around<00:01:59.900> it'll<00:02:00.900> hold

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
you get it all the way around it'll hold

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.910 
you get it all the way around it'll hold
there<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.760> there's<00:02:03.410> two<00:02:04.410> little<00:02:04.620> nuts

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
there and then there's two little nuts

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.090 
there and then there's two little nuts
on<00:02:05.130> each<00:02:05.550> side<00:02:06.050> that<00:02:07.050> we<00:02:07.140> are<00:02:07.380> gonna<00:02:07.590> click<00:02:07.860> in

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
on each side that we are gonna click in

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.740 
on each side that we are gonna click in
now<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.360> gently<00:02:10.460> slide<00:02:11.460> this<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.030> you

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
now if you just gently slide this in you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.330 
now if you just gently slide this in you
can<00:02:12.900> do<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.110> without<00:02:13.200> making<00:02:13.650> any<00:02:13.920> noise<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
can do it without making any noise and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.070 
can do it without making any noise and
that's<00:02:17.580> extremely<00:02:18.150> important<00:02:18.840> if<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.050> want

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
that's extremely important if you want

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:37.690 
that's extremely important if you want
to<00:02:19.290> tight<00:02:19.470> very<00:02:20.340> tight<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.820> bedding<00:02:21.180> area

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.150 

so<00:02:38.240> what<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.450> do<00:02:38.569> after<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:39.050> set<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.500> up<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:39.950> just

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
so what I do after I set it up is I just

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.940 
so what I do after I set it up is I just
take<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.340> couple<00:02:40.550> steps<00:02:40.849> on<00:02:41.270> each<00:02:41.390> step<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:42.770> lock

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
take a couple steps on each step to lock

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:56.930 
take a couple steps on each step to lock
it<00:02:43.099> down<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.550> tree

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.420 

okay<00:02:57.540> at<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.320> point<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.770> platform<00:02:59.070> is

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
okay at this point this platform is

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.210 
okay at this point this platform is
rock-solid<00:02:59.760> I<00:03:00.480> have<00:03:00.900> no<00:03:01.140> concerns<00:03:01.620> about<00:03:01.890> it

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
rock-solid I have no concerns about it

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.030 
rock-solid I have no concerns about it
slipping<00:03:02.840> squeaking<00:03:03.840> or<00:03:04.230> making<00:03:04.590> any<00:03:04.800> noise

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
slipping squeaking or making any noise

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:18.080 
slipping squeaking or making any noise
if<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.490> if<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.180> deer<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.630> come<00:03:06.780> out

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.729 

next<00:03:18.780> we're<00:03:18.900> going<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.110> take<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.260> look<00:03:19.470> at<00:03:19.620> this

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
next we're going to take a look at this

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.190 
next we're going to take a look at this
one<00:03:19.950> from<00:03:20.099> US<00:03:20.430> cargo<00:03:20.849> control<00:03:21.180> like<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.020> said

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
one from US cargo control like it said

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.610 
one from US cargo control like it said
earlier<00:03:22.530> it's<00:03:23.069> big<00:03:23.430> its<00:03:24.030> bulky<00:03:24.380> but<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.500> gets

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
earlier it's big its bulky but it gets

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.949 
earlier it's big its bulky but it gets
really<00:03:25.890> tight<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.580> tree<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.330> mechanism

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
really tight to the tree the mechanism

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.710 
really tight to the tree the mechanism
is<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.110> lot<00:03:28.319> more<00:03:28.530> complex<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.510> that's<00:03:30.510> what

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
is a lot more complex and that's what

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.370 
is a lot more complex and that's what
enables<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.260> get<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:31.650> tight<00:03:31.890> on<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.160> tree

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
enables it to get so tight on the tree

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
enables it to get so tight on the tree
we're<00:03:34.380> going<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.560> set<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.739> up<00:03:34.830> just<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.220> same

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
we're going to set it up just the same

00:03:35.400 --> 00:04:18.890 
we're going to set it up just the same
as<00:03:35.580> we<00:03:35.670> did<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.510> other<00:03:36.540> one

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.659 

okay<00:04:19.410> now<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.650> biggest<00:04:19.949> difference<00:04:20.160> with

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
okay now the biggest difference with

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.270 
okay now the biggest difference with
this<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:21.389> that<00:04:21.660> due<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.079> that<00:04:22.169> mechanism<00:04:22.560> I

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
this is that due to that mechanism I

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.030 
this is that due to that mechanism I
can't<00:04:24.270> pull<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:24.690> as<00:04:24.900> tight<00:04:25.139> as<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.770> did<00:04:25.949> the

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
can't pull this as tight as I did the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.740 
can't pull this as tight as I did the
other<00:04:26.190> one<00:04:26.280> I'm<00:04:26.880> not<00:04:27.090> gonna<00:04:27.270> be<00:04:27.389> able<00:04:27.449> to<00:04:27.570> pull

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
other one I'm not gonna be able to pull

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.200 
other one I'm not gonna be able to pull
this<00:04:27.870> lever<00:04:28.110> around<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:29.460> what<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.669> do<00:04:29.790> is<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.180> just

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
this lever around so what I do is I just

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.860 
this lever around so what I do is I just
leave<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.540> little<00:04:30.870> bit<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:31.050> slack<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:32.870> then

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
leave a little bit of slack and then

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:41.860 
leave a little bit of slack and then
pull<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.169> around

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.660 

this<00:04:42.230> one<00:04:42.440> has<00:04:42.590> a<00:04:42.620> little<00:04:42.830> latch<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.160> locked

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
this one has a little latch that locked

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:59.230 
this one has a little latch that locked
it<00:04:43.850> into<00:04:44.120> place<00:04:44.360> as<00:04:44.660> you<00:04:44.720> hold<00:04:45.110> it<00:04:45.230> around

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.999 

again<00:04:59.840> I'm<00:04:59.990> going<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.199> step<00:05:00.410> on<00:05:00.530> each<00:05:00.560> step

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
again I'm going to step on each step

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.800 
again I'm going to step on each step
just<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.430> make<00:05:01.580> sure<00:05:01.610> it's<00:05:01.880> lockdown<00:05:02.090> solid

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
just to make sure it's lockdown solid

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.809 
just to make sure it's lockdown solid
but<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.050> one<00:05:03.380> is<00:05:03.530> even<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:04.100> bit<00:05:04.490> tighter<00:05:04.729> than

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
but this one is even a bit tighter than

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:14.620 
but this one is even a bit tighter than
the<00:05:05.060> other<00:05:05.180> one

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.820 

and<00:05:15.050> there<00:05:15.170> we<00:05:15.290> go<00:05:15.320> we<00:05:15.590> have<00:05:15.620> rock-solid<00:05:16.010> clap

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
and there we go we have rock-solid clap

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.410 
and there we go we have rock-solid clap
alright<00:05:18.830> everyone<00:05:19.220> so<00:05:19.430> this<00:05:19.550> is<00:05:19.730> the<00:05:19.970> close-up

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
alright everyone so this is the close-up

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.630 
alright everyone so this is the close-up
view<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:22.030> latching<00:05:23.030> this<00:05:23.270> over<00:05:23.690> Center<00:05:23.960> buckle

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
view of latching this over Center buckle

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.950 
view of latching this over Center buckle
again<00:05:25.640> this<00:05:25.790> is<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.120> one<00:05:26.270> from<00:05:26.570> boxer

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
again this is the one from boxer

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.490 
again this is the one from boxer
tie-downs<00:05:28.420> so<00:05:29.420> like<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.840> said<00:05:30.020> before<00:05:30.170> this

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
tie-downs so like I said before this

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.590 
tie-downs so like I said before this
device<00:05:30.950> is<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.400> little<00:05:31.880> bit<00:05:31.970> simpler<00:05:32.300> than<00:05:32.390> the

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
device is a little bit simpler than the

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.470 
device is a little bit simpler than the
other<00:05:32.750> one<00:05:32.960> so<00:05:33.800> I<00:05:34.130> pulled<00:05:34.850> this<00:05:34.970> strap<00:05:35.270> really

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
other one so I pulled this strap really

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.240 
other one so I pulled this strap really
tight<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:38.320> then<00:05:39.320> you<00:05:39.470> just<00:05:39.650> pull<00:05:39.890> that<00:05:39.920> around

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
tight and then you just pull that around

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.930 
tight and then you just pull that around
and<00:05:40.990> then<00:05:41.990> there's<00:05:42.530> a<00:05:42.680> little<00:05:42.860> nub<00:05:43.550> on<00:05:43.760> each

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
and then there's a little nub on each

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.080 
and then there's a little nub on each
side<00:05:44.210> right<00:05:44.420> here<00:05:44.630> that's<00:05:44.810> gonna<00:05:45.020> slide<00:05:45.380> in<00:05:46.090> so

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
side right here that's gonna slide in so

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
side right here that's gonna slide in so
that's<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.390> only<00:05:47.510> thing<00:05:47.840> that<00:05:47.990> could

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
that's the only thing that could

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.560 
that's the only thing that could
possibly<00:05:48.500> make<00:05:48.710> noise<00:05:48.950> so<00:05:49.250> if<00:05:50.090> you're<00:05:50.300> careful

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
possibly make noise so if you're careful

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.370 
possibly make noise so if you're careful
you<00:05:52.150> can<00:05:53.150> push<00:05:53.330> it<00:05:53.480> in<00:05:53.570> without<00:05:53.720> making<00:05:54.200> any

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
you can push it in without making any

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.770 
you can push it in without making any
noise<00:05:54.500> just<00:05:54.860> like<00:05:55.070> that<00:05:55.430> if<00:05:55.970> you're<00:05:56.510> worried

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
noise just like that if you're worried

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.110 
noise just like that if you're worried
about<00:05:56.870> this<00:05:57.170> buckle<00:05:57.670> coming<00:05:58.670> open<00:05:58.790> while
