00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.070
 so the little demonstration we just crack that windows password 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.909
 is 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.560
 i have pull Windows 7 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.560
 I want someone to change password as a user 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.090
 that means I go to change password 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.220
 one uses called Uster 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.710
 as an old password, I have nothing up to now with a new and angular 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.790
 Although you make sure password for example 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.940
 January 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.880
 10 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.310
 exclamation mark 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.140
 January 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.050
 on 2 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.270
 Although from March 8 pages percent has a special character numbers and letters 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.090
 Canup changed 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.090
 Landline also again in which nothing hit 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.290
 Password anonymous the cicadas entering the water 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.950
 is working 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.950
 So even if he does not work Las 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.330
 January 10th 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.980
 exclamation mark 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.980
 and logged in games 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.130
 now it could happen that I pro 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 without constellation on my notebook for example 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.550
 it comes more changes Nano Vice Japan used lost or stolen that 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.900
 second set 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.220
 Underestimated, I demonstrate how easy it is 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.220
 crack a password like that 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.090
 I have teeth plasters the inserted my notebook 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.719
 and it's a CD as well 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.950
 a little 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.100
 Linux operating system contains 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.650
 where and percent 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.629
 I can now easily use the password 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.059
 quasi percent shut down 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.639
 and Priklopil CDs are criticized by Mrs. Fruit 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.089
 and 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.819
 Meyer indicated I have two partitions on this notebook 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.390
 there is the first coalition it is the proposition of Windows 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.760
 and the second position is Stages Partition that means here I want now 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.949
 as an attacker, for example 2 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:46.369
 the butcher knows down in which system Othmer is that ordinary 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.369
 Notes that the windows system is located 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.549
 it asked me Heinz password reset so 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.769
 Repro- duces password, or assigns the password 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.499
 or how can a control 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:04.889
 I would like to access the data of Demi user password reset 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:10.299
 and then I want to index a password on number one user data 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.209
 that Weisbrich 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.269
 can watch now 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.190
 have what is there for users that means here I see there is one 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.230
 Administrator 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.940
 there is a 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.909
 the account there is a Home Cup Uster and there is a user 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.930
 and the user for these users ladies with the report from a notebook 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.129
 was logged in 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.879
 and that is also administrator points chronic coquettish 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.239
 I would like to change the user now Warsaw had everything to data 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:42.649
 to have a fax machine it is now here to say Clear password that is percent 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.579
 for gives can not delete the old password 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.579
 to 1 4 password 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:51.409
 the Wars in the end 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:52.579
 said 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.569
 Password clears and with the exclamation point can not get out 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.779
 under dance-ag I quit% Cu representative 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.489
 He asked me if I want to talk about the changes that means I have to 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.369
 of course, just write on that so grab a notebook so I can 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.369
 to enforce my changes at all 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.049
 the on 4 1 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.409
 I'm done support says Reutlingen and Komplet 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.379
 So who but you have the following I have earlier 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.789
 typed in my windows and password this is a secure password 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.639
 It had been Windows 7 with the current image too over-the-top 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.639
 the security paper son updates 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.279
 is called the Amour 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.319
 10 exclamation mark secure password 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.590
 Now I have such a lumpy CD 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.469
 exactly Mandy 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:44.379
 led everyone accessible on the internet, and dozens of times 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.749
 so 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:46.779
 a in all possible variations 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.109
 and now just look what happens when I windows again 

00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:52.109
 go up 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.300
 Findus wants to start up 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.979
 that has to be surprising but to take advantage of it in advance 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.120
 the password is deleted No but I also want to demonstrate 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.639
 they are everyone but they can 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.339
 then it must have really seen before all of all 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:13.409
 umpteen times then how 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.199
 PHW how safe you feel on the one hand but weighs and sure that 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.490
 whole but even in Windows 7 so in the latest Windows 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.490
 works of course with her warm windows version too 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:26.629
 I see here 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.220
 it is not even asked for a password 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.400
 usually 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.600
 now comes a dialogue Wohltmann Pastor must state but it is not 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.749
 If this dialog is really correct, I'm just in it now 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:39.609
 that is, if I were still an attacker or someone of the notebook 

00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:42.289
 have a hundred and a little idea 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.949
 If I were in the system now, he could win with other groups 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.569
 here for example on the user so the user is called the 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.319
 per cent 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.749
 from a few dates in it 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:58.400
 when I look at everything now 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.520
 of course it now only refers to those who had not encrypted 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.719
 are but 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:07.050
 I'm definitely in the system and the city is encrypted 

00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:09.289
 dates 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.289
 I might as well raise some wars though 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.550
 For example, be sure to demonstrate 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.499
 easy and 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:22.799
 really something for everyone 10 to crack it and system 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:27.089
 That's how you make it a world hit here I go 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:28.969
 sign out 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.969
 WiMAX forums have also done 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.029
 then come the registrations 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.029
 then with the password dialog 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.579
 so it goes so it is not a password Mac Law password has been deleted 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.199
 Victor Tsang Sophie enforce this percent password percent there 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:52.430
 Of course, many more possibilities but it was important for me to do that 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.419
 just show live 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:56.689
 sublime 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:00.639
 these tools are really available to buy i say s i say so there are too 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.919
 many HÃ¶rde Latif idiot-proof the tourist as Opera KÃ¶ck a big one 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:05.899
 Safety 

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:09.279
 Per cent professional know-how about this and that's the dangerous thing about it 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:09.800
 Thing 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.199
 It means we remember the following a password in itself 

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:18.949
 he protects percent from that 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:21.289
 my pc percent always mine here 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:23.409
 Well, nobody is there 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:27.190
 on the fast log in the password could not know but as soon as mine 

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:30.599
 Money is gone or stolen is it spread the password 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:34.599
 I would exist it is like a garden fence 

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:37.520
 Percent us-data kitchens shot though 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.560
 yes left and right of it that no garden fence parades knock knock 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.370
 easy detour and then that's been forever
