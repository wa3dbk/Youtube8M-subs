00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
I'll show you the programs i can make

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
I'll show you the programs i can make
your<00:00:54.030> computer<00:00:54.210> faster<00:00:54.480> which<00:00:55.140> i'll<00:00:55.530> start

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
your computer faster which i'll start

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.900 
your computer faster which i'll start
off<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.160> smart<00:00:56.460> defrag<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.280> as<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.699> see

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
off with smart defrag so as you can see

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.760 
off with smart defrag so as you can see
you<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> couple<00:01:00.660> buttons<00:01:00.840> there's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
you have a couple buttons there's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.729 
you have a couple buttons there's
analyze<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.579> defrag<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.719> there's<00:01:04.290> also<00:01:04.439> these

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
analyze and defrag so there's also these

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.370 
analyze and defrag so there's also these
it'll<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.210> shows<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> map<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.110> what

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
it'll just just shows you a map of what

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.789 
it'll just just shows you a map of what
what's<00:01:08.189> what<00:01:08.460> when<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.299> happening<00:01:09.869> so

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
what's what when you see it happening so

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.090 
what's what when you see it happening so
there's<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.520> free<00:01:12.270> space<00:01:12.830> rarely<00:01:13.830> used

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
there's a free space rarely used

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.380 
there's a free space rarely used
frequently<00:01:14.790> use<00:01:15.290> directories<00:01:16.290> mft<00:01:17.390> I'm

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
frequently use directories mft I'm

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.289 
frequently use directories mft I'm
movable<00:01:18.979> fragmented<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.130> moving<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
movable fragmented and moving so the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.490 
movable fragmented and moving so the
first<00:01:21.450> thing<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.750> want<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.200> click

files<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.250> you'll<00:01:27.000> start<00:01:27.210> seeing<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.630> whole

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
files and you'll start seeing a whole

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
files and you'll start seeing a whole
bunch<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.200> little<00:01:28.590> dots<00:01:28.770> appear<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.340> just

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
bunch of little dots appear that's just

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.280 
bunch of little dots appear that's just
analyzing<00:01:29.880> your<00:01:30.119> computer<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:33.079> this<00:01:34.079> will

analyzing your computer and this will
take<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> lot<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.860> time<00:01:34.979> takes<00:01:35.820> couple<00:01:36.210> hours<00:01:36.570> if

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
take a lot of time takes couple hours if

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.300 
take a lot of time takes couple hours if
you<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.560> use<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> lot<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.040> things<00:01:38.130> in

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
you have if you use a lot of things in

you have if you use a lot of things in
your<00:01:38.430> computer<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.750> recommend<00:01:40.079> doing<00:01:40.560> this

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
your computer so I recommend doing this

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.550 
your computer so I recommend doing this
while<00:01:41.549> you're<00:01:41.729> sleeping<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.560> defragging

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
while you're sleeping and defragging

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.490 
while you're sleeping and defragging
while<00:01:43.890> you're<00:01:44.040> sleeping<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.670> possible<00:01:45.500> so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
while you're sleeping if possible so

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.880 
while you're sleeping if possible so
after<00:01:46.710> let's<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.340> say<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.640> done<00:01:47.880> d<00:01:48.119> for

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
after let's just say it's done d for

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.420 
after let's just say it's done d for
analyzing<00:01:51.020> you'll<00:01:52.020> click<00:01:52.290> defrag<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.100> it'll

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
analyzing you'll click defrag and it'll

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.950 
analyzing you'll click defrag and it'll
start<00:01:53.700> defragging<00:01:54.149> your<00:01:54.390> computer<00:01:54.780> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
putting files where they're actually

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.240 
putting files where they're actually
supposed<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.659> maximize<00:01:58.170> your<00:01:58.740> computer

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250

description<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.290> smart<00:02:04.590> defrag<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.280> it

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
description on smart defrag and what it

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.240 
description on smart defrag and what it
does<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:06.329> very<00:02:06.360> useful<00:02:07.110> program<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.099> works

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
does so very useful program and it works

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.510 
does so very useful program and it works
very<00:02:08.369> well<00:02:08.869> then<00:02:09.869> there's<00:02:10.170> quick<00:02:10.530> or<00:02:10.770> let's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
very well then there's quick or let's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.870 
very well then there's quick or let's
just<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:11.940> advanced<00:02:12.239> systemcare<00:02:12.660> which<00:02:13.080> is

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
just go in advanced systemcare which is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.710 
just go in advanced systemcare which is
the<00:02:14.000> same<00:02:14.240> thing<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.110> little<00:02:15.410> more<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:17.330> then

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
the same thing but a little more so then

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.800 
the same thing but a little more so then
you<00:02:17.990> have<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.590> quick<00:02:18.920> malware<00:02:19.340> removal

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
you have a quick malware removal

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.990 
you have a quick malware removal
registry<00:02:20.810> fix<00:02:20.990> shortcut<00:02:21.620> fix<00:02:21.920> privacy<00:02:22.790> sweep

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
registry fix shortcut fix privacy sweep

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.780 
registry fix shortcut fix privacy sweep
and<00:02:23.180> junk<00:02:23.510> files<00:02:23.750> clean<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.250> can<00:02:25.460> just

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
and junk files clean so you can just

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.930 
and junk files clean so you can just
scan<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.080> it'll<00:02:27.280> scan<00:02:28.280> for<00:02:28.610> all<00:02:28.760> these

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
scan that and it'll scan for all these

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.780 
scan that and it'll scan for all these
things<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.690> remove<00:02:30.260> them<00:02:30.440> or<00:02:30.710> move<00:02:31.160> them<00:02:31.490> or

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
things and remove them or move them or

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.970 
things and remove them or move them or
anything<00:02:32.780> else<00:02:33.110> they<00:02:33.320> can<00:02:33.380> do<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.770> make<00:02:33.860> your

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
anything else they can do to make your

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.400 
anything else they can do to make your
computer<00:02:34.130> faster<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.810> let's<00:02:36.170> just<00:02:36.320> say<00:02:36.380> that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
computer faster so let's just say that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.050 
computer faster so let's just say that
strat<00:02:36.890> then<00:02:37.100> then<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.490> can<00:02:37.610> run<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.850> next

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
strat then then you can run the next

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.950 
strat then then you can run the next
program<00:02:38.240> which<00:02:38.690> would<00:02:38.900> be<00:02:39.110> glary<00:02:39.890> utilities

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
program which would be glary utilities

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.710 
program which would be glary utilities
so<00:02:41.960> this<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.320> registry<00:02:42.920> cleaner<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.580> more

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
so this is a registry cleaner and more

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.370 
so this is a registry cleaner and more
so<00:02:44.720> it'll<00:02:44.990> like<00:02:45.580> it'll<00:02:46.580> change<00:02:47.300> stuff<00:02:47.570> in<00:02:48.170> your

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
so it'll like it'll change stuff in your

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.590 
so it'll like it'll change stuff in your
setup<00:02:49.070> manager<00:02:49.310> it'll<00:02:50.270> remove<00:02:51.020> spyware<00:02:51.770> and

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
setup manager it'll remove spyware and

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.740 
setup manager it'll remove spyware and
it<00:02:53.600> tracks<00:02:54.260> eraser<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:55.910> erases<00:02:56.180> activity

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
it tracks eraser so it erases activity

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.420 
it tracks eraser so it erases activity
history<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:58.990> temporary<00:02:59.990> files<00:03:00.560> it'll<00:03:01.160> remove

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
history and temporary files it'll remove

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.700 
history and temporary files it'll remove
temporary<00:03:01.850> files<00:03:02.300> like<00:03:02.540> your<00:03:02.750> registry<00:03:03.350> after

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
temporary files like your registry after

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.430 
temporary files like your registry after
you<00:03:03.830> install<00:03:04.130> game<00:03:04.400> etc<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.200> can<00:03:06.410> just

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
you install game etc so you can just

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.800 
you install game etc so you can just
scan<00:03:06.890> for<00:03:07.160> issues<00:03:07.490> and<00:03:07.820> it'll<00:03:08.150> start<00:03:08.420> scanning

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
scan for issues and it'll start scanning

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
scan for issues and it'll start scanning
for<00:03:09.520> various<00:03:10.520> things<00:03:10.960> so<00:03:11.960> that's<00:03:12.140> sad<00:03:12.470> glary

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
for various things so that's sad glary

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.120 
for various things so that's sad glary
utilities<00:03:12.980> it's<00:03:13.790> very<00:03:14.510> useful<00:03:14.800> then<00:03:15.800> there's

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
utilities it's very useful then there's

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.580 
utilities it's very useful then there's
CC<00:03:16.580> cleaner<00:03:16.910> which<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.690> going<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.930> clear

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
CC cleaner which is going to clear

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.760 
CC cleaner which is going to clear
cookies<00:03:18.890> history<00:03:19.670> etc<00:03:20.170> from<00:03:21.170> Internet

Explorer<00:03:22.160> windows<00:03:22.700> explores<00:03:23.090> your<00:03:23.330> system

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
Explorer windows explores your system

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.590 
Explorer windows explores your system
and<00:03:24.430> if<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.610> want<00:03:25.790> advance<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:26.450> can<00:03:26.570> just

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
and if you want advance so you can just

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.750 
and if you want advance so you can just
analyze<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.500> it'll<00:03:27.770> start<00:03:28.010> doing<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.430> and

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
analyze and it'll start doing that and

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.790 
analyze and it'll start doing that and
after<00:03:29.330> it's<00:03:29.600> done<00:03:29.690> analyzing<00:03:29.990> which<00:03:30.380> doesn't

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
after it's done analyzing which doesn't

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.470 
after it's done analyzing which doesn't
take<00:03:30.950> too<00:03:31.100> much<00:03:31.190> time<00:03:31.460> you<00:03:31.520> can<00:03:31.730> just<00:03:32.030> say<00:03:32.180> run

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
take too much time you can just say run

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.370 
take too much time you can just say run
cleaner<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.610> that's<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:34.850> it's<00:03:35.420> done<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:36.170> now

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
cleaner and that's it it's done so now

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.990 
cleaner and that's it it's done so now
your<00:03:36.500> computer<00:03:36.890> with<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.130> little<00:03:37.490> faster<00:03:37.850> after

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
your computer with a little faster after

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.770 
your computer with a little faster after
that<00:03:38.680> then<00:03:39.680> there's<00:03:40.340> avast<00:03:40.880> free<00:03:41.570> antivirus

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
that then there's avast free antivirus

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.340 
that then there's avast free antivirus
this<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.500> another<00:03:43.310> type<00:03:43.610> of<00:03:43.640> avg<00:03:44.570> but<00:03:45.200> with<00:03:45.320> a

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
this is another type of avg but with a

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.010 
this is another type of avg but with a
little<00:03:45.530> more<00:03:47.830> variations<00:03:48.830> in<00:03:49.190> programs<00:03:50.020> so

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
little more variations in programs so

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.460 
little more variations in programs so
this<00:03:51.290> is<00:03:51.440> basically<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:52.100> antivirus<00:03:52.580> for<00:03:53.470> games

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
this is basically a antivirus for games

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.699 
this is basically a antivirus for games
so<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.370> can<00:03:55.610> just<00:03:55.670> quick<00:03:56.030> scan<00:03:56.390> full<00:03:57.260> system

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
so you can just quick scan full system

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.180 
so you can just quick scan full system
scan<00:03:57.740> at<00:03:58.250> removable<00:03:59.240> media<00:03:59.390> scan<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.190> select

scan at removable media scan and select

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.650 
scan at removable media scan and select
the<00:04:01.220> folder<00:04:01.430> scan<00:04:01.850> if<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:02.120> just<00:04:02.300> want<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.480> stay

in one folder that you're not sure of so

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.420 
in one folder that you're not sure of so
that's<00:04:05.540> just<00:04:05.660> a<00:04:05.990> nice<00:04:06.290> avg<00:04:06.860> that<00:04:07.010> you<00:04:07.100> can<00:04:07.220> have

that's just a nice avg that you can have

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:15.220 
that's just a nice avg that you can have
and<00:04:08.290> last<00:04:09.290> but<00:04:09.380> not<00:04:09.560> least<00:04:09.620> it's<00:04:10.610> or<00:04:14.230> so
