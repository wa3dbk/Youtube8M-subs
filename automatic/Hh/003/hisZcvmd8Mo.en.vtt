00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.150
 and it asks him what skyheroes how 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.890
 it's going well today for a 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.230
 new gameplay on call of duty cost 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.329
 and this time on the mapaq at michael 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.679
 myers sees the little mission 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.720
 then unlocks to explain a little 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.520
 little mission for those who do not beat who 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.989
 do not know everyone is carrying 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.360
 of a mission on call of duty kid 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.530
 any game mode here is a little 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.150
 by dint you do any 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.770
 maps is the first person to 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.060
 killed loose a blue box 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.620
 so we'll see that right away when 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.340
 you start the game you but hey I 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.630
 will wait a little bit that the 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.700
 enemies arrive one obviously up 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.290
 the little blue room and run that 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.970
 it means it's the mission I'm going 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.500
 go get the mission is at each 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.450
 time here he gives you something to 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.130
 to do and when you complete bull you 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.330
 unblocks a strategic package and in 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.250
 the strategic package that can be 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.660
 a lot of things and particularity of 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.549
 this map the the seal map that comes from 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.290
 go out on the dl six children who comes 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.729
 to go out a little week and for 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.900
 those who ask each time that goes 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.149
 go out well in not long time you 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.799
 do not worry about ps3 the mission was 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.119
 to do a headshot here I did a 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.829
 small and the one where I made a small 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.049
 turn this suddenly it's pretty good 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.979
 passed on me and to kill the blocks the 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.810
 strategic package 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.969
 you throw the strategic package and on 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.789
 this map fog so you can have the 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.020
 michael myers new killstreaks between 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.450
 quotation marks since we can see it 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.409
 only as a bonus and not by chance I 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.390
 I had the first blow frankly 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.619
 but I was pretty happy what I 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.359
 think it's about the third 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.590
 once I unlock and each time 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.210
 that I unlock the show each time 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.409
 I unblock the packages I always have 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.880
 old shit stuff is besides in 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.109
 speaking of parcels I do not know at every 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.109
 once I unlock a collar and I have to 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.399
 have a drone or shit like that 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.380
 but against me my enemies they have 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.340
 always a fucking helicopter that 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.990
 breaks the balls 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.520
 in short, I do not know how it's done 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.109
 is behind an anti month thing 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.490
 to have something good in the packages 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.600
 but here I was happy I had the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.369
 michael myers so here it is 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.569
 completely random and once 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.950
 you the blocks you can no longer 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.439
 unlock after that so only one 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.539
 times in the game and you embody so 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.880
 that's what we'll say in quotation marks 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.170
 hero of the halloween movie that 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.369
 normally in the movie he with a 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.819
 knife and has it this time with a 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.440
 chopped 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.909
 I do not know why they did that 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.290
 but hey that it does and nice 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.430
 the advantage is that we can kill 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.989
 really a 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.519
 leaving without having this little 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.569
 cinematic of a real that we have as we 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.489
 the east one could have with a knife 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.290
 for the life of michael mayer i 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.849
 think it is substantially equal to 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.680
 that of any one mastodon 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.969
 can run as fast so it's 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.500
 to say that if someone tries to you 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.540
 in cask to flee a little bit of you 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.250
 he will not be able to see a little bit 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.719
 precisely he who gives the bottom to stumble 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.129
 and unfortunately you do not 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.049
 that go my buddy right in the back 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.760
 and I was really happy with this 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.469
 part there because it's my most beautiful 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.209
 series with the michael myers good as I 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.650
 I said unlock three times but 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.939
 I understand a little about the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.489
 strategy that had to be really 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.109
 do not go on fronting enemies 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.220
 try to make the most of the trick 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.590
 since in any case we are really 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.329
 very stealthy and the particularity also 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.709
 we have this little music 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.079
 tint in our ears the music of the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.459
 halloween movie that not only do you 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.510
 hear when you 're michael myers but 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.489
 everyone hears that is to say that 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.290
 when there is michael myers everyone 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.629
 so really knows if he's in front 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.639
 of you really blundered because he 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.219
 is really really really 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.569
 effective and it's pure kif to play with 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.769
 al akwaa that's why I want 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.139
 really unlock it I can play 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.700
 on because when you play with the 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.500
 michael byers what is it that they 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.180
 run to enemies like that the 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.760
 puts big ax in the head 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.989
 and continue continue then good on 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.489
 try to stay alive the most 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.229
 long time possible to be able to kill a 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.819
 maximum of enemies and finally on 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.409
 this part there I really managed to 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.989
 well dodge enemy bullets for 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.879
 do my best series my series of 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.560
 seventeen that's seventeen he with the 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.970
 badly that myers then we can not I do not 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.169
 not think but maybe should test 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.120
 a private match but I do not think so 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.799
 that we can not do a klm with the 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.329
 michael myers because it's one that 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.250
 strict and we can not make any case 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.720
 with the killstreaks may but 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.040
 frankly if we could make a case 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.840
 even with the michael myers 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.030
 wow that would be they do she sends 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.680
 a small rep the fid same pitcher but in 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.120
 small sequence of three to evil that 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.709
 myers and that's something I 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.780
 would you like to cross over evil? 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.549
 that myers it would really be re kif 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.799
 and unfortunately the series stops 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.150
 right here where I'm getting killed right here 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.199
 good had it stop at the end 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.359
 of a moment to get shot at me 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.739
 little ball lost but here is a series of 17 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.299
 years michael myers who really does 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.370
 pleasure available only on the 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.750
 map fog and on the other maps to 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.380
 each mission corresponds to another 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.609
 district 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.169
 that's the end of this 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.789
 gameplay the rest is not necessarily very 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.720
 interesting so the serves not great 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.639
 thing that I show you the importance 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.020
 was the harm that myers if you have any 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.430
 questions of comments do not hesitate 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.260
 underneath the video a little green thumb 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.940
 also it's nice 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.660
 this is the reward for my part I you 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.710
 leave you wish an excellent 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.790
 day that happiness that good 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.180
 things and I tell you both 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.840
 next 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.840
 go ciao bye
