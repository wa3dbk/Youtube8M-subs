00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 a quick short cross of the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.600
 drivers in duel against man everything 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.400
 requires a steep curve at the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.190
 the whole swing will be taken away 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.710
 must and then the 25 meter pool 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.929
 with a degree plus water temperature in 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.850
 nobody really wants to land 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.100
 at the beginning of april this was the king of the year 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.470
 world tour at the chapel restaurant am 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 tokyo in fantastic weather and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.060
 Bright sunshine supported 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.189
 Over 30 skis and snowboarders partly in 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.910
 short pants and daredevil maneuvers 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.910
 over the water 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.610
 but from the beginning there on the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.320
 Water surface at 1850 meters above 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.510
 night has formed a layer of ice 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.550
 had to get on the road before any driver 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.739
 the route could only be sent 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.570
 the ponds are freed from the ice 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.090
 so that everything is safe 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.760
 a forerunner has to test that, of course 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.680
 since the weather was so wonderful I have 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.960
 me as moderator of tv's motto 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.620
 Ready to test rabbits 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.629
 play 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.290
 in advance I wanted to have a few more 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.380
 get the tips that would advise him 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.210
 Steep turn off teachers thus remember 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.770
 the qualification in any case outside 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.470
 because that's just the faster lines 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.890
 america it would be in the final the documents 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.030
 of the club peter niehoff come so far 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.940
 Anyway, they run longer 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.100
 Full throttle Schnellinger co2 and the with 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.820
 a lot of swing to the finish line, therefore, allowed 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.640
 the whole thing I'm not quite like that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.670
 Thank you very much for the fits 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.800
 clarify and vegetables 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.700
 the team is everything is possible 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.270
 if we definitely choose how do I feel 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.979
 better for speed cyclists and cyclists 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.369
 clean water over the god month 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.380
 banner 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.890
 because the partner is the most important club 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.709
 makes it so nice car window and the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.539
 God also the world-class drill markus 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:03.270
 Schairer was confident that I would 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.690
 So get a lot of momentum and get off 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.690
 it's 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.709
 and a bit too slow I can do it all 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.230
 Bike only wish a lot of speed 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.990
 take what's ice cold as one 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:00.620
 The air had good luck for everyone 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:02.720
 other citizens make me better 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.940
 last turn is probably the fatal 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.100
 but I was far from it 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.980
 the only one in the icy water 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.600
 landed so many had one 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.550
 due to the water temperature from the 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.910
 be helped because the body 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.560
 gets a good push 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.870
 participants like frozen and had to 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.120
 even be pulled out thanks to the 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.160
 but all have sun again quickly 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.950
 the vice-world champion is recovering in the 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.900
 boardercross 2013 solved his task in 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.819
 the qualification very sovereign and 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.160
 of course had one immediately 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.160
 explanation ready for my downfall 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:44.900
 when gunter gabriel is and where is water 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.940
 is surely as you would you do with 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.090
 made up speed now has a 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.709
 ambitious on the spot to note that 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.670
 I'll give you more titles today 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.519
 know who should be 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.530
 He press his thumb and bake after the 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.090
 Qualification went both in the 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.620
 snowboarders as well as the skiers 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.630
 right to the point 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.239
 thanks in parallel became the 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.040
 numerous spectators watch spectacular 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.750
 race action with sensational rides 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.880
 commanded over the water basin 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.130
 one or the other crash was natural 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.170
 also thanks to water and 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.120
 No one was injured 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.910
 but already at cross-country skiing it happened 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.979
 the active activities are called everything 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.850
 and showed waterslide action from 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.220
 finest 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.470
 Actually, all of them have the title kings 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.390
 of the water certainly deserves 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.420
 the audience was from 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.360
 event excited so sounds 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.480
 Really nice for oral sex 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.210
 is perfect water is bitterly cold 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.830
 and the one with the intel but us 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.510
 had kept on the snow is the zkb 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.700
 more and more great pieces 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.300
 Loved the obi as well as the 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.360
 look at 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.480
 a bit over the next year 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.250
 perhaps it shakes my 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.480
 thumb 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.370
 in the finale stood at the 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.140
 skiers Thomas Waldner and the 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.750
 former Blomberg rl skispringer 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.730
 balthasar schneider opposite the profi 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.010
 got the better start and let 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.200
 Do not burn anything on the water 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.420
 markus managed with the snowboarders 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.550
 Schairer easily make the move to the final 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.550
 there is waiting with philipp reinberger but 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.650
 a banner waters unfortunately came reinberger 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.330
 with some advantage to the water but the 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.130
 boardercrosser zone on the last 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.600
 in the water somehow the turbo and 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.350
 grabbed a gossamer 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.660
 Leap off the title as 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.510
 boardercrosser is much better than 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:39.530
 he would have suggested a winding drive outside 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.060
 is so choose I think I see it fits 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.950
 now went on the Monday 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.900

 this spirit is my other meeting 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.660
 must hangers beats the 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.880
 honorary place as a clown with a lot of fun now 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.170
 choice would be there still the poor high text 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.510
 You can lose markus seiler or 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.970
 richly congratulate to second place 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:08.960

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.210
 looking forward 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.479
 The winners were with a new board 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.789
 or new skis equipped for one 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.770
 Perfect conclusion said the coverband 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.530
 max driver on the terrace of the cafe 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.629
