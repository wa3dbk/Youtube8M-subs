at<00:00:05.149> UPM<00:00:05.689> prophy<00:00:06.080> deck<00:00:06.259> we<00:00:06.920> go<00:00:07.130> on<00:00:07.189> a<00:00:07.460> lot<00:00:07.880> about

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
at UPM prophy deck we go on a lot about

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.509 
at UPM prophy deck we go on a lot about
our<00:00:09.019> clothes<00:00:09.379> surface<00:00:09.889> and<00:00:10.100> the<00:00:10.340> high

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
our clothes surface and the high

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.240 
our clothes surface and the high
friction<00:00:10.820> surface<00:00:11.570> and<00:00:11.780> there's<00:00:12.200> one<00:00:12.380> reason

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
friction surface and there's one reason

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.669 
friction surface and there's one reason
we<00:00:13.370> do<00:00:13.549> this<00:00:13.790> because<00:00:14.690> when<00:00:14.929> you<00:00:15.110> have<00:00:15.349> a

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
we do this because when you have a

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.920 
we do this because when you have a
barbecue<00:00:16.430> or<00:00:16.490> if<00:00:17.240> you're<00:00:17.450> running<00:00:17.630> a

restaurant or at home and you spilled
some<00:00:21.170> food<00:00:21.439> or<00:00:21.680> oil<00:00:21.890> on<00:00:22.100> then<00:00:22.699> you<00:00:23.000> want<00:00:23.180> to<00:00:23.240> be

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
some food or oil on then you want to be

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.720 
some food or oil on then you want to be
able<00:00:23.449> to<00:00:23.630> clean<00:00:23.869> it<00:00:23.900> easily<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.680> a<00:00:25.340> lot<00:00:25.490> of<00:00:25.609> our

able to clean it easily and a lot of our

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.669 
able to clean it easily and a lot of our
competitors<00:00:26.390> don't<00:00:26.599> have<00:00:26.869> this<00:00:27.050> advantage

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
competitors don't have this advantage

for the edging of a deck or for making

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.459 
for the edging of a deck or for making
stairs<00:00:40.219> and<00:00:41.120> if<00:00:41.239> I<00:00:41.329> just<00:00:41.600> take<00:00:41.809> some<00:00:41.870> normal

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
stairs and if I just take some normal

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.380 
stairs and if I just take some normal
olive<00:00:42.860> oil<00:00:43.039> it<00:00:43.370> could<00:00:43.730> be<00:00:43.910> that<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:44.180> have<00:00:44.360> a

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
olive oil it could be that you have a

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.720 
olive oil it could be that you have a
barbecue<00:00:44.719> or<00:00:45.110> or<00:00:45.680> you<00:00:46.039> might<00:00:46.219> spill<00:00:46.489> some

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
barbecue or or you might spill some

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.760 
barbecue or or you might spill some
ketchup<00:00:46.969> or<00:00:47.329> something<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:48.260> just<00:00:48.530> pour

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
ketchup or something and I just pour

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.100 
ketchup or something and I just pour
some<00:00:48.800> olive<00:00:49.219> oil<00:00:49.370> on<00:00:49.610> that<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:50.149> then<00:00:50.780> I<00:00:50.809> have<00:00:51.079> a

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
some olive oil on that and then I have a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.500 
some olive oil on that and then I have a
competing<00:00:51.530> product<00:00:51.949> and<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:53.149> competing

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
competing product and the competing

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.990 
competing product and the competing
product<00:00:54.050> has<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.440> typical<00:00:54.680> wire<00:00:55.609> brush

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
product has the typical wire brush

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.900 
product has the typical wire brush
surface<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.500> wood<00:00:57.710> fibers<00:00:58.010> are<00:00:58.370> open<00:00:58.730> and

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
surface so the wood fibers are open and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.270 
surface so the wood fibers are open and
if<00:00:59.420> I<00:00:59.570> pour<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.109> oil<00:01:00.280> also<00:01:01.280> onto<00:01:01.460> this<00:01:03.280> then

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
if I pour the oil also onto this then

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.999 
if I pour the oil also onto this then
what<00:01:04.580> happens<00:01:05.089> over<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.840> short<00:01:06.170> time<00:01:06.259> is<00:01:06.770> the

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
what happens over a short time is the

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.490 
what happens over a short time is the
oil<00:01:07.250> will<00:01:07.580> soak<00:01:07.940> up<00:01:08.179> inside<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:09.020> wood<00:01:09.229> fibers

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
oil will soak up inside the wood fibers

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.859 
oil will soak up inside the wood fibers
and<00:01:09.950> it'll<00:01:10.670> be<00:01:10.819> difficult<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.420> clean<00:01:11.539> you'll

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
and it'll be difficult to clean you'll

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.109 
and it'll be difficult to clean you'll
have<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.200> sand<00:01:12.440> it<00:01:12.590> whereas<00:01:12.979> with<00:01:13.009> UPM<00:01:13.700> prophy

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
have to sand it whereas with UPM prophy

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.180 
have to sand it whereas with UPM prophy
deck<00:01:14.330> we<00:01:14.780> have<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:14.990> closed<00:01:15.289> surface<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.979> the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
deck we have a closed surface and the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.449 
deck we have a closed surface and the
oil<00:01:16.340> doesn't<00:01:16.880> soak<00:01:17.060> up<00:01:17.300> so<00:01:17.990> we'll<00:01:18.250> just<00:01:19.250> leave

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:19.459 
oil doesn't soak up so we'll just leave

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:20.740 
oil doesn't soak up so we'll just leave
this<00:01:19.640> for<00:01:19.849> a<00:01:19.880> couple<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.240> minutes<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.690> then

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
this for a couple of minutes and then

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.020 
this for a couple of minutes and then
I'll<00:01:21.500> wipe<00:01:21.770> off<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.130> oil<00:01:22.160> and<00:01:22.550> you'll<00:01:22.789> see

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
I'll wipe off the oil and you'll see

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.820 
I'll wipe off the oil and you'll see
what<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.270> mean<00:01:23.509> about<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.050> difference<00:01:26.830> okay

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
what I mean about the difference okay

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.230 
what I mean about the difference okay
we've<00:01:28.099> now<00:01:28.130> waited<00:01:28.580> a<00:01:28.640> couple<00:01:28.670> of<00:01:28.970> minutes

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
we've now waited a couple of minutes

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.839 
we've now waited a couple of minutes
since<00:01:29.390> I<00:01:29.539> put<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.020> olive<00:01:30.259> oil<00:01:30.679> on<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:31.670> can

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:31.849 
since I put the olive oil on and you can

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:33.820 
since I put the olive oil on and you can
see<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.179> difference<00:01:32.630> already<00:01:32.840> happening<00:01:33.649> if

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
see the difference already happening if

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.190 
see the difference already happening if
I<00:01:34.009> take<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.280> cloth<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:34.720> this<00:01:35.720> if<00:01:36.050> you<00:01:36.080> remember

and the same things going to happen with

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.089 
and the same things going to happen with
tomato<00:01:56.090> ketchup<00:01:56.450> or<00:01:56.780> red<00:01:57.020> wine<00:01:57.050> or<00:01:57.649> other

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
tomato ketchup or red wine or other

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.089 
tomato ketchup or red wine or other
things<00:01:58.459> whereas<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.479> Profi<00:01:59.899> deck<00:02:00.140> with<00:02:00.920> the

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
things whereas the Profi deck with the

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.580 
things whereas the Profi deck with the
closed<00:02:01.429> surface<00:02:01.819> then<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:02.959> can<00:02:03.140> see<00:02:03.319> it's<00:02:03.500> a

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
closed surface then you can see it's a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.369 
closed surface then you can see it's a
bit<00:02:03.770> more<00:02:03.979> like<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.220> kitchen<00:02:04.789> floor<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:06.200> can

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:06.379 
bit more like a kitchen floor you can

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:08.020 
bit more like a kitchen floor you can
see<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.590> put<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:06.890> lot<00:02:07.039> of<00:02:07.160> oil<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:07.489> this<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.000> you

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
see I put a lot of oil on this so you

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.779 
see I put a lot of oil on this so you
can<00:02:08.300> see<00:02:08.450> I'm<00:02:08.539> not<00:02:08.690> cheating<00:02:09.110> but<00:02:09.770> here<00:02:10.220> the

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
can see I'm not cheating but here the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.930 
can see I'm not cheating but here the
oil<00:02:11.000> has<00:02:11.270> not<00:02:11.540> soaked<00:02:11.989> in<00:02:12.200> at<00:02:12.320> all<00:02:12.500> so<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.490> have

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
oil has not soaked in at all so you have

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.490 
oil has not soaked in at all so you have
an<00:02:14.240> easy<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:15.050> clean<00:02:15.320> low-maintenance<00:02:16.070> deck

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
an easy to clean low-maintenance deck

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.310 
an easy to clean low-maintenance deck
compared<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.190> competing<00:02:18.580> product<00:02:19.320> there

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
compared to the competing product there

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.020 
compared to the competing product there
are<00:02:20.500> some<00:02:20.800> competing<00:02:21.160> products<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.850> have<00:02:22.000> a

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
are some competing products that have a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.270 
are some competing products that have a
thin<00:02:22.360> plastic<00:02:22.630> layer<00:02:23.140> around<00:02:23.500> them<00:02:23.770> which

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
thin plastic layer around them which

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.670 
thin plastic layer around them which
also<00:02:24.610> resists<00:02:25.210> the<00:02:25.390> oil<00:02:25.570> but<00:02:26.110> then<00:02:26.320> they<00:02:26.530> don't

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
also resists the oil but then they don't

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.190 
also resists the oil but then they don't
have<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.070> same<00:02:27.250> friction<00:02:27.610> surface<00:02:28.270> so<00:02:28.750> prophy

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
have the same friction surface so prophy

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.350 
have the same friction surface so prophy
deck<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.710> only<00:02:29.860> one<00:02:30.220> which<00:02:30.820> will<00:02:31.000> resist

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
deck is the only one which will resist

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.810 
deck is the only one which will resist
the<00:02:31.600> oil<00:02:31.810> has<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.260> good<00:02:32.590> moisture<00:02:33.220> resistance

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
the oil has a good moisture resistance

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.490 
the oil has a good moisture resistance
but<00:02:34.180> at<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.390> same<00:02:34.570> time<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:35.050> good<00:02:35.290> friction

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
but at the same time a good friction

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.430 
but at the same time a good friction
surface<00:02:36.100> as<00:02:36.250> well
