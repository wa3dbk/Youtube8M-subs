00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.190 

okay<00:00:01.079> so<00:00:01.140> now<00:00:01.979> we<00:00:02.040> have<00:00:02.220> this<00:00:02.610> DVD<00:00:03.600> desert<00:00:04.110> it

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
okay so now we have this DVD desert it

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.559 
okay so now we have this DVD desert it
was<00:00:04.319> said<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.740> us<00:00:04.890> we<00:00:05.759> had<00:00:05.910> taken<00:00:06.180> out<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.450> the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
was said to us we had taken out of the

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.240 
was said to us we had taken out of the
case<00:00:06.779> before<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.649> was<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.830> do<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.610> system<00:00:09.269> so<00:00:10.260> what

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
case before it was a do a system so what

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.400 
case before it was a do a system so what
we<00:00:11.400> have<00:00:11.610> here<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:12.950> power<00:00:13.950> leg<00:00:14.309> on<00:00:14.929> and<00:00:15.929> we're

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
we have here is power leg on and we're

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.290 
we have here is power leg on and we're
going<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.770> push<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.490> power<00:00:17.640> button<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.000> see

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
going to push the power button to see

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.150 
going to push the power button to see
what<00:00:18.330> happens<00:00:20.570> now<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.949> what<00:00:22.949> has

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
what happens now what what has

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.330 
what happens now what what has
transpired<00:00:23.519> since<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.650> did<00:00:25.650> ever<00:00:25.830> think<00:00:26.130> is

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
transpired since we did ever think is

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.580 
transpired since we did ever think is
this<00:00:27.080> capacitor<00:00:28.080> right<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:29.150> seek<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:32.329> art

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
this capacitor right here seek to of art

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.790 
this capacitor right here seek to of art
it<00:00:34.590> sparked<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.309> little<00:00:35.550> bit<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.620> what<00:00:37.620> we're

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it sparked a little bit so what we're

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.910 
it sparked a little bit so what we're
gonna<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:39.540> actually<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.410> if

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
gonna do and you can actually see it if

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
gonna do and you can actually see it if
you<00:00:41.160> take<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> look<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.360> little<00:00:43.110> bit<00:00:43.350> of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
you take a look at it a little bit of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.080 
you take a look at it a little bit of
damage<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:45.030> we're<00:00:45.149> gonna<00:00:45.270> do<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:47.090> cut

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
damage on it what we're gonna do is cut

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.209 
damage on it what we're gonna do is cut
the<00:00:48.239> system<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:49.070> see<00:00:50.070> what<00:00:50.250> happens<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:52.070> we<00:00:53.070> get

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the system on see what happens so we get

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.209 
the system on see what happens so we get
the<00:00:53.340> lights<00:00:54.110> we<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.260> everything<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.070> it

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the lights we get everything out of it

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.310 
the lights we get everything out of it
now<00:00:57.020> it<00:00:58.020> appears<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.649> running<00:00:59.899> of<00:01:00.899> course

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
now it appears to be running of course

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.579 
now it appears to be running of course
it's<00:01:01.559> giving<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.920> memory<00:01:02.250> code<00:01:02.579> error<00:01:03.559> but<00:01:04.559> we

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
it's giving a memory code error but we

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.640 
it's giving a memory code error but we
don't<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:05.159> anything<00:01:05.489> coming<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.650> that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
don't see anything coming out of that

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
don't see anything coming out of that
capacitor<00:01:10.400> we<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:11.850> nothing<00:01:12.240> coming<00:01:12.420> out<00:01:12.570> of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
capacitor we see nothing coming out of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.899 
capacitor we see nothing coming out of
the<00:01:12.810> whole<00:01:12.990> entire<00:01:13.290> area<00:01:14.030> actually<00:01:16.850> now<00:01:17.850> we

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the whole entire area actually now we

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.510 
the whole entire area actually now we
know<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> power<00:01:19.020> circuit

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
know that that's in the power circuit

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.670 
know that that's in the power circuit
and<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.790> actually<00:01:22.220> performing<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.340> function

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
and it's actually performing a function

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.800 
and it's actually performing a function
and<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.579> our<00:01:29.579> best<00:01:29.850> guess<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.570> try<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and so our best guess is to try to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.330 
and so our best guess is to try to
figure<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.430> exactly<00:01:32.430> what<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:34.680> capacitor

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
figure out exactly what that capacitor

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.640 
figure out exactly what that capacitor
controls<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> does<00:01:36.829> because<00:01:39.650> we

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
controls and what it does because we

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.289 
controls and what it does because we
have<00:01:40.860> chips<00:01:41.159> that's<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.640> high<00:01:41.909> and

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
have chips that's get high and

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
have chips that's get high and
processors<00:01:43.020> getting<00:01:43.320> caught<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.430> now<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.759> we

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
processors getting caught so now that we

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.050 
processors getting caught so now that we
have<00:01:45.030> everything<00:01:45.570> booting<00:01:46.310> but<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.640> far<00:01:47.909> as

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
have everything booting but as far as

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.219 
have everything booting but as far as
that<00:01:48.240> capacitor<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:48.990> concerned<00:01:50.960> since<00:01:51.960> its

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
that capacitor is concerned since its

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.080 
that capacitor is concerned since its
art<00:01:52.530> that's<00:01:52.829> part<00:01:53.159> there's<00:01:53.460> something<00:01:53.970> that's

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
art that's part there's something that's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.690 
art that's part there's something that's
going<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.710> power<00:01:55.920> circuit<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
going on with the power circuit and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.660 
going on with the power circuit and
everything<00:01:57.149> there<00:01:57.439> that<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.619> need<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.040> figure

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
everything there that we need to figure

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.730 
everything there that we need to figure
out<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:01.170> what<00:02:01.530> we're<00:02:01.680> gonna<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:03.740> most

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
out so what we're gonna do is most

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.419 
out so what we're gonna do is most
likely<00:02:05.159> change<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.700> capacitor<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.899> they

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
likely change that capacitor out if they

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.850 
likely change that capacitor out if they
go<00:02:08.429> from<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:08.849> see<00:02:09.119> what<00:02:09.300> happens<00:02:09.860> okay

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
go from there and see what happens okay

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.040 
go from there and see what happens okay
so<00:02:11.099> we<00:02:11.459> still<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.849> our

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
so we still have our

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.980 
so we still have our
bad<00:02:13.709> chip<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.160> there<00:02:14.510> as<00:02:15.510> far<00:02:15.750> as<00:02:15.870> our

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
bad chip on there as far as our

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.870 
bad chip on there as far as our
capacitor<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:17.100> we're<00:02:17.190> gonna<00:02:17.310> hook<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:17.700> up

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
capacitor but we're gonna hook this up

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.780 
capacitor but we're gonna hook this up
and<00:02:18.090> see<00:02:18.240> if<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.390> get<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.630> video<00:02:19.080> out<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.790> just

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and see if we get a video out of it just

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.300 
and see if we get a video out of it just
as<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> testing<00:02:21.630> deal<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.800> we're<00:02:22.950> gonna<00:02:23.040> push

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
as a testing deal so we're gonna push

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.110 
as a testing deal so we're gonna push
the<00:02:23.459> power<00:02:23.610> button<00:02:23.730> here<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.750> get<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.080> lights

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
the power button here you get the lights

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.180 
the power button here you get the lights
and<00:02:27.120> we're<00:02:27.630> gonna<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:27.990> about<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.560> video<00:02:28.860> here

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
and we're gonna see about the video here

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.630 
and we're gonna see about the video here
and<00:02:32.300> we<00:02:33.300> have<00:02:33.540> synching<00:02:34.080> with<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.350> video<00:02:34.640> so

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
and we have synching with the video so

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.050 
and we have synching with the video so
we<00:02:35.940> know<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.569> video<00:02:37.140> works<00:02:37.760> even<00:02:38.760> though

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
we know that the video works even though

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.460 
we know that the video works even though
that<00:02:39.300> chip<00:02:40.280> shorted<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:42.780> know<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.170> other

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
that chip shorted and we know that other

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.160 
that chip shorted and we know that other
parts<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.400> board<00:02:44.670> work<00:02:44.940> ie<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.600> memory

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
parts on the board work ie the memory

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.210 
parts on the board work ie the memory
the<00:02:46.650> CPU<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:49.410> two<00:02:49.590> chipsets<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:52.290> sub

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
the CPU the two chipsets this sub

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.190 
the CPU the two chipsets this sub
controller<00:02:53.670> here<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:54.690> we're<00:02:54.810> gonna<00:02:54.959> do

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
controller here but what we're gonna do

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.100 
controller here but what we're gonna do
is<00:02:55.380> still<00:02:55.650> pull<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.250> chip<00:02:56.610> off<00:02:56.930> just<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.080> make

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
is still pull that chip off just to make

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.780 
is still pull that chip off just to make
for<00:02:58.500> certain<00:02:58.890> that<00:03:01.160> something's<00:03:02.160> not<00:03:02.310> damaged

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
for certain that something's not damaged

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.979 
for certain that something's not damaged
there<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.870> that's<00:03:04.290> what<00:03:04.410> we're<00:03:04.650> gonna<00:03:04.739> do<00:03:05.989> here

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
there so that's what we're gonna do here

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.130 
there so that's what we're gonna do here
right<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:07.830> so<00:03:08.269> we're<00:03:09.269> gonna<00:03:09.360> take<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:09.870> over

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
right now so we're gonna take this over

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.930 
right now so we're gonna take this over
to<00:03:10.709> our<00:03:11.310> other<00:03:11.750> workbench<00:03:12.750> area<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.940> we're

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
to our other workbench area and we're

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.920 
to our other workbench area and we're
going<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.920> set<00:03:16.920> up<00:03:17.190> for<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.880> parallel<00:03:18.329> remover

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
going to set up for the parallel remover

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.380 
going to set up for the parallel remover
and<00:03:19.160> do<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> little<00:03:20.459> bit<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.670> testing<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.209> see

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
and do a little bit of testing and see

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.620 
and do a little bit of testing and see
if<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:21.600> can't<00:03:21.840> get<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.230> chip<00:03:22.920> off<00:03:26.180> okay<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.239> we

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
if we can't get this chip off okay so we

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.860 
if we can't get this chip off okay so we
have<00:03:27.810> our<00:03:28.430> chip<00:03:29.430> changed<00:03:30.120> out<00:03:30.269> which<00:03:30.720> you

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
have our chip changed out which you

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.680 
have our chip changed out which you
could<00:03:31.049> see<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.380> right<00:03:31.560> there<00:03:32.450> where<00:03:33.450> we've

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
could see it right there where we've

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.039 
could see it right there where we've
replaced<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.120> Reese<00:03:36.120> under<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.600> do<00:03:36.720> one<00:03:36.900> on

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
replaced it and Reese under to do one on

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.289 
replaced it and Reese under to do one on
so<00:03:37.739> what<00:03:37.890> we're<00:03:38.040> gonna<00:03:38.100> do<00:03:38.400> is<00:03:38.610> turn<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.060> on

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
so what we're gonna do is turn this on

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:48.500 
so what we're gonna do is turn this on
and<00:03:42.829> let<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:43.890> run<00:03:44.190> for<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:45.290> few<00:03:46.290> hours<00:03:47.359> like<00:03:48.359> we

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
and let it run for a few hours like we

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.940 
and let it run for a few hours like we
always<00:03:48.690> do<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:50.480> what<00:03:51.480> we're<00:03:51.630> gonna<00:03:51.690> do<00:03:52.019> is<00:03:52.290> let

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
always do so what we're gonna do is let

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.970 
always do so what we're gonna do is let
it<00:03:53.010> boot<00:03:53.220> up<00:03:53.930> which<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.109> actually<00:03:55.230> forgot<00:03:55.769> to

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
it boot up which I actually forgot to

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.740 
it boot up which I actually forgot to
put<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:57.200> keyboard<00:03:58.579> plug<00:03:59.579> in<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.390> we're<00:04:00.660> gonna

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
put the keyboard plug in so we're gonna

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.360 
put the keyboard plug in so we're gonna
have<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.700> restart<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:02.850> computer<00:04:03.390> already<00:04:04.370> to

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
have to restart this computer already to

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.330 
have to restart this computer already to
go<00:04:05.519> into<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.880> BIOS<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:07.680> let's<00:04:07.920> see<00:04:08.130> what

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
go into the BIOS so let's see what

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.440 
go into the BIOS so let's see what
happens

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.320 

this<00:04:12.099> alright<00:04:13.099> so<00:04:13.459> we're<00:04:13.790> gonna<00:04:13.849> turn<00:04:14.150> this

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
this alright so we're gonna turn this

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:22.240 
this alright so we're gonna turn this
off<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:19.700> then<00:04:19.790> turn<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.239> right<00:04:20.480> back<00:04:20.630> on<00:04:21.250> and

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
off and then turn it right back on and

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.620 
off and then turn it right back on and
then<00:04:22.400> we're<00:04:22.550> gonna<00:04:22.669> run<00:04:22.970> it<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.240> see<00:04:23.330> what

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
then we're gonna run it and see what

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:32.129 
then we're gonna run it and see what
happens<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:24.460> we<00:04:25.460> gotta<00:04:27.130> pick<00:04:28.130> this<00:04:28.310> up

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:41.320 

ctrl<00:04:33.139> alt<00:04:33.380> delete<00:04:35.590> delete<00:04:38.560> then<00:04:39.760> press<00:04:40.760> f10<00:04:41.180> to

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
ctrl alt delete delete then press f10 to

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:52.040 
ctrl alt delete delete then press f10 to
see<00:04:41.510> if<00:04:41.600> we<00:04:41.720> can't<00:04:41.990> get<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.290> into<00:04:43.600> buyers<00:04:49.660> so

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
see if we can't get it into buyers so

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.310 
see if we can't get it into buyers so
we<00:04:52.530> have<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:52.830> into<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.220> BIOS<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:54.690> we<00:04:54.870> see<00:04:55.110> that

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
we have it into the BIOS and we see that

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.970 
we have it into the BIOS and we see that
it's<00:04:56.210> I'd<00:04:57.210> say<00:04:57.770> nearly<00:04:59.210> 1350<00:05:00.260> so<00:05:01.260> we're<00:05:01.860> going

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
it's I'd say nearly 1350 so we're going

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.610 
it's I'd say nearly 1350 so we're going
to<00:05:02.040> let<00:05:02.220> this<00:05:02.370> run<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:03.780> do<00:05:03.990> what<00:05:04.170> it<00:05:04.290> needs<00:05:04.320> to

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
to let this run and do what it needs to

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.990 
to let this run and do what it needs to
do<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:06.110> run<00:05:07.110> for<00:05:07.410> a<00:05:07.440> few<00:05:07.680> hours<00:05:07.790> we'll<00:05:08.790> probably

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
do to run for a few hours we'll probably

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.910 
do to run for a few hours we'll probably
run<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.450> for<00:05:09.630> an<00:05:09.720> hour<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.050> see<00:05:10.350> what<00:05:10.500> happens

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
run it for an hour and see what happens

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.080 
run it for an hour and see what happens
and<00:05:11.130> then<00:05:12.090> go<00:05:12.720> from<00:05:12.900> there<00:05:13.190> as<00:05:14.190> you<00:05:14.280> can<00:05:14.430> tell<00:05:14.760> I

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
and then go from there as you can tell I

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.300 
and then go from there as you can tell I
didn't<00:05:15.480> plug<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:17.210> fan<00:05:18.210> in<00:05:18.600> so<00:05:18.990> we<00:05:19.890> plug<00:05:20.130> that

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
didn't plug the fan in so we plug that

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.000 
didn't plug the fan in so we plug that
fan<00:05:20.580> in<00:05:20.820> right<00:05:21.030> there<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.540> we'll<00:05:22.500> let<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.680> run

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
fan in right there and we'll let it run

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.980 
fan in right there and we'll let it run
and<00:05:23.690> do<00:05:24.690> what<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:24.990> needs<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.320> do<00:05:25.590> to<00:05:26.780> test<00:05:27.780> and

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
and do what it needs to do to test and

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.100 
and do what it needs to do to test and
see<00:05:28.140> if<00:05:28.200> that<00:05:29.030> chip<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.150> gonna<00:05:30.330> fail<00:05:30.600> again<00:05:30.630> or

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
see if that chip is gonna fail again or

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.230 
see if that chip is gonna fail again or
not<00:05:31.260> so<00:05:33.620> we'll<00:05:34.620> let<00:05:34.740> it<00:05:34.950> do<00:05:35.460> its<00:05:35.490> thing<00:05:35.730> and<00:05:35.880> see

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
not so we'll let it do its thing and see

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.710 
not so we'll let it do its thing and see
where<00:05:36.390> it<00:05:36.480> goes<00:05:37.340> okay<00:05:38.340> so<00:05:38.400> we've<00:05:38.850> had<00:05:39.270> this<00:05:39.420> run

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
where it goes okay so we've had this run

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.440 
where it goes okay so we've had this run
it<00:05:39.870> for<00:05:40.080> about<00:05:40.170> an<00:05:40.410> hour<00:05:40.850> we<00:05:41.850> can<00:05:42.060> see<00:05:42.240> that

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
it for about an hour we can see that
