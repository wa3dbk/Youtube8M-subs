00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.600 
lot which give us an easier side to side
and<00:04:33.169> then<00:04:33.290> CT<00:04:33.680> side<00:04:33.830> with<00:04:33.950> one<00:04:34.040> pistol<00:04:34.430> so

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
and then CT side with one pistol so

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.130 
and then CT side with one pistol so
we're<00:04:35.150> just<00:04:35.300> cruising<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:35.720> then<00:04:35.840> we<00:04:35.900> started

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
we're just cruising and then we started

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.390 
we're just cruising and then we started
pushing<00:04:36.320> a<00:04:36.470> little<00:04:36.560> bit<00:04:36.770> too<00:04:37.010> aggressively

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
pushing a little bit too aggressively

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.610 
pushing a little bit too aggressively
and<00:04:37.760> they<00:04:38.360> they<00:04:38.840> want<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.020> couple<00:04:39.230> rounds<00:04:39.320> and

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
and they they want a couple rounds and

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.340 
and they they want a couple rounds and
we<00:04:39.710> ended<00:04:40.430> up<00:04:40.580> finishing<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.330> deal<00:04:41.540> so<00:04:41.900> we

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
we ended up finishing the deal so we

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.650 
we ended up finishing the deal so we
play<00:04:42.620> looks<00:04:43.310> like<00:04:43.610> just<00:04:44.030> over<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:44.300> we<00:04:44.360> play<00:04:44.510> x

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
play looks like just over so we play x

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.200 
play looks like just over so we play x
Rio<00:04:44.840> next<00:04:45.260> on<00:04:45.580> inferno<00:04:46.580> for<00:04:46.820> upper<00:04:46.970> bracket

finals<00:04:47.570> should<00:04:47.720> be<00:04:47.840> an<00:04:47.930> interesting<00:04:48.230> match<00:04:48.590> to

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
finals should be an interesting match to

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.100 
finals should be an interesting match to
tune<00:04:48.980> in
