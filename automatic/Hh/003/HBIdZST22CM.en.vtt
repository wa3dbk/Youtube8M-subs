00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
just going to pound some fresh cardamom

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.260 
just going to pound some fresh cardamom
add<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.009> into<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.310> coconut<00:01:50.490> mixture<00:01:53.060> now<00:01:54.060> cook

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
this with all the extra moisture

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.949 
this with all the extra moisture
evaporate<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.209> get<00:01:57.330> a<00:01:57.360> nice<00:01:57.569> thick

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
evaporate and you get a nice thick

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.050 
evaporate and you get a nice thick
consistency<00:01:58.399> this<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.880> your

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
consistency this is going to be your

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.630 
consistency this is going to be your
filling<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:04.170> filling<00:02:04.470> is<00:02:04.590> cooled<00:02:04.860> down<00:02:05.039> next

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
filling the filling is cooled down next

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.789 
filling the filling is cooled down next
step<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.270> make<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.569> pogies<00:02:07.020> take<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.530> little

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
step is to make the pogies take a little

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.979 
step is to make the pogies take a little
dough<00:02:08.069> slack<00:02:08.940> little<00:02:09.330> sensor<00:02:11.420> fill<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.540> with

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
dough slack little sensor fill it with

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:20.020 
dough slack little sensor fill it with
the<00:02:13.170> coconut<00:02:14.069> filling

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.300 

make<00:02:20.660> sure<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.930> seal<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.410> on<00:02:21.530> all<00:02:21.650> sides<00:02:21.680> very

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
make sure you seal it on all sides very

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.880 
make sure you seal it on all sides very
carefully<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.360> don't<00:02:23.480> want<00:02:23.600> any<00:02:23.780> gaps<00:02:26.890> once

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
carefully you don't want any gaps once

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.140 
carefully you don't want any gaps once
you've<00:02:28.100> done<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.570> slash<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.840> little<00:02:30.200> bit

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
you've done that slash it a little bit

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.190 
you've done that slash it a little bit
right<00:02:32.150> keep<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.810> aside<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:34.070> next<00:02:34.220> step<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.730> to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
right keep it aside the next step is to

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.350 
right keep it aside the next step is to
flatten<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.650> Puran<00:02:36.980> Poli<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:37.970> while<00:02:38.120> rolling

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
flatten the Puran Poli so while rolling

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.690 
flatten the Puran Poli so while rolling
out<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.900> puranpoli<00:02:39.620> make<00:02:40.220> sure<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.520> don't

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
out the puranpoli make sure you don't

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.780 
out the puranpoli make sure you don't
add<00:02:40.880> too<00:02:41.300> much<00:02:41.330> pressure<00:02:42.430> because<00:02:43.430> then<00:02:43.700> the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
add too much pressure because then the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.480 
add too much pressure because then the
