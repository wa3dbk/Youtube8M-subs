00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
was developed in 1923 by a guy who was

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.350 
was developed in 1923 by a guy who was
had<00:00:50.920> just<00:00:51.160> had<00:00:51.310> a<00:00:51.340> best<00:00:51.580> friend<00:00:51.850> killed<00:00:52.150> in<00:00:52.300> a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
had just had a best friend killed in a

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.170 
had just had a best friend killed in a
fixed-wing<00:00:52.720> airplane<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:54.670> those<00:00:54.910> days

stalling<00:00:55.810> was<00:00:55.990> a<00:00:56.350> fairly<00:00:56.800> common<00:00:57.100> feature<00:00:57.430> and

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
stalling was a fairly common feature and

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.610 
stalling was a fairly common feature and
he<00:00:58.540> went<00:00:58.750> out<00:00:58.870> of<00:00:58.960> his<00:00:59.080> way<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.260> try<00:00:59.500> and

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
he went out of his way to try and

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.620 
he went out of his way to try and
develop<00:00:59.830> a<00:01:00.160> wing<00:01:00.550> that<00:01:00.790> wouldn't<00:01:01.090> stall<00:01:01.330> and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
develop a wing that wouldn't stall and

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
develop a wing that wouldn't stall and
that's<00:01:02.440> where<00:01:02.740> the<00:01:03.610> airplane<00:01:04.239> was<00:01:04.390> born<00:01:04.659> the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
that's where the airplane was born the

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.310 
that's where the airplane was born the
wing<00:01:06.009> rotates<00:01:06.520> and<00:01:06.909> as<00:01:07.719> long<00:01:07.929> as<00:01:07.960> there<00:01:08.259> was

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
wing rotates and as long as there was

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.260 
wing rotates and as long as there was
air<00:01:08.530> passing<00:01:08.979> over<00:01:09.219> the<00:01:09.310> wing<00:01:09.490> it'll<00:01:09.969> continue

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
air passing over the wing it'll continue

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.989 
air passing over the wing it'll continue
to<00:01:10.420> fly<00:01:10.780> so<00:01:11.409> it's<00:01:11.890> not<00:01:12.039> driven<00:01:12.280> by<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.579> engine

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:12.999 
to fly so it's not driven by the engine

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.529 
to fly so it's not driven by the engine
it's<00:01:13.179> driven<00:01:13.509> by<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.259> air<00:01:14.499> and<00:01:14.999> all<00:01:15.999> we<00:01:16.240> do<00:01:16.390> is

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
it's driven by the air and all we do is

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.690 
it's driven by the air and all we do is
move<00:01:16.749> the<00:01:16.960> aircraft<00:01:17.079> through<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.710> air<00:01:17.829> we're

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
move the aircraft through the air we're

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.029 
move the aircraft through the air we're
pushing<00:01:18.969> it<00:01:19.179> on<00:01:19.659> this<00:01:19.810> one<00:01:20.049> with<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.380> propeller

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
pushing it on this one with a propeller

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.249 
pushing it on this one with a propeller
at<00:01:21.189> the<00:01:21.280> back<00:01:21.429> pushing<00:01:21.880> us<00:01:21.999> along<00:01:22.149> if<00:01:23.020> the

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
at the back pushing us along if the

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.809 
at the back pushing us along if the
engine<00:01:23.649> stops<00:01:23.679> while<00:01:24.219> we<00:01:24.310> just<00:01:24.340> lower<00:01:24.670> the

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
engine stops while we just lower the

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.700 
engine stops while we just lower the
nose<00:01:24.999> and<00:01:25.179> become<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.450> glider<00:01:25.749> and<00:01:26.049> we're<00:01:26.530> still

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
nose and become a glider and we're still

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.889 
nose and become a glider and we're still
pushing<00:01:26.920> air<00:01:27.189> over<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.490> wing<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:28.810> the

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
pushing air over the wing and so the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.770 
pushing air over the wing and so the
wing<00:01:29.049> works<00:01:29.229> rotates<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.549> gives<00:01:31.450> us<00:01:31.569> lift

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
wing works rotates and gives us lift

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.080 
wing works rotates and gives us lift
right<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.619> way<00:01:32.740> down<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:33.460> ground<00:01:33.639> where

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
right the way down to the ground where

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.499 
right the way down to the ground where
we<00:01:34.119> just<00:01:34.389> flare<00:01:34.899> and<00:01:35.789> as<00:01:36.789> I<00:01:36.850> say<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.210> aircraft

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
we just flare and as I say the aircraft

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.950 
we just flare and as I say the aircraft
will<00:01:37.659> land<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.990> organization<00:01:39.569> we<00:01:40.569> similarly

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
will land of organization we similarly

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.539 
will land of organization we similarly

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
seen you around these shows in New

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.370 
seen you around these shows in New

there<00:01:47.259> are<00:01:47.289> probably<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.679> lot<00:01:47.859> more<00:01:47.920> in<00:01:48.490> the

because oh yes for many many years well
the<00:01:54.459> first<00:01:54.670> ones<00:01:54.880> I<00:01:55.060> knew<00:01:55.240> about<00:01:55.359> were<00:01:55.950> 1960s

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
the first ones I knew about were 1960s

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.879 
the first ones I knew about were 1960s
where<00:01:57.549> people<00:01:57.909> were<00:01:58.060> building<00:01:58.450> their<00:01:58.600> own

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:58.889 
where people were building their own

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:02.340 
where people were building their own
machines<00:01:59.889> basically<00:02:00.729> from<00:02:01.299> a<00:02:01.450> set<00:02:02.049> of<00:02:02.139> plans

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
machines basically from a set of plans

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.819 
machines basically from a set of plans
out<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.740> Popular<00:02:03.069> Mechanics<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:04.709> from<00:02:05.709> that

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
out of Popular Mechanics and from that

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.410 
out of Popular Mechanics and from that
day<00:02:06.039> onwards<00:02:06.399> people<00:02:06.729> were<00:02:06.850> teaching

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
day onwards people were teaching

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.719 
day onwards people were teaching
themselves<00:02:07.539> to<00:02:07.840> fly<00:02:08.050> these<00:02:08.110> auto<00:02:08.560> gyros<00:02:09.069> some

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
themselves to fly these auto gyros some

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.910 
themselves to fly these auto gyros some
were<00:02:09.849> towed<00:02:10.090> behind<00:02:10.269> act<00:02:10.720> bike<00:02:11.230> behind<00:02:11.470> cars

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
were towed behind act bike behind cars

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.720 
were towed behind act bike behind cars
in

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
in

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.690 
in
form<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.090> gliders<00:02:13.390> being<00:02:13.810> towed<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:15.580> was

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
form of gliders being towed and that was

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.690 
form of gliders being towed and that was
a<00:02:15.730> good<00:02:15.970> way<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.150> get<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.870> feel<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:18.069> cherub

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
a good way to get a feel of a cherub

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.070 
a good way to get a feel of a cherub
before<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.030> put<00:02:19.180> an<00:02:19.299> engine<00:02:19.569> on<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:19.930> went

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
before you put an engine on it and went

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.759 
before you put an engine on it and went
flying<00:02:20.319> but<00:02:21.190> yes<00:02:21.430> there's<00:02:21.730> quite<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.569> few

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
flying but yes there's quite a few

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.580 
flying but yes there's quite a few
backyards<00:02:23.769> and<00:02:23.920> garages<00:02:24.549> with<00:02:25.440> possibly<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
remains of a few of these machines

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.869 
remains of a few of these machines
tucked<00:02:29.319> away

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
tucked away

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.009 
tucked away
you<00:02:30.879> mentioned<00:02:31.150> this<00:02:31.239> machine<00:02:31.510> itself<00:02:31.810> is

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
you mentioned this machine itself is

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.740 
you mentioned this machine itself is
from<00:02:32.620> Germany<00:02:33.220> are<00:02:33.670> they<00:02:33.790> big<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.060> Europe<00:02:34.209> yes

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
from Germany are they big in Europe yes

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750 
from Germany are they big in Europe yes
the<00:02:35.049> this<00:02:35.739> company<00:02:36.099> has<00:02:36.190> produced<00:02:36.340> two

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
the this company has produced two

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.339 
the this company has produced two
thousand<00:02:37.180> machines<00:02:37.629> in<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.930> last<00:02:38.080> five<00:02:38.319> years

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
thousand machines in the last five years

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.880 
thousand machines in the last five years
so<00:02:39.340> their<00:02:40.060> workforces<00:02:40.840> increased<00:02:41.440> from<00:02:41.709> about

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
so their workforces increased from about

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.860 
so their workforces increased from about
core<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.879> 16<00:02:43.810> when<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.230> first<00:02:44.500> knew<00:02:44.709> him<00:02:44.890> in

core of 16 when I first knew him in

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.479 
core of 16 when I first knew him in

pretty extreme what's your take on that
on<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.859> demo<00:03:40.169> though<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.319> demo<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:41.769> well

Jarrah<00:03:48.400> plane<00:03:48.639> is<00:03:48.849> that<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:49.180> needs<00:03:49.359> to<00:03:49.540> have

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
Jarrah plane is that it needs to have

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.979 
Jarrah plane is that it needs to have
positive<00:03:50.230> G<00:03:50.440> at<00:03:50.560> all<00:03:50.739> times<00:03:51.389> that<00:03:52.389> may<00:03:52.630> sound<00:03:52.870> a

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
positive G at all times that may sound a

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.420 
positive G at all times that may sound a
little<00:03:53.019> technical<00:03:53.500> but<00:03:53.680> basically<00:03:54.280> you're

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
little technical but basically you're

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.879 
little technical but basically you're
encouraging<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.450> rotors<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:56.079> keep<00:03:56.470> turning

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
encouraging the rotors to keep turning

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.800 
encouraging the rotors to keep turning
by<00:03:57.010> pushing<00:03:57.340> air<00:03:57.489> through<00:03:57.519> them<00:03:57.910> if<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:58.690> go

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
by pushing air through them if you go

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.050 
by pushing air through them if you go
negative<00:03:59.079> then<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.980> air<00:04:00.310> flow<00:04:00.549> goes<00:04:00.879> the

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
negative then the air flow goes the

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.430 
negative then the air flow goes the
other<00:04:01.180> way<00:04:01.389> comes<00:04:01.810> down<00:04:01.959> on<00:04:02.079> top<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.379> the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
other way comes down on top of the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.680 
other way comes down on top of the
rotors<00:04:02.769> so<00:04:02.919> they<00:04:03.040> slow<00:04:03.280> down<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.790> that<00:04:04.239> sound

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
rotors so they slow down and that sound

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.309 
rotors so they slow down and that sound
knock<00:04:05.290> doesn't<00:04:05.919> make<00:04:06.010> for<00:04:06.160> a<00:04:06.220> good<00:04:06.250> day<00:04:06.519> so<00:04:07.319> as

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
knock doesn't make for a good day so as

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.289 
knock doesn't make for a good day so as
long<00:04:08.470> as<00:04:08.620> we<00:04:08.739> keep<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.340> positive<00:04:09.730> G<00:04:09.910> there<00:04:10.120> we

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
long as we keep the positive G there we

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.270 
long as we keep the positive G there we
can<00:04:10.449> throw<00:04:10.629> the<00:04:10.840> airplane<00:04:11.199> around<00:04:11.560> in<00:04:11.769> the

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
can throw the airplane around in the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.170 
can throw the airplane around in the
confidence<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.359> it<00:04:14.319> will<00:04:14.620> enable<00:04:15.459> us<00:04:15.669> to<00:04:15.730> put

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
confidence so it will enable us to put

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.640 
confidence so it will enable us to put
it<00:04:16.299> on<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.539> ground<00:04:16.780> at<00:04:16.930> any<00:04:16.959> time<00:04:17.349> if<00:04:17.530> we<00:04:17.620> need

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
it on the ground at any time if we need

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.520 
it on the ground at any time if we need
to<00:04:18.030> well<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.090> believe<00:04:19.419> that<00:04:19.570> when<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.229> get<00:04:20.470> a

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
to well I believe that when you get a

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.490 
to well I believe that when you get a
plectrum<00:04:20.979> adjara<00:04:21.579> plane

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
plectrum adjara plane

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
and you get a professionally talked to

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.690 
and you get a professionally talked to
pilot<00:04:24.960> you've<00:04:25.530> got<00:04:25.740> probably<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.280> safest

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
pilot you've got probably the safest

pilot you've got probably the safest

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
combination that you can get I'm flying

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.530 
combination that you can get I'm flying
over<00:04:28.650> New<00:04:28.800> Zealand<00:04:29.340> with<00:04:29.610> some<00:04:30.120> hostile

over New Zealand with some hostile

over New Zealand with some hostile
terrain<00:04:31.190> it's<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.280> pretty<00:04:32.640> good<00:04:32.910> idea<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.360> have

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
terrain it's a pretty good idea to have

terrain it's a pretty good idea to have
something<00:04:33.780> that<00:04:34.080> you're<00:04:34.770> going<00:04:34.920> to<00:04:35.010> walk<00:04:35.160> away
