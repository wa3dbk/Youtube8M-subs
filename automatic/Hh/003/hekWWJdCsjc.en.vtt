00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
it's pushed in this feels pretty good

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.630 
it's pushed in this feels pretty good

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
here and you can see how precisely cut

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.890 
here and you can see how precisely cut
all<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:23.010> switches<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.490> ports<00:02:25.090> are<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.600> has

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
all the switches and ports are and has

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.260 
all the switches and ports are and has
that<00:02:26.080> awesome<00:02:26.500> same<00:02:27.160> feel<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.850> textured

that awesome same feel that textured
back<00:02:28.510> as<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.800> nexus<00:02:30.340> 7<00:02:30.700> does<00:02:30.910> right<00:02:31.660> now

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
back as the nexus 7 does right now

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
back as the nexus 7 does right now
without<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.200> case<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:35.080> is<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.290> nice

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
without a case so this is a nice

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.160 
without a case so this is a nice
integration<00:02:36.100> here<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.940> here's<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.900> front

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
integration here and here's that front

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.080 
integration here and here's that front
flat<00:02:38.410> but<00:02:38.710> since<00:02:39.100> we<00:02:39.250> know<00:02:39.400> there's<00:02:39.640> magnet

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
flat but since we know there's magnet

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.780 
flat but since we know there's magnet
magnets<00:02:40.720> inside<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.350> nexus<00:02:41.800> 7<00:02:42.130> similar<00:02:42.580> to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
magnets inside the nexus 7 similar to

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.770 
magnets inside the nexus 7 similar to
the<00:02:43.210> ipad<00:02:43.780> 3<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:45.250> ipad<00:02:45.580> 2<00:02:45.850> i'm<00:02:46.540> very

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
the ipad 3 and the ipad 2 i'm very

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.540 
the ipad 3 and the ipad 2 i'm very
surprised<00:02:47.200> i<00:02:47.380> didn't<00:02:47.620> put<00:02:47.770> any<00:02:47.950> kind<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.400> a

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
surprised i didn't put any kind of a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.120 
surprised i didn't put any kind of a
magnetic<00:02:48.880> strip<00:02:49.270> on<00:02:49.420> here<00:02:49.750> at<00:02:50.620> all<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.070> it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
magnetic strip on here at all and it

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.480 
magnetic strip on here at all and it
just<00:02:51.310> feels<00:02:51.460> kind<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.940> flimsy<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:53.070> I'm<00:02:54.070> almost

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
just feels kind of flimsy and I'm almost

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.210 
just feels kind of flimsy and I'm almost
wondering<00:02:54.790> if<00:02:55.210> I<00:02:55.930> just<00:02:56.140> rather<00:02:56.350> not<00:02:56.710> have<00:02:57.190> that

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
wondering if I just rather not have that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.000 
wondering if I just rather not have that
on<00:02:57.670> there<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.720> can't<00:02:58.960> even<00:02:59.050> prop<00:02:59.740> it<00:02:59.920> up

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
on there and you can't even prop it up

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.110 
on there and you can't even prop it up
or<00:03:00.220> anything<00:03:00.280> there's<00:03:01.240> no<00:03:01.390> support<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:03.120> I

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
or anything there's no support and I

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.290 
or anything there's no support and I
almost<00:03:04.870> wonder<00:03:05.140> if<00:03:05.640> me<00:03:06.640> I'm<00:03:06.820> not<00:03:06.970> too<00:03:07.150> crazy

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
almost wonder if me I'm not too crazy

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.910 
almost wonder if me I'm not too crazy
about<00:03:07.480> screen<00:03:07.900> cover<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.410> I'm<00:03:08.620> almost

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
about screen cover so I'm almost

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.290 
about screen cover so I'm almost
wondering<00:03:09.130> if<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.490> would<00:03:09.550> just<00:03:09.850> rather<00:03:10.000> have

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
wondering if I would just rather have

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.330 
wondering if I would just rather have
that<00:03:10.510> back<00:03:10.870> case<00:03:11.140> on<00:03:11.350> without<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.890> maybe<00:03:12.160> with

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
that back case on without it maybe with

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.700 
that back case on without it maybe with
a<00:03:12.400> screen<00:03:12.730> protector<00:03:12.880> or<00:03:13.270> something<00:03:13.630> but<00:03:14.500> for

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
a screen protector or something but for

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.900 
a screen protector or something but for
people<00:03:14.830> that<00:03:15.100> are<00:03:15.220> looking<00:03:15.310> for<00:03:15.640> screen

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
people that are looking for screen

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.570 
people that are looking for screen
protection<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:16.720> closing<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.590> up<00:03:17.680> like<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.250> book

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
protection and closing it up like a book

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.410 
protection and closing it up like a book
then<00:03:19.239> this<00:03:20.020> might<00:03:20.260> be<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.680> case<00:03:20.860> for<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.420> so

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
then this might be the case for you so

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.740 
then this might be the case for you so
it<00:03:22.540> doesn't<00:03:22.570> feel<00:03:22.900> too<00:03:24.209> bulky<00:03:25.209> or<00:03:25.360> anything

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
it doesn't feel too bulky or anything

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.300 
it doesn't feel too bulky or anything
but<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.200> flap<00:03:26.470> is<00:03:26.680> probably<00:03:27.010> going<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.250> end

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
but that flap is probably going to end

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.610 
but that flap is probably going to end
up<00:03:27.430> getting<00:03:27.700> in<00:03:27.820> my<00:03:27.970> way<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.570> looks<00:03:29.440> like

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
up getting in my way and looks like

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.979 
up getting in my way and looks like
there<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.280> doesn't<00:03:30.640> come<00:03:31.000> off<00:03:31.030> too<00:03:31.330> easily<00:03:31.540> but

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
there it doesn't come off too easily but

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.220 
there it doesn't come off too easily but
it's<00:03:32.489> it's<00:03:33.489> also<00:03:33.700> not<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:33.970> snug<00:03:34.360> fit<00:03:34.750> but<00:03:35.080> it

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
it's it's also not the snug fit but it

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.410 
it's it's also not the snug fit but it
does<00:03:35.470> feel<00:03:35.800> decent<00:03:36.610> enough<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.180> where<00:03:37.330> you

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
does feel decent enough to where you

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.729 
does feel decent enough to where you
know<00:03:37.540> it's<00:03:37.690> not<00:03:37.840> going<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.020> slip<00:03:38.260> off<00:03:38.410> of<00:03:38.590> there

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
know it's not going to slip off of there

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.030 
know it's not going to slip off of there
so<00:03:39.730> I<00:03:39.760> do<00:03:39.970> like<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.510> back<00:03:40.720> on<00:03:40.959> there<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.440> if

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
so I do like the back on there and if

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.800 
so I do like the back on there and if
this<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.730> official<00:03:43.030> accessory<00:03:43.780> that

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
this is the official accessory that

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.720 
this is the official accessory that
you're<00:03:44.050> looking<00:03:44.140> forward<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.860> not<00:03:45.130> add<00:03:45.400> too

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
you're looking forward to not add too
