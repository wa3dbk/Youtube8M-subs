00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.860
 something that if so what and do not feel that if 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.110

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:50.129
 my experience with tattoos and is the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.129
 First 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.950
 it was the past and you see the story is a 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.210
 super extensive story and I do not know if I'm going to 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:04.210
 know summarize the but basically it 's a 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.690
 animal is a symbol that relaxes me 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.790
 me that transmits tranquility and 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.530
 done when it's good if you've seen the 50 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.979
 things about me you will know that I have had 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.450
 panic and anxiety attacks lately 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.390
 I do not know why everyone has 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.060
 anxiety and it's like what's happening is 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.009
 very hard that is something that does not leave you 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.350
 lead a normal life especially if 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.060
 you have a pronounced anxiety like 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.619
 that I had just as happens that the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.950
 Most of the time you have to 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.479
 america you have to take anxiolytics 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.460
 what happens with the anxiolytics what happens 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.149
 with this kind of pills 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.670
 tranquilizers that are makes your 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.700
 body gets used and also 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.219
 they usually have muscle relaxants 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.219
 soft how it goes beyond those keys 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.430
 what's up with this because talking about 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.630
 pills, well, what happens is that 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.030
 I wanted to leave this topic of the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.860
 pills what I hate first of all I hate 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.530
 the drugs the truth is that when 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.630
 I get sick I try to heal with 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.630
 natural remedies or mobile home 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.379
 no no 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.740
 the one I have on the beach in front of 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.740
 home 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.000
 but I'm not here with you counting 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.569
 the little things I left the pills for me 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.120
 account 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.120
 little by little and with very good process 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.580
 what happens what 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.280
 I bought a book in which there was 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.660
 butterflies 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.270
 It was a drawing and coloring book 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.010
 that had many butterflies for you 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.280
 the colors as you would like is not a 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.940
 foolishness that the candy store appears in 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.220
 Coloring draw 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.410
 It relaxes a lot I dedicated myself for the 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.760
 afternoons 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.680
 to color and with the butterfly then 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:09.610
 thanks to that a little so to speak 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.610
 I could get out of that anxiety crisis that 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.700
 now 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.680
 and when I leave the pills or the 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.230
 complete the medication throws it to the 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.720
 garbage and I realized that myself 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.030
 I had overcome a pretty phase 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.920
 complicated goal I had the butterfly that more 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.720
 I need that book that's the story 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.000
 of the first tattoo 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.910
 we go with the second the second 12 that 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.220
 I did it I did it a year and then 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.220
 which is the neck of a key of the sun 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.620
 it's a shared tattoo my best friend 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.340
 has the same but I have a r has 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.989
 a shame because then as you will know a lot 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.080
 if you follow me for a long time my name 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:04.459
 real is father and my best friend is called 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.290
 she went to live the normal man 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.719
 whole and she 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.359
 we were very united to be all the 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.829
 days together to stay for the night 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.049
 with the other one 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.889
 we were almost like sisters we followed 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.910
 being but until his birthday 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.910
 I gave him a tattoo 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.080
 special for twelve 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.080
 Y 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.409
 speaks of just basically because 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.869
 we shared musical tastes with 16 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:41.169
 years and we see that with certain data are 

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:43.860
 well our presented 16 years of 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.860
 concert 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:53.020
 the same we see ourselves and that 's the story 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:58.709
 It's a little short but it's pretty and 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.709
 last the most recent is this 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.770
 it's a common thing 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.770
 initials is still a little healing 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.449
 the p la r and the m and a rose 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:26.449
 this tattoo is very special it is hard 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:28.720
 because the initials are from my sisters 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.860
 and boy and the rose 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.889
 for my mother 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.210
 that he died when I was 12 years old 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.030
 impact 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.740
 is something that I have already overcome good not 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.050
 exceeded because it is not something that is exceeded 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.120
 easily the loss of a loved one 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:51.210
 and more not to be loved as a father 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:53.970
 but I do not know I do not have my hard moments 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.620
 like everyone but it does not hurt 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.870
 talk about it because it's something that has 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.660
 past and you have already assumed that life is 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.300
 so sometimes from things to aesthetics 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.990
 things and good is a rose because I 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.990
 send weeks 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.160
 and I wanted to tell you taking advantage of this 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.920
 tattoo I think if you have any 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:20.070
 family member who is sick now that there is 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.970
 so much cancer out there and so much disease 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.710
 and to be very strong is worth because those 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.800
 people who are sick do not want 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.440
 to see ourselves badly is a very hard disease and 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.520
 I send you a lot of strength from here to all 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.650
 those people who have family 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:39.600
 sick or who have lost someone to 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:42.030
 cause of the disease do not think that 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.590
 the world ends because no matter how 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.820
 the world ends with continuing to fulfill 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.650
 our dreams keep fulfilling 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.340
 our goals because those people 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.340
 they want 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.629
 I encourage you to do the tattoos because it is 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:58.979
 something beautiful is something that I personally 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:01.900
 like much long as it 's on 5 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:03.999
 with the help of professionals please 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.409
 do not study and cousins ​​of tattoos have 

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:07.839
 Be very careful with that, because they are 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:09.789
 single- use needles and if you do not 

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:12.879
 well apart from staying for life 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:14.559
 and then the statues them like that with 

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:16.120
 a fact not played with that because it 

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:19.659
 can enter transmit diseases 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.020
 also be careful and nothing else we see in 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:22.020
 the pre-salt
