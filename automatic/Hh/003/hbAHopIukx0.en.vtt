 German steel Anatoly 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.770
 Ivanovich 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.410

 switched to this steel all knives makes out 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:04.030
 This steel she behaves while very 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:08.740
 not bad and sharpening 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.190
 the cutting edge is of course the most interesting 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.870
 in this knife it is his original lock 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.590
 castle lesson which consists of two 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.620
 the walls of the handle and shutter 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.000
 which brings them together here there are two 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.870
 stubborn pin 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.030
 one here here on the blade and 2 inside we 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.670
 we will not see it we can see a hole 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:43.630
 in which he enters and when our 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:48.930
 the shutter opens and turns 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:53.560
 then both of these pins 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.710
 stabilize this blade inside the hilt 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.010
 respectively, one outside one inside 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:03.100
 and the walls also clamp this blade 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.230
 accordingly we have a system at 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.510
 which has no backlash 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.390
 and longitudinal and the knife becomes something 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.870
 like fix and so very reliable 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.580
 powerful system about 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.380
 opening-closing the knife all this 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:23.430
 done without effort that is 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:30.480
 the shutter opens fully 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.480
 Janos itself unfolds close the shutter 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.040
 in order to fold the knife also exactly 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:39.160
 we take it all the way to the end and just 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.380
 simply slightly change the angle of the knife 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.580
 all I do not even any hand 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.400
 movements no inertia nothing 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.650
 the blade itself is folded accordingly 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:57.720
 close and it can no longer decompose 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:02.130
 let's take a closer look I will try 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.130

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.660
 as you can see the workmanship 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.300
 exceptionally high all facets removed 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.870
 everything is done almost perfect everything 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.870
 licked 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:30.500
 very nice interesting here is the knife 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.470
