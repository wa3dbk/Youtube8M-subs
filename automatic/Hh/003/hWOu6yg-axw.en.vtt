little<00:01:42.390> more<00:01:42.570> ominously<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.140> little<00:01:43.710> bit<00:01:43.799> more

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
little more ominously a little bit more

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.350 
little more ominously a little bit more
of<00:01:43.979> an<00:01:44.130> ominous<00:01:44.400> feeling<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.880> know<00:01:44.970> into<00:01:45.270> this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
of an ominous feeling you know into this

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.260 
of an ominous feeling you know into this
kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> an<00:01:45.900> occupied<00:01:46.320> type<00:01:46.560> London<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
kind of an occupied type London and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.039 
kind of an occupied type London and
airships<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> sky<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.869> course

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
airships in the sky that of course

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.140 
airships in the sky that of course
didn't<00:01:49.259> exist<00:01:49.500> at<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.680> time<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.729> gives<00:01:50.939> an

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
didn't exist at the time but it gives an

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.270 
didn't exist at the time but it gives an
almost<00:01:51.450> believable<00:01:51.869> reality<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.650> it<00:01:52.680> people

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
almost believable reality to it people

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.620 
almost believable reality to it people
actually<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.700> could<00:01:53.790> probably<00:01:54.030> sell<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.420> to

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
actually you could probably sell that to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.030 
actually you could probably sell that to
people<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.140> oh<00:01:55.290> maybe<00:01:55.500> London<00:01:55.799> was

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
people and be like oh maybe London was

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.490 
people and be like oh maybe London was
like<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.400> back<00:01:56.579> then<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.840> know<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.350> we

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
like that back then and I know what we

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.289 
like that back then and I know what we
what<00:01:58.829> we've<00:01:58.950> done<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.880> game<00:02:00.090> takes

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
what we've done is that this game takes

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.280 
what we've done is that this game takes
place<00:02:00.360> after<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.780> Industrial<00:02:01.079> Revolution

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
place after the Industrial Revolution

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.580 
place after the Industrial Revolution
and<00:02:02.210> that<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.570> trigger<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:04.200> happens<00:02:04.500> in

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and that that trigger that happens in

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.280 
and that that trigger that happens in
our<00:02:04.680> history<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.909> trigger<00:02:06.240> when<00:02:06.509> man<00:02:06.840> takes

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
our history is a trigger when man takes

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.080 
our history is a trigger when man takes
over<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.160> war<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.549> has<00:02:08.670> been<00:02:08.820> going<00:02:08.940> on

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
over in this war that has been going on

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.060 
over in this war that has been going on
for<00:02:09.149> centuries<00:02:09.450> they<00:02:10.229> take<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> upper<00:02:10.890> hand

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
for centuries they take the upper hand

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.979 
for centuries they take the upper hand
by<00:02:11.370> being<00:02:11.549> able<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.880> build<00:02:12.060> weapons<00:02:12.269> by<00:02:12.660> having

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
by being able to build weapons by having

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.080 
by being able to build weapons by having
amazing<00:02:13.230> technology<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.040> they<00:02:14.400> use<00:02:14.760> to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
amazing technology that they use to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.390 
amazing technology that they use to
fight<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.989> war<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.500> has<00:02:16.650> been<00:02:16.799> lasting<00:02:17.100> for<00:02:17.280> so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
fight a war that has been lasting for so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.800 
fight a war that has been lasting for so
long<00:02:17.549> but<00:02:17.760> they<00:02:17.940> were<00:02:18.030> losing<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.600> time

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
long but they were losing all this time

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.840 
long but they were losing all this time
it's<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.260> war<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.680> has<00:02:20.250> been<00:02:20.370> going<00:02:20.489> on<00:02:20.670> for

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
it's a war that has been going on for

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.800 
it's a war that has been going on for
centuries<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.299> mean

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
centuries I mean

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.510 
centuries I mean
and<00:02:21.989> probably<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:23.069> tell<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.280> more<00:02:23.370> than<00:02:23.489> a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
and probably I can tell you more than a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.050 
and probably I can tell you more than a
million<00:02:23.700> millennia<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:26.160> way<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.940> whole

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
million millennia and the way the whole

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.309 
million millennia and the way the whole
thing<00:02:27.239> start<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.750> there<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> trigger

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
thing start is that there is a trigger

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.339 
thing start is that there is a trigger
you<00:02:28.620> know<00:02:28.739> IP<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.550> changes<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.360> way<00:02:30.510> humans

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
you know IP that changes the way humans

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.190 
you know IP that changes the way humans
you<00:02:31.830> know<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:32.550> go<00:02:33.420> through<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.690> history<00:02:33.840> and

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
you know like go through the history and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.650 
you know like go through the history and
that<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.099> that<00:02:35.430> trigger<00:02:35.670> brings<00:02:36.270> about<00:02:36.390> this

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
that that that trigger brings about this

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.420 
that that that trigger brings about this
war<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.080> starts<00:02:37.410> small<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:38.040> know<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.250> one

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
war that starts small you know in one

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.770 
war that starts small you know in one
place<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:38.940> then<00:02:39.090> slowly<00:02:39.300> starts<00:02:39.599> growing

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
place but then slowly starts growing

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.559 
place but then slowly starts growing
around<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.440> know<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.650> world<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.099> this<00:02:42.000> this

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
around you know the world and this this

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.630 
around you know the world and this this
game<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.110> particular<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.769> window<00:02:44.250> into<00:02:44.430> that

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
game in particular is a window into that

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.150 
game in particular is a window into that
wall<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.330> know<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:46.260> built<00:02:46.470> an<00:02:46.590> IP<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.920> really

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
wall you know we built an IP that really

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.440 
wall you know we built an IP that really
wasn't<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.670> game<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:47.940> was<00:02:48.000> something<00:02:48.300> much

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
wasn't just a game it was something much

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.940 
wasn't just a game it was something much
bigger<00:02:48.599> but<00:02:49.140> what<00:02:49.260> we<00:02:49.349> want<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.620> give<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
bigger but what we want to give the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.770 
bigger but what we want to give the
players<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.519> really<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> window<00:02:51.300> into<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.660> to

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
players is really a window into it to

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.970 
players is really a window into it to
make<00:02:51.810> them<00:02:52.050> understand<00:02:52.530> what<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.800> whole

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
make them understand what this whole

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.789 
make them understand what this whole
thing<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.819> visually<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:55.110> can<00:02:55.350> definitely

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
thing is so visually you can definitely

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.140 
thing is so visually you can definitely
expect<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.160> out<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.580> game<00:02:56.819> as<00:02:57.030> you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
expect this out of the game as you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.330 
expect this out of the game as you
played<00:02:57.360> actually<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.380> cinematic<00:02:59.220> in

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
played actually this is a cinematic in

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.130 
played actually this is a cinematic in
some<00:02:59.519> ways<00:02:59.670> where<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.269> cinematic<00:03:01.019> done

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
some ways where it is a cinematic done

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.509 
some ways where it is a cinematic done
in<00:03:01.260> game<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.709> that's<00:03:02.069> what<00:03:02.190> we're<00:03:02.400> planning

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
in game and that's what we're planning

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.009 
in game and that's what we're planning
on<00:03:02.730> doing<00:03:02.940> we<00:03:03.120> plan<00:03:03.330> on<00:03:03.450> not<00:03:03.600> having<00:03:03.780> any

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
on doing we plan on not having any

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.500 
on doing we plan on not having any
scenes<00:03:04.350> between<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.850> cinematics<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.420> you

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
scenes between the cinematics that you

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.789 
scenes between the cinematics that you
find<00:03:06.720> normally<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.260> know<00:03:07.349> like<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.680> know<00:03:07.769> uh

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
find normally you know like you know uh

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.500 
find normally you know like you know uh
you<00:03:08.370> know<00:03:08.459> pre-rendered<00:03:08.970> stuff<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:09.390> see

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
you know pre-rendered stuff that you see
