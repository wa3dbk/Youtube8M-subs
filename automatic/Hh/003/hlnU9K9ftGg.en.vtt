00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.220
 well in the next exercise we are going to 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.650
 calculate the standard potential of a 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.590
 series of batteries the first of them is 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.650
 this one that we see here change changed more 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.050
 silver plus silver good when we have 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.539
 this note of a pile remember 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.630
 that on the left we have the anode is 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.880
 say the oxidation semi-reaction that 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.330
 on the right the cathode the emigration of 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.280
 reduction by giving here automatically 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.000
 we know we have him 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.000
 loves 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.070
 that is, oxidation 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.949
 and to the right they are indicating us the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.949
 cathode 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.170
 that is to say 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.620
 the reduction therefore the semi-reaction 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.620
 oxidation 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.159
 of this process this stack will be 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.159
 the one in which instead 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.280
 happens to meat in addition to the loss of 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.520
 the electrons as it is in fact 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.980
 written here from change to cadmium is more 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.680
 while the semi-reaction of 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.190
 reduction will be that in which the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.370
 silver happens to us silver metallic silver 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.370
 plus 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.960
 dissolved also would also be dissolved 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:37.430
 the silver gets the electron to give 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.220
 metallic silver well the overall process 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.550
 would be explaining this selection here 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.140
 by two the electrons will be simplified 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.090
 and we will have what 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.670
 the change 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.670
 reacts with the silver more 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:06.320
 giving two more silver and more 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.929
 plus two silver 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.180
 this would be the process now let's see 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.330
 how we calculate the standard potential of 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.269
 this pile remember that to calculate it 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.629
 we just had to make potential 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.390
 of penalty equal to the standard potential 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.599
 of the series of action that takes place on 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.510
 rescued that is from the least dilution 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.760
 the standard potential of the semi 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.090
 reaction that takes place at the anode is 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.090
 say the swing so much for this 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.209
 pile in particular the cathode is silver 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.060
 the reduction and potential of silver 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:51.099
 it's 0.80 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.890
 volts less potential long on 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.770
 this case the oxidation of the change that 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.950
 has a potential of minus 0 40 volts 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.200
 we have to subtract and thus put back 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.910
 his sign and that corresponds to him therefore 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:11.500
 minus minus 0.40 this will leave us at 0.80 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.260
 plus 0.40 and we'll have 1.20 volts 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.590
 this would be the potential of this first 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.590
 battery
