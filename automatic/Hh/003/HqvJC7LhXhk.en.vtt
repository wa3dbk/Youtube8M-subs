00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.120 
auto so right now I'm in medium and I've
already<00:00:33.329> used<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.750> mic<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> shoot<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.950> it

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
already used this mic for a shoot and it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.630 
already used this mic for a shoot and it
was<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> very<00:00:35.579> loud<00:00:36.170> outdoor<00:00:37.170> PA<00:00:37.469> system<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.370> my

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
was a very loud outdoor PA system and my

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
was a very loud outdoor PA system and my
audio<00:00:38.969> was<00:00:39.120> completely<00:00:39.600> distorted<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.530> Nikon

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
audio was completely distorted the Nikon

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.459 
audio was completely distorted the Nikon
d50<00:00:41.550> 100<00:00:42.090> has<00:00:42.270> no<00:00:42.629> way<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.989> checking<00:00:43.230> your

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
d50 100 has no way of checking your

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.160 
d50 100 has no way of checking your
levels<00:00:43.950> there's<00:00:44.550> no<00:00:44.789> level<00:00:45.239> meters<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
levels there's no level meters so you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
levels there's no level meters so you
just<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.860> guess<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.489> get<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.789> know

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
just have to guess it and get to know

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.540 
just have to guess it and get to know
your<00:00:48.390> microphone<00:00:48.989> settings<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:50.010> mic<00:00:50.309> has

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
your microphone settings this mic has

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.689 
your microphone settings this mic has
pads<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:52.079> they're<00:00:52.260> tiny<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.370> mean

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
pads on it but they're tiny and I mean

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.000 
pads on it but they're tiny and I mean
tiny<00:00:54.149> little<00:00:54.600> switches<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.620> battery

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
tiny little switches in the battery

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.260 
tiny little switches in the battery
compartment<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:57.329> set<00:00:57.570> those<00:00:57.780> pads<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.270> you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
compartment to set those pads up so you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.700 
compartment to set those pads up so you
do<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.629> too<00:01:00.780> many<00:01:00.930> times<00:01:01.050> you're<00:01:01.379> probably

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
do that too many times you're probably

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.860 
do that too many times you're probably
just<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> break<00:01:02.460> them<00:01:02.690> because<00:01:03.690> they

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
just going to break them because they

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.490 
just going to break them because they
are<00:01:04.019> really<00:01:04.680> hard<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> get<00:01:06.000> at<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:07.200> am

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
are really hard to get at so I just am

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.440 
are really hard to get at so I just am
not<00:01:07.950> messing<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.549> pads<00:01:08.820> I'm<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.240> using

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
not messing with the pads I'm just using

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.980 
not messing with the pads I'm just using
my<00:01:09.780> settings<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.530> my<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:11.040> my<00:01:11.100> camera<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
my settings on my on my camera the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.429 
my settings on my on my camera the
better<00:01:13.140> cameras<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.790> Nikon<00:01:15.290> d800<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
better cameras like the Nikon d800 and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.570 
better cameras like the Nikon d800 and
the<00:01:16.560> d600<00:01:17.189> they<00:01:18.180> will<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:19.070> more<00:01:20.070> level

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the d600 they will have more level

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.600 
the d600 they will have more level
control<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.420> they<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.810> meters<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.250> that's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
control and they have meters so that's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.630 
control and they have meters so that's
good<00:01:24.170> but<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.979> work<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
good but you know you work with what you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.179 
good but you know you work with what you
have<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.930> microphone<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.560> great

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
have so I think this microphone is great

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.160 
have so I think this microphone is great
compared<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> built-in<00:01:30.450> mic<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.960> it's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
compared to the built-in mic and it's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.870 
compared to the built-in mic and it's
only<00:01:31.610> 100<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.960> 100<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.020> some<00:01:34.229> odd<00:01:34.320> dollars

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
only 100 and 100 and some odd dollars

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.420 
only 100 and 100 and some odd dollars
you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.030> find<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.479> Amazon<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.140> BH<00:01:37.920> any<00:01:38.220> one

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you can find it on Amazon or BH any one

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.210 
you can find it on Amazon or BH any one
of<00:01:38.460> those<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.140> like<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> sound<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> at<00:01:41.009> this

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
of those I like the sound of it at this

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.330 
of those I like the sound of it at this
distance<00:01:41.759> better<00:01:42.060> than<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> lapel<00:01:42.869> mic<00:01:43.340> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
distance better than the lapel mic and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.560 
distance better than the lapel mic and
the<00:01:44.490> noise<00:01:44.750> ratio<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.780> pretty<00:01:46.259> good<00:01:47.240> my<00:01:48.240> lapel

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the noise ratio is pretty good my lapel

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.210 
the noise ratio is pretty good my lapel
mic<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.020> its<00:01:49.200> own<00:01:49.380> seems<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> little

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
mic on its own seems to be a little

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.880 
mic on its own seems to be a little
noisy<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.210> Nikon<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.899> its<00:01:52.079> own<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.619> it's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
noisy and the Nikon on its own just it's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.120 
noisy and the Nikon on its own just it's
recording<00:01:53.549> quality<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> little<00:01:54.810> hissy<00:01:55.200> so

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
recording quality is a little hissy so

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.819 
recording quality is a little hissy so
this<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:57.000> Mike<00:01:57.270> seems<00:01:57.600> usable<00:01:58.140> now<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.680> I

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
this this Mike seems usable now if I

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.580 
this this Mike seems usable now if I
move<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.250> camera<00:01:59.430> back<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:01.140> course<00:02:01.350> I'll<00:02:01.560> be

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
move the camera back of course I'll be

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.999 
move the camera back of course I'll be
out<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.860> focus<00:02:03.439> there<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.590> go

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
out of focus there we go

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.940 
out of focus there we go
obviously<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.360> picking<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:06.960> way<00:02:07.710> less

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
obviously it's now picking up way less

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.550 
obviously it's now picking up way less
level<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:08.580> voice<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.810> also<00:02:10.020> picking

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
level on my voice and it's also picking

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.170 
level on my voice and it's also picking
up<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.800> lot<00:02:11.009> more<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.459> room

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
up a lot more of the room

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.720 
up a lot more of the room
this<00:02:12.719> room<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.140> carpeted<00:02:13.709> it's<00:02:14.040> not<00:02:14.219> that<00:02:14.459> big

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
this room is carpeted it's not that big

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.670 
this room is carpeted it's not that big
so<00:02:15.000> there's<00:02:15.209> not<00:02:15.359> a<00:02:15.420> lot<00:02:15.659> of<00:02:15.689> bounce<00:02:16.079> going<00:02:16.500> on

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
so there's not a lot of bounce going on

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.259 
so there's not a lot of bounce going on
here<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.159> my<00:02:17.310> guess<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.790> audio<00:02:18.090> quality

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
here so my guess is the audio quality

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.640 
here so my guess is the audio quality
might<00:02:18.780> still<00:02:19.109> be<00:02:19.290> good

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
might still be good

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.199 
might still be good
so<00:02:19.859> the<00:02:19.980> next<00:02:20.159> thing<00:02:20.310> I'm<00:02:20.459> going<00:02:20.579> to<00:02:20.640> do<00:02:20.879> is

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
so the next thing I'm going to do is

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.660 
so the next thing I'm going to do is
just<00:02:21.420> show<00:02:21.659> you<00:02:21.719> the<00:02:21.930> difference<00:02:21.959> between<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
just show you the difference between the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.929 
just show you the difference between the
rode<00:02:23.909> videomic<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.409> nikon<00:02:25.890> built-in<00:02:26.670> mic

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
rode videomic and the nikon built-in mic

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.360 
rode videomic and the nikon built-in mic
and<00:02:27.530> obviously<00:02:28.530> there's<00:02:28.769> going<00:02:28.889> to<00:02:28.950> be<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.099> big

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
and obviously there's going to be a big

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.179 
and obviously there's going to be a big
difference<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.909> quality<00:02:30.739> okay<00:02:31.739> now<00:02:31.980> I'm<00:02:32.159> just

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
difference in quality okay now I'm just

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.569 
difference in quality okay now I'm just
using<00:02:32.639> the<00:02:32.939> internal<00:02:33.599> mic<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:35.010> camera

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
using the internal mic the camera

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.539 
using the internal mic the camera
onboard<00:02:35.700> camera<00:02:36.450> mic<00:02:36.659> of<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.019> Nikon<00:02:37.379> d50<00:02:38.010> 100

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
onboard camera mic of the Nikon d50 100

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.030 
onboard camera mic of the Nikon d50 100
and<00:02:38.730> as<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:39.030> can<00:02:39.209> hear<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:40.200> quality<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.799> much

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
and as you can hear the quality is much

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.220 
and as you can hear the quality is much
better<00:02:41.310> using<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.969> rode<00:02:42.209> videomic<00:02:42.719> as

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
better using the rode videomic as

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.800 
better using the rode videomic as
opposed<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.069> using<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.579> onboard<00:02:44.760> camera<00:02:45.599> mic

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
opposed to using the onboard camera mic

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.229 
opposed to using the onboard camera mic
so<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> think<00:02:46.919> it's<00:02:47.250> worth<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.459> money<00:02:47.849> for<00:02:48.120> this

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
so I think it's worth the money for this

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.990 
so I think it's worth the money for this
microphone<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.079> know<00:02:49.620> as<00:02:49.769> far<00:02:50.040> as<00:02:50.099> plusses

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
microphone you know as far as plusses

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.690 
microphone you know as far as plusses
and<00:02:51.030> minuses<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:52.530> all<00:02:52.950> plastic

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
and minuses it's all plastic

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.629 
and minuses it's all plastic
it's<00:02:54.299> very<00:02:55.049> probably<00:02:55.590> easy<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:56.099> break<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
it's very probably easy to break the

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.500 
it's very probably easy to break the
shoe<00:02:56.939> mount<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.540> all<00:02:57.780> plastic<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.239> little

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
shoe mount is all plastic and the little

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.250 
shoe mount is all plastic and the little
rubber<00:03:00.719> things<00:03:01.109> that<00:03:01.409> it's<00:03:01.560> all<00:03:01.709> attached<00:03:02.159> to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
rubber things that it's all attached to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.349 
rubber things that it's all attached to
probably<00:03:04.260> will<00:03:04.950> go<00:03:05.189> bad<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.879> you'll<00:03:06.000> have<00:03:06.180> to

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
probably will go bad and you'll have to

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.629 
probably will go bad and you'll have to
replace<00:03:06.629> them<00:03:07.019> so<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.439> got<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.950> keep<00:03:08.099> extras

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
replace them so you got to keep extras

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.240 
replace them so you got to keep extras
of<00:03:08.669> those<00:03:09.000> around<00:03:09.389> it<00:03:09.780> uses<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> 9-volt<00:03:10.799> battery

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
of those around it uses a 9-volt battery

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.129 
of those around it uses a 9-volt battery
it's<00:03:11.669> supposed<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.120> last<00:03:12.389> 10<00:03:12.780> hours<00:03:12.810> of

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
it's supposed to last 10 hours of

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.409 
it's supposed to last 10 hours of
recording<00:03:13.889> and<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.669> think<00:03:14.939> there<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.239> little

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
recording and I think there is a little

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:16.670 
recording and I think there is a little
light<00:03:15.689> on<00:03:15.840> there<00:03:16.049> that's<00:03:16.229> going<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.409> show<00:03:16.620> you

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
light on there that's going to show you

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.500 
light on there that's going to show you
if<00:03:16.889> the<00:03:17.010> battery's<00:03:17.430> starting<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:17.879> go<00:03:18.030> dead<00:03:18.329> or

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
if the battery's starting to go dead or

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.920 
if the battery's starting to go dead or
not<00:03:18.979> so<00:03:19.979> you<00:03:20.340> know<00:03:20.519> it's<00:03:21.209> good<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:21.540> certain

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
not so you know it's good for certain

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.259 
not so you know it's good for certain
uses<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.530> other<00:03:22.680> thing<00:03:22.949> is<00:03:23.099> it's<00:03:23.310> it's<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.849> mono

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
uses the other thing is it's it's a mono

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.439 
uses the other thing is it's it's a mono
microphone<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:25.620> records<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.579> two<00:03:26.849> channels

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
microphone it records to two channels

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.289 
microphone it records to two channels
but<00:03:28.319> it<00:03:28.439> records<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.040> same<00:03:29.310> thing<00:03:29.669> a<00:03:29.909> mono

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
but it records the same thing a mono

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.719 
but it records the same thing a mono
channel<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.199> mono<00:03:31.530> channel<00:03:32.099> it<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.459> not<00:03:32.699> a

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
channel and a mono channel it is not a

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.000 
channel and a mono channel it is not a
stereo<00:03:33.479> mic<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.139> if<00:03:34.169> you<00:03:34.409> want<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.680> record

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
stereo mic so if you want to record

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.270 
stereo mic so if you want to record
stereo<00:03:35.639> ambience<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:37.199> mic<00:03:37.470> will<00:03:37.739> not<00:03:37.949> do

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
stereo ambience this mic will not do

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.390 
stereo ambience this mic will not do
that<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:39.239> good<00:03:39.569> for<00:03:39.840> voiceover<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.680> I

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
that it's good for voiceover and I

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.330 
that it's good for voiceover and I
prefer<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.750> sound<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.199> it<00:03:43.319> over<00:03:43.769> my<00:03:43.919> my

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
prefer it the sound of it over my my

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.550 
prefer it the sound of it over my my
little<00:03:44.609> lapel<00:03:45.090> mic<00:03:45.329> it<00:03:45.599> just<00:03:45.930> has<00:03:46.169> a<00:03:46.199> nice

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
little lapel mic it just has a nice

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.189 
little lapel mic it just has a nice
round<00:03:47.040> or<00:03:47.280> fatter<00:03:47.489> sound<00:03:47.849> so<00:03:48.629> it's<00:03:48.989> good<00:03:49.169> for

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
round or fatter sound so it's good for

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.499 
round or fatter sound so it's good for
some<00:03:49.560> uses<00:03:49.919> not<00:03:50.129> good<00:03:50.370> for<00:03:50.519> others<00:03:50.849> but<00:03:51.449> for

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:51.509 
some uses not good for others but for

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:52.969 
some uses not good for others but for
the<00:03:51.780> money<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.109> think<00:03:52.349> it's<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.680> pretty<00:03:52.889> good

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
the money I think it's a pretty good

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:56.179 
the money I think it's a pretty good
deal<00:03:53.340> but<00:03:53.579> do<00:03:53.790> make<00:03:53.939> a<00:03:54.000> pro<00:03:54.359> model<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:55.739> haven't

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
deal but do make a pro model I haven't

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.890 
deal but do make a pro model I haven't
really<00:03:56.400> looked<00:03:56.549> at<00:03:56.699> it<00:03:56.759> to<00:03:57.000> see<00:03:57.180> if<00:03:57.269> it's<00:03:57.419> got<00:03:57.569> a

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
really looked at it to see if it's got a

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.240 
really looked at it to see if it's got a
better<00:03:58.349> mounting<00:03:59.180> scenario<00:04:00.180> but<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:02.069> other

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
better mounting scenario but the other

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.009 
better mounting scenario but the other
thing<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.639> can<00:04:02.790> get<00:04:03.000> with<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.329> is<00:04:03.509> a<00:04:03.569> boom

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
thing you can get with this is a boom

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.869 
thing you can get with this is a boom
pole<00:04:04.349> which<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.799> bought<00:04:05.009> because<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.549> was<00:04:05.639> very

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
pole which I bought because it was very

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.469 
pole which I bought because it was very
cheap<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:07.889> can<00:04:08.189> have<00:04:08.759> a<00:04:08.790> longer<00:04:09.120> wire

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
cheap and so you can have a longer wire

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.020 
cheap and so you can have a longer wire
and<00:04:09.840> record<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.739> on<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.009> boom<00:04:11.250> over<00:04:11.609> your

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
and record it on the boom over your

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.390 
and record it on the boom over your
talent<00:04:12.509> as<00:04:12.659> opposed<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.620> having<00:04:13.889> it<00:04:14.099> attached

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
talent as opposed to having it attached

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.460 
talent as opposed to having it attached
to<00:04:14.430> your<00:04:14.729> camera<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.720> can<00:04:15.840> have<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.019> separate

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
to your camera you can have a separate

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.949 
to your camera you can have a separate
person<00:04:16.859> doing<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.280> boom<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.789> record<00:04:18.780> with

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
person doing the boom and record with

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.120 
person doing the boom and record with
your<00:04:19.109> cameras

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.090 

so<00:04:23.120> thanks<00:04:23.630> for<00:04:23.780> watching<00:04:23.840> my<00:04:24.410> review<00:04:24.470> of<00:04:24.860> the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
so thanks for watching my review of the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.520 
so thanks for watching my review of the
rode<00:04:25.400> videomic<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.540> recommend<00:04:27.410> this

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
rode videomic I recommend this

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.400 
rode videomic I recommend this
microphone<00:04:28.130> for<00:04:28.970> certain<00:04:29.420> uses<00:04:29.630> it<00:04:30.050> certainly

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
microphone for certain uses it certainly

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.000 
microphone for certain uses it certainly
is<00:04:30.590> cheap<00:04:30.890> enough<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.370> give<00:04:31.550> it<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.730> try<00:04:32.030> and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
is cheap enough to give it a try and

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.310 
is cheap enough to give it a try and
it's<00:04:34.010> way<00:04:34.250> better<00:04:34.460> than<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:35.180> onboard<00:04:35.810> mic<00:04:36.050> on

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
it's way better than the onboard mic on

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.460 
it's way better than the onboard mic on
your<00:04:36.680> D<00:04:36.860> 50-100<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.000> most<00:04:38.390> likely<00:04:38.780> way<00:04:39.200> better

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
your D 50-100 and most likely way better

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.620 
your D 50-100 and most likely way better
than<00:04:39.740> any<00:04:40.070> microphones<00:04:40.730> that<00:04:40.940> are<00:04:41.000> built<00:04:41.300> into

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
than any microphones that are built into

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.620 
than any microphones that are built into
these<00:04:41.870> cameras<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:43.060> again<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:44.210> can<00:04:44.360> attach

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
these cameras and again you can attach

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.260 
these cameras and again you can attach
it<00:04:44.660> to<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:44.990> boom<00:04:45.350> pole<00:04:45.680> with<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.580> longer<00:04:46.910> cable

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
it to a boom pole with a longer cable

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.140 
it to a boom pole with a longer cable
and<00:04:47.720> not<00:04:48.710> have<00:04:48.950> it<00:04:48.980> attached<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.730> camera

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
and not have it attached to the camera

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.630 
and not have it attached to the camera
so<00:04:50.630> it's<00:04:50.900> got<00:04:51.110> multi-purpose<00:04:51.860> uses<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.460> other

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
so it's got multi-purpose uses the other

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.610 
so it's got multi-purpose uses the other
thing<00:04:52.880> I'm<00:04:53.000> going<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.180> do<00:04:53.420> is<00:04:53.630> a<00:04:53.660> quick<00:04:53.990> test<00:04:54.380> of

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
thing I'm going to do is a quick test of

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.400 
thing I'm going to do is a quick test of
the<00:04:54.740> microphone<00:04:55.310> directly<00:04:56.300> into<00:04:56.870> Pro<00:04:57.110> Tools

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
the microphone directly into Pro Tools

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.290 
the microphone directly into Pro Tools
as<00:04:57.680> opposed<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.280> recording<00:04:58.790> it<00:04:58.910> into<00:04:59.180> the

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
as opposed to recording it into the

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.600 
as opposed to recording it into the
camera<00:04:59.780> okay<00:05:00.500> so<00:05:00.560> now<00:05:00.920> I'm<00:05:01.070> recording

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
camera okay so now I'm recording

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.360 
camera okay so now I'm recording
directly<00:05:02.150> into<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:02.720> computer<00:05:02.930> via<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.130> rode

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
directly into the computer via the rode

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.720 
directly into the computer via the rode
mic<00:05:04.700> just<00:05:05.540> to<00:05:05.750> see<00:05:05.990> an<00:05:06.350> audio<00:05:06.830> comparison<00:05:07.580> of

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
mic just to see an audio comparison of

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.000 
mic just to see an audio comparison of
recording<00:05:08.180> directly<00:05:08.750> into<00:05:09.140> the<00:05:09.230> mic<00:05:09.440> I'm<00:05:09.770> also

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
recording directly into the mic I'm also

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.400 
recording directly into the mic I'm also
talking<00:05:10.460> very<00:05:10.970> closely<00:05:11.390> to<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:11.840> mic<00:05:12.050> and<00:05:12.080> I'm

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
talking very closely to the mic and I'm

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.830 
talking very closely to the mic and I'm
going<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.950> line<00:05:13.250> input<00:05:13.580> with<00:05:14.120> an<00:05:14.240> adapter

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
going to the line input with an adapter

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.490 
going to the line input with an adapter
into<00:05:15.200> my<00:05:15.380> in<00:05:15.650> box<00:05:15.860> pro<00:05:16.420> so<00:05:17.420> this<00:05:17.660> is<00:05:17.810> a<00:05:17.840> test<00:05:18.230> of

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
into my in box pro so this is a test of

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.380 
into my in box pro so this is a test of
the<00:05:18.620> rode<00:05:18.830> mic<00:05:18.860> directly<00:05:19.790> to<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.180> computer

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
the rode mic directly to the computer

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.510 
the rode mic directly to the computer
and<00:05:20.930> just<00:05:21.620> see<00:05:21.740> if<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.950> quality<00:05:22.070> difference

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
and just see if the quality difference

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.390 
and just see if the quality difference
is<00:05:22.940> even<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.570> much<00:05:23.780> better<00:05:24.110> recording<00:05:25.010> into

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
is even that much better recording into

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.250 
is even that much better recording into
say<00:05:25.820> a<00:05:25.850> good<00:05:26.270> recorder<00:05:26.750> you<00:05:26.930> could<00:05:27.110> also

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
say a good recorder you could also

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.050 
say a good recorder you could also
record<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:27.860> directly<00:05:28.220> intellect<00:05:28.730> one<00:05:28.970> of

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
record it directly intellect one of

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.820 
record it directly intellect one of
those<00:05:29.210> tasks<00:05:29.510> and<00:05:29.780> portable<00:05:30.350> recorders

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
those tasks and portable recorders

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.070 
those tasks and portable recorders
instead<00:05:31.220> of<00:05:31.340> directly<00:05:31.730> into<00:05:32.060> your<00:05:32.090> camera<00:05:32.570> but

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
instead of directly into your camera but

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.010 
instead of directly into your camera but
then<00:05:33.230> you<00:05:33.350> have<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.650> resync<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.220> audio<00:05:34.580> later

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
then you have to resync the audio later

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.450 
then you have to resync the audio later
chances<00:05:36.020> are<00:05:36.140> the<00:05:36.320> quality<00:05:36.830> though<00:05:37.010> might<00:05:37.280> be

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
chances are the quality though might be

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.400 
chances are the quality though might be
better<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:38.480> only<00:05:38.570> thing<00:05:38.810> about<00:05:38.930> this<00:05:39.170> camera

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
better the only thing about this camera

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.340 
better the only thing about this camera
also<00:05:39.710> is<00:05:40.040> it's<00:05:40.340> a<00:05:40.460> mini<00:05:40.700> plug<00:05:41.000> there<00:05:41.330> is<00:05:41.480> no<00:05:41.720> XLR

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
also is it's a mini plug there is no XLR

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.430 
also is it's a mini plug there is no XLR
jack<00:05:42.710> it<00:05:42.950> is<00:05:43.400> not<00:05:43.610> a<00:05:43.640> pro<00:05:44.030> camera<00:05:44.600> so<00:05:45.080> it's

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
jack it is not a pro camera so it's

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.580 
jack it is not a pro camera so it's
really<00:05:45.770> for<00:05:46.160> these<00:05:46.510> prosumer<00:05:47.510> digital<00:05:48.080> SLR

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
really for these prosumer digital SLR

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.860 
really for these prosumer digital SLR
cameras<00:05:49.100> that<00:05:49.280> have<00:05:49.460> a<00:05:49.490> mini<00:05:49.850> plug<00:05:50.210> in<00:05:50.450> and<00:05:50.690> you

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
cameras that have a mini plug in and you

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.980 
cameras that have a mini plug in and you
want<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.200> just<00:05:51.380> have<00:05:51.710> better<00:05:52.130> audio<00:05:52.940> for<00:05:53.900> your

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
want to just have better audio for your

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.500 
want to just have better audio for your
camera<00:05:54.320> but<00:05:54.920> again<00:05:55.280> it's<00:05:55.580> mono<00:05:55.940> it's<00:05:56.300> not

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510
