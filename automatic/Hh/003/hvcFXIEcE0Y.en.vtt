00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.710
 give dick damn everything hello my name is 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.000
 Valerie by the beginning of 2015 I already wanted 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.400
 get together and still continue to shoot 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.330
 video open some serious projects 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.970
 and wanted this year to create three games and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.599
 as you see, I was trying to do something 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.149
 to make 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.600
 I decided to create my first load on the engine 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.750
 unity and looked looked so thought 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.329
 and realized that there is no more I will not 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.789
 do on unity because i 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.680
 unity I don't know and study unity with me 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.230
 it just takes a lot of time and 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.809
 I don’t have time for the end of the year and therefore I’m 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.149
 I decided that my game from unity 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.109
 I will not do j on any other 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.730
 unity engine of course very cool burn 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.399
 I have nothing against him very much 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.769
 cool engine all superbly done 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.520
 I like it very much but it will take me to study 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.250
 a lot of time I was stuck even on the menu then 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.770
 there is a menu that may be easier yes but 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.710
 to create a menu for me here 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.110
 c1 turns white learn to watch different videos 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.900
 tuturial and read all sorts of articles and then 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.060
 Already for the whole day right all day 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.759
 getting out of the computer i can do 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.820
 me there yes but it is really very long 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.740
 and I just do not want myself and therefore I 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.229
 the game will be done on another engine on that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.310
 only those that I know well and generally with 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.020
 what did it have to do some games 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.780
 long standing in general I then all this 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.750
 I'll tell you all then find out for now 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.440
 what game and discuss the topic I will not say but 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.440
 then at the end of the summer I think 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.200
 I'll release my first game if not 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.880
 the end of the summer then at the end of the year I wanted 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.890
 Of course, release three games, but as always 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.870
 some of the problem as always something 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.420
 It does not work but it is already being formed 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.880
 own team not even one absence 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.890
 teams a team that will do 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.200
 games and the team that will be me 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.660
 help shoot a video and that's basically 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.340
 I am very happy before I had too 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.890
 some of their own teams but all this 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.860
 broke up for various reasons that's all 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.740
 Of course, reboot soon I will tell you about 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.800
 it all but is now something but I return 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.340
 people on youtube and how you see 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.890
 a serious project that I will not give up 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.390
 I will continue to finish this game I will do and 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.970
 as I said at least at the end of the summer and 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.160
 maximum at the end of this year will be released 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.170
 first game she will be just awesome and 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.630
 there will be many more presentations to the trailer 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.640
 video and I'll give you everything so beautiful 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.650
 and the action that you like my game 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.030
 initially the game will be released under the platform 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.670
 windows with those 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.230
 and then I want to import under 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.660
 android and hereinafter what 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.580
 platforms will come out this we will see but 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.590
 initially what said will be seen 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.360
 when the game comes out, we’ll all let you know 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.700
 separate video for now what you have left 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.560
 just wait, we of course create the game 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.480
 it's not that fast and it's not that 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.820
 Cheap view for schedule minutes to roll off 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.620
 still a lot of money but in spite of this I 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.090
 still finish this project I hope that 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.610
 that you support me with your likes 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.110
 patience and of course comments 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.480
 who you write under this video 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.160
 write something to think about it all and I 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.769
 I will try to inform you somehow 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.750
 about how my project is progressing but 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.220
 meanwhile on it all put the huskies wait 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.220
 and good luck everyone
