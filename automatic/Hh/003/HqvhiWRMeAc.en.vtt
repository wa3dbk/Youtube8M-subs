 they are providing military service here 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.220
 in this unit we know a little bit of 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.090
 how our compatriots live 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 they are serving the fatherland 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.470

 on land when you see me when you see me 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.180

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 and nothing 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.340
 ferrer 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.770
 and 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.359
 if conditions you want to contain it 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.359
 I say to my people 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.340
 we joined for a day in a 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.930
 battalion to see the activities that 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.240
 realize our compatriots who are 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.830
 providing the service of the motherland ago 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780
 a time in depth the young people had 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.460
 panic to military service when 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.710
 they watched a command did not care 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.600
 jump the wall higher or jump by the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.340
 bigger ravine but now with the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.229
 unemployment that is in the country the majority 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.820
 of the battalions are full of these 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.680
 Hondurans who decide to appear 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.080
 voluntarily because here they have 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.869
 food clothes and earn the minimum wage 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.970
 that they are practically free 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.460
 this is how you should see if you 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.440
 talk as there are people there there is quite 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.229
 professional people technicians in 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.299
 Computing experts bachilleres there is another 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.640
 people with exercises and really that 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.500
 they look for the armed forces because outside 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.560
 the situation around the world if you 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.819
 ask if you have the opportunity 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.580
 ask him and he will see that the majority 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.830
 they come for this because there is no lack of 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.470
 employment there are no sources of work in the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.530
 country and this here has its roof 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.550
 food that has dress so 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.410
 less 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.120
 has the part of the health insurance that 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.130
 anyone who has then does not have 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.600
 that the hospital after the notice that the 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.400
 school so here we have hospital 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.480
 military that has the capacity to 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.040
 learn it and that is worth admiring in 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.670
 the armed force as an institution 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.440
 which can thus serve the population and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.490
 help alleviate unemployment a little 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.890
 when a soldier wins approximately 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.190
 earn five thousand to five thousand of something from 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.620
 lempiras and only it is removed 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.350
 what the military hospital they do 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.570

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.430
 pm on him and takes away that they 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.820
 when they leave, it's like a saving 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.820
 they have 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.530
 to the lack of measures to overcome 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.579
 of our nation 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.870
 we will march determined to the war 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.760

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:53.330
 and military discipline has not changed 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.740
 although it is true the punishments are not 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.420
 the same as it is now prohibited 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.070
