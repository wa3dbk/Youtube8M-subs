00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
series I just wanted to upload this

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.729 
series I just wanted to upload this
gameplay<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.200> thought<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.500> kind

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
gameplay because I thought it was kind

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.020 
gameplay because I thought it was kind
of<00:00:40.800> funny<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.460> decided<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.910> use<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
of funny because I decided to use a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.020 
of funny because I decided to use a
assault<00:00:42.930> shield<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:44.040> actually<00:00:44.250> helped<00:00:44.879> us

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
assault shield and it actually helped us

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
assault shield and it actually helped us
a<00:00:45.149> ton<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.780> might<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.410> reason<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.800> won

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
a ton and might be that reason we won

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.279 
a ton and might be that reason we won
because<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:48.120> were<00:00:48.210> actually<00:00:48.360> playing<00:00:48.809> against

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
because we were actually playing against

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.920 
because we were actually playing against
Porto<00:00:49.649> Ricans<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:51.449> was<00:00:51.750> their

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
Porto Ricans in this and it was their

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.279 
Porto Ricans in this and it was their
host<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.530> map<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.570> obviously<00:00:54.570> they're

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
host on this map so obviously they're

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.170 
host on this map so obviously they're
gonna<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> huge<00:00:55.860> advantage<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.550> mean<00:00:56.730> they

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
gonna have a huge advantage I mean they

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.299 
gonna have a huge advantage I mean they
all<00:00:57.539> live<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.899> Puerto<00:00:58.050> Rico<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:59.070> live

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
all live in Puerto Rico and we all live

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.700 
all live in Puerto Rico and we all live
in<00:00:59.340> California<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.750> they<00:01:00.989> were<00:01:01.050> definitely<00:01:01.500> at

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
in California so they were definitely at

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.860 
in California so they were definitely at
an<00:01:01.859> advantage<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.820> definitely<00:01:03.120> helped

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
an advantage so this definitely helped

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.240 
an advantage so this definitely helped
us<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.199> think<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.530> ended<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.769> winning<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250

something like that which might be a

something like that which might be a
little<00:01:29.970> bit<00:01:30.150> more<00:01:30.270> entertaining<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.770> just

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
little bit more entertaining I just

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.230 
little bit more entertaining I just
thought<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.640> search<00:01:32.880> might<00:01:33.119> be

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
thought this search might be

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.310 
thought this search might be
entertaining<00:01:33.570> because<00:01:33.780> i'm<00:01:34.020> using<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
entertaining because i'm using the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.760 
entertaining because i'm using the
assault<00:01:34.590> shield<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.450> actually<00:01:36.960> not<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
assault shield and it's actually not a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.819 
assault shield and it's actually not a
bad<00:01:37.920> class<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.000> honest<00:01:39.390> because<00:01:39.659> at<00:01:40.619> least

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
bad class to be honest because at least

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.170 
bad class to be honest because at least
these<00:01:41.100> guys<00:01:41.340> didn't<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:41.850> know<00:01:41.970> how<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
these guys didn't really know how to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.480 
these guys didn't really know how to
counter<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.600> um<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.860> only<00:01:43.890> thing<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.430> can

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
counter it um the only thing I can

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.219 
counter it um the only thing I can
really<00:01:44.670> think<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.570> wasn't<00:01:46.079> using

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
really think of is that I wasn't using

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.580 
really think of is that I wasn't using
flak<00:01:46.740> jacket<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.369> class<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.380> if<00:01:49.380> they

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
flak jacket on this class so if they

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.560 
flak jacket on this class so if they
were<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:50.100> made<00:01:50.820> me<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.149> something<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
were to made me or something like that

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.510 
were to made me or something like that
that<00:01:51.750> could<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.229> worked<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.009> don't<00:01:53.189> think

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that could have worked but I don't think

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.160 
that could have worked but I don't think
they<00:01:53.610> really<00:01:53.909> realized<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:54.780> maybe<00:01:54.960> they

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
they really realized that or maybe they

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.270 
they really realized that or maybe they
weren't<00:01:55.320> using<00:01:55.560> nades<00:01:55.799> at<00:01:55.950> all<00:01:56.100> I'm<00:01:56.250> not

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
weren't using nades at all I'm not

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.120 
weren't using nades at all I'm not
really<00:01:56.520> too<00:01:56.729> sure<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:58.140> was<00:01:58.350> one<00:01:58.799> thing

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
really too sure so that was one thing

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.090 
really too sure so that was one thing
but<00:01:59.430> um<00:02:00.210> I'm<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:01.170> they<00:02:01.320> could<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.619> stunned<00:02:01.950> me

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
but um I'm or they could have stunned me

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.679 
but um I'm or they could have stunned me
uh<00:02:02.310> yeah<00:02:02.850> they<00:02:03.000> could<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.299> stunned<00:02:03.509> me<00:02:03.600> as

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
uh yeah they could have stunned me as

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.870 
uh yeah they could have stunned me as
well<00:02:03.840> because<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.170> wasn't<00:02:04.530> using<00:02:04.770> tack<00:02:05.159> mass<00:02:05.490> so

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
well because I wasn't using tack mass so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.510 
well because I wasn't using tack mass so
those<00:02:06.540> are<00:02:06.570> two<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:07.290> guess<00:02:07.530> counters<00:02:08.340> they

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
those are two I guess counters they

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.369 
those are two I guess counters they
could<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.849> used<00:02:09.119> but<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.750> guess<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.080> didn't

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
could have used but I guess they didn't

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.630 
could have used but I guess they didn't
think<00:02:10.560> about<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.800> or<00:02:11.069> something<00:02:11.430> I'm<00:02:11.550> not

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
think about that or something I'm not

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.790 
think about that or something I'm not
really<00:02:11.819> too<00:02:12.060> sure<00:02:12.200> because<00:02:13.200> they<00:02:13.440> didn't

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
really too sure because they didn't

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.560 
really too sure because they didn't
they'd<00:02:13.890> never<00:02:14.070> even<00:02:14.430> stunned<00:02:14.880> me<00:02:15.030> or<00:02:15.150> nade<00:02:15.390> me

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
they'd never even stunned me or nade me

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.390 
they'd never even stunned me or nade me
once<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.020> don't<00:02:16.230> think<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.650> go<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.070> see

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
didn't I just I guess I just wasn't

feeling I'm not really sure the main

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.460 
feeling I'm not really sure the main
reason<00:03:02.730> i<00:03:03.180> think<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.660> just<00:03:03.780> because<00:03:04.140> i<00:03:04.170> know<00:03:04.320> a

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
reason i think is just because i know a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.720 
reason i think is just because i know a
lot<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.710> people<00:03:04.800> don't<00:03:05.190> want<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.400> watch<00:03:05.550> me

of<00:03:11.070> some<00:03:11.280> pro<00:03:11.520> player<00:03:11.790> or<00:03:11.910> something<00:03:11.940> which<00:03:12.330> is

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
of some pro player or something which is

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.360 
of some pro player or something which is
definitely<00:03:12.750> understandable<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.590> you're

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
definitely understandable like you're

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.040 
definitely understandable like you're
probably<00:03:14.610> not<00:03:14.880> i<00:03:14.910> could<00:03:15.120> learn<00:03:15.420> much<00:03:15.690> from<00:03:15.870> me

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
probably not i could learn much from me

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.570 
probably not i could learn much from me
playing<00:03:16.290> competitive<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.100> only<00:03:17.340> really

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
playing competitive the only really

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.340 
playing competitive the only really
thing<00:03:17.820> maybe<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.330> can<00:03:18.480> watch<00:03:18.750> me<00:03:18.989> get<00:03:19.170> better

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
thing maybe you can watch me get better

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.720 
thing maybe you can watch me get better
or<00:03:19.650> something<00:03:19.920> like<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.040> i'm<00:03:20.400> not<00:03:20.550> too<00:03:20.700> sure

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
or something like that i'm not too sure

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.300 
or something like that i'm not too sure
so<00:03:21.570> that's<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.140> main<00:03:22.440> reason<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.010> viewership

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
so that's the main reason the viewership

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.250 
so that's the main reason the viewership
shows<00:03:23.760> as<00:03:23.970> well<00:03:24.000> like<00:03:24.360> I'll<00:03:24.570> pull<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.900> lot<00:03:25.110> more

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
shows as well like I'll pull a lot more

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.930 
shows as well like I'll pull a lot more
viewers<00:03:25.590> i'm<00:03:25.739> playing<00:03:26.160> public<00:03:26.520> match<00:03:26.670> then<00:03:26.910> I

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
viewers i'm playing public match then I

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.300 
viewers i'm playing public match then I
will<00:03:27.150> competitive<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.310> definitely

will competitive so definitely

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.420 
will competitive so definitely
understandable<00:03:30.380> you'll<00:03:31.380> see<00:03:31.560> like<00:03:31.770> optic

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
understandable you'll see like optic

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.400 
understandable you'll see like optic
nadeshot<00:03:32.580> like<00:03:33.000> pulls<00:03:33.330> like<00:03:33.480> twelve<00:03:33.959> thousand

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
nadeshot like pulls like twelve thousand

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.170 
nadeshot like pulls like twelve thousand
viewers<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.800> entire<00:03:35.070> time<00:03:35.400> or<00:03:35.700> whatever<00:03:35.880> in

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
viewers the entire time or whatever in

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.690 
viewers the entire time or whatever in
it's<00:03:36.690> even<00:03:36.870> hard<00:03:37.230> for<00:03:37.320> other<00:03:37.739> pro<00:03:38.160> players<00:03:38.430> to

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
it's even hard for other pro players to

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.970 
it's even hard for other pro players to
really<00:03:38.940> stream<00:03:39.239> competitive<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.410> mean<00:03:40.770> for

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
really stream competitive so I mean for

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.500 
really stream competitive so I mean for
me<00:03:41.160> it's<00:03:41.370> not<00:03:41.550> I<00:03:41.850> don't<00:03:42.180> think<00:03:42.300> it's<00:03:42.390> gonna

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
me it's not I don't think it's gonna

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.390 
me it's not I don't think it's gonna
work<00:03:42.600> out<00:03:42.989> like<00:03:43.200> extremely<00:03:43.709> well<00:03:43.980> but<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.190> can

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
work out like extremely well but I can

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.070 
work out like extremely well but I can
definitely<00:03:44.489> try<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.030> if<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.630> guys<00:03:45.840> actually

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
definitely try it if you guys actually

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.260 
definitely try it if you guys actually
want<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.470> see<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.680> just<00:03:47.550> leave<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.730> comment<00:03:48.239> or

want to see that just leave a comment or

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.729 
want to see that just leave a comment or
something<00:03:48.630> telling<00:03:48.959> me<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.200> I'll<00:03:49.260> be<00:03:49.410> sure<00:03:49.440> to

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
do it I actually might stream a

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.190 
do it I actually might stream a
tournament<00:03:53.880> on<00:03:54.000> sunday<00:03:54.390> I'm<00:03:54.720> thinking<00:03:55.020> about

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
tournament on sunday I'm thinking about

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.510 
tournament on sunday I'm thinking about
because<00:03:55.380> it's<00:03:55.530> an<00:03:55.650> actual<00:03:55.770> tournament<00:03:56.190> so

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
because it's an actual tournament so

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.060 
because it's an actual tournament so
people<00:03:56.820> might<00:03:56.940> be<00:03:57.090> interested<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:58.070> it's

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
people might be interested in that it's

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.370 
people might be interested in that it's
on<00:03:59.489> sunday<00:04:00.180> i<00:04:00.209> believe<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.900> starts<00:04:00.930> around

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
on sunday i believe it starts around

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.240 
on sunday i believe it starts around
noon<00:04:01.709> maybe<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.720> pacific<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:04.020> i'll<00:04:05.010> probably

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
noon maybe to pacific so i'll probably

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.760 
noon maybe to pacific so i'll probably
stream<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.820> well<00:04:06.540> we<00:04:06.690> actually<00:04:06.930> got<00:04:07.260> kind<00:04:07.650> of

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
stream that well we actually got kind of

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.160 
stream that well we actually got kind of
a<00:04:08.070> solid<00:04:08.580> team<00:04:08.910> together<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:09.600> I'm<00:04:09.750> kind<00:04:10.080> of

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
a solid team together so I'm kind of

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.660 
a solid team together so I'm kind of
excited<00:04:10.380> about<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.800> hopefully<00:04:11.070> we<00:04:11.370> can<00:04:11.550> get

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
excited about that hopefully we can get

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.060 
excited about that hopefully we can get
kind<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.060> far<00:04:12.300> it's<00:04:12.630> an<00:04:13.140> amateur<00:04:13.590> tournament

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
kind of far it's an amateur tournament

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.920 
kind of far it's an amateur tournament
so<00:04:14.570> that<00:04:15.570> means<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:16.549> no<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.910> know<00:04:18.359> pro<00:04:18.630> players

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
so that means that no I know pro players

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.780 
so that means that no I know pro players
can<00:04:19.140> really<00:04:19.380> play<00:04:19.590> basically<00:04:20.459> it's<00:04:20.640> on<00:04:20.760> a

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
can really play basically it's on a

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.810 
can really play basically it's on a
website<00:04:21.090> called<00:04:21.419> 360<00:04:22.020> icons<00:04:22.470> and

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
website called 360 icons and

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.300 
website called 360 icons and
to<00:04:24.480> be<00:04:24.630> considered<00:04:25.080> an<00:04:25.200> amateur<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.950> can't

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
to be considered an amateur you can't

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.340 
to be considered an amateur you can't
have<00:04:26.520> 13<00:04:27.120> cash<00:04:27.390> prizes<00:04:27.720> from<00:04:27.960> their<00:04:28.170> website

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
have 13 cash prizes from their website

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.220 
have 13 cash prizes from their website
so<00:04:28.830> technically<00:04:29.700> probably<00:04:30.180> some<00:04:30.510> pros<00:04:30.840> could

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
so technically probably some pros could

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.830 
so technically probably some pros could
play<00:04:31.530> in<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.830> but<00:04:32.150> probably<00:04:33.150> not<00:04:33.270> too<00:04:33.510> many<00:04:33.720> you

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
play in it but probably not too many you

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.330 
play in it but probably not too many you
know<00:04:33.960> because<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.230> lot<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.500> pros<00:04:34.770> use<00:04:34.950> that<00:04:35.130> site

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
know because a lot of pros use that site

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.910 
know because a lot of pros use that site
as<00:04:35.490> well<00:04:35.700> but<00:04:36.030> we'll<00:04:36.900> see<00:04:37.080> how<00:04:37.200> it<00:04:37.230> goes<00:04:37.380> I

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
as well but we'll see how it goes I

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.500 
as well but we'll see how it goes I

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
it's a pretty good cash prize for how

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.800 
it's a pretty good cash prize for how
much<00:04:52.920> you're<00:04:53.070> putting<00:04:53.340> in<00:04:53.570> if<00:04:54.570> you<00:04:54.690> can

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
much you're putting in if you can

much you're putting in if you can
actually<00:04:55.020> win<00:04:55.440> which<00:04:56.010> is<00:04:56.190> tough<00:04:56.460> because<00:04:56.670> you

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
actually win which is tough because you

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.210 
actually win which is tough because you
know<00:04:57.000> there's<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.270> lot<00:04:57.300> of<00:04:57.480> like<00:04:57.750> top<00:04:58.560> amateur

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
know there's a lot of like top amateur

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.410 
know there's a lot of like top amateur
teams<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.610> know<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.880> didn't<00:05:00.210> place

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
teams you know that didn't place

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.840 
teams you know that didn't place
necessarily<00:05:01.050> pro<00:05:01.410> I<00:05:01.710> didn't<00:05:02.310> events<00:05:02.700> but

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
necessarily pro I didn't events but

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.460 
necessarily pro I didn't events but
they're<00:05:02.970> placing<00:05:03.330> like<00:05:03.480> top<00:05:03.690> 16<00:05:04.200> and<00:05:04.380> they're

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
they're placing like top 16 and they're

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.200 
they're placing like top 16 and they're
solid<00:05:04.860> teams<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.340> solid<00:05:05.640> players<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:06.120> all

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
solid teams and solid players and all

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.030 
solid teams and solid players and all
that<00:05:06.390> so<00:05:06.690> it's<00:05:07.320> definitely<00:05:07.740> still<00:05:07.980> a

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
that so it's definitely still a

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.290 
that so it's definitely still a
challenge<00:05:08.550> you<00:05:08.610> know<00:05:08.700> just<00:05:08.970> because<00:05:09.030> you're

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
challenge you know just because you're

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.580 
challenge you know just because you're
playing<00:05:09.480> against<00:05:09.690> amateurs<00:05:09.960> doesn't<00:05:10.230> make<00:05:10.470> it

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
playing against amateurs doesn't make it

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.560 
playing against amateurs doesn't make it
easy<00:05:10.770> especially<00:05:11.040> being<00:05:11.580> an<00:05:11.760> amateur<00:05:11.940> myself

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
easy especially being an amateur myself

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.900 
easy especially being an amateur myself
I<00:05:12.810> don't<00:05:12.990> claim<00:05:13.230> to<00:05:13.290> be<00:05:13.470> even<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:13.890> top<00:05:14.370> image<00:05:14.760> or

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
I don't claim to be even a top image or

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.570 
I don't claim to be even a top image or
anything<00:05:15.180> like<00:05:15.210> that<00:05:15.330> I'm<00:05:15.960> probably<00:05:16.770> just<00:05:17.040> an

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
anything like that I'm probably just an

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.840 
anything like that I'm probably just an
average<00:05:18.000> player<00:05:18.360> I<00:05:18.480> would<00:05:18.840> say<00:05:19.050> so<00:05:19.080> I

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
average player I would say so I

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.920 
average player I would say so I
definitely<00:05:20.850> want<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.300> get<00:05:21.420> into<00:05:21.540> a<00:05:21.630> little<00:05:21.780> bit

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
definitely want to get into a little bit

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.360 
definitely want to get into a little bit
more<00:05:22.170> it'd<00:05:22.320> be<00:05:22.440> cool<00:05:22.650> to<00:05:22.680> get<00:05:22.890> better<00:05:23.130> at<00:05:23.340> it

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
more it'd be cool to get better at it

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.400 
more it'd be cool to get better at it
and<00:05:24.120> it'd<00:05:24.270> be<00:05:24.390> cool<00:05:24.600> to<00:05:24.630> go<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:24.870> events<00:05:25.320> and

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
and it'd be cool to go to events and

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.900 
and it'd be cool to go to events and
stuff<00:05:25.530> like<00:05:25.770> that<00:05:25.830> but<00:05:26.040> I'll<00:05:26.550> just<00:05:26.610> have<00:05:26.850> to

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
stuff like that but I'll just have to

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.600 
stuff like that but I'll just have to
wait<00:05:27.210> for<00:05:27.240> that<00:05:27.600> until<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.650> get<00:05:29.190> we<00:05:29.310> get<00:05:29.460> more

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
wait for that until I get we get more

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.340 
wait for that until I get we get more
settled<00:05:29.910> in<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.390> I<00:05:30.450> actually<00:05:30.600> you<00:05:31.020> know<00:05:31.050> how

for now maybe who knows what will happen
in<00:05:41.220> ghosts<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:42.260> but<00:05:43.260> for<00:05:43.440> now<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:43.590> guess<00:05:43.770> I'll

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
in ghosts I but for now I guess I'll

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.520 
in ghosts I but for now I guess I'll
just<00:05:44.340> try<00:05:45.330> to<00:05:45.390> get<00:05:45.630> better<00:05:45.810> at<00:05:45.990> cuz<00:05:46.290> if<00:05:46.410> you're

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
just try to get better at cuz if you're

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.680 
just try to get better at cuz if you're
gonna<00:05:46.620> go<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:46.860> event<00:05:47.280> and<00:05:47.460> like<00:05:47.670> not<00:05:48.510> even

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
gonna go to event and like not even

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.960 
gonna go to event and like not even
place<00:05:49.140> if<00:05:49.860> you're<00:05:50.070> not<00:05:50.160> even<00:05:50.220> confident<00:05:50.850> you

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
place if you're not even confident you

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.030 
place if you're not even confident you
could<00:05:51.090> place<00:05:51.330> top<00:05:51.630> 16<00:05:52.200> there's<00:05:52.440> almost<00:05:52.650> no

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
could place top 16 there's almost no

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.490 
could place top 16 there's almost no
point<00:05:53.070> of<00:05:53.460> going<00:05:53.610> to<00:05:54.060> be<00:05:54.180> honest<00:05:54.510> so<00:05:54.750> like<00:05:55.350> for

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
point of going to be honest so like for

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.810 
point of going to be honest so like for
example<00:05:55.590> I<00:05:55.890> could<00:05:55.950> have<00:05:56.160> gone<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.340> Anaheim

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
example I could have gone to Anaheim

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.480 
example I could have gone to Anaheim
technically<00:05:57.480> because<00:05:58.140> that's<00:05:58.380> like<00:05:58.500> what<00:05:59.040> 45

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
technically because that's like what 45

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.950 
technically because that's like what 45
minutes<00:05:59.790> to<00:05:59.910> an<00:05:59.940> hour<00:06:00.090> away<00:06:00.300> from<00:06:00.600> me<00:06:00.720> but

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
minutes to an hour away from me but

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.600 
minutes to an hour away from me but
there's<00:06:01.170> almost<00:06:01.380> no<00:06:01.740> point<00:06:01.770> because<00:06:02.430> I<00:06:02.550> know

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
there's almost no point because I know

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.250 
there's almost no point because I know
for<00:06:02.940> sure<00:06:03.120> i'm<00:06:03.330> not<00:06:03.510> gonna<00:06:03.660> place<00:06:03.960> in<00:06:04.200> the

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
for sure i'm not gonna place in the

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260 
for sure i'm not gonna place in the
money<00:06:04.470> so<00:06:04.860> it's<00:06:05.460> kind<00:06:05.610> of<00:06:05.670> pointless<00:06:05.850> in<00:06:06.180> my

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
money so it's kind of pointless in my

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.460 
money so it's kind of pointless in my
opinion<00:06:06.540> i<00:06:06.630> guess<00:06:06.840> i<00:06:06.960> could<00:06:07.020> have<00:06:07.260> gained

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
opinion i guess i could have gained

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.900 
opinion i guess i could have gained
experience<00:06:07.830> from<00:06:08.190> it<00:06:08.310> or<00:06:08.400> whatever<00:06:08.550> but<00:06:08.850> i

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
experience from it or whatever but i

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.400 
experience from it or whatever but i
didn't<00:06:09.120> have<00:06:09.210> a<00:06:09.240> solid<00:06:09.510> team<00:06:09.810> or<00:06:09.990> anything<00:06:10.080> so

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
didn't have a solid team or anything so

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.760 
didn't have a solid team or anything so
it's<00:06:10.440> kind<00:06:10.740> of<00:06:10.770> pointless<00:06:10.950> and<00:06:12.620> and<00:06:13.620> that's

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
it's kind of pointless and and that's

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.290 
it's kind of pointless and and that's
about<00:06:13.860> it<00:06:13.980> guys<00:06:14.130> hope<00:06:14.610> you<00:06:14.730> guys<00:06:14.850> enjoyed<00:06:15.180> this
