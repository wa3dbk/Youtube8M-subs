00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and it's stretches too I also got some

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.850 
and it's stretches too I also got some
battery<00:02:06.509> straps<00:02:06.840> too<00:02:07.140> got<00:02:07.290> those<00:02:07.439> from<00:02:07.590> tower

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
battery straps too got those from tower

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.449 
battery straps too got those from tower
I<00:02:07.950> think<00:02:08.340> those<00:02:08.429> not<00:02:08.580> actually<00:02:08.819> axial<00:02:09.450> better

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.410 

what<00:02:14.459> else<00:02:14.640> did<00:02:14.879> I<00:02:14.970> get

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
what else did I get

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.410 
what else did I get
you<00:02:15.659> know<00:02:15.810> honestly<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.829> about<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:18.299> know

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
you know honestly it's about it you know

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.869 
you know honestly it's about it you know
wheels<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.930> tires<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.409> shame<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:20.069> mess<00:02:20.849> with

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
wheels and tires in shame I mess with

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.850 
wheels and tires in shame I mess with
the<00:02:21.150> gearing<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.900> right<00:02:22.110> now<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> think<00:02:22.530> I'm

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
the gearing so right now I think I'm

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.319 
the gearing so right now I think I'm
added<00:02:23.099> like<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:24.560> 17<00:02:25.560> or<00:02:25.590> 18<00:02:26.189> tooth

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
added like a 17 or 18 tooth

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:34.850 
added like a 17 or 18 tooth
then<00:02:28.079> that's<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.790> 58<00:02:29.790> tooth<00:02:30.030> pinion<00:02:33.769> trying<00:02:34.769> to

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
then that's a 58 tooth pinion trying to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.240 
then that's a 58 tooth pinion trying to
think

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
think

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.729 
think
still<00:02:35.579> rugged<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.329> rugged<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.109> run<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
still rugged that rugged the run in the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.449 
still rugged that rugged the run in the
27<00:02:38.370> megahertz<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:40.530> know<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.890> works<00:02:41.099> just<00:02:41.340> fine

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
27 megahertz you know it works just fine

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.569 
27 megahertz you know it works just fine
and<00:02:41.760> since<00:02:41.909> everybody<00:02:42.180> runs

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
and since everybody runs

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.339 
and since everybody runs
2.4<00:02:44.579> right<00:02:44.790> now<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.209> wouldn't<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.049> a<00:02:46.109> problem

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
2.4 right now I wouldn't have a problem

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.039 
2.4 right now I wouldn't have a problem
with<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.920> know<00:02:47.120> trying<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> find<00:02:48.389> a<00:02:48.540> frequency

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
with you know trying to find a frequency

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.059 
with you know trying to find a frequency
that's<00:02:49.079> open<00:02:49.500> or<00:02:49.620> anything<00:02:49.680> like<00:02:50.040> that

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
that's open or anything like that

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.069 
that's open or anything like that
because<00:02:50.310> like<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.639> said<00:02:50.700> everybody<00:02:51.120> runs<00:02:51.359> 2.4

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
because like I said everybody runs 2.4

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:52.930 
because like I said everybody runs 2.4

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
gonna get the original battery box it

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.369 
gonna get the original battery box it
goes<00:03:02.670> back<00:03:02.909> here<00:03:03.239> I'm<00:03:03.900> gonna<00:03:04.049> put<00:03:04.260> the

goes back here I'm gonna put the
receiver<00:03:04.859> in<00:03:05.310> there<00:03:05.879> and<00:03:06.409> waterproof<00:03:07.409> it<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.489> I

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
receiver in there and waterproof it so I

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:09.860 
receiver in there and waterproof it so I
can<00:03:08.730> go<00:03:08.819> through<00:03:09.000> puddles<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:09.780> not

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
can go through puddles and and not

can go through puddles and and not
have<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.200> worry<00:03:10.379> about<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.069> just<00:03:11.129> like<00:03:11.400> run

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
have to worry about it and just like run

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.000 
have to worry about it and just like run
all<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.970> wires<00:03:12.180> like<00:03:12.569> underneath<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:13.620> motor

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
all the wires like underneath the motor

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.650 
all the wires like underneath the motor
unlike<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.699> back<00:03:14.940> end<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.329> transmission

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
unlike the back end of the transmission

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.839 
unlike the back end of the transmission
because<00:03:16.169> the<00:03:16.290> brake<00:03:16.530> all<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.250> brake<00:03:17.489> stuff

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
because the brake all the brake stuff

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.490 
because the brake all the brake stuff
isn't<00:03:18.030> there<00:03:18.329> anymore<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:19.019> know<00:03:19.139> from<00:03:19.349> it

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
isn't there anymore you know from it

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
being worried about getting caught what

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.629 
being worried about getting caught what
else<00:03:30.060> did<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.269> do<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.569> this<00:03:30.690> thing<00:03:30.750> oh<00:03:31.549> if<00:03:32.549> you

else did I do to this thing oh if you
can<00:03:32.790> really<00:03:32.910> see<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.359> but<00:03:34.489> on<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.669> speed

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
can really see it but on the speed

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.360 
can really see it but on the speed
controller<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:37.019> fan<00:03:37.319> that's<00:03:37.829> actually<00:03:38.250> from

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
controller the fan that's actually from

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.930 
controller the fan that's actually from
the<00:03:38.519> hobbyking<00:03:39.379> esc<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:40.650> then<00:03:41.280> what<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.489> did<00:03:41.790> is

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
the hobbyking esc and then what I did is

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.909 
the hobbyking esc and then what I did is
I<00:03:42.030> just<00:03:42.060> made<00:03:42.389> it<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.599> little<00:03:42.720> dafter<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.739> looks

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
I just made it a little dafter it looks

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.030 
I just made it a little dafter it looks
just<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.639> bundle<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.120> wires<00:03:45.359> but<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:46.169> made<00:03:47.010> a

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
just a bundle of wires but I made a

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.289 
just a bundle of wires but I made a
little<00:03:47.370> damper<00:03:47.699> so<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.819> didn't<00:03:48.000> have<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.150> go<00:03:48.269> and

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
little damper so I didn't have to go and

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.599 
little damper so I didn't have to go and
buy<00:03:48.540> anything<00:03:48.840> from<00:03:50.090> spare<00:03:51.090> parts<00:03:51.799> so<00:03:52.799> yeah

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
buy anything from spare parts so yeah

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.970 
buy anything from spare parts so yeah
it's<00:03:53.790> about<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.209> for<00:03:54.449> the<00:03:54.540> ej<00:03:55.079> tow<00:03:55.139> I'm<00:03:55.680> gonna

it's about it for the ej tow I'm gonna

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.670 
it's about it for the ej tow I'm gonna
cut<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.310> here<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:57.659> cut<00:03:57.900> out<00:03:58.019> last<00:03:58.230> time<00:03:58.409> when<00:03:58.650> I

cut it here to cut out last time when I

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.349 
cut it here to cut out last time when I
was<00:03:58.829> talking<00:03:58.980> about<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.430> pinion<00:04:00.180> and

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
was talking about the the pinion and

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.360 
was talking about the the pinion and
spur<00:04:01.049> gear<00:04:01.319> so<00:04:01.560> I'm<00:04:01.620> gonna<00:04:01.739> cut<00:04:01.889> it<00:04:02.010> out<00:04:02.129> here

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
spur gear so I'm gonna cut it out here

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.949 
spur gear so I'm gonna cut it out here
and<00:04:02.639> then<00:04:02.760> we're<00:04:03.060> gonna<00:04:03.180> move<00:04:03.359> on<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.750> ear

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
not too much has changed the main

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:25.680 
not too much has changed the main
drastic<00:04:17.720> thing<00:04:18.729> this<00:04:19.870> gone<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:21.669> got<00:04:22.669> the

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.890 

proline<00:04:26.690> SVT<00:04:27.680> Ford<00:04:28.550> Raptor<00:04:28.849> pickup<00:04:29.630> truck

proline SVT Ford Raptor pickup truck

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.490 
proline SVT Ford Raptor pickup truck
body<00:04:30.139> port<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:31.599> it<00:04:32.599> makes<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.050> look<00:04:33.199> so<00:04:33.229> much

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
body port I it makes it look so much

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.760 
body port I it makes it look so much
cooler<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:35.120> other<00:04:35.300> one<00:04:35.539> it's<00:04:35.750> just<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:36.229> don't

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
cooler the other one it's just I don't

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.610 
cooler the other one it's just I don't
get<00:04:36.889> me<00:04:36.979> wrong<00:04:37.130> I<00:04:37.340> like<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.639> eerie<00:04:38.000> bold<00:04:38.210> look

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
get me wrong I like the eerie bold look

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.140 
get me wrong I like the eerie bold look
but<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.680> think<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.070> pickup<00:04:40.430> truck<00:04:40.699> just<00:04:40.940> makes

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
but I think the pickup truck just makes

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.600 
but I think the pickup truck just makes
it<00:04:41.270> look<00:04:41.509> a<00:04:41.840> lot<00:04:42.110> more<00:04:42.169> meaner<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.490> know

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
it look a lot more meaner and you know

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.520 
it look a lot more meaner and you know
more<00:04:43.849> aggressive<00:04:44.449> so<00:04:45.320> I<00:04:45.349> painted<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:46.009> silver

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
more aggressive so I painted it silver

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.890 
more aggressive so I painted it silver
now<00:04:48.530> you<00:04:48.590> can't<00:04:49.070> tell<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.340> reflection<00:04:49.900> silver

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900
