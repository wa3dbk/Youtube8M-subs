you'll see the white box and I'll say

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.920 
you'll see the white box and I'll say
third<00:00:34.829> box<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:36.660> going

third box and on it so just going

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.080 
third box and on it so just going
through<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.739> product<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> ingredients

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
through the product and the ingredients

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.069 
through the product and the ingredients
the<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:41.129> under<00:00:41.610> 20<00:00:41.850> capsules<00:00:42.210> per

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the first is it's under 20 capsules per

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.950 
the first is it's under 20 capsules per
bottle<00:00:43.320> 60<00:00:44.280> capsules<00:00:44.730> or<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.270> should<00:00:45.539> say<00:00:45.629> 60

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
bottle 60 capsules or I should say 60

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.170 
bottle 60 capsules or I should say 60
servings<00:00:46.140> per<00:00:46.350> container

so<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> first<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> audrina<00:00:49.050> flex<00:00:49.320> which

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
so the first is the audrina flex which

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.560 
so the first is the audrina flex which
is<00:00:49.620> caffeine<00:00:50.550> anhydrous<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.239> Akasha

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570

a<00:01:13.939> so<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.450> also<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.869> ingredient<00:01:16.320> that

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
a so and it's also the ingredient that

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.770 
a so and it's also the ingredient that
gave<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> real<00:01:17.310> big<00:01:17.580> energy<00:01:18.180> kick<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.689> was

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
gave the real big energy kick that was

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.350 
gave the real big energy kick that was
in<00:01:18.930> dexedrine<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:20.280> shouldn't<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:20.939> strong

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
in dexedrine this shouldn't be as strong

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
in dexedrine this shouldn't be as strong
because<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.890> evidenced<00:01:23.369> by<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> two

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
because just as evidenced by the two

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.240 
because just as evidenced by the two
capsules<00:01:24.270> serving<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.380> should<00:01:25.710> still<00:01:26.040> get<00:01:26.220> a

capsules serving we should still get a
nice<00:01:26.460> energy<00:01:26.729> kick<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
nice energy kick from it so that's the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.950
