00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.410

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.900

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.570

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.119

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.350
 number everyone or almost 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.850
 can notice is that in when one 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.949
 look at all the comments a310 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.269
 then good is removed roughly what the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.390
 people who answer me etc 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.669
 we do not stop the eco at 270 and in fact 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.559
 we see that at most in number charest 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.719
 at 140 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.200
