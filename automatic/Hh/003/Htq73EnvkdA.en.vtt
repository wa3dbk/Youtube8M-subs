00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.829
 i 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.260
 The new apple samsung products 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.969
 break records and see images of g4 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.549
 how are they greeted by vanessa hand 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.619
 orellana and gabriel sama and welcome to 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.740
 another segment of the week in cinema in 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.380
 Spanish Gabriel started this week 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.710
 de barcelona- direct to san francisco 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.020
 because we had an event and it was not 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.869
 exactly what we expected 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.870
 counting a bit then vanessa really 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.120
 an hour and a half to wait for these 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.109
 ads seem a bit like 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.769
 disappointing I have the impression that 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:43.329
 really did not prepare this very well 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.159
 clear program we knew they were going to 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.920
 talk about the new watch and that support 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:52.210
 was going to be the center of attention but it 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.649
 they waited almost 80 minutes 70 minutes 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.839
 to start talking about the list of 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.940
 applications and in the end they gave us the 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.649
 price they gave us the availability but 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.199
 before that they made some announcements that 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.600
 I found them a little small for 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.970
 sizes of this company told us that 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.640
 the plane will be available in 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.470
 apple tv that they lowered the price to 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.570
 device that already has several years in 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.810
 the market also told us a little 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.030
 from research get that is this idea that 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.740
 people can compare share their 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.510
 medical information with institutions 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.160
 as stanford and other big 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.320
 medical institutions that I think is a 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.420
 very important initiative but somewhat 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.090
 boring and they also told us about 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.490
 macbook that you had in your hands and 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.840
 that some people confused the 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.330
 fact that I did not have enough 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.940
 tickets or slots but that in the background 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.700
 It is a very nice product very well 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.140
 built but that was not the reason 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.020
 why we were there for that 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.240
 announcement yes the truth they spoke good 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.460
 they spoke at the end of the town but already 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.560
 We all knew what to expect because 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.290
 they had already presented him at the event 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.420
 previous and the truth that I in what 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.979
 staff I was a little disappointed 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.020
 because they did not present anything new anymore 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.720
 we had seen so many clocks in the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.030
 market doing similar functions that 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.429
 the uach and the truth that I at least 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.060
 I expected them to bring something between 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.030
 Something new hands 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.110
 and you had the support of 10 thousand dollars in 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.420
 the doll 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.489
 good more surprising then what yes no 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.890
 I expected gabriel was the price of 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.099
 watch that the cheapest one of the version 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.260
 watch gilt edition the most 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.900
 cheap it costs 10 thousand dollars so 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.200
 Well, Gabrielle, you already know what you're going 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.180
 to give Christmas 3 to save 2 grams 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.030
 a big team if everyone wants one 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.610
 Well you have to start saving good 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.349
 true that for me that the product the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.420
 The best product of the presentation was the 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.010
 macbook that the truth is fine 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.220
 pretty but as you say confused 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.850
 many people for that micro usb slot 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.010
 I know that now I will only have that 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.230
 we'll see how it works once 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.390
 let's have the tests for the test 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.670
 more in detail but well let's move on 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.769
 apple to samsung because we can not talk 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.920
 of apps without talking about samsung and them 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.209
 they also broke this week's record 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.370
 tell us a little then look vanessa no 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.410
 it surprises me because we had these two 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.700
 new samsung devices in the 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.010
 hands the galaxy s 6 and the galaxy s 68 e 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.970
 even I wrote 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.670
 an apology a poetry dedicated to 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.590
 galaxy s 68 and it makes me laugh because people 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.170
 critical me because I'm 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.049
 writing these this advertising for 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.549
 samsung the reality is that it is not 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.440
 advertising for samsung and phones 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.650
 they are very well made very well designed 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.200
 the galaxy s 6 it seems to me that it has a 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.780
 similarity a suspicious resemblance to 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.940
 iphone 6 but the galaxy is that is done 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.819
 it seems to me an innovative phone very well 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.640
 built very well designed and I like 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.440
 that the Korean company the giant of 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.500
 Korea finally pay attention to 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.819
 design has been animated with new 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.010
 materials and that's the answer there 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.720
 that the market knows what it wants and 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.560
 is responding to these new 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.420
 good products and you 6 s poetry 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.000
 it was worth it because already supposedly 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.330
 According to the company they asked for 20 million 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.660
 units 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.269
 15 of those 20 million are from the 6th 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.390
 means that only 5 million would be 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.520
 from the 66th that for me was the protagonist 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.070
 that he stole the show because good for 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.530
 what do you want for 11 squares and 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.510
 you can have one with curves gabriel is 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.850
 a very well-built phone and 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.220
 let's finish with another flagship phone 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.410
 that we already thought that 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.570
 the ads had finished but at 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.020
 seem to still lack an important and 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.510
 it's his and the g4 the flagship phone 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.370
 that would replace g3 and that is that 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.430
 they filtered the first gabriel images 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.590
 of this day phone and they have it and 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.490
 as you can see it has a little curve 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.370
 similar to elche reflex 2 and good 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.520
 also that cover with imitation of 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.130
 metal like the one we saw in g3 and the 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.990
 truth is not already compared to the s 6 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.600
 gabriel is not the most attractive in the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.480
 market but we'll see what it brings us in 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.220
 As for functions, because abel the jeffrey 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.520
 the one of the youtube were at the time 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.610
 phones with very specifications 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.069
 awesome very powerful excellent 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.740
 processor and especially highlighted in the 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:28.349
 screen I do not know what screen will bring 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.509
 the new lg but it will surely bring 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.460
 high-end specifications that is 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.349
 what they have us used to and I 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.750
 love this idea that the competition 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.340
 it follows that the user the consumers 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.349
 our friends still have 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.449
 excellent options and I do not think the 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:45.360
 disappointments as well said it looks like a 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.849
 little design to the flex that already 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.740
 we have the flex 2 and well I do not understand 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.690
 very well that curvature still for what 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.550
 serves I think he really does not have a 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.889
 practical function but good they will 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.840
 bet on that design apparently and 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.310
 We will see how the market reacts to 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.819
 that does not double in your pocket 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.199
 gabriel because it's already bent 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.740
 good remember they can see all 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:09.630
 this news and more in cinema puntocom 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:14.180
 I'm vanessa hand orellana and open 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.180
 fame and we came back the other week with more
