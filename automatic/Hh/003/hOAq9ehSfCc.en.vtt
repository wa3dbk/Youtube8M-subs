let two completely separate teams take
their<00:01:27.900> basic<00:01:28.439> idea<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> would<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
their basic idea of what it would be and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
their basic idea of what it would be and
then<00:01:30.689> develop<00:01:31.079> two<00:01:31.380> completely<00:01:32.100> different

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
then develop two completely different

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.990 
then develop two completely different
games<00:01:32.880> based<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.950> general<00:01:34.950> idea<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.610> one

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
games based on that general idea so one

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.090 
games based on that general idea so one

it looking at screenshots it looks
really<00:02:27.980> awesome<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:28.550> I<00:02:28.640> wish<00:02:28.850> some<00:02:29.270> day<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.510> be

able<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.110> play<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.500> but<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:31.520> team<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:32.150> has

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
able to play it but the team that has

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.890 
able to play it but the team that has
supposedly<00:02:32.960> been<00:02:33.410> translating<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.550> for<00:02:34.970> for

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
supposedly been translating this for for

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.710 
supposedly been translating this for for
a<00:02:35.930> decade<00:02:36.350> now<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.920> think<00:02:37.310> still<00:02:38.300> hasn't

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
a decade now I think still hasn't

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.920 
a decade now I think still hasn't
finished<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.190> may<00:02:40.910> never<00:02:41.270> get<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.540> chance<00:02:41.750> to

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
finished it so may never get a chance to

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.500 
finished it so may never get a chance to
play<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.380> unfortunately<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.940> sixth<00:02:44.300> east

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
play that unfortunately the sixth east

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.650 
play that unfortunately the sixth east
game<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:46.040> east<00:02:46.310> game<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:46.820> most<00:02:47.060> people<00:02:47.510> I

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
game is the east game that most people I

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.330 
game is the east game that most people I

think are familiar with it's called the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.670 
think are familiar with it's called the
arc<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.790> piston<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.840> was<00:02:50.990> made<00:02:51.260> for

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
arc of the piston and it was made for

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.630 
arc of the piston and it was made for
the<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:52.430> think<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.910> ps2<00:02:53.240> and<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.610> a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
the I think of the ps2 and it is a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.400 
the I think of the ps2 and it is a
really<00:02:56.030> great<00:02:56.270> game

place all the way back before the first
East<00:03:16.790> game<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.060> think<00:03:17.209> exactly<00:03:17.720> one<00:03:18.200> thousand

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
East game I think exactly one thousand

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.030 
East game I think exactly one thousand
years<00:03:19.100> before<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.060> first<00:03:20.360> East<00:03:20.750> game<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.320> it

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
years before the first East game and it

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.420 
years before the first East game and it
takes<00:03:22.340> place<00:03:22.700> entirely<00:03:23.480> in<00:03:23.810> just<00:03:24.650> one<00:03:25.040> tower

takes place entirely in just one tower
that<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.000> explore<00:03:26.540> in<00:03:26.780> that<00:03:27.020> first<00:03:27.290> East<00:03:27.620> game

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
that you explore in that first East game

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.390 
that you explore in that first East game
but<00:03:28.520> in<00:03:29.300> explicably<00:03:29.780> suddenly<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.770> tower<00:03:31.010> has

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
but in explicably suddenly the tower has

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.240 
but in explicably suddenly the tower has
a<00:03:31.760> bazillion<00:03:32.510> more<00:03:32.900> floors<00:03:33.290> than<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.860> did<00:03:34.040> in

a bazillion more floors than it did in

East one it's hard to explain that it
really<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:37.850> whole<00:03:38.300> game<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:39.050> itself<00:03:39.500> and

really is a whole game and of itself and
what's<00:03:40.910> interesting<00:03:41.150> about<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:42.020> since<00:03:42.709> it

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
what's interesting about it is since it

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.130 
what's interesting about it is since it

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
feel like it should be I feel like it's

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.100 
feel like it should be I feel like it's
so<00:05:58.400> good<00:05:58.790> that<00:05:58.850> it<00:05:59.330> should<00:05:59.570> be<00:05:59.690> more<00:05:59.840> popular

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
so good that it should be more popular

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.790 
so good that it should be more popular
than<00:06:00.410> it<00:06:00.740> is<00:06:00.890> but<00:06:01.960> so<00:06:02.960> that's<00:06:03.050> it<00:06:03.320> for<00:06:03.590> the

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
than it is but so that's it for the

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.070 
than it is but so that's it for the
sweet<00:06:04.070> King<00:06:04.310> games<00:06:04.580> like<00:06:04.850> Zelda<00:06:05.090> I<00:06:05.600> really

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
sweet King games like Zelda I really

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.080

feel<00:06:06.260> like<00:06:06.290> maybe<00:06:06.560> the<00:06:06.890> hets<00:06:07.070> series<00:06:07.730> double

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
feel like maybe the hets series double

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.780 
feel like maybe the hets series double
