00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.030
 hello let me introduce you 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.520
 a small overview pokatushek on such 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.680
 wonderful pt constructions like jagtigr 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.510
 88 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.420
 despite the fact that this tank is often 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.329
 is in the top as now this review 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.720
 thoughts will be interesting for those who are still 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:33.260
 chooses a temporary technique 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:37.220
 I think that to him to buy generally 88 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:41.480
 this is a machine that is made for 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.399
 cautious people the thing is that how 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.000
 we know the difference from this tank from 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.800
 of his 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.210
 no premium counterpart consists 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.510
 fairly weak gun 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:56.600
 while this gun is very accurate high 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.109
 high intelligence and strong frontal 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.510
 armor 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.160
 before the machines we have a certain set of armor and 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.430
 naturally in that case 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.850
 probably foolish fox somewhere ahead quite 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.250
 first because pick us up 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.230
 can still up a large number 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.060
 Level 8 tanks are easy enough 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.740
 will do while we are also 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.260
 good targets for art though in this 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.450
 boyarka no what it was there three flows 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.450
 the river in a row when you were away and 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.250
 here we play the role of supporting it 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.690
 perhaps the main role for this tank 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.979
 which he manages to cheer here we are 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:43.360
 see as a large mobile group so 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.869
 let's say it is controlled by the zero line 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.380
 fairly obvious 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.460
 see that there is a distance of 450 meters 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.290
 if not more high mixing 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.539
 spread on the movement of this tank too 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.470
 small 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.550
 that means we can easily 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.000
 meeting a sudden opponent 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.630
 go stand ready and what we 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.020
 do and 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.100
 because of the roller coaster didnâ€™t climb out 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.570
 starting to cover our our mobile 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.820
 the group that is trying to give the opponent 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.980
 from the flank 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.239
 we will not say that such type tanks 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.890
 Cromwell there are not like him 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.890
 some special problem for us 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.290
 I would say that the second important point 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.210
 is this tank by having a large 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.000
 ammunition what it allows it 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.000
 allows for quite a small alpha 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.200
 enemy controller not giving it 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.530
 you protrude going down the projectile next to 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.610
 it either barely open 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.590
 places thereby not giving the enemy and 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.300
 roll fully so either light up 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.900
 our tanks and now after the first 50 50 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.540
 shots 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.760
 can see how the tanks start 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.540
 hiding understand yes what's on it 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.750
 firing 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.430
 for all that they also 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.010
 stealing which tanks also hide behind 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.190
 same support from them but 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.440
 can not lean out not all that 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.680
 just shells are constantly flying and 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.030
 constantly even if it ricochet yes well 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.580
 FIG us that it is better to wait for their 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.760
 allies allies do not act 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.360
 way up to about 5 ppocto stuck 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:43.450
 harem counting on his support 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:46.100
 center that did not render me 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.670
 even now see how you can 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.590
 fine shoot apt-5 on the upper hatch 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.590
 with such a gun 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.070
 can really say that the gun 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:04.100
 this machine is not the most accurate understandable 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:05.870
 matter though at the same time its accuracy of theirs 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.650
 it is enough to almost through 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:16.540
 half the cards now you can watch beat 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:18.650
 according to enemy technology but respectively 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.100
 the enemy nothing remains as a port 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.100
 hide 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:31.180
 probably many will say that the best 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:36.390
 the game you see this way giving 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:40.000
 ricochets but distracting now with their forehead 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:44.800
 enemy tanks well we actually 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.310
 write out the sentence hangar on 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.310
 long distance 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.909
 more so if we talk about a Syrian tank 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.080
 in this distance is hardly likely 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:55.080
 something we can do 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.200
 Well, once again I remind you that we will restore 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.100
 before being shot over with tanks which 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.690
 level below 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.080
 but let's not forget 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:14.900
 that I later post logger 88 this 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.110
 premium tank and the whole situation 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.380
 having missed the cars is below its 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.380
 analogs 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:39.110
 now I missed but again don't wake up 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.110
 underestimate such shots 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.010
 because even when full 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.660
 fails anyway see perfectly 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.770
 often by tracer 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:54.350
 there the projectile flew here the distance 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:56.900
 four hundred and ninety two meters that is 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:00.889
 understand give so that we can with-400 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.270
 actually from 500 meters set fire to a lion on 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.100
 such a distance plus I did not 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.630
 Amendment us was certainly a little bit higher 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.630
 you can raise this distance 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.720
 then, in principle, because it is 1000 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.410
 shoots you can imagine what 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.630
 can make its analog non premium 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.080
 who possess very high very 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.080
 high alpha 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.390
 I think everyone will like this car 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:33.230
 for those who love to play carefully with 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:36.800
 cover it helping its allies in 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.400
 same time it is impossible to say that this tank 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.030
 simply 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:44.090
 covers its allied tanks 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:47.260
 if the allies merge so 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:50.660
 Frontal armor allows yagtigr 88 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:56.230
 keeping control is often easy 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:58.510
 substituting forehead there for over 250 in my 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.920
 no armor 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.770
 well and of course we must remember 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.960
 that cover nld we still need 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.760
 because he has enough cotton 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:12.800
 as for lichka mehvoda 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.170
 Well for 10 fights and you say so not in 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.730
 he was not hit by anyone in 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.290
 principle or rarely with this tank 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.770
 face either 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.700
 oh fight about other places 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.710
 only thing to note 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.410
 this mask gun oddly mask 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.950
 guns are you the game often makes its way 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:33.950
 being at angles but approximately 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:38.990
 as you now see it can be pierced in 

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:41.530
 the mask is probably still common 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:45.249
 recommendations for this tank serves 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:49.199
 position of large rhombus 

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:49.199
 thank you all bye
