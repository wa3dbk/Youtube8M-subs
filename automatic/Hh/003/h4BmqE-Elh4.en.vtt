I<00:03:26.049> don't<00:03:26.109> want<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.769> get<00:03:27.190> VW<00:03:27.700> angry<00:03:28.209> if<00:03:28.299> it's

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
I don't want to get VW angry if it's

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.720 
I don't want to get VW angry if it's
just<00:03:28.690> an<00:03:28.810> issue<00:03:28.900> with<00:03:29.169> this<00:03:29.349> car<00:03:29.620> but<00:03:29.950> the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
just an issue with this car but the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.089 
just an issue with this car but the
satellite<00:03:31.180> radio<00:03:31.510> here<00:03:31.810> cuts<00:03:32.139> out<00:03:32.349> constantly

satellite radio here cuts out constantly

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.319 
satellite radio here cuts out constantly
and<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.400> think<00:03:33.609> it's<00:03:33.730> got<00:03:33.849> something<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.180> do

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
and I think it's got something to do

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.039 
and I think it's got something to do
with<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.540> antenna<00:03:34.930> in<00:03:35.739> a<00:03:35.859> convertible<00:03:36.280> layout
