00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.360
 Hi, I'm Smurfette and in this video 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.890
 boat chacra let's talk about the do not 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.900
 click 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.789
 click you are an add-on that allows us 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.099
 afford skills over a unit 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.099
 from our interface members of the raid 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.900
 or the party voice units etc. without 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.930
 need to have it selected as 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.210
 objective is to let us launch 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.040
 spells in mouse robert but without that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.150
 we have to create specific macros 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.100
 for it 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.500
 in this way the add-on can be useful 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.059
 for hitler or ps when the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.300
 precise fight change of objective 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.610
 constantly 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.680
 in the case of killers, where 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.690
 interface units like the gil bot or 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.760
 voodoo already bring by default the 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.820
 functionality to cure the mouse or see 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.860
 however if we use another add ons or 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.750
 the native blizzard click interface that 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.000
 It can be very helpful 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.220
 Once the add-on is installed to access 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.960
 to the configuration is enough 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.530
 open the spellbook from the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.340
 micro menu or by pressing the key pe 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.350
 we'll see how in the spell book 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.380
 in addition to the side tabs 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.670
 usual generals and our 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.350
 specializations we see a 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.970
 new tab click binding configuration 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.280
 we click on it and the panel appears 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.740
 of configuration of the addon while the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.270
 panel is visible we can browse by 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.580
 the rest of the tabs for 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.520
 select those skills to 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.840
 which we want to create the assignment 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.060
 We also see that there are already two 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.220
 assignments created that we will keep 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.500
 how are they because one allows us 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.720
 card with the left button and the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.650
 another launches the conceptual menu on a 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.560
 unit with the right mouse button 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.090
 let's do some example we look at 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.640
 the spell book the skill 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.920
 renew click on it with the button 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.680
 left and we see how it appears in the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.560
 Click panel by default has us 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.750
 assigned the left button because it's the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.360
 that we clicked when adding it but 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.009
 let's change that we click with the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.500
 right button on the skill in the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.710
 panel and select the sing option 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.120
 vending 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.370
 we place the mouse on the set button 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.680
 beijing and we press the key with which 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.100
 we're going to launch the renovate skill by 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.930
 example the key 1 press to accept and 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.460
 we see that our ability and it appears 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.770
 assigned to the key 1 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.600
 we can also eliminate a certain 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.730
 ability of the assignment list 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.100
 that we have created if we no longer want 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.810
 use it with the click for it 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.970
 press again with the button 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.850
 Right on it and select 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.770
 the option delete bai ling 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.810
 we also have the possibility of 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.150
 configure in what circumstances 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.670
 we want the assignment to be used in 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.830
 the six-innings set-up menu set 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.599
 here we can specify if the 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.700
 assignment has to be executed on 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.280
 the friendly interface units or 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.930
 enemy this can be interesting in 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.660
 the case of skills that can 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.370
 used in any unit 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.069
 indistinctly as penance or 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.790
 mental scolding primary spect or 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.890
 secondary among other options 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.689
 and I find above all necessary 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.489
 specify the specialization of 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.189
 talents for every assignment that I think 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.109
 because in addition to having the information a 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.569
 little better organized in the panel the 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.370
 click that may be imperative for 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.250
 the skills shared among several 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.040
 you ask for inks and more if we want to have them 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.470
 assigned on different keys of this 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.670
 shape let's select 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.050
 secondary specialization of talents 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.420
 only and we try 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.790
 to see the effect more clearly let's 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.250
 to put the friendly doll in focus 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.530
 we are going to select our objective 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.840
 and let's press the 1 key while 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.960
 we have the mouse positioned on the 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.730
 focus unit we can see how the 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.770
 Renovation hall has been applied to 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.600
 our focus and not ourselves 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.300
 We can do the same for the 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.820
 offensive skills we return to the book 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.930
 of spells to the click panel and 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.930
 we add ammunition 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.260
 we assign it equally to key 1 and 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.870
 we specify that we want to use it 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.640
 in this secondary talent and also 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.640
 only about enemy units 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.850
 we will modify the renewal assignment 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.100
 to add the condition so that 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.039
 only work on friendly units 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.830
 so if we put the doll in a few 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.840
 enemy and we press the one spend we will do 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.660
 function that is a damage spell 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.940
 while on a friendly unit by 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.120
 example about our own framework with 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.160
 the 1 that we will be renewing if not 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.009
 we have no unit marked with the 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.110
 mouse and we press the one we're going to throw 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.720
 the ability word sacred serenity 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.590
 which is what I have on button 1 of my 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.590
 action bar 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.520
 it's a pretty interesting way of 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.650
 make the most of the keys 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.960
 action available but you have to have 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.180
 Beware of positioning the mouse over the 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.580
 appropriate unit to launch a 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.680
 ability or another I normally what 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.900
 I do is put the skills in the click 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.750
 that I have assigned to the action bar 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.449
 or the mouse buttons with the same 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.340
 key assignment for simply not 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.220
 have to card different units 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.070
 and heal only by moving the mouse of a 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.960
 unit to another one must also have 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.900
 be careful with the skills we leave 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.060
 unassigned in the clicker if while 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.699
 we try to afford them we have the mouse 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.949
 about a certain unit we will launch 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.139
 the ability on ourselves or 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:47.689
 about our goal if possible 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.270
 but if our doll was not possible 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:52.159
 will be left without being able to do anything the same 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.740
 will happen if the skill we have 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:57.770
 assigned to a certain type of unit 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.599
 friend or enemy but when throwing it the 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.810
 unit that we have indicated with the mouse 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:05.060
 be the opposite because up to here our 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.729
