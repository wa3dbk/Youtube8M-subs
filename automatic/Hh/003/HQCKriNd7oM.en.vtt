00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.619
 disputed between the days 22 and 24 of July in the kartódromo of interlagos 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.279
 August in São Paulo The Seventh Wonder 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.279
 result 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.579
 jobs powered by gasoline is so good electricity 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.550
 the edition was marked by the competitiveness of the 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.460
 projects a rigorous security inspection via telemetry with GPS 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.500
 making the achievements even more significant 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.240
 the new record of participants was also reached with 32 cars of 16 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.650
 institutions representing the states of minas gerais' são paulo 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.489
 parana 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.450
 santa catarina in rio grande do sul 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.840
 he only stayed in Quito the team has managed to be prepared and not 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.500
 as a little throughout the continent was milton active 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.080
 but anyway 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.470
 with this growth 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.760
 I'm feeling it will not be in a standstill 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.880
 but they should have been harder to visit than nine days stuck the ones that came 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.630
 Here 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.990
 That's all our team is on the right track. 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.050
 until today 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.070
 more than one hundred prototypes and ecological ones were present on the marathon track 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.610
 efficiency 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.300
 every year the teams surprise with innovative solutions in projects 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.370
 electronics in alternative materials 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.320
 in 2010 the goal to be achieved was to beat the unicamp records with 367 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.900
 kilometers per liter with gasoline and the federal of Itabuba 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.880
 with 39 26 kilometers the team played the wagon also a motorcycle battery without 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.810
 regeneration 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.310
 marathon 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.980
 very important for the personal and academic growth of the participants 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.180
 I believe 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.580
 that's what we talk about 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.729
 our team that is the importance of this to develop the practical side 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.529
 the people inside the college 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.529
 we acquire knowledge but it is very difficult to put into 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.249
 an appropriate laboratory with a host of other things 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.569
 here we learn to solve the problems 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.739
 what he arrived with the speed with which he arrives with the requirement 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.479
 if the problem asks at that moment 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:32.299
 then it is of the utmost importance 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.909
 it's not just with the backwoods 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.829
 I'm going to build a part in the emergency room. 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.909
 Is this a motor-home we did this morning 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.549
 but yes 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.109
 manage problems manage 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.109
 people manage 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.069
 the gasoline and ethanol prototypes and full and marathon efficiency 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.429
 you are entitled to three attempts to establish your consumption 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.469
 leads in turns each 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.919
 the final classification I consider the best result achieved 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.700
 provided that it maintains a minimum average speed of 24 kilometers per hour 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:15.619
 in the electric category the vehicles receive a standard battery in each one 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:17.119
 of the three outputs 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.020
 the champion 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.580
 will be the one that completes more laps with a minimum average speed of 15 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.999
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.680
 the total distance traveled is used as a tiebreaker criterion 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.180
 between the gasoline vehicles to federal of santa maria to repeat the performance of the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.140
 last year 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.289
 silas team champion 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:43.399
 the 2010 edition reaches the consumption of 284 dribbles two kilometers per liter 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.249
 as a result 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:51.099
 the record of the race follows with the unicamp that reach 1,367 kilometers per 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.189
 liter 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.189
 the second place was with the university anhembi morumbi 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.779
 with the mark of 5 5 to 4 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:00.949
 there are many politicians 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.219
 the great news of the marathon until this Wednesday 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.089
 I have not seen a role shift yet 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.169
 with victory the rudder 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.169
 with the consumption of 140 kilometers per liter 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:15.129
 Santa Maria 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.309
 psdb saw company 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:19.809
 just as was the action 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:22.999
 the same used in rain pokerstars cause 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.479
 already the students of the institute mauá de são paulo will have the advantage of the new rule of the 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.630
 electric category and won by 14 25 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.580
 with the same country bike battery 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.590
 with sponsorship from the cplp onboard team and technology snct 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.840
 in addition to technical support from heliar 20 center the 7th university marathon of 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.309
 energy efficiency 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:52.540
 is the event of the Brazilian city 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.360
 the best award 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.319
 in total 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.379
 six vehicles were distributed in nine engines between the institutions 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.379
 winner 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090
