with another video review for you so
today<00:00:12.420> we're<00:00:12.509> going<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> be<00:00:12.750> taking<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.049> look<00:00:13.170> at

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
today we're going to be taking a look at

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.959 
today we're going to be taking a look at
easy<00:00:13.590> answer<00:00:14.160> it's<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.370> really<00:00:14.670> cool<00:00:14.849> little

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
easy answer it's a really cool little

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.210 
easy answer it's a really cool little
application<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.750> found<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> other<00:00:16.230> day<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.619> I

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
application I found the other day and I

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.680 
application I found the other day and I
thought<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.460> was<00:00:17.550> pretty<00:00:17.730> useful<00:00:18.119> because<00:00:18.210> if

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
thought it was pretty useful because if

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
thought it was pretty useful because if
you<00:00:19.050> don't<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.160> capability<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.670> touch

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
you don't have the capability to touch

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.820 
you don't have the capability to touch
your<00:00:21.210> phone<00:00:21.330> say<00:00:21.630> for<00:00:21.840> instance<00:00:21.930> your<00:00:22.650> hands

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
your phone say for instance your hands

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.650 
your phone say for instance your hands
are<00:00:23.010> dirty<00:00:23.220> or<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.730> got<00:00:24.060> gloves<00:00:24.390> or

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
are dirty or you got gloves or

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.170 
are dirty or you got gloves or
unresponsive<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.470> touch<00:00:25.710> screens<00:00:26.180> whatever

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
unresponsive to touch screens whatever

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.060 
unresponsive to touch screens whatever
the<00:00:27.300> reason<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.320> don't<00:00:28.740> want<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> be

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the reason is that you don't want to be

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.439 
the reason is that you don't want to be
touching<00:00:29.279> your<00:00:29.429> phone<00:00:29.670> or<00:00:29.970> maybe<00:00:30.240> you're<00:00:30.420> just

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
touching your phone or maybe you're just

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.600 
touching your phone or maybe you're just
lazy<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.439> want<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.740> new<00:00:31.920> way<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.130> answer

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
lazy and you want a new way to answer

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.850 
lazy and you want a new way to answer

cool it's called easy answer like I
mentioned<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.350> got<00:00:37.559> an<00:00:37.649> on/off<00:00:38.100> switch<00:00:38.129> so

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
mentioned it's got an on/off switch so

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.209 
mentioned it's got an on/off switch so
that's<00:00:39.660> pretty<00:00:39.989> awesome<00:00:40.170> which<00:00:40.590> means<00:00:40.860> you

that's pretty awesome which means you
don't<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.700> uninstall<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.360> application

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
don't have to uninstall the application

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.560 
don't have to uninstall the application
when<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.250> don't<00:00:44.489> want<00:00:44.760> those<00:00:44.969> features

when you don't want those features

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.690 
when you don't want those features
enabled<00:00:46.110> there's<00:00:46.770> lots<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.039> applications<00:00:47.579> out

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
enabled there's lots of applications out

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.060 
enabled there's lots of applications out
there<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.360> similar<00:00:49.039> sort<00:00:50.039> of

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
there that kind of have similar sort of

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.880 
there that kind of have similar sort of
aspects<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:52.020> can't<00:00:52.260> disable<00:00:52.530> them

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
aspects to it and you can't disable them

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.010 
aspects to it and you can't disable them
without<00:00:53.730> straight-up<00:00:54.329> uninstalling<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
without straight-up uninstalling the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.479 
without straight-up uninstalling the
application<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.219> added

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
application so I like that they added

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
application so I like that they added
the<00:00:56.730> on-off<00:00:57.030> switch<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.440> getting<00:00:58.680> into

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the on-off switch there so getting into

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.549 
the on-off switch there so getting into
it<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.030> actually<00:01:00.539> using<00:01:01.109> proximity

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
it this is actually using proximity

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.619 
it this is actually using proximity
sensors<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:02.699> accelerometer<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.480> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
sensors and your accelerometer is to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.830 
sensors and your accelerometer is to
basically<00:01:03.930> control<00:01:04.729> how<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.790> answer<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.540> end

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
basically control how you answer and end

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
basically control how you answer and end
phone<00:01:07.229> calls<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.369> right<00:01:08.850> off<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> bat<00:01:09.240> here

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
phone calls so right off the bat here

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.760 
phone calls so right off the bat here
you'll<00:01:09.600> notice<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.960> says<00:01:10.080> call<00:01:10.409> answering

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you'll notice it says call answering

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
you'll notice it says call answering
gestures<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.790> obviously<00:01:12.299> based<00:01:12.540> on

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
gestures so it's obviously based on

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.179 
gestures so it's obviously based on
gestures<00:01:13.110> again<00:01:13.350> using<00:01:13.650> your<00:01:13.680> proximity

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
gestures again using your proximity

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.700 
gestures again using your proximity
sensor<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:15.270> first<00:01:15.479> one<00:01:15.630> that's<00:01:15.720> default<00:01:16.470> tick

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
sensor the first one that's default tick

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.350 
sensor the first one that's default tick
is<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.159> ear<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.299> it

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
is on ear so as you can see there it

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.149 
is on ear so as you can see there it
says<00:01:18.509> answer<00:01:18.930> by<00:01:19.049> raising<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.560> phone<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.040> your

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
says answer by raising the phone to your

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.340 
says answer by raising the phone to your
ear<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.939> as<00:01:21.060> soon<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> phone<00:01:21.600> starts

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
ear so as soon as the phone starts

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.690 
ear so as soon as the phone starts
ringing<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.890> put<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.369> ear<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
ringing just put it up to your ear the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.340 
ringing just put it up to your ear the
proximity<00:01:24.030> sensor<00:01:24.330> I'll<00:01:24.540> pick<00:01:24.720> up<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
proximity sensor I'll pick up on it and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.819 
proximity sensor I'll pick up on it and
the<00:01:26.250> phone<00:01:26.880> call<00:01:27.060> will<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.210> answered<00:01:28.049> close

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the phone call will be answered close

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.880 
the phone call will be answered close
proximity<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.659> interesting<00:01:31.020> answer

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
proximity so this is interesting answer

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.800 
proximity so this is interesting answer
by<00:01:31.979> setting<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> phone<00:01:32.549> screen<00:01:32.909> close<00:01:33.390> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
by setting the phone screen close to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
by setting the phone screen close to
something<00:01:34.439> or<00:01:34.619> something<00:01:35.009> close<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> phone

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
something or something close to phone

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.120 
something or something close to phone
screen<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.750> basically<00:01:37.409> if<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:37.979> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
screen so basically if you have that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.940 
screen so basically if you have that
ticked<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.939> phone<00:01:39.150> starts<00:01:39.810> ringing<00:01:39.950> you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
ticked and the phone starts ringing you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.649 
ticked and the phone starts ringing you

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
opinion kind of pointless well I guess

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.970 
opinion kind of pointless well I guess
it's<00:02:41.210> not<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:41.480> mean<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.900> usually<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:42.740> hit<00:02:42.860> the
