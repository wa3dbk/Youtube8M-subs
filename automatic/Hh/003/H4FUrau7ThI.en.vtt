00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
to fight how the pike shows up it's

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.050 
to fight how the pike shows up it's
going<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.020> say<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.470> pike<00:05:01.860> something<00:05:02.669> i<00:05:02.789> think<00:05:02.850> a

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
going to say a pike something i think a

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.050 
going to say a pike something i think a
bike<00:05:03.690> gang<00:05:04.650> or<00:05:04.979> something<00:05:05.160> something<00:05:05.820> shows

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
bike gang or something something shows

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.130 
bike gang or something something shows
up<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.210> bottle<00:05:06.419> cover<00:05:06.570> you<00:05:06.690> saw<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:06.960> last

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
up the bottle cover you saw in the last

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.670 
up the bottle cover you saw in the last
video<00:05:07.760> shows<00:05:08.760> up<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:08.940> bottom<00:05:09.240> corner

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
video shows up the bottom corner

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.500 
video shows up the bottom corner
basically<00:05:10.680> says<00:05:10.950> it's<00:05:11.490> very<00:05:11.820> close<00:05:12.120> that<00:05:12.419> it

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
basically says it's very close that it

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.029 
basically says it's very close that it
means<00:05:12.660> it's<00:05:12.870> coming<00:05:13.200> when<00:05:13.620> they<00:05:13.770> come<00:05:14.010> through

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
means it's coming when they come through

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.580 
means it's coming when they come through
you<00:05:14.789> take<00:05:15.030> out<00:05:15.240> them<00:05:15.479> try<00:05:15.960> not<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.229> shoot<00:05:16.410> the

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
you take out them try not to shoot the

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.219 
you take out them try not to shoot the
pike<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.550> so<00:05:17.789> i<00:05:17.850> just<00:05:18.000> got<00:05:18.150> another<00:05:18.450> it's<00:05:19.110> a
