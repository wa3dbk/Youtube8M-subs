00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.949 
piece here now on the one hand it
actually<00:02:08.099> works<00:02:08.310> really<00:02:08.489> well<00:02:08.879> but<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
actually works really well but on the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.440 
actually works really well but on the
other<00:02:09.989> hand<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.940> not<00:02:12.180> so

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
other hand it actually is not so

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.230 
other hand it actually is not so
comfortable<00:02:12.690> too

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
comfortable too

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.900 
comfortable too

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
goes in quite easily you simply put in a

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.930 
goes in quite easily you simply put in a
corner<00:02:20.140> put<00:02:20.590> in<00:02:20.650> another<00:02:20.800> corner<00:02:21.070> press<00:02:21.700> down

on<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.120> corners<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.540> then<00:02:23.020> make<00:02:23.230> sure<00:02:23.260> that

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
on the corners and then make sure that

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.610 
on the corners and then make sure that
everything<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.400> seated<00:02:24.880> nicely<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.870> securely

bulky<00:03:16.210> ipad<00:03:17.140> case<00:03:17.380> again<00:03:18.160> my<00:03:18.430> biggest<00:03:18.850> issue

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
bulky ipad case again my biggest issue

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.260 
bulky ipad case again my biggest issue
with<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.630> simply<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.770> price<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.790> one<00:03:22.150> of

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
with it is simply the price so one of

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.610 
with it is simply the price so one of
the<00:03:22.330> neat<00:03:22.480> things<00:03:22.510> about<00:03:22.840> this<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.410> you

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
the neat things about this is that you

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.670 
the neat things about this is that you
mean<00:03:23.800> you<00:03:23.890> fold<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.220> around<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.720> cover<00:03:25.990> folds

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
mean you fold it around the cover folds

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.940 
mean you fold it around the cover folds
and<00:03:27.090> stays<00:03:28.090> perfectly<00:03:28.660> in<00:03:28.810> place<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:29.620> does

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
and stays perfectly in place it does

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.770 
and stays perfectly in place it does
flop<00:03:30.220> around<00:03:30.420> nothing<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.480> hold<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.690> in<00:03:31.750> place

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
flop around nothing to hold it in place

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.880 
flop around nothing to hold it in place
we're<00:03:32.110> actually<00:03:32.230> going<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.530> look<00:03:32.650> at<00:03:32.710> another

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
we're actually going to look at another

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.160 
we're actually going to look at another
case<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.220> actually<00:03:33.640> solves<00:03:34.000> this<00:03:34.150> issue<00:03:34.360> but

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
case that actually solves this issue but

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.040 
case that actually solves this issue but
what<00:03:35.350> happens<00:03:35.380> is<00:03:36.240> when<00:03:37.240> you<00:03:37.390> fold<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.780> over

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.470 

you<00:03:41.050> get<00:03:41.290> this<00:03:41.710> angle<00:03:42.190> with<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.370> nice<00:03:42.640> typing

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
you get this angle with a nice typing

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.380 
you get this angle with a nice typing
angle<00:03:44.100> or<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:47.050> can<00:03:47.260> turn<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.500> around<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:49.150> view

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
angle or you can turn it around to view

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.620 
angle or you can turn it around to view
just<00:03:49.750> lock<00:03:49.990> it<00:03:50.020> in<00:03:50.350> place<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:52.090> see<00:03:52.270> there<00:03:52.420> lock

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
just lock it in place you see there lock

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.960 
just lock it in place you see there lock
it<00:03:52.780> in<00:03:52.870> place<00:03:52.990> and<00:03:53.430> then<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.610> gives<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.940> a

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
it in place and then it gives you a

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.920 
it in place and then it gives you a
fairly<00:03:55.570> stable<00:03:55.920> I've<00:03:56.920> never<00:03:57.160> loved<00:03:57.930> this

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
fairly stable I've never loved this

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.660 
fairly stable I've never loved this
approach<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.560> having<00:03:59.800> a<00:03:59.890> stand<00:04:00.160> because<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.520> do

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
approach to having a stand because I do

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.430 
approach to having a stand because I do
worry<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.180> it's<00:04:01.420> top-heavy<00:04:01.660> but<00:04:02.080> it<00:04:02.200> does

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
worry that it's top-heavy but it does

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.460 
worry that it's top-heavy but it does
work<00:04:02.880> more<00:04:03.880> importantly<00:04:04.300> it<00:04:05.110> works<00:04:05.290> really

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
work more importantly it works really

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.740 
work more importantly it works really
well<00:04:05.620> if<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.070> want<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.250> type<00:04:06.460> that<00:04:06.490> way<00:04:06.880> so<00:04:07.690> you

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
well if you want to type that way so you

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.660 
well if you want to type that way so you
can<00:04:07.840> get<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.990> nice<00:04:08.110> typing<00:04:08.500> surface<00:04:08.890> again<00:04:09.490> this
