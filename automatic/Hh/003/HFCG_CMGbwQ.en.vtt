Suzuki gs-7 50 that would mean that this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.030 
Suzuki gs-7 50 that would mean that this

cycle was actually produced as an

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.930 
cycle was actually produced as an
intention<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:34.010> Suzuki<00:00:35.010> demonstrating<00:00:35.730> what

intention of Suzuki demonstrating what

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.729 
intention of Suzuki demonstrating what
they<00:00:36.210> were<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:37.020> producing<00:00:37.590> the

they were going to be producing the
following<00:00:38.100> year<00:00:39.350> 1977<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> first<00:00:40.860> year

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
following year 1977 was the first year

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.270 
following year 1977 was the first year
of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.489> GS<00:00:42.329> 750<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.469> would<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> zero

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
of the GS 750 so this would be a zero

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
from their estate a kind of a sad story

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.720 
from their estate a kind of a sad story
but<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.930> certainly<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.410> beautiful<00:01:02.129> original

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
but it's certainly a beautiful original

but it's certainly a beautiful original
bike<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.979> some<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> features<00:01:05.519> that

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
bike here some of the features that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.000 
bike here some of the features that
distinguish<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.960> from<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.200> production

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
distinguish it from the production

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.570 
distinguish it from the production
cycles<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.080> has<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.650> single<00:01:11.100> disc<00:01:11.340> at

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
cycles are that it has a single disc at

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.469 
cycles are that it has a single disc at
the<00:01:11.610> front<00:01:12.500> it<00:01:13.500> has<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.830> been<00:01:14.010> removed

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
the front it has not been removed

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.280 
the front it has not been removed
originally<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:16.430> like<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:18.080> but<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
originally it's a like this but the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.030 
originally it's a like this but the
production<00:01:19.799> bikes<00:01:20.390> have<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> separate<00:01:22.040> disc

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
production bikes have a separate disc

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.539 
production bikes have a separate disc
here<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> separate<00:01:24.299> caliper<00:01:25.310> which<00:01:26.310> was

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
here in a separate caliper which was

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.480 
here in a separate caliper which was
what<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:26.970> intended<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.600> doing<00:01:28.369> but<00:01:29.369> this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
what they intended on doing but this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.760 
what they intended on doing but this
bike<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:30.030> produced<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.689> way<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
bike was produced this way just as a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.469 
bike was produced this way just as a
demonstration<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.479> dealers<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.049> use

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
demonstration for for dealers to use

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.380 
demonstration for for dealers to use
another<00:01:36.479> distinguishing<00:01:37.409> factor<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.390> that

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
another distinguishing factor is that

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.660 
another distinguishing factor is that
the<00:01:39.720> choke<00:01:40.140> mechanism<00:01:40.829> needs<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.340> wrench<00:01:41.520> or

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the choke mechanism needs a wrench or

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
the choke mechanism needs a wrench or
pliers<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:42.210> no<00:01:42.360> mechanism<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.020> installed<00:01:43.380> on

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
pliers as no mechanism was installed on

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.740 
pliers as no mechanism was installed on
these<00:01:43.619> demonstrator<00:01:44.100> bikes<00:01:44.420> now<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.600> was

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
these demonstrator bikes now this was

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.060 
these demonstrator bikes now this was
simply<00:01:45.990> because<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.520> demonstrators<00:01:48.390> would

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
simply because the demonstrators would

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.469 
simply because the demonstrators would
get<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.189> bike<00:01:50.340> running<00:01:50.549> warmed<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
get the bike running warmed up for the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.499 
get the bike running warmed up for the
day<00:01:52.040> with<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> special<00:01:53.579> wrench<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> choke

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
day with a special wrench on the choke

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.889 
day with a special wrench on the choke
and<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.920> would<00:01:56.549> proceed<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.060> ride<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and then would proceed to ride it and a

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.520 
and then would proceed to ride it and a
lot<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.170> others<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.799> ride<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.759> test<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.180> out

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
lot of others to ride it and test it out

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.410 
lot of others to ride it and test it out
things<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.920> nature<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.880> wasn't<00:02:03.240> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
things like this nature so it wasn't a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.100 
things like this nature so it wasn't a
completed<00:02:04.079> bike<00:02:04.820> but<00:02:05.820> cosmetically<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.750> is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
completed bike but cosmetically it is

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.339 
completed bike but cosmetically it is

fine let me see if I can get a shot down

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:14.780 
fine let me see if I can get a shot down
in<00:03:05.970> here<00:03:06.330> of<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:07.310> engine<00:03:08.310> number<00:03:09.770> is<00:03:13.790> focus

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
in here of this engine number is focus

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.300 
in here of this engine number is focus
here<00:03:15.710> okay<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:16.890> GS<00:03:17.690> 750<00:03:18.690> one<00:03:19.380> zero<00:03:19.709> four<00:03:20.280> three

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
here okay the GS 750 one zero four three

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.430 
here okay the GS 750 one zero four three
five<00:03:20.810> now<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.870> engines<00:03:22.830> started<00:03:23.820> at<00:03:24.090> 1<00:03:24.360> 0<00:03:24.750> 0<00:03:25.140> 0

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
five now the engines started at 1 0 0 0

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.280 
five now the engines started at 1 0 0 0
1<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:26.880> would<00:03:27.060> be<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:28.370> 434th<00:03:29.570> bike<00:03:30.570> off<00:03:30.900> of

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
model year let's go ahead and fire it up

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:40.869 
model year let's go ahead and fire it up
and<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:58.980> can<00:03:59.130> hear<00:03:59.310> how<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.490> sounds

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:05:29.930 

low<00:04:41.449> beam<00:04:42.279> high<00:04:43.279> beam

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.210 

there<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.060> is<00:05:31.450> just<00:05:31.930> an<00:05:32.080> excellent<00:05:32.560> classic

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
there it is just an excellent classic

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.330 
there it is just an excellent classic
machine<00:05:33.640> here<00:05:34.470> it's<00:05:35.470> certainly<00:05:35.890> a<00:05:35.950> piece<00:05:36.190> of

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
machine here it's certainly a piece of

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.420 
machine here it's certainly a piece of
history<00:05:36.700> being<00:05:37.090> a<00:05:37.440> dealers<00:05:38.440> prototype<00:05:39.160> of

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
history being a dealers prototype of

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.470 
history being a dealers prototype of
what<00:05:40.330> was<00:05:40.480> yet<00:05:40.720> to<00:05:40.870> come<00:05:40.900> and<00:05:41.370> the<00:05:42.370> GS<00:05:42.700> 750

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
what was yet to come and the GS 750

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.220 
what was yet to come and the GS 750
certainly<00:05:44.350> was<00:05:44.500> a<00:05:45.390> historical<00:05:46.390> bike<00:05:46.630> for

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
certainly was a historical bike for

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.350 
certainly was a historical bike for
Suzuki<00:05:47.560> as<00:05:47.830> a<00:05:47.860> brand<00:05:48.190> at<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.640> time<00:05:48.880> they<00:05:49.210> had

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
Suzuki as a brand at the time they had

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.170 
Suzuki as a brand at the time they had
only<00:05:49.510> been<00:05:49.630> producing<00:05:51.270> two-stroke<00:05:52.270> bikes

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
only been producing two-stroke bikes

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.850 
only been producing two-stroke bikes
producing<00:05:55.180> this<00:05:55.420> bike<00:05:55.720> it<00:05:56.020> was<00:05:56.110> a<00:05:56.170> basically<00:05:56.770> a

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
producing this bike it was a basically a

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.530 
producing this bike it was a basically a
last-ditch<00:05:57.400> effort<00:05:57.580> of<00:05:57.940> them<00:05:58.120> trying<00:05:58.450> to

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
last-ditch effort of them trying to

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.270 
last-ditch effort of them trying to
compete<00:05:58.900> with<00:05:58.960> Honda

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
compete with Honda

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.830 
compete with Honda
so<00:06:00.670> this<00:06:00.990> 750<00:06:02.010> actually<00:06:03.010> was<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:03.370> first

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
so this 750 actually was the first

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.310 
so this 750 actually was the first
Suzuki<00:06:05.070> four-stroke<00:06:06.070> bike<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:06.910> be<00:06:07.320> produced

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
in mass as it was it's actually the the

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.060 
in mass as it was it's actually the the
