00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
mandolin and I wish I catch it pretty

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.880 
mandolin and I wish I catch it pretty
much<00:02:37.269> compatible<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.110> it's<00:02:38.290> mostly<00:02:38.620> enough

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
much compatible that it's mostly enough

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.759 
much compatible that it's mostly enough
model<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:40.630> you're<00:02:40.780> gonna<00:02:40.870> multi<00:02:41.260> any<00:02:41.380> away<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
model so you're gonna multi any away the

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.589 
model so you're gonna multi any away the
Machine<00:02:42.130> here<00:02:42.400> we<00:02:42.970> could<00:02:43.120> think<00:02:43.329> about<00:02:43.360> these

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
Machine here we could think about these

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.370 
Machine here we could think about these
mini<00:02:43.840> our<00:02:43.989> cages<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.650> really<00:02:45.069> stable<00:02:46.380> stable

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
mini our cages is really stable stable

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.789 
mini our cages is really stable stable
under<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:49.140> yeah<00:02:50.140> that's<00:02:50.349> what<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.590> try<00:02:50.769> to

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
under this yeah that's what you try to
