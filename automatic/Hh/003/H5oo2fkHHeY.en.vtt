 a pet bomb with a starfish is a 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.920
 game 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.710
 You may even be asking yourself. 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.620
 how is it, like a pet will have a 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.649
 stardom is because this is a new good to 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.350
 pet he is trying to imitate the country 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.679
 so they have enough in some 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.139
 country there are some things imitating feet 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:48.760

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.660
 the league table the league got very 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:11.620
 bad because the normal friend had 38 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:13.550
 games here but this league has 50 in 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.850
 59 games 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.490
 so who will play 51 games in a league 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.720
 and in just one season has not 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.320
 fitting 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.760
 and here go if you enter here will have a 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.150
 business that I think has an xbox 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.120
 also that it is the note of the players 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.390
 best players in the league here is good 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.390
 cool 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.979
 the pain i have now created a little career 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:45.929
 I played some games, I just read other then 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:49.109
 17 years just to show subject and now 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:52.619
 I will show another way that was well 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:55.469
 cool no bumba pet the best of the hour 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.100
 I think you who are fans of faith expands 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:02.340
 pet bomb you're going to like is a 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.149
 dismissal than that very old way that 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.410
 had at 2009 weight had in 2010 foot and 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:13.470
 that I'm not afraid of these new roles 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.660
 2012 forward did not have that way anymore 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.760
 world that is the way you choose 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.549
 a team can be from anywhere in the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.970
 planet and you will do in missions that 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:27.540
 He says, like, I've done some 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.670
 missions here I won here in 15 missions 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.440
 in the round of j 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.420
 the European round that just a look here 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.380
 was more hurt at the end 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.829
 then the European molding cold comes 5 in the 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.730
 end of the missions round african hear 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:50.940
 two are missing one from the continent as well 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.120
 advanced in his young work hard and 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.680
 It's really cool here. You can see the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:03.359
 mission have been winning with two goals 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.819
 head or you have to earn the 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:10.019
 play and have to make at least two goals 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.000
 This is how these headaches work . 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.030
 were the two biggest changes I 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.650
 I really liked this game and the last one 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.140
 thing I wanted to show that I did not 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.930
 I know if you came here. 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.770
 shop you will find a neighborhood type of 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.430
 ball 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:30.420
 I'll find the ball is watermelon meat neighborhood 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.790
 The keys are so cool, good for you. 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.120
 likes to have some fun in games 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.950
 because the play doh is okay, it's getting 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.560
 well outdated 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.220
 so these things are fun these 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.680
 Ball modes look great in the game and 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:51.000

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.510

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.850
 A little bit of the game I'm going to get a ball. 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:04.470
 different is where the type of ball is there 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.989
 have all the samples bought and do not use 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.130

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.890

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.040

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.430

 commenting on your opinion is very 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:32.370
 important the channel team is to pretend 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.500

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.110
