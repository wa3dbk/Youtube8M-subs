so you can see them and it will open up
both<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.680> i<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:53.160> both<00:00:53.340> deserve<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
both because i think they both deserve a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.319 
both because i think they both deserve a
look<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:55.039> basically<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.309> two<00:00:56.579> piece<00:00:56.850> style

stay put like when I put it in here it
doesn't<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.340> move<00:01:26.580> out<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> then

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
doesn't want to like move out and then

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.090 
doesn't want to like move out and then
also<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.049> going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.200> absorb<00:01:28.380> shock<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
also it's going to absorb shock and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100 
also it's going to absorb shock and
impact<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.210> first<00:01:30.450> step<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.990> installing

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
impact so the first step to installing

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.840 
impact so the first step to installing
is<00:01:31.530> place<00:01:31.829> your<00:01:31.860> phone<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:32.759> you
