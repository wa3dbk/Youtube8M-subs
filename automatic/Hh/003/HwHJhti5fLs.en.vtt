00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 I 'm going to teach today to do a 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.970
 very powerful microscope use phone 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.970
 cell phone 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.290
 this is another experiment 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.420
 World Book Book 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.490
 You still do not know he has a book. 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.359
 just click on a link here below to 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.820
 to know more 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.199
 besides the camera phone you go 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.789
 also need something 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.890
 transparent I'll use a 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.050
 but it can be a glass for 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.849
 example you will also need a piece 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.740
 to see eb to this kind of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.040
 If you do not have 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.050
 to be a thick paper some tape 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.350
 I'll use some paper support here. 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.600
 letters and a lens that I will take from 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.100
 a burned-out DVD drive if you do not 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.050
 have a dvd drive 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.219
 you can use a camera lens had 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.719
 laser 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.520
 after you do a microscope you 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.680
 can put the lens is back like this 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.719
 you will not lose your home talent 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.850
 The first step is to make a 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.649
 microscope I'm going to use here two daughters 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.050
 book that will serve as a leaf 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.000
 I'm going to leave a gap between them. 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.670
 If I'm going to put the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.650
 cd cover lisa that other part 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.979
 will stay a little further back here in 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.439
 On top of it, I'll put the cell phone 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.330
 now I will rescue the lens is in 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.320
 From the DVD box to this I'm going to take 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.570
 all dvd casting and lens is that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.640
 here do not forget to save 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.090
 the two superiors on the side of the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.750
 lens and the small motor that opens the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.460
 DVD 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.860
 these ingredients are great for 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.750
 do various other experiences 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.640
 the third step is to make a backup 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.439
 learn this lens using a little bit 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.780
 to see I'm going to cut a square of 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.000
 more or less 2 by 2 centimeters in the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.399
 half of it to make a hole to fit 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.070
 the lens I'm going to stick this exactly 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.020
 on top of the cell phone lens with tape 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.759
 adhesive 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.259
 the microscope is almost ready 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.020
 But you will realize that you will have to 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.939
 put the lens too close to the object 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.310
 that you are observing to be able to focus 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.770
 and to control this distance has to 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.950
 it is too short to use some letters with 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.990
 the damn 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.000
 And as you can only imagine, it's missing. 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.050
 something cool for people watching 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.690
 microscope 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.380
 I'm going to call somebody to help me find 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.380
 this cool stuff 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:46.400
 [Music] 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:03:44.930
 O 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:03:47.099
 [Music] 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.560
 now that you can see with me 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.319
 these microscopic images do not understand 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.379
 like this microscope so simple 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.000
 that tiny lens that 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.909
 people dug from the dvd is a lens 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.250
 that is to say after the 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.829
 of light pass through it they meet 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.030
 and this lens serves as a magnifying glass 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.829
 magnifier 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.230
 and how a lens is capable of 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.900
 magnify an image everything a lens 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.150
 do is divert the rays of light 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.549
 the rays of light come out of the object pass 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.720
 the lens and change direction 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.729
 there you have the impression that it is 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.370
 having an image larger than this image 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.599
 that is behind there and is exactly 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.280
 This is what happens with our 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:29.340
 the microscope, we have a lens 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.889
 tiny but super powerful more 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.410
 videos that turbin the utilities of your 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:38.100
 cell phone you find on the channel 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:43.570
 book the world manual 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:46.340
 [Music] 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.320
 if you were surprised by the images of 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.810
 homemade microscope do not forget the one 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.180
 jewelry here in the video I'll leave as 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.090
 other things that make the 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.680
 cell has become a urinary tract 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.170
 pressed one of the cool things 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.600
 of the world's manual that is the projector 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.190
 Homemade made with singular you can 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.280
 transform your cell phone 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.020
 a screen of more than 30 inches and the 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.910
 on the other side and I will leave a technique 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.410
 very cool you can write 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.410
 like pike using the cell phone
