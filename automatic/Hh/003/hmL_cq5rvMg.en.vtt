we went camping on

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.349

a<00:01:59.789> very<00:02:00.789> cold<00:02:01.000> date<00:02:01.270> so<00:02:01.659> winter<00:02:01.929> camp<00:02:02.289> out<00:02:02.500> and

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
a very cold date so winter camp out and

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.669 
a very cold date so winter camp out and
it<00:02:04.359> held<00:02:04.600> up<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.109> cold<00:02:05.439> weather<00:02:06.240> since

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
it held up to the cold weather since

there are no ventilation at the bottom

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:19.320 
there are no ventilation at the bottom
so<00:02:11.650> it's<00:02:11.830> sealed<00:02:12.129> from<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.610> bottom<00:02:18.330> so

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
so it's sealed from the bottom so

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.080 
so it's sealed from the bottom so
