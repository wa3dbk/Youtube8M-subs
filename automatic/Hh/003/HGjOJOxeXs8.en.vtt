start<00:02:47.700> with<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:47.970> right<00:02:48.209> here<00:02:48.359> this<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.599> a<00:02:48.720> 3.5

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
start with this right here this is a 3.5

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.379 
start with this right here this is a 3.5
millimeter<00:02:49.849> gold-plated<00:02:50.849> Jack's<00:02:51.180> you're

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
millimeter gold-plated Jack's you're

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:52.640 
millimeter gold-plated Jack's you're
gonna<00:02:51.480> get<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.780> highest<00:02:52.049> audio<00:02:52.470> quality

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
gonna get the highest audio quality

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.500 
gonna get the highest audio quality
possible<00:02:53.310> because<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.609> is<00:02:53.700> gold-plated<00:02:54.000> and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
possible because it is gold-plated and

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.569 
possible because it is gold-plated and
at<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.319> end<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.560> has<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.799> nice<00:02:55.980> secure<00:02:56.400> thing

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
at the end it has this nice secure thing

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.099 
at the end it has this nice secure thing
right<00:02:56.730> here<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.940> like<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.389> because<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.989> keeps

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
right here I like this because it keeps

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.199 
right here I like this because it keeps
the<00:02:58.319> wire<00:02:58.500> from<00:02:58.709> breaking<00:02:59.159> like<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.849> makes<00:03:00.090> it

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
the wire from breaking like it makes it

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.119 
the wire from breaking like it makes it
harder<00:03:01.109> for<00:03:01.139> the<00:03:01.319> wire<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.590> break<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:01.889> I<00:03:01.950> like

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
harder for the wire to break so I like

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.619 
harder for the wire to break so I like
that<00:03:02.250> they<00:03:02.370> have<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.730> metal<00:03:03.180> piece<00:03:03.389> right

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
that they have this metal piece right

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.030 
that they have this metal piece right
here<00:03:03.659> well<00:03:04.019> it's<00:03:04.200> not<00:03:04.349> really<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> metal<00:03:04.920> it's

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
here well it's not really a metal it's

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.160 
here well it's not really a metal it's
plastic<00:03:05.489> but<00:03:05.670> yeah<00:03:05.819> and<00:03:06.090> then<00:03:06.720> what<00:03:06.930> we<00:03:07.019> have

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
plastic but yeah and then what we have

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.170 
plastic but yeah and then what we have
is<00:03:07.349> a<00:03:07.470> nice<00:03:07.680> gray<00:03:08.069> wire<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:08.639> really<00:03:08.849> long<00:03:09.000> it

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
is a nice gray wire it's really long it

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.509 
is a nice gray wire it's really long it
runs<00:03:09.450> I'm<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.409> sure<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.739> exact<00:03:11.069> length<00:03:11.280> but

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
runs I'm not sure the exact length but

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.789 
runs I'm not sure the exact length but
it's<00:03:11.639> a<00:03:11.700> nice<00:03:11.849> length<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.500> will<00:03:13.620> go<00:03:13.769> to

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
it's a nice length so that it will go to

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.039 
it's a nice length so that it will go to
your<00:03:13.980> pocket<00:03:14.519> up<00:03:14.730> here<00:03:15.269> years<00:03:15.810> with<00:03:16.019> no

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
problem at all right here we had the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.259 
problem at all right here we had the
little<00:03:18.840> splitter<00:03:19.319> on<00:03:19.560> which<00:03:20.129> it<00:03:20.579> has<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> idea

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
little splitter on which it has the idea

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.879 
little splitter on which it has the idea

quality from these bad boys right here
the<00:05:46.529> only<00:05:46.770> really<00:05:47.070> doubtful<00:05:47.460> i<00:05:47.520> can<00:05:47.669> see

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
the only really doubtful i can see

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.890 
the only really doubtful i can see
through<00:05:47.940> these<00:05:48.000> headphones<00:05:48.210> is<00:05:48.630> that<00:05:48.840> they

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
through these headphones is that they

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.300 
through these headphones is that they
don't<00:05:49.110> have<00:05:49.260> a<00:05:49.289> volume<00:05:49.680> control<00:05:49.740> on<00:05:50.159> the

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
don't have a volume control on the

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.430 
don't have a volume control on the
inline<00:05:50.669> control<00:05:50.849> that's<00:05:51.810> pretty<00:05:52.139> much<00:05:52.380> the

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
inline control that's pretty much the

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.190 
inline control that's pretty much the
only<00:05:52.650> thing<00:05:53.130> i<00:05:53.250> can<00:05:53.310> think<00:05:53.430> of<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:53.969> would<00:05:54.029> be

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
only thing i can think of that would be

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.600 
only thing i can think of that would be
remotely<00:05:55.200> bad<00:05:55.500> about<00:05:55.740> these<00:05:55.889> headphones<00:05:56.130> um

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
remotely bad about these headphones um

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.000 
remotely bad about these headphones um
so<00:05:57.330> I<00:05:57.360> mean<00:05:57.630> if<00:05:57.659> they<00:05:57.779> had<00:05:57.960> had<00:05:58.380> added<00:05:58.680> a<00:05:58.740> volume

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
so I mean if they had had added a volume

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.950 
so I mean if they had had added a volume
control<00:05:59.039> one<00:05:59.669> hundred<00:05:59.940> percent<00:05:59.969> without<00:06:00.810> the

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
control one hundred percent without the

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.240 
control one hundred percent without the
volume<00:06:01.229> control<00:06:01.500> it's<00:06:01.650> not<00:06:01.800> that<00:06:01.950> big<00:06:02.070> of<00:06:02.130> a

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
volume control it's not that big of a

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.700 
volume control it's not that big of a
deal<00:06:02.430> but<00:06:03.330> I<00:06:03.389> wish<00:06:03.960> they<00:06:04.110> did<00:06:04.320> have<00:06:04.440> a<00:06:04.469> volume

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
deal but I wish they did have a volume

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.600 
deal but I wish they did have a volume
control<00:06:04.800> that<00:06:05.159> would<00:06:05.279> have<00:06:05.370> made<00:06:05.430> these

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
control that would have made these

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.040 
control that would have made these
