hey guys and welcome back this tutorial
is<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:03.000> teach<00:00:03.179> you<00:00:03.360> how<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.540> make<00:00:03.780> a

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
is going to teach you how to make a

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.590 
is going to teach you how to make a
compact<00:00:04.319> security<00:00:04.920> staircase<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:05.609> designed

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
compact security staircase I designed

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.500 
compact security staircase I designed
this<00:00:06.720> for<00:00:06.779> use<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.109> my<00:00:07.319> livestream<00:00:07.770> but<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.940> was

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
this for use in my livestream but I was

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.780 
this for use in my livestream but I was
always<00:00:09.660> worried<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.080> my<00:00:10.740> staircase<00:00:11.040> was<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
always worried that my staircase was the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.999 
always worried that my staircase was the
weak<00:00:11.940> point<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.420> my<00:00:12.540> design<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.559> just<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
weak point in my design so it's just a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.070 
weak point in my design so it's just a
too<00:00:14.400> wide<00:00:14.759> staircase<00:00:15.179> all<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> way<00:00:15.750> up<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.960> my

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
too wide staircase all the way up to my

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.720 
too wide staircase all the way up to my
base<00:00:16.260> not<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> very<00:00:16.920> long<00:00:17.070> staircase<00:00:17.430> or

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
base not a very long staircase or

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.870 
base not a very long staircase or
anything<00:00:17.880> like<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.170> but<00:00:19.170> nonetheless

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
anything like that but nonetheless

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.519 
anything like that but nonetheless
spiders<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.270> zombies<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:22.109> everything<00:00:22.380> else

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
spiders and zombies and everything else

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.779 
spiders and zombies and everything else
would<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.830> come<00:00:23.010> walking<00:00:23.189> right<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.699> my

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
would just come walking right up to my

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.450 
would just come walking right up to my
base<00:00:23.970> especially<00:00:24.750> creepers<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> hate<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.130> I

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
base especially creepers I hate it so I

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.830 
base especially creepers I hate it so I
wanted<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> design<00:00:27.240> something<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.630> would<00:00:27.779> be

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
wanted to design something that would be

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.200 
wanted to design something that would be
compact<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.650> fit<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> area<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> map

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
compact to fit in the area of the map

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.530 
compact to fit in the area of the map
that<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.449> using<00:00:30.630> as<00:00:30.900> well<00:00:31.710> as<00:00:32.090> be<00:00:33.090> secure

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
that I'm using as well as be secure

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.000 
that I'm using as well as be secure
against<00:00:33.899> monsters<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.410> isn't<00:00:34.800> great<00:00:34.980> for

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
against monsters this isn't great for

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.520 
against monsters this isn't great for
PvP<00:00:35.730> servers<00:00:36.120> or<00:00:36.270> anything<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:37.079> will<00:00:37.350> work

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
PvP servers or anything this will work

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340 
PvP servers or anything this will work
great<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.280> survival<00:00:38.700> server<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:40.170> what<00:00:40.320> I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
great in a survival server so what I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.369 
great in a survival server so what I
have<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.940> three<00:00:41.940> stairs<00:00:42.210> stacked<00:00:42.809> with

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
have here is three stairs stacked with

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.619 
have here is three stairs stacked with
sticky<00:00:43.710> pistons<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.190> top<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.550> bottom<00:00:44.700> to

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
sticky pistons on the top and bottom to

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.209 
sticky pistons on the top and bottom to
keep<00:00:45.780> them<00:00:45.930> straight<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.440> then<00:00:46.860> they<00:00:47.010> will

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
keep them straight and then they will

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.209 
keep them straight and then they will
when<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> switch<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.600> pressed<00:00:48.980> turn<00:00:49.980> into<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
when the switch is pressed turn into a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.610 
when the switch is pressed turn into a
regular<00:00:50.520> staircase<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.410> automatically<00:00:52.410> time

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
regular staircase and automatically time

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.160 
regular staircase and automatically time
out<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:53.190> lock<00:00:53.430> down<00:00:53.610> again<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> Redstone

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
out to lock down again so the Redstone

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.299 
out to lock down again so the Redstone
is<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.469> simple<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:55.920> take<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
is really simple you just take the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.330 
is really simple you just take the
pressure<00:00:56.550> plate<00:00:56.899> redstone<00:00:57.920> then<00:00:58.920> into<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
pressure plate redstone then into the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.170 
pressure plate redstone then into the
first<00:00:59.579> level<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:01.670> Pistons<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
first level of Pistons you have the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.080 
first level of Pistons you have the
repeaters<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:04.949> steps<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
repeaters going up a little steps you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.050 
repeaters going up a little steps you
have<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.350> redstone<00:01:08.130> torches<00:01:08.490> which<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:08.880> on

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
have the redstone torches which are on

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.910 
have the redstone torches which are on
all<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.390> time<00:01:09.510> except<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> buttons

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
all the time except for when the buttons

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.469 
all the time except for when the buttons
get<00:01:11.070> pressed<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.939> leaves<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
get pressed so that leaves this in the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.179 
get pressed so that leaves this in the
out<00:01:12.630> position<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.799> when<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> buttons

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
out position and then when the buttons

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.060 
out position and then when the buttons
pressed<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.700> sucks<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.150> therein<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
pressed it sucks this therein so that

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.630 
pressed it sucks this therein so that
way<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.720> effect<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:20.310> up<00:01:20.430> here<00:01:20.580> on

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
way you get this effect and up here on

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.010 
way you get this effect and up here on
top<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.060> there's<00:01:21.180> two<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.479> pressure<00:01:21.720> plates

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
top and there's two more pressure plates

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.380 
top and there's two more pressure plates
and<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.830> by<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:22.979> way<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.030> all

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and just by the way that this is all

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.760 
and just by the way that this is all
arranged<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.170> acts<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.250> these<00:01:26.430> torches<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
arranged it acts on these torches and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.640 
arranged it acts on these torches and
makes<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> whole<00:01:29.040> circuit<00:01:29.369> work<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.500> can

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
makes the whole circuit work so you can

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.100 
makes the whole circuit work so you can
walk<00:01:31.829> down<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.329> as<00:01:33.450> easily<00:01:33.600> as<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.960> can

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
walk down it just as easily as you can

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.420 
walk down it just as easily as you can
walk<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.619> no<00:01:35.340> problem<00:01:36.860> there<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.040> nothing

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
walk up it no problem there is nothing

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.770 
walk up it no problem there is nothing
fancy<00:01:38.549> about<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:38.970> think<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.240> takes<00:01:39.390> 28

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
fancy about it I think it takes 28

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.870 
fancy about it I think it takes 28
redstone<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> way<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> did<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> also<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
redstone the way I did it also one of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.460 
redstone the way I did it also one of
these<00:01:42.150> sides<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.869> taken<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.259> if<00:01:43.380> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
these sides can be taken out if you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.410 
these sides can be taken out if you
would<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.549> design<00:01:45.240> things

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
would like I like to design things

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.420 
would like I like to design things
symmetrically<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:46.619> I'm<00:01:46.710> OCD<00:01:47.189> but

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
symmetrically just because I'm OCD but

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
symmetrically just because I'm OCD but
you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.670> save<00:01:48.090> resources<00:01:48.299> by<00:01:48.689> taking<00:01:49.350> out<00:01:49.500> one

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
you can save resources by taking out one

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.510 
you can save resources by taking out one
half<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.610> circuit<00:01:51.740> over<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.369> have

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
half of this circuit over here we have

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.130 
half of this circuit over here we have
the<00:01:53.700> hidden<00:01:53.939> design<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.899> how<00:01:54.990> it's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the hidden design so this is how it's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.690 
the hidden design so this is how it's
gonna<00:01:55.200> look<00:01:55.320> much<00:01:55.680> done<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.430> where<00:01:56.610> all

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
gonna look much done this is where all

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.520 
gonna look much done this is where all
the<00:01:56.820> red<00:01:57.000> stones<00:01:57.240> hidden<00:01:57.479> everything<00:01:58.350> looks

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the red stones hidden everything looks

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.620 
the red stones hidden everything looks
in<00:01:58.649> its<00:01:58.799> finished<00:01:59.130> state<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.670> added<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.509> mean

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
in its finished state I added I mean

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.389 
in its finished state I added I mean
these<00:02:00.750> three<00:02:01.079> rows<00:02:01.259> here<00:02:01.560> are<00:02:01.740> all<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.159> added

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
these three rows here are all just added

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.130 
these three rows here are all just added
for<00:02:02.640> decoration<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.540> row<00:02:03.719> here<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
for decoration but this row here and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.200 
for decoration but this row here and
this<00:02:04.590> row<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.490> hide<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> redstone

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
this row here are to hide the redstone

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.600 
this row here are to hide the redstone
it<00:02:06.869> works<00:02:07.079> great<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.439> also<00:02:07.710> added<00:02:07.979> ledges<00:02:08.429> here

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
it works great I also added ledges here

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.969 
it works great I also added ledges here
to<00:02:08.729> keep<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> spiders<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.560> at<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.679> point<00:02:10.890> in

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
to keep the spiders out at this point in

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.890 
to keep the spiders out at this point in
the<00:02:11.099> design<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.910> only<00:02:12.239> way<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> monster<00:02:12.780> can

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
the design the only way a monster can

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.550 
the design the only way a monster can
get<00:02:13.080> into<00:02:13.290> your<00:02:13.379> house

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
get into your house

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 
get into your house
is<00:02:13.800> by<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> spider<00:02:14.280> climbing<00:02:14.730> up<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:15.090> exact

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
is by a spider climbing up this exact

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.960 
is by a spider climbing up this exact
wall<00:02:15.959> or<00:02:16.260> by<00:02:16.770> an<00:02:16.860> Enderman<00:02:17.280> transporting<00:02:17.849> it

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
wall or by an Enderman transporting it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.300 
wall or by an Enderman transporting it
so<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.330> works<00:02:18.450> great<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:19.620> run<00:02:19.890> straight<00:02:20.130> up

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
so it works great it's run straight up

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.990 
so it works great it's run straight up
it<00:02:20.489> no<00:02:21.270> problem<00:02:21.890> run<00:02:22.890> straight<00:02:23.310> down<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.700> no

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
it no problem run straight down it no

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.300 
it no problem run straight down it no
worries<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:25.050> locks<00:02:25.260> behind<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.830> nothing's

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
worries it locks behind you nothing's

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.740 
worries it locks behind you nothing's
gonna<00:02:26.430> follow<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.090> creepers<00:02:27.450> will<00:02:27.569> stay

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
gonna follow you the creepers will stay

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.870 
gonna follow you the creepers will stay
out<00:02:27.870> here<00:02:28.080> even<00:02:28.380> when<00:02:28.470> you're<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.620> here<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.160> know

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
out here even when you're in here I know

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.040 
out here even when you're in here I know
some<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.209> guys<00:02:30.269> are<00:02:30.450> probably<00:02:30.480> thinking

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
some of you guys are probably thinking

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.750 
some of you guys are probably thinking
you<00:02:31.170> know<00:02:31.290> well<00:02:31.530> these<00:02:31.860> pressure<00:02:32.130> plates

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
you know well these pressure plates

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.339 
you know well these pressure plates
you<00:02:33.120> know<00:02:33.209> creepers<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.690> stuff<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.050> activate

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
you know creepers and stuff can activate

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.089 
you know creepers and stuff can activate
them<00:02:34.470> too<00:02:34.620> but<00:02:35.870> in<00:02:36.870> my<00:02:37.050> experience<00:02:37.560> they<00:02:37.860> don't

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
them too but in my experience they don't

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.559 
them too but in my experience they don't
move<00:02:38.280> fast<00:02:38.610> enough<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:39.060> actually<00:02:39.180> get<00:02:39.450> up

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
move fast enough to actually get up

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.570 
move fast enough to actually get up
those<00:02:39.720> stairs<00:02:40.019> before<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.069> boots<00:02:41.430> them

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
those stairs before I just boots them

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.190 
those stairs before I just boots them
off<00:02:41.670> they're<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:41.970> know<00:02:42.030> slow<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:42.840> kicks

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
off they're you know slow it just kicks

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.440 
off they're you know slow it just kicks
them<00:02:43.349> off<00:02:43.440> right<00:02:43.590> here<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.000> hasn't<00:02:45.300> been

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
them off right here so that hasn't been

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.090 
them off right here so that hasn't been
a<00:02:45.540> problem<00:02:45.600> if<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.470> are<00:02:46.590> worried<00:02:46.890> about<00:02:46.950> it

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
a problem if you are worried about it

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.009 
a problem if you are worried about it
maybe<00:02:47.519> put<00:02:47.730> them<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.880> couple<00:02:48.060> spaces<00:02:48.299> back<00:02:48.720> and

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
maybe put them a couple spaces back and

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.449 
maybe put them a couple spaces back and
set<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.260> timing<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.680> little<00:02:49.709> bit<00:02:49.980> further<00:02:50.220> and

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
set the timing a little bit further and

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.979 
set the timing a little bit further and
you<00:02:50.519> can<00:02:50.670> just<00:02:50.790> sprint<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.690> way<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.870> can

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
you can just sprint in that way you can

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.930 
you can just sprint in that way you can
really<00:02:52.260> secure<00:02:53.010> yourself<00:02:53.130> from<00:02:53.519> creepers<00:02:53.910> and

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
really secure yourself from creepers and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.680 
really secure yourself from creepers and
whatnot<00:02:54.360> or<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:55.350> some<00:02:56.000> mod<00:02:57.000> packs<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.450> whatnot

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
whatnot or in some mod packs and whatnot

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.420 
whatnot or in some mod packs and whatnot
you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:57.989> also<00:02:58.140> add<00:02:58.470> pressure<00:02:59.010> plates<00:02:59.340> that

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
you can also add pressure plates that

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.009 
you can also add pressure plates that
are<00:02:59.489> activated<00:02:59.970> only<00:03:00.030> by<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.360> player<00:03:00.630> instead

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
are activated only by the player instead

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.870 
are activated only by the player instead
of<00:03:01.110> by<00:03:01.200> mobs<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:02.040> keep<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.370> mind<00:03:02.610> as<00:03:02.730> well

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
of by mobs so keep that in mind as well

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.539 
of by mobs so keep that in mind as well
another<00:03:03.599> way<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.080> activate<00:03:04.470> these<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:05.010> by

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
another way you can activate these is by

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.059 
another way you can activate these is by
using<00:03:06.269> some<00:03:06.959> other<00:03:07.110> redstone<00:03:07.590> tools<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.950> can

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
using some other redstone tools you can

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.589 
using some other redstone tools you can
use<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.190> daylight<00:03:08.549> sensor<00:03:08.910> for<00:03:09.090> instance<00:03:09.390> so

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
use a daylight sensor for instance so

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.800 
use a daylight sensor for instance so
that<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.980> know<00:03:11.030> daylight<00:03:12.030> the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
that this is you know daylight the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.020 
that this is you know daylight the
staircase<00:03:13.290> will<00:03:13.470> open<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.280> then<00:03:14.910> at

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
staircase will open and then at

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.250 
staircase will open and then at
nighttime<00:03:15.209> when<00:03:15.480> all<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.630> monsters<00:03:15.959> come<00:03:16.140> out

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
nighttime when all the monsters come out

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.780 
nighttime when all the monsters come out
it'll<00:03:16.590> automatically<00:03:16.920> close<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.579> lock<00:03:17.730> down

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
it'll automatically close and lock down

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.150 
it'll automatically close and lock down
I<00:03:18.350> don't<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.709> as<00:03:19.829> well<00:03:19.859> as<00:03:20.070> the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
I don't like that as well as the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.430 
I don't like that as well as the
pressure<00:03:20.340> plate<00:03:20.609> system<00:03:20.820> just<00:03:21.690> because<00:03:21.989> I

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
pressure plate system just because I

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.900 
pressure plate system just because I
find<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.100> pressure<00:03:23.310> place<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.640> be<00:03:23.700> more

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
find the pressure place to be more

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.250 
find the pressure place to be more
convenient<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.570> can<00:03:24.690> also<00:03:24.810> just<00:03:25.049> use<00:03:25.230> a

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
convenient you can also just use a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.970 
convenient you can also just use a
regular<00:03:25.350> lever<00:03:26.120> activate<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.359> way<00:03:27.510> I

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
regular lever activate it that way I

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.819 
regular lever activate it that way I
think<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.340> pretty<00:03:29.519> good<00:03:29.609> design<00:03:29.970> overall

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829
