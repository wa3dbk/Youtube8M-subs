that<00:00:19.500> December<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.250> going<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
that December is going to be the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.660 
that December is going to be the
toughest<00:00:21.930> month<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.680> far<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.279> tough<00:00:23.490> as

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
toughest month so far it's as tough as

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.880 
toughest month so far it's as tough as
it's<00:00:23.850> gonna<00:00:23.970> get<00:00:24.330> especially<00:00:25.320> towards<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
it's gonna get especially towards the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.080 
it's gonna get especially towards the
end<00:00:25.920> because<00:00:26.279> we're<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.970> be

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
end because we're going to have to be

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.910 
end because we're going to have to be
coming<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:27.449> against<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> likes<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.349> Blackburn

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
coming up against the likes of Blackburn

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.030 
coming up against the likes of Blackburn
Watford<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> also<00:00:30.359> Cardiff<00:00:30.960> we've<00:00:31.470> done<00:00:31.769> well

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
Watford and also Cardiff we've done well

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.610 
Watford and also Cardiff we've done well
up<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.520> point<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.420> top<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.410> table

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
up to this point to be top of the table

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.010 
up to this point to be top of the table
but<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.520> could<00:00:35.910> potentially<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> mean<00:00:36.899> it's

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
but we could potentially I mean it's

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.569 
but we could potentially I mean it's
happen<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.469> other<00:00:37.620> teams<00:00:37.890> before<00:00:38.070> where<00:00:38.460> we

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
happen to other teams before where we

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
happen to other teams before where we
can<00:00:38.730> slip<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.300> towards<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> end<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.290> December

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
can slip up towards the end of December

down there because heading into the game

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.690 
down there because heading into the game
I<00:03:17.440> was<00:03:17.560> thinking<00:03:17.890> you<00:03:18.040> know<00:03:18.070> we<00:03:18.280> need<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.549> win

I was thinking you know we need to win
this<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:19.120> think<00:03:19.180> we<00:03:19.450> can<00:03:19.600> do<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:20.380> we<00:03:20.500> can<00:03:20.620> then

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
this I think we can do it so we can then

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.560 
this I think we can do it so we can then
go<00:03:20.920> on<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.100> beat<00:03:21.370> Fulham<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.820> week<00:03:22.000> after<00:03:22.239> and
