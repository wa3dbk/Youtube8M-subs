00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:11.519
 for such as it is very good afternoon days nights welcome to this the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.959
 puntonet digital news story that today has to do with 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.750
 the numbers of calderón but not the numbers against crime 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.660
 organized that we already know that it costs then that like that is not believing 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.560
 no one 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.970
 if not the numbers in your bank account 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.390
 and it's all because it comes has nothing to account for a 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.200
 one for a report a very good story that also publishes 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.650
 hide excellent journalist which good 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.010
 I greatly admire that Alvaro is called Slim in case he publishes the process 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.060
 and expressly about Calderón's fortune he is asked to read the 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.149
 full report we have alex adosac and in the 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.620
 and has the information sheet this video and also there we have 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.230
 the link 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.210
 they have in addition going to give us the data are more relevant bribes that grant 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.780
 most relevant this east of this report of Alvaro Slim 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.790
 when Calderón leaves the secretariat of energy and this I remember him very 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.750
 well why did he say it he used in an interview 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.220
 per cent in 2004 goes calderón 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.170
 and he says obesity that he had 32 thousand pesos nothing more in his in his accounts of 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.890
 Bank 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.200
 i had a deposit of 16 thousand dollars or so 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.320
 abroad is not was all the money I had 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.800
 the poor the energy secretary who had run out of chamba 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.700
 the funny thing the interesting thing at least 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.080
 is that evidence according to this without flame of 2004 2006 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.420
 and in 2006 when the campaign begins 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.750
 these 32 thousand pesos 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.380
 they became one hundred 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.229
 here we have in 288 thousand 495 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.580
 look, it stays according to the zinc samba 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.810
 and when he leaves, he only had 32,000 pesos left and returned two years later in 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.240
 2006 without work 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.789
 ghana good they have their accounts as he says 288 thousand pesos 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.940
 already as president 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.130
 that is also very interesting already as president in 2008 he declared income 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.450
 for 2 million 471 thousand pesos 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.509
 and he promised in campaign that he was not going to raise the salary 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.579
 thing that is forgetting very fast 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:20.889
 so fast that in 2009 he declares that of these 2 million 471 thousand pesos of 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:28.499
 2008 in 2009 are already 3 million 45 thousand 800 27 pesos this is 35 percent more 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:34.949
 of salaries of salary that he received in 2009 interesting very interesting 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:38.490
 he the report of 7 álvaro delgado 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.170
 We have highly recommended the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.060
 the agreement of the investigation that makes based on the statements 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.559
 patrimoniales portos official information 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:49.309
 and it's public information 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:53.329
 but physically I feel very but very short these these amounts 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.430
 are agencies that have to give this is that you have to account not for the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.539
 institute but access to public information 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.459
 but frankly frankly paths taught short there must be very many 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.559
 of information that we know of having a lot of other information 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.889
 that this one 3 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.569
 there are many, many more 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.369
 that this one millions of pesos i and that then for there they walk today not and we do not 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.699
 we realize 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.479
 nobody nobody is pointing out acts of corruption is less clear nobody 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.619
 notes that Calderón are corroborated everything that has stolen the money or something 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.969
 A) Yes 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.729
 simply 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:33.510
 Suddenly more money appeared to him and that he had run out of chamba 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.089
 before being president 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:39.129
 and that as president he promised not to raise his salary and if he raised it and 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.729
 saw them omb balmon in 5 percent sums up is a considerable increase that already 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.279
 Well, we would like very many Mexicans, but 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.460
 to Friday s is what you do calderón will have to see the numbers 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.699
 that are not public 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.739
 those those are the numbers 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.339
 that she is not much more interesting because 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.759
 because I do not think anything else in a couple of millions to 10 very much but 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:02.959
 a lot of money more 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.059
 and believe me, believe me 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:08.059
 what is this 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:12.550
 but many, many, many more 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.549
 maturana and in a way as sow as we can imagine this 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:23.099
 if the officials were not worth less, even if less were really worth 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.120
 these these amounts but 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.529
 Well when we see 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:31.039
 the insecurity that is the subject that we bring whenever digital news or 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.119
 when we see the health issue when we see percent pacts 

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:38.249
 politicians when we go to legislators who like to bring 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.370
 cocaine and guns 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.900
 well, they cost us dearly and 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.919
 plus 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.539
 excuse me but they are a ball of 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:48.879
 clowns 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:49.999
 drink it today 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:53.419

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.399
