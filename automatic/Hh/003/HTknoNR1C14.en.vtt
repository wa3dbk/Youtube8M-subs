hi<00:00:06.750> I'm<00:00:07.350> Oscar<00:00:07.560> from<00:00:07.830> Dave<00:00:07.980> hunter<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.550> this

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
hi I'm Oscar from Dave hunter and this

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.870 
hi I'm Oscar from Dave hunter and this
is<00:00:08.790> brems<00:00:09.330> Sifl<00:00:09.990> it's<00:00:10.710> actually<00:00:11.250> already<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
is brems Sifl it's actually already the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.419 
is brems Sifl it's actually already the
second<00:00:12.599> prototype<00:00:12.960> unless<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.250> guess

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
second prototype unless you can guess

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.829 
second prototype unless you can guess
from<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.820> name<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.179> puzzle<00:00:15.599> it's<00:00:15.719> an

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
from the name of the puzzle it's an

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.560 
from the name of the puzzle it's an
invention<00:00:16.139> by<00:00:16.500> Bram<00:00:16.830> Cohen<00:00:17.330> the<00:00:18.330> first

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
invention by Bram Cohen the first

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.200 
invention by Bram Cohen the first
version<00:00:19.400> one<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.550> have<00:00:20.640> seen<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:20.970> another

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
version one you have seen at another

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.599 
version one you have seen at another
video<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.039> was<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> failed

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
video is this one it was a failed

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.960 
video is this one it was a failed
prototype<00:00:24.150> because<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:25.230> was<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.099> box<00:00:26.369> full

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
prototype because it was just a box full

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.140 
prototype because it was just a box full
of<00:00:27.029> rattling<00:00:27.689> pieces<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.439> was<00:00:28.890> no<00:00:29.070> puzzle<00:00:29.460> but

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
of rattling pieces and was no puzzle but

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.350 
of rattling pieces and was no puzzle but
the<00:00:30.330> second<00:00:30.779> prototype<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.009> success<00:00:32.430> so

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the second prototype it's a success so

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.130 
the second prototype it's a success so
let<00:00:33.660> me<00:00:33.809> show<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.079> how<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.130> prototype<00:00:35.640> works

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
let me show you how this prototype works

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.190 
let me show you how this prototype works
what<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.170> see<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:38.059> well<00:00:39.059> an<00:00:39.300> octahedron<00:00:40.020> at

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
what you see is well an octahedron at

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.660 
what you see is well an octahedron at
the<00:00:40.320> outside<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.360> it<00:00:42.360> has<00:00:43.250> space<00:00:44.250> at<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the outside and it has space at the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.560 
the outside and it has space at the
inside<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.890> seven

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
inside and what you have is seven

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.380 
inside and what you have is seven
tetrahedral<00:00:48.570> pieces<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.829> piece<00:00:50.129> is

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
tetrahedral pieces so this piece is

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.840 
tetrahedral pieces so this piece is
yellow<00:00:51.390> orange<00:00:52.110> green<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.920> black<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
yellow orange green and black at the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.779 
yellow orange green and black at the
center<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.649> green<00:00:56.370> orange

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
center and this one is green orange

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.479 
center and this one is green orange
white<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.329> black<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.020> center<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.680> they

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
white and black in the center and they

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.990 
white and black in the center and they
can<00:00:59.760> shift<00:01:00.390> position<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.370> seven<00:01:02.850> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
can shift position so there are seven of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.039 
can shift position so there are seven of
these<00:01:03.270> tetrahedrons<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> whole<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
these tetrahedrons and as a whole and

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.039 
these tetrahedrons and as a whole and
you<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.260> move<00:01:07.610> one<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.850> tetrahedrons<00:01:09.540> at

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
you can move one of the tetrahedrons at

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.230 
you can move one of the tetrahedrons at
the<00:01:10.200> inside<00:01:10.560> through<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.189> hole<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> other

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the inside through the hole to the other

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.550 
the inside through the hole to the other
side<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.200> I'll<00:01:13.290> show<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:14.340> move<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.560> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
side so I'll show you one move and it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.800 
side so I'll show you one move and it
takes<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.130> dexterity<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:18.659> we

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
takes a bit of dexterity but there we

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.160 
takes a bit of dexterity but there we
are

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
are

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.800 
are
so<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.150> moved<00:01:21.540> one

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so here you see that I have moved one

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.380 
so here you see that I have moved one
piece<00:01:22.200> from<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.180> one

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
piece from here to there it's the one

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.569 
piece from here to there it's the one
that's<00:01:24.860> green<00:01:26.060> red<00:01:27.060> white<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.900> black<00:01:28.770> here<00:01:29.490> it

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that's green red white and black here it

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.830 
that's green red white and black here it
is<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.409> let<00:01:31.409> me<00:01:31.560> show<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.890> another<00:01:32.729> move<00:01:33.180> so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
is and let me show you another move so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.260 
is and let me show you another move so
now<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> hole<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.840> I'm<00:01:36.840> moving<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
now the hole is here and I'm moving the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.770 
now the hole is here and I'm moving the
red<00:01:39.270> blue<00:01:40.229> white<00:01:40.680> piece<00:01:40.979> into<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.939> hole<00:01:42.180> like

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
red blue white piece into the hole like

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.670 
red blue white piece into the hole like
this<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:44.210> when<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.570> when<00:01:45.840> I'm<00:01:46.020> Midway

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
this and when you see when I'm Midway

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.920 
this and when you see when I'm Midway
the<00:01:47.189> turn<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
the turn you can see that there is a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.590 
the turn you can see that there is a
sort<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.409> arrow<00:01:49.680> shape<00:01:50.130> at<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> middle<00:01:50.939> which

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
sort of arrow shape at the middle which

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.770 
sort of arrow shape at the middle which
hooks<00:01:51.899> into<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.610> tetrahedron<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.329> reason

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
hooks into the tetrahedron the reason

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.530 
hooks into the tetrahedron the reason
for<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.740> without<00:01:56.640> those<00:01:57.060> arrows

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
for that is that without those arrows

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.810 
for that is that without those arrows
all<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.350> pieces<00:01:58.590> would<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.280> float<00:01:59.610> around

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
all the pieces would just float around

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.630 
all the pieces would just float around
as<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.689> their<00:02:00.869> first<00:02:01.110> prototype<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.460> was

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
as in their first prototype so that was

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.499 
as in their first prototype so that was
my<00:02:02.820> solution

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
my solution

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.230 
my solution
for<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.049> second<00:02:04.380> prototype<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.969> course

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
for the second prototype and of course

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.059 
for the second prototype and of course
you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.570> guess<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.110> object<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> puzzle

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
you can guess the object of the puzzle

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.490 
you can guess the object of the puzzle
it<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.789> move<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.450> tetrahedron<00:02:10.080> surround

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it is to move the tetrahedron surround

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.940 
it is to move the tetrahedron surround
all<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.370> way<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.819> then<00:02:12.599> try<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.260> get<00:02:13.590> them

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
all the way and then try to get them

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.920 
all the way and then try to get them
back<00:02:14.069> in<00:02:14.370> color<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.870> we're<00:02:16.140> almost<00:02:16.319> now<00:02:17.930> my

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
back in color like we're almost now my

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.430 
back in color like we're almost now my
question<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:20.599> first<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.810> all<00:02:21.959> about

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
question to you is first of all about
