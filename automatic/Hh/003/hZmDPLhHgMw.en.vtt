00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.519
 the galera that is in play with another blog 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.929
 for you 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.719
 It has been a long time that was not in 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.859
 guys and I decided to bring this blog that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.910
 I wanted to say a few things to 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.840
 you're mostly not okay until the end 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.160
 I want to talk some things 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.900
 important 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.960
 the first important thing to talk about 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.650
 with you is that the channel is a partner of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.030
 minecraft when you like shirts 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.170
 mouse pad is all minecraft plushies 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.500
 a specific minecraft store goes there 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.250
 access the link in the video description is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.200
 low and only 6 click on the link 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.010
 affiliated with the channel you may have 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.780
 also promotions then access this link 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.680
 and take a look there if you find 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.780
 Anything interesting here? 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.860
 and something else I wanted to talk to you 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.610
 because it's usually live 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.710
 not everyone watches all live and me 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.700
 talk a lot but he only is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.040
 important to blog for you both 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.670
 speaking other things you do not see 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.610
 live then beauty is first things 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.869
 saw that there is a new series called era 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.210
 since it is a historical series but 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.340
 that is not a killing machine like some 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.799
 people who were wanting I left the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.759
 freedom for other people to do 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.340
 maschmann but it was not necessary and there 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.590
 within this series beyond that beginning 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.210
 that was history a story for 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.420
 show you how it came in 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.409
 in that world is during the series 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.549
 you will see several fable quests 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.479
 that the people who are doing the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.920
 missions right 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.240
 You saw the first one at three 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.909
 little pigs and people too 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.700
 They met other nice acquaintances. 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.099

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.720

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.550
 I like to tell you that sometimes I 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.030
 to mind some things but beyond 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.880
 social networks and web client skiff 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.060
 I went to something else that sometimes 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.540
 people do not know is what you want to see 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.720

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.530
 the first ones I threw then there 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.540
 are all the videos and have the things 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.610
 play lists that I always separated 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.840
 right for each series, and I was 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.270
 talking once 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.040
 I 'm thinking of posting every Wednesday at 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:11.330
 7 pm every Friday at 7 p.m. and Saturday 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:14.630
 the noon was once I the psdb tried 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.430
 Try because it's difficult, but it's day. 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.380
 I'm Sunday morning have to 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.320
 to be awake at dawn to send 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.919
 video but speak the truth to them 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.860
 every day and I have to 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.260
 organize better because it does not 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.870
 to stay alone a computer needs 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.510
 exercise physically that my 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.789

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:47.320
 Something to get out a little 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:49.550
