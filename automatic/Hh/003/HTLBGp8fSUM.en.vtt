 commenting and I bring you a gameplay of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.200
 black ops 2 this is a gameplay that 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.360
 it comes out that way from those who got the first 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.830
 day this is the game yesterday and the uploaded 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.320
 simply because it is the game that most 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.410
 I liked every day of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.730
 livestream and good the truth is that it is 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.770
 a game that I liked a lot because of the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.000
 The theme that is super moved is to touch a 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.000
 lots of gusts everybody goes with 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.310
 streaks death machines the uar machine 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.349
 they have everything of everything of all then 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.880
 He is a man that I liked a lot and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.170
 I also wanted because he was going to 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.550
 comment a lot of things as you are 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.489
 seeing developers is already star 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.320
 lg commentator and one of the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.230
 main and here you have the minimum to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.629
 this they are showing and the slogan of 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.430
 treyarch let's say that is they want the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.110
 game be entertaining to watch have not 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.210
 bet very strong for sports 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.660
 electronic, then a new one 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.640
 generation already know that in Korea 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.710
 is for example the starcraft is sport 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.690
 sport play when being coffee is like a 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.910
 national sport then let's say that 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.350
 they want it to be more or less not to that 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.700
 level but they would like to get to that 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.020
 level then they want it to be 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.250
 entertaining to see not all 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.050
 these days the games will be very 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.160
 entertaining to see and that's why a 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.600
 lots of things and tools that have 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.280
 I was putting before you had to stay 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.410
 in a single team you had to stay 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.640
 with one player and more or less and now 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.140
 you can choose in this menu how are you? 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.610
 seeing right the numbers are the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.570
 each player's streak 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.920
 you can see if he's capturing a 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.080
 flag in case it's that mode of 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.790
 game or is not catching the flag 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.200
 you can see this from one computer to another 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.520
 you can put a track from as seen 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.360
 at the beginning to know how they start 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.009
 Players 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.690
 the strategy would seek to destroy if they go 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.850
 all for the same pump because 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.680
 flanks go that kind of thing have they 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.810
 done as I tell you of slogan remember 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.840
 that this is a fun game 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.520
 to see then good here as you are 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.229
 minutes of mapi such that they talked and 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.090
 nothing the game are playing the 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.470
 Americans against the Europeans and 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.090
 you will say and these people who are in case 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.039
 you asked the people who do not know 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.619
 for here is the streak that throw frye is 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.850
 the hunter kill in the little house until I 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.250
 I think it's the cheapest after 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.569
 of the rc and radar but good the case is 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.530
 that the Americans are playing 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.640
 against 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.900
 Europeans for the European side 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.430
 they were playing aitex from germany and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.610
 then they were playing me prof on themselves 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.740
 then there were these 22 teams that 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.000
 was each each team of three we are 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.980
 playing these two together because that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.300
 starting six against six and testing 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.800
 American were playing the two 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.780
 of optics you know we were that won 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.370
 the cot exp and the one million tournament 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.959
 dollars that was last year a 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.750
 presentation of rafer mode 3 that was in 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.580
 September then next to it they were 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.410
 playing also the shipping team not 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.060
 they are playing shipments and optics by the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.019
 American side and then they were 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.690
 playing and ipex germany together with the 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.910
 own equipment and that is from uk then 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.530
 good as you are seeing is made 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.150
 1 where livestream is what the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.370
 you will have all posts in the channel 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.890
 treyarch tweets in which you can 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.530
 review the summary played hard 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.330
 point search and destroy are played multi 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.850
 team deathmatch were a lot of 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.650
 things and I do not here is when it's going to 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.340
 really start the action if you see that 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.340
 sometimes he separates 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.099
 in exterminate if it's simply because or 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.569
 the screen of your invention because 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.920
 separated the stream and as a servant 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.290
 example the bar and all this what 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.329
 I recorded, that is, do not repeat to anyone 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.640
 others simply it was recording me and 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.409
 nothing like I said was a streaming 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.290
 quite entertaining of course the 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.180
 slogan they have complied we go well to 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.709
 hair was very fun to see there is a 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.120
 heap of tools 6 infraction of 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.340
 commentator can change sector the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.620
 let's say let's do it where 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.030
 there's more more activity, so I 'm not 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.670
 watching here is the war machine the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.129
 Semi-automatic grenade launcher is one of 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.379
 the low runs and I think that also 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.420
 I think you can choose how you know 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.250
 play a help pack so that 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.900
 colleague and it was what used a lot of 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.730
 times and that is to say that they saw each other 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.319
 many of those during all the 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.269
 days not even though once you touch on 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.340
 helicopter and spectacular dogs 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.560
 or nothing simply touched radars more 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.420
 radars played also 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.770
 and prescribed them a couple of times but 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.690
 they played a lot of death machines 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.120
 and the world machines 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.670
 very many so let's say that they have 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.110
 put a very very small percentage per 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.520
 the least is what you saw is not a 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.560
 seen nothing or official data but it 's what 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.620
 that I can appreciate that they put on 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.519
 let's say a lot of 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.799
 percentages I think the percentage of 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.239
 that you hit a very high streak like 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.489
 before loaned when a game better 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.560
 and always plays the other team has not 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.090
 decided 30 when those of the other team 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.769
 they are very bad and they destroy the game 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.930
 and just luckily I do not think that 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.220
 now they have put it more as it is worth 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.530
 for the possibility that you throw yourself a 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.849
 packet with new dogs but it's very 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.280
 very complicated in fact I think that 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.750
 that ratio or that 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.550
 probability are better in the black 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.020
 ops since very rarely and they played 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.000
 dogs in the package always played 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.740
 ammunition radars and that kind of stuff without 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.349
 However in roll fairtrade mode you have a 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.180
 aid package and an ax straps 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.490
 6 pay blues and all that kind of stuff the 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.810
 I have seen that have played a lot of 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.820
 done I think they play with a lot 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.050
 often and maybe too much so 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.789
 Well, you are going to see how I tell you during 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.300
 all this gameplay this people are people 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:58.000
 than playing professionally at the level of 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.070
 this that they are winning teams charge 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.200
 juan tournaments 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.670
 in which money is played not money 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.810
 that he has put on them but there is a 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.790
 registration fee that pays your 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.160
 team with their sponsors sponsor them 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.710
 helmets brands to the best of cards 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.920
 graphics a bunch of sponsors in a 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.970
 team and with that money it hits the 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.010
 description for tournaments and 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.030
 participate in the league in the m the axis by 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.710
 example that is the league there from 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.720
 united states and others here you see another 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.090
 death machine and as I tell you very 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.650
 happy that they allowed us to see 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.120
 so many days 14 days of streaming 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.160
 quite entertaining as I say has 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.210
 very much liked the way in which 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.370
 have done it because it has been 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.650
 entertaining to see and here we are seeing 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.280
 it is astro that together with swiss are the 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.360
 most well-known commentators of the 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.950
 good energy at the American level that is 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.260
 the gel storm you already know it 's like 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.710
 predictor variation so to speak 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:53.080
 in which you simply choose one 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.340
 location or a point and put the chosen 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.780
 that the projector arrives I think it can 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.850
 say that in the predictor to that 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.950
 speed or you can choose to throw them before 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.260
 that before he arrives alone he does not but 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.300
 I think if you do not shoot, you only have the 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.280
 missiles for yourself I think when it falls 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.260
 the ground also explodes but good 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.000
 it's going like it's pretty enough 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.580
 absurd in addition as soon as what 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.110
 tires greater is the range that arrives 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.700
 that if you wait a lot because then 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.919
 that goes a little bad but good the 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.690
 departure is already finished is simply 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.060
 This is going to be one of the few gameplays that 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.770
 rise for the moment I do not know when they will take 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.480
 zombies everything I've told you is 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.669
 put a playlist of the 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.380
 Black ops 2 information is not known 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.639
 how do I tell you if you have any 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.440
 ask things you have not heard 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.090
 if you have seen all the videos and you say 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.650
 oysters and this how it works if we what 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.000
 He told us he told us it is because I do not know 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.320
 because everything I've told you has been 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.850
 instantly informed during all
