you wind up in the womb of the earth
called<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.140> tomb<00:01:56.409> from<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:57.310> wound<00:01:57.609> up<00:01:57.909> to

called the tomb from the wound up to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.180 
called the tomb from the wound up to
this<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.130> whole<00:02:00.310> trip

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.130 

and<00:02:07.479> one<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.660> them<00:02:08.930> is<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.550> Sun<00:02:11.140> will

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
and one of them is that the Sun will

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.500 
and one of them is that the Sun will
appear<00:02:12.800> from<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.520> west<00:02:13.820> instead<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.920> east

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
appear from the west instead of the east

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.060 
appear from the west instead of the east
but<00:02:17.510> what<00:02:17.720> we<00:02:17.900> know<00:02:17.930> from<00:02:18.260> science<00:02:18.770> is<00:02:18.920> the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
but what we know from science is the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.870 
but what we know from science is the
follow<00:02:19.360> in<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.750> beginning<00:02:20.900> our<00:02:21.410> earth<00:02:22.370> used

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
follow in the beginning our earth used

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.110 
follow in the beginning our earth used
to<00:02:23.120> complete<00:02:23.570> one<00:02:24.080> complete<00:02:24.740> circle<00:02:25.130> around

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
to complete one complete circle around

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.140 
to complete one complete circle around
its<00:02:26.480> axis<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:27.290> four<00:02:27.590> hours<00:02:27.860> used<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.000> be<00:02:29.120> very

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
its axis in four hours used to be very

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.400 
its axis in four hours used to be very
fast<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.890> has<00:02:31.190> been<00:02:31.490> slowing<00:02:32.120> down<00:02:32.750> since

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
fast and it has been slowing down since

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.570 
fast and it has been slowing down since
then<00:02:33.950> now<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.570> completes<00:02:36.320> one<00:02:36.980> rotation

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
then now it completes one rotation

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.460 
then now it completes one rotation
around<00:02:38.150> its<00:02:38.510> axis<00:02:38.840> in<00:02:39.670> 23<00:02:40.670> hours<00:02:41.290> 56<00:02:42.290> minutes

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
around its axis in 23 hours 56 minutes

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.930 
around its axis in 23 hours 56 minutes
and<00:02:43.010> 4<00:02:43.310> seconds<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.590> scientists<00:02:45.590> know<00:02:45.800> that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
and 4 seconds and scientists know that

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.560 
and 4 seconds and scientists know that
the<00:02:46.940> earth<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.480> going<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.080> slow<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:49.180> slow<00:02:50.180> and

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
the earth is going to slow and slow and

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.920 
the earth is going to slow and slow and
slow<00:02:51.410> up<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.220> point<00:02:52.580> where<00:02:52.820> it<00:02:53.270> can<00:02:53.600> not

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
slow up to a point where it can not

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.360 
slow up to a point where it can not
because<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.440> its<00:02:54.890> mass<00:02:55.510> slow<00:02:56.510> any<00:02:56.930> further

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
because of its mass slow any further

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.020 
because of its mass slow any further
then<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.670> will<00:02:58.940> stop<00:02:59.450> briefly<00:02:59.990> and<00:03:00.580> will<00:03:01.580> start

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
then it will stop briefly and will start

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.980 
then it will stop briefly and will start
to<00:03:02.300> rotate<00:03:02.900> in<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.980> clockwise<00:03:04.430> fashion<00:03:04.990> and
