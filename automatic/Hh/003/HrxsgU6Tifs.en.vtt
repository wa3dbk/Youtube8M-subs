00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
slippery last year and he sort of must

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.580 
slippery last year and he sort of must
judge<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.670> fence<00:01:51.940> slip<00:01:52.390> behind<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:53.080> we<00:01:53.409> just

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590
