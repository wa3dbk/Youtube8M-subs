the 88 acceleration so that's really

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.870 
the 88 acceleration so that's really
good<00:02:16.020> with<00:02:16.200> him<00:02:16.320> because<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.950> guy<00:02:17.160> takes<00:02:17.550> off

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
good when it comes to pace and it's kind

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.060 
good when it comes to pace and it's kind
of<00:02:21.480> hard<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.720> really<00:02:21.960> catch<00:02:22.230> up<00:02:22.440> with<00:02:22.620> them<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
of hard to really catch up with them and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.830 
of hard to really catch up with them and
going<00:02:23.640> along<00:02:23.910> with<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.090> pace<00:02:24.420> he's<00:02:24.600> also

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
going along with that pace he's also

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.380 
going along with that pace he's also
really<00:02:25.320> good<00:02:25.500> dribbler<00:02:25.800> too<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.430> when<00:02:27.240> you're

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
really good dribbler too so when you're

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.970 
really good dribbler too so when you're
running<00:02:27.720> with<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.110> pace<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.590> run<00:02:28.830> into

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
running with that pace and you run into

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.380 
running with that pace and you run into
the<00:02:29.130> opposition<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.090> use<00:02:30.240> this

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
the opposition you can use this

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.720 
the opposition you can use this
dribbling<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.350> weave<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.070> out<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.550> know

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
dribbling to weave in and out you know

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.580 
dribbling to weave in and out you know
no<00:02:33.030> problem<00:02:33.390> whatsoever<00:02:33.570> i<00:02:34.080> think<00:02:34.350> it's<00:02:34.470> like

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
no problem whatsoever i think it's like

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.550 
no problem whatsoever i think it's like
90<00:02:35.100> dribbling<00:02:35.670> 88<00:02:36.210> ball<00:02:36.510> control<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.380> that's

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
90 dribbling 88 ball control so that's

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.500 
90 dribbling 88 ball control so that's
really<00:02:37.800> nice<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.130> solid<00:02:38.640> especially<00:02:39.300> when<00:02:39.450> you

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
really nice a solid especially when you

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.330 
really nice a solid especially when you
have<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.720> faster<00:02:40.140> player<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.920> way<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.160> can

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
have a faster player to that way you can

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.210 
have a faster player to that way you can
go<00:02:41.490> ahead<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.910> get<00:02:42.510> up<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:42.990> between<00:02:43.290> the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
go ahead and get up in between the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.430 
go ahead and get up in between the
defenders<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.090> also<00:02:45.480> some<00:02:45.660> good<00:02:45.810> agility<00:02:46.050> to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
defenders and also some good agility to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.570 
defenders and also some good agility to
which<00:02:46.650> kind<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.920> goes<00:02:47.040> along<00:02:47.220> with<00:02:47.520> that

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
which kind of goes along with that

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.000 
which kind of goes along with that
because<00:02:47.970> if<00:02:48.360> your<00:02:48.630> player<00:02:48.960> turns<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> tank

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
because if your player turns like a tank

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.550 
because if your player turns like a tank
then<00:02:50.400> well<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.390> kind<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.750> sucks<00:02:52.050> because<00:02:52.260> you

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
then well it kind of sucks because you

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.160 
then well it kind of sucks because you
can't<00:02:52.770> really<00:02:53.130> do<00:02:53.400> too<00:02:53.790> much<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.660> he<00:02:54.780> also<00:02:54.990> has

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
can't really do too much and he also has

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.810 
can't really do too much and he also has
four<00:02:55.470> starts<00:02:55.710> kill<00:02:56.010> moves<00:02:56.250> if<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.580> can't

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
four starts kill moves if you can't

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.550 
four starts kill moves if you can't
dribble<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.360> what's<00:02:57.660> up<00:02:57.840> man<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.110> guy<00:02:58.530> is

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
dribble that what's up man this guy is

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.740 
dribble that what's up man this guy is
just<00:02:58.980> really<00:02:59.370> good<00:02:59.580> overall<00:03:00.120> when<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.540> comes

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
just really good overall when it comes

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.630 
just really good overall when it comes
to<00:03:00.900> dribbling<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.560> getting<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.220> out<00:03:02.460> of

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
to dribbling and getting in out of

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.490 
to dribbling and getting in out of
defenders<00:03:03.180> now<00:03:03.660> we<00:03:03.720> also<00:03:03.960> have<00:03:04.170> some<00:03:04.350> good

defenders now we also have some good

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.170 
defenders now we also have some good
