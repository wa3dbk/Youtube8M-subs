00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.420
 the tank that you see now 

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.140
 fantastic it came up from did 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.769
 our Volgograd masters group 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:08.709
 enthusiasts headed if the Diet went gkm 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.879
 and the tank is also in england in russia 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:12.699
 models are not needed even very well 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.839
 made real 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.960
 and everything else is considered pampering 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.550
 and what are you doing factor with your 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.630
 friends in Russia do not need to west 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.269
 delight comes from tanks 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.619
 Volgograd made hundreds order 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.939
 I offer buttons to work exposure 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.609
 homeland guys huddle in two rooms 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.489
 unnecessary to anyone 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.129
 But in the collection of Alexei factor 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.859
 today there are more than 20 types of tanks and 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:35.729
 soviet petrik combination and auxerre 

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:38.870
 Stalin German tigers the same panther 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.250
 cars and these unique ones 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.350
 big models of the world their scale is one to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.360
 six 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.700
 even from tracks made from real metal 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.960
 western colleagues make caterpillars from 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.690
 plastic and rubber would tape 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.540
 in a word it is even models to call it 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.520
 can not if it does not turn almost 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.560
 real tanks just a little bit 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.630
 less than their true big 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.580
 gather we found such a logic 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.880
 world market which 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.800
 has anyone seen their own big this 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.170
 large tank models 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.020
 the theory itself began to do so step by 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.350
 step by step 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.140
 were able to convince these waters 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.240
 tickets for our all western engineers 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.520
 what we do better than these 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.870
 interestingly indicative on 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.500
 walked last year for lunch ring means 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.479
 everyone to be a week and every day 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.840
 two hours 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.210
 held such an indicator 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.320
 offensive model 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.620
 and here it is appropriate to say about 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.280
 revenues the place where we began to mine 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.460
 beta kilometers 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.409
 this is filaret tanks going on their own 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.180
 on the first day we went here we arrived 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.830
 only ours 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.250
 English production and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.580
 Japanese production were 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.300
 Korean American models 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.410
 means or somewhere halfway through 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.480
 and we went every day and every day 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.450
 the public demonstrated this 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.940
 this is a tank battle 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.210
 the edge on the models that is, we show that 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.780
 we do much more corporation 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.930
 why came to us means began 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.010
 ask and so you can do 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.740
 although it is also very cool 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.260
 doubted but 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.610
 today we have shown that we can 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.000
 make her one more time we show the whole world 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.100
 that in Russia they can do everything 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.040
 you only understand us not to disturb them 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.590
 at least not interfere with at least the minimum condition 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.520
 that helped to know the general fashionable all 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.919
 speak won't find the most 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.989
 bouncers out of a rut such are our measures 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.359
 the phrase that 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:18.489
 in our production we 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.719
 use only imported materials 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.849
 that he can't do anything to us 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.659
 good our old is a bucket of bolts 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.760
 send it to the wrong enter and we can't we don't 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:30.769
 can we do anything good pmi do 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.789
 mobil us a bucket of bolts and then 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.319
 for some reason i come to western firms 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.629
 engineering sit avalanche of our people and 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.519
 I do so privately foreigners do not 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.409
 rejoice they give 100 points before the air 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.359
 why are they doing so here 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.609
 but it would be that he is yet we can we 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.589
 do better here 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.019
 the country is just 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.290
 will give it is necessary to rotate the conditions 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.809
 and we will be fine 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:53.529
 and the whole world will say what we do 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:55.159
 better Japanese get 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.609
 m best mens swiss watches 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.050
 turnout that our tanks are 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.090
 and in America in England, even having driven such 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.920
 countries like japan switzerland and 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.050
 Luxembourg and Monaco they were sent by 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.940
 addresses and in the sense of yumashev mother so 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.160
 models yes our tank model would rule 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.360
 to addresses from beverly hills and bought us 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.159
 the king of jordan here acquired 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.569
 thanked the gift of the Minister 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.059
 and famous people 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.339
 big for that now do 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:23.249
 big tank ride back 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.349
 kursk battle and run it in 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.729
 disneyland in america we actually 98th year 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.019
 so the pilot on this gattar unpretentious 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.269
 option three years he worked in the park 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.729
 bitter Moscow and also several place 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.609
 disneyland say interest was selling 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.089
 Roma here and here, too, need to decide 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.939
 a large number of technical problems 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.629
 technical plan and 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.979
 financially of course we have 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.429
 songs are the eternal problem of russian 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:50.639
 and the power is our local right to know not only 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.989
 local why monks that when was with us 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.129
 that from the 33rd battle we did the exposure 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.950
 museum panorama of the battle of stalingrad 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.449
 under the washer Moscow to the government house 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.919
 there looked more too delighted all 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:03.909
 know but 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.979
 this is again a city of sore question what 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.049
 don't need it on the side understand it 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.229
 Here I watched percent until summer 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:12.779
 often abroad that others 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:14.929
 countries like these firms will not be with 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:15.770
 one question 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.870
 everyone would be willing to help may the exhibition 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.830
 somewhere you can have something else 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.470
 bothers you are missing 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.470
 our plants do not need no 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.430
 there is no
