with<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> nexus<00:00:34.110> brand<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:35.100> Google<00:00:35.430> does<00:00:35.610> is

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
with the nexus brand what Google does is

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.690 
with the nexus brand what Google does is
it<00:00:36.329> doesn't<00:00:36.960> manufacture<00:00:37.260> any<00:00:37.890> phones<00:00:38.190> itself

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
it doesn't manufacture any phones itself

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.610 
it doesn't manufacture any phones itself
but<00:00:39.390> what<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.600> does<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:39.960> lets<00:00:40.410> these

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
but what it does is it lets these

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.430 
but what it does is it lets these
companies<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.370> LG<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.270> make<00:00:42.930> these<00:00:43.170> phones

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
companies like LG here make these phones

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.799 
companies like LG here make these phones
or<00:00:43.710> tablets<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:44.700> them<00:00:44.910> under<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> Nexus

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
or tablets for them under the Nexus

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.170 
or tablets for them under the Nexus
brand<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.530> pretty<00:00:47.280> much<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.489> embodies<00:00:48.149> what

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
brand and pretty much it embodies what

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.840 
brand and pretty much it embodies what
Google<00:00:48.809> would<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> phone<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.370> they<00:00:50.789> were

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
Google would do as a phone if they were

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.700 
Google would do as a phone if they were
a<00:00:50.969> hardware<00:00:51.449> manufacturer<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> little

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
a hardware manufacturer so just a little

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.639 
a hardware manufacturer so just a little
insight<00:00:53.190> into<00:00:53.219> what<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> Nexus<00:00:54.149> brand<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.750> so

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this is exactly what Google wants this

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.049 
this is exactly what Google wants this
is<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.260> intended<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.100> phone<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.730> for

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059

see<00:01:54.899> what<00:01:54.990> else<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.259> get<00:01:55.409> inside<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> box<00:01:56.149> so

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
see what else we get inside the box so

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.480 
see what else we get inside the box so
we<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> little<00:01:57.630> tab<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.280> put

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
we have a little tab here we can put

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.639 
we have a little tab here we can put
that<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.149> there's<00:02:00.990> nothing<00:02:01.110> inside<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that up and there's nothing inside of

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.560 
that up and there's nothing inside of
here<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:03.060> let's<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.969> of<00:02:05.969> course<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.420> get

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
here so let's see so of course you get

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.440 
here so let's see so of course you get
some<00:02:06.899> manuals<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.009> some<00:02:08.399> paper<00:02:08.759> documents

some manuals and some paper documents

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.979 
some manuals and some paper documents
and<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:10.289> believe<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> sim<00:02:11.610> ejector<00:02:12.150> so

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
and I believe this is a sim ejector so

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.880 
and I believe this is a sim ejector so
you<00:02:13.050> can<00:02:13.260> take<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
and use it to pop out the sim card from

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.980 
and use it to pop out the sim card from
your<00:02:17.040> current<00:02:17.520> phone<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.060> then<00:02:18.510> put<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.840> in

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
snapdragon 800 processor so it should be

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.500 
snapdragon 800 processor so it should be
really<00:05:32.860> fast<00:05:33.490> and<00:05:33.669> nexus<00:05:33.910> ones<00:05:34.060> are<00:05:34.180> typically

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
really fast and nexus ones are typically

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.540 
really fast and nexus ones are typically
very<00:05:34.540> fast<00:05:35.020> because<00:05:35.380> it<00:05:35.560> has<00:05:35.770> android<00:05:36.220> and

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
very fast because it has android and

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.250 
very fast because it has android and
it's<00:05:36.669> optimized<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.270> run<00:05:37.480> it<00:05:37.600> very<00:05:37.870> smoothly

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
it's optimized to run it very smoothly

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.930 
it's optimized to run it very smoothly

happening has two hundred two thousand
three<00:06:35.650> hundred<00:06:35.770> milliamps<00:06:36.250> of<00:06:36.660> battery<00:06:37.660> which

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
three hundred milliamps of battery which

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.679 
three hundred milliamps of battery which
isn't<00:06:38.650> the<00:06:38.740> greatest<00:06:38.919> and<00:06:39.460> I've<00:06:40.000> heard<00:06:40.210> that

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:40.689 
isn't the greatest and I've heard that

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:43.559

nexus5 does suffer from battery issues

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.659 
nexus5 does suffer from battery issues
so<00:06:43.839> it's<00:06:44.019> not<00:06:44.259> the<00:06:44.409> greatest<00:06:44.559> battery<00:06:45.129> but<00:06:45.580> I'm

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
so it's not the greatest battery but I'm

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:47.039 
so it's not the greatest battery but I'm
going<00:06:45.759> to<00:06:45.849> test<00:06:46.059> that<00:06:46.149> out<00:06:46.239> myself<00:06:46.449> and<00:06:46.869> see

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:47.049 
going to test that out myself and see

00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:49.409 
going to test that out myself and see
how<00:06:47.289> it<00:06:47.409> is<00:06:47.499> do<00:06:47.860> normal<00:06:48.219> stage<00:06:48.519> a<00:06:48.789> normal<00:06:49.239> state
