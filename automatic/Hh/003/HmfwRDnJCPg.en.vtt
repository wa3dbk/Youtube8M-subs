00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello how about people I am rafa and in this 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.330
 video I will show you dry that sure 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.130
 that we would all like to have in our 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.130
 houses so it's going to move it 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.770
 in position number 6 we are 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.930
 with the corsa and 383 series stand out 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.820
 she for her square cube shape her 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.289
 size as you can see we can take it 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.419
 in the hand it is also possible to say that 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.750
 we would have to mount it with mini plates 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:31.270
 tx this plate of 17 x 17 meters are 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.850
 really small and we will find it 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.760
 about a price with 250 euros in the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.040
 placed number 5 we have the manufacturer in 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.170
 wilton manufacturer that you use to box 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.300
 quite rare and in this case the box 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.680
 It has quite a pretty aesthetic 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.630
 curious and different from what we 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.090
 we normally find in the boxes 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.670
 It has a tempered glass that 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.500
 better endure the blows as this is 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.150
 one of the main functions of the 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.250
 computer case protect the 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.770
 such components we will find it by 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.989
 an approximate price of about 300 years in 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.659
 the number 4 place we did not find a 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.500
 pretty weird box and we started to see 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.649
 the rare faces 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.630
 it's about the alienware area 51 as 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.700
 out there is this a box concept that 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.370
 begins to graze the weird since it is a 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.870
 box with a triangle shape account 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.540
 with enough fans 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.240
 I'm going to put two and three graphic cards 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.340
 a rather weird box its price starts 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.680
 from two thousand seven hundred euros and it arrives 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.180
 up to three thousand 700 euros being 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.460
 more powerful the one that has a 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.510
 i7 processor of 16 gigs of ram 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.300
 it brings graph gtx 970 among other things 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.970
 we went to position number 3 and we 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.280
 we find with the inwin s frame gold 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.700
 this box particularly to me 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.440
 love in a box that aesthetically 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.450
 for its construction materials all 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.100
 it's pink basically perfection has 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.680
 an incredible design with some edges 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.000
 gold its chassis is metallic in 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.950
 definitive a box that with the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.510
 components assembled inside and so on 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.220
 it would be amazing the only 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.500
 inconvenience that has to its price that 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.110
 It costs around 850 euros 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.000
 just tell you that for me there is one 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.530
 of my favorite boxes we follow 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.780
 climbing and we go up to the second 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.850
 since we started with the bed 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.310
 extravagant from the market one of the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.950
 streets right now it's from the deep mark 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.810
 cool and the model is to install as 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.060
 here you can see us divide the body into 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.230
 three parts how did this plate 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.200
 base has a supply 2 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.239
 where does it go to the other side where can 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.830
 put the graphics card somewhere else 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.480
 has the power supply already 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.280
 through there connects all the cables 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.019
 one of the rarest ways there is in 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.970
 the market and the truth that by its design 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.159
 and to me it seems pretty cool 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.049
 is second in this list and 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.390
 now let's move on to see the box that 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.030
 occupies the position number 1 plan presented 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.890
 recently and it's the weirdest thing you can 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.829
 find in the gambling market in this 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.900
 Inwin brand box, you know already 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.450
 we have said before makes very weird designs 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.799
 in this case the hache dower is a box 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.019
 that we could say that it looks like a 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.420
 true transforms I do not imagine that 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.730
 will be pressing a button opens and not 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.769
 teaches the components the plate 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.750
 base and the rest here you can see it in 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.700
 video because explain what really 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.670
 difficult the finishes that it has are 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.489
 incredible but it costs nothing more and nothing 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.870
 less attention that is 1500 euros something 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.060
 which of course is not within reach of 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.670
 all and it will be for real fan and 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.530
 exhibitions so nothing this is the 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.810
 list that elaborated of the boxes that to 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.549
 I have found them more extravagant than 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.200
 There is right now in the market if 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.270
 you know some too 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.590
 rare or some weird things from boxes that 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.870
 you have seen, I would like for you to give it to me 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.970
 in the comments because you already know people 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.040
 So far this video we see ourselves inside 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.510
 of little in the next video a greeting 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.510
 everyone and more
