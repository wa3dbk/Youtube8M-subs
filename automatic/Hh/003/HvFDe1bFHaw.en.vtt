00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.940 

for<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.300> single<00:02:12.510> logs<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.140> found<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.620> best<00:02:13.830> to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
for the single logs I found it best to

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
for the single logs I found it best to
route<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> data<00:02:14.489> first<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.060> then<00:02:15.330> cut<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
route the data first and then cut the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.010 
route the data first and then cut the
link<00:02:19.640> I'll<00:02:20.640> then<00:02:20.849> resaw<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.330> remaining<00:02:21.870> two

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
link I'll then resaw the remaining two

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.839 
link I'll then resaw the remaining two
by<00:02:22.170> six<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.590> half<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.099> be<00:02:23.220> used<00:02:23.400> for<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.670> roof

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
by six in half to be used for the roof

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:35.509 
by six in half to be used for the roof
slats<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.510> E's<00:02:33.620> here<00:02:34.620> I'm<00:02:34.920> cutting<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.340> eaves

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
slats and E's here I'm cutting the eaves

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:47.090 
slats and E's here I'm cutting the eaves
on<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.850> bandsaw<00:02:45.230> for<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.319> roof<00:02:46.500> eaves<00:02:46.799> I

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
on the bandsaw for the roof eaves I

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.680 
on the bandsaw for the roof eaves I
found<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.519> cutting<00:02:47.819> out<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.030> data<00:02:48.209> easier

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
found that cutting out the data easier

00:02:48.690 --> 00:03:08.250 
found that cutting out the data easier
on<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.959> bandsaw

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.890 

and<00:03:08.909> then<00:03:09.909> the<00:03:10.030> bandsaw<00:03:10.390> makes<00:03:10.599> quick<00:03:10.870> work

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
and then the bandsaw makes quick work

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:24.149 
and then the bandsaw makes quick work
for<00:03:11.260> cutting<00:03:11.530> out<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.709> chimney<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.980> round

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
for cutting out the chimney to round
