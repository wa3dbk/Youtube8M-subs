hey Ron my name is Marcus and I'm one of

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.090 
hey Ron my name is Marcus and I'm one of
the<00:00:05.750> developers<00:00:06.109> behind<00:00:06.290> magnetic<00:00:06.919> age

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
the developers behind magnetic age

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.680 
the developers behind magnetic age
closed<00:00:07.399> and<00:00:07.729> today<00:00:08.090> I'm<00:00:08.270> thinking<00:00:08.600> about

closed and today I'm thinking about
showing<00:00:09.049> you<00:00:09.230> a<00:00:09.260> bit<00:00:09.500> about<00:00:09.680> our<00:00:09.740> gameplay<00:00:10.280> and

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549 
showing you a bit about our gameplay and

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.520 
showing you a bit about our gameplay and
the<00:00:11.000> mechanics<00:00:11.450> that<00:00:11.570> it<00:00:11.630> can<00:00:11.750> play<00:00:11.990> expect

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
the mechanics that it can play expect

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.839 
the mechanics that it can play expect
from<00:00:12.889> our<00:00:13.299> game<00:00:14.299> so<00:00:15.230> jumping<00:00:16.009> straight<00:00:16.520> into

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
from our game so jumping straight into

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.269 
from our game so jumping straight into
it<00:00:19.000> here's<00:00:20.000> one<00:00:20.180> of<00:00:20.270> the<00:00:20.360> tutorial<00:00:20.810> levels

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
it here's one of the tutorial levels

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.799 
it here's one of the tutorial levels
what's<00:00:22.279> the<00:00:22.430> first<00:00:22.669> tutorial<00:00:23.360> level<00:00:23.570> actually

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:23.809 
what's the first tutorial level actually

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:26.490 
what's the first tutorial level actually
and<00:00:24.619> which<00:00:25.099> is<00:00:25.220> kind<00:00:25.369> of<00:00:25.399> like<00:00:25.550> a<00:00:25.579> playground

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
and which is kind of like a playground

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.409 
and which is kind of like a playground
playground<00:00:27.500> room<00:00:27.739> and<00:00:27.950> where<00:00:28.820> you<00:00:29.000> will<00:00:29.180> get

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
playground room and where you will get

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.089 
playground room and where you will get
to<00:00:29.630> play<00:00:29.750> around<00:00:30.050> a<00:00:30.200> bit<00:00:30.230> with<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.649> magnet<00:00:30.950> gun

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
to play around a bit with the magnet gun

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.010 
to play around a bit with the magnet gun
before<00:00:31.250> moving<00:00:31.849> along<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.450> you<00:00:32.509> can<00:00:32.750> see<00:00:32.870> here

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
before moving along so you can see here

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.700 
before moving along so you can see here
that<00:00:33.140> again

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
that again

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.590 
that again
pull<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:34.250> push<00:00:34.730> in<00:00:34.879> objects<00:00:35.239> that's<00:00:35.420> like<00:00:35.570> a

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
pull and push in objects that's like a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.220 
pull and push in objects that's like a
core<00:00:36.140> thing<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:36.710> can<00:00:36.859> do<00:00:37.719> and<00:00:38.719> you<00:00:38.870> can<00:00:39.019> also

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
core thing you can do and you can also

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.689 
core thing you can do and you can also
push<00:00:39.739> buttons<00:00:41.260> or<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.800> know<00:00:42.890> various<00:00:43.309> effects

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
push buttons or you know various effects

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.759 
push buttons or you know various effects
and<00:00:43.969> stuff<00:00:44.239> they<00:00:44.510> work<00:00:44.690> in<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:44.960> bit<00:00:45.289> different

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
and stuff they work in a bit different

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.590 
and stuff they work in a bit different
ways<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.309> blue<00:00:46.519> button<00:00:46.850> will<00:00:47.179> play<00:00:47.480> an

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
ways the blue button will play an

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.970 
ways the blue button will play an
animation<00:00:47.929> that<00:00:48.109> stops<00:00:48.469> once<00:00:48.679> you<00:00:48.739> get<00:00:48.859> off<00:00:48.949> of

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
animation that stops once you get off of

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.529 
animation that stops once you get off of
it<00:00:49.219> and<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.460> red<00:00:49.640> one<00:00:49.820> will<00:00:50.059> move<00:00:50.210> something

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
it and the red one will move something

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.599 
it and the red one will move something
from<00:00:50.929> position<00:00:51.589> a<00:00:51.710> to<00:00:51.739> position<00:00:51.890> B<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.489> then

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
from position a to position B and then

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.910 
from position a to position B and then
move<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:52.850> back<00:00:52.879> again<00:00:53.300> if<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:54.199> get<00:00:54.469> off<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.649> it

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
move it back again if you get off of it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.119 
move it back again if you get off of it
and<00:00:55.390> then<00:00:56.390> we<00:00:56.569> have<00:00:56.780> these<00:00:56.989> magnetic<00:00:57.769> plates

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
and then we have these magnetic plates

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.309 
and then we have these magnetic plates
that<00:00:58.550> are<00:00:58.609> stuck<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.449> the<00:00:59.480> walls<00:00:59.749> and<00:01:00.199> the

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
that are stuck to the walls and the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.500 
that are stuck to the walls and the
floor<00:01:00.499> and<00:01:00.920> ceilings<00:01:01.429> and<00:01:01.640> stuff<00:01:01.789> within<00:01:02.359> the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
floor and ceilings and stuff within the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.329 
floor and ceilings and stuff within the
game<00:01:02.690> which<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:03.469> can<00:01:03.589> actually<00:01:03.739> use<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:04.040> pull

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
game which you can actually use to pull

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.390 
game which you can actually use to pull
and<00:01:04.519> push<00:01:04.699> yourself<00:01:05.089> away<00:01:05.239> from<00:01:06.100> get<00:01:07.100> back<00:01:07.280> to

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
and push yourself away from get back to

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.990 
and push yourself away from get back to
that<00:01:07.520> later

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
that later

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.500 
that later
and<00:01:08.240> then<00:01:08.750> we<00:01:09.020> just<00:01:09.380> have<00:01:10.210> dispenser<00:01:11.210> here

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
and then we just have dispenser here

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.380 
and then we just have dispenser here
which<00:01:11.780> will<00:01:12.080> give<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.860> box<00:01:13.190> or<00:01:13.550> two<00:01:13.580> if

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
which will give you a box or two if

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.930 
which will give you a box or two if
you're<00:01:14.570> lucky<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:16.310> then<00:01:16.460> we<00:01:16.580> have<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.790> big

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
you're lucky and then we have the big

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.560 
you're lucky and then we have the big
box<00:01:17.150> here<00:01:17.390> now<00:01:17.720> as<00:01:17.900> you<00:01:18.080> can<00:01:18.230> probably<00:01:18.500> see

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
box here now as you can probably see

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.270 
box here now as you can probably see
make<00:01:20.570> it<00:01:20.660> a<00:01:20.720> bit<00:01:20.840> clearer<00:01:21.050> later<00:01:21.290> but<00:01:21.740> I<00:01:21.950> was

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
make it a bit clearer later but I was

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.610 
make it a bit clearer later but I was
actually<00:01:22.610> being<00:01:23.240> pulled<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:23.870> pushed<00:01:24.350> away

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
actually being pulled and pushed away

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.400 
actually being pulled and pushed away
from<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:25.370> object<00:01:26.030> when<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.450> was<00:01:26.840> pulling<00:01:27.080> or

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
from the object when I was pulling or

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.700 
from the object when I was pulling or
pushing<00:01:27.620> on<00:01:27.980> it<00:01:28.160> so<00:01:29.120> heavy<00:01:29.870> physics<00:01:30.290> objects

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
pushing on it so heavy physics objects

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.550 
pushing on it so heavy physics objects
will<00:01:31.100> affect<00:01:31.730> you<00:01:31.910> as<00:01:32.120> well<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.690> send<00:01:33.320> you

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
will affect you as well and send you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.350 
will affect you as well and send you
flying<00:01:34.010> so<00:01:34.400> if<00:01:34.490> you're<00:01:34.640> not<00:01:34.730> careful<00:01:34.940> you'll

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
flying so if you're not careful you'll

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.390 
flying so if you're not careful you'll
be<00:01:35.510> able<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.750> pull<00:01:36.320> yourself<00:01:36.770> off<00:01:37.040> a<00:01:37.070> ledge

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
be able to pull yourself off a ledge

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.480 
be able to pull yourself off a ledge
where<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:38.270> don't<00:01:38.450> intend<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.280> got<00:01:40.400> to

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
where you don't intend to so you got to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.560 
where you don't intend to so you got to
think<00:01:40.610> about<00:01:40.730> that<00:01:40.910> when<00:01:41.360> you're<00:01:41.450> actually

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
think about that when you're actually

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.640 
think about that when you're actually
playing<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.170> game<00:01:43.780> now<00:01:44.780> I'm<00:01:45.200> thinking<00:01:45.590> about

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
playing the game now I'm thinking about

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.040 
playing the game now I'm thinking about
just<00:01:46.580> jumping<00:01:47.210> straight<00:01:47.420> into<00:01:47.720> one<00:01:47.870> of<00:01:47.960> the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
just jumping straight into one of the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.680 
just jumping straight into one of the
harder<00:01:48.350> levels<00:01:48.710> we've<00:01:48.920> got<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.490> just<00:01:50.210> showing

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
harder levels we've got and just showing

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.130 
harder levels we've got and just showing
you<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.810> bit<00:01:51.080> about<00:01:51.310> how<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.840> actual<00:01:53.840> game

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
you a bit about how the actual game

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.110

strike back there stuck to the wall
don't<00:04:07.000> be<00:04:07.120> kind<00:04:07.330> of<00:04:07.390> in<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.540> way<00:04:07.690> right<00:04:08.050> now<00:04:08.200> I

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
don't be kind of in the way right now I

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.440 
don't be kind of in the way right now I
can<00:04:08.440> actually<00:04:08.560> use<00:04:08.830> them<00:04:09.069> to<00:04:09.430> move<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.150> boxes

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
can actually use them to move the boxes

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.640 
can actually use them to move the boxes
around<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.840> little<00:04:10.930> bit<00:04:11.140> easier<00:04:12.989> but<00:04:13.989> they<00:04:14.470> can

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
around a little bit easier but they can

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.039 
around a little bit easier but they can
be<00:04:14.799> horrible<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.790> deal<00:04:16.060> with<00:04:16.239> sometimes<00:04:16.450> right

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
be horrible to deal with sometimes right

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.710 
be horrible to deal with sometimes right
so<00:04:17.440> now<00:04:17.829> I<00:04:17.859> got<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.190> get<00:04:18.250> through<00:04:18.459> here<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:18.910> not

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
so now I got to get through here and not

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:36.390 
so now I got to get through here and not
get<00:04:19.959> fried<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:30.120> right<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:31.690> then<00:04:35.130> that<00:04:36.130> means

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
get fried just right and then that means

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.890 
get fried just right and then that means
the<00:04:36.460> fire<00:04:36.639> goes<00:04:36.880> out<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.360> can<00:04:37.660> get<00:04:37.840> back<00:04:42.900> because

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
the fire goes out I can get back because

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.620 
the fire goes out I can get back because
as<00:04:44.470> lights<00:04:45.010> indicate<00:04:45.520> both<00:04:46.210> of<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.419> gates

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
as lights indicate both of the gates

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.060 
as lights indicate both of the gates
down<00:04:46.840> here<00:04:47.760> I<00:04:49.140> am<00:04:50.140> pretty<00:04:50.500> much<00:04:50.710> completed

so let's get straight into with this one

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:24.670 
so let's get straight into with this one
bit<00:05:10.000> faster<00:05:10.450> over<00:05:11.440> here

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.890

I<00:05:31.690> cannae<00:05:32.140> difference<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.470> time

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.770 

like<00:05:36.200> this<00:05:36.320> big<00:05:36.880> box<00:05:37.880> straight<00:05:38.240> up<00:05:38.390> send<00:05:38.720> it

and I'll just abused these for bed gone
through<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.360> fire<00:05:59.600> singing<00:06:01.030> was<00:06:02.030> a<00:06:02.060> bit

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
through the fire singing was a bit

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.120 
through the fire singing was a bit
faster

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
faster

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.080

level we just played and this is what we

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
presented with a choice as its name
