actually<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.600> fermented<00:00:07.440> soy<00:00:07.710> products<00:00:08.340> are

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
actually the fermented soy products are

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.450 
actually the fermented soy products are
healthier<00:00:09.690> than<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.200> ordinary<00:00:10.559> soy<00:00:10.950> product

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
healthier than the ordinary soy product

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.829 
healthier than the ordinary soy product
because<00:00:12.290> fermented<00:00:13.290> soy<00:00:13.590> products<00:00:14.460> are

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
because fermented soy products are

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.310 
because fermented soy products are
easier<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.049> digest<00:00:16.369> high<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.820> enzyme<00:00:18.630> which

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
easier to digest high in enzyme which

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.370 
easier to digest high in enzyme which
helps<00:00:20.279> our<00:00:20.430> body<00:00:20.970> function<00:00:21.570> very<00:00:21.810> well<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
helps our body function very well and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.160 
helps our body function very well and
also<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> natural<00:00:23.850> probiotic<00:00:24.630> which

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
also that a natural probiotic which

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.960 
also that a natural probiotic which
means<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> good<00:00:26.699> bowel

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
means that that we can have a good bowel

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.029 
means that that we can have a good bowel
movement

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039

you can get so I will explain about each
product<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.809> by<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.170> now<00:00:41.989> miso<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
product one by one now miso is a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.440 
product one by one now miso is a
fermented<00:00:45.090> soybean<00:00:45.750> paste<00:00:46.579> there<00:00:47.579> are<00:00:47.850> so

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
fermented soybean paste there are so

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.369 
fermented soybean paste there are so
many<00:00:48.719> types<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.860> miso<00:00:50.370> available<00:00:51.379> basically

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
many types of miso available basically

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.110 
many types of miso available basically
the<00:00:52.980> cultured<00:00:53.760> grain<00:00:54.180> called<00:00:54.960> Koji<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:56.550> used

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the cultured grain called Koji it used

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.540 
the cultured grain called Koji it used
to<00:00:57.539> make<00:00:58.070> me<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.670> fermented<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.949> three

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
to make me so to be fermented so three

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.550 
to make me so to be fermented so three
types<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.359> culture<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.260> grain<00:01:04.559> are<00:01:05.189> used<00:01:06.560> soy

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
types of culture the grain are used soy

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.219 
types of culture the grain are used soy
bean<00:01:07.890> counter<00:01:08.340> grain<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.970> also<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
bean counter grain and also that the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.210 
bean counter grain and also that the
barley<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.420> rice<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.140> that's<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.590> grain<00:01:13.950> that

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
barley and rice so that's the grain that

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.960 
barley and rice so that's the grain that
we<00:01:14.460> use<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.390> Koji<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.310> solving<00:01:17.790> is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
we use for the Koji so if the solving is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.039 
we use for the Koji so if the solving is
used<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.750> call<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.229> soybean<00:01:20.189> missile<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
used we call the soybean missile if the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.050 
used we call the soybean missile if the
valley<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.740> used<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.610> called<00:01:23.909> Valley<00:01:24.600> missile

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
valley is used we called Valley missile

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.450 
valley is used we called Valley missile
the<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.270> rice<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.869> used<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.590> rice<00:01:28.860> missiles

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the the rice is used to rice missiles

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.090 
the the rice is used to rice missiles
and<00:01:29.880> also<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.630> those<00:01:30.810> some<00:01:31.229> time<00:01:31.439> week<00:01:31.680> have

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
and also that those some time week have

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.440 
and also that those some time week have
to<00:01:32.280> grind<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> color<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.299> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
to grind to to see the color so this is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.140 
to grind to to see the color so this is
a<00:01:36.479> kind<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.930> typical<00:01:37.170> thing<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.939> is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
a kind of a typical thing here this is

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.179 
a kind of a typical thing here this is
why<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> me<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.740> not<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> white

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
but we called white or Shiro miso this

me so this is red miso nice and firm and
very<00:01:57.210> very<00:01:58.110> salty<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> strongest<00:02:00.270> at

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420

very very salty this is a strongest at
flavor<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.469> me<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.579> our<00:02:02.969> semi<00:02:03.780> so

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
flavor of the me so we have our semi so

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.830 
flavor of the me so we have our semi so
which<00:02:04.619> basically

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
which basically

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.240 
which basically
mix<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.820> white<00:02:08.060> miso<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.500> red<00:02:09.890> miso

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
mix the white miso and the red miso

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.610 
mix the white miso and the red miso
together<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.970> become<00:02:11.420> our<00:02:11.750> Sammy<00:02:12.110> sauce<00:02:12.349> so

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
together and become our Sammy sauce so

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.190 
together and become our Sammy sauce so
you<00:02:12.680> can<00:02:13.400> see<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.690> white<00:02:14.930> miso

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
you can see that this is a white miso

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.400 
you can see that this is a white miso
this<00:02:15.500> dismisses<00:02:16.190> this<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:18.050> that<00:02:18.080> the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
this dismisses this and this is that the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.300 
this dismisses this and this is that the
red<00:02:18.650> miso<00:02:19.069> this<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.670> our<00:02:20.239> semi<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.130> this<00:02:22.130> is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
red miso this is our semi so this is

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.140 
red miso this is our semi so this is
mild

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
mild

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.540 
mild
this<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.780> medium<00:02:24.140> flavor<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.370> is

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
this is the medium flavor and this is

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.570 
this is the medium flavor and this is
the<00:02:25.640> sharp<00:02:26.030> strong<00:02:26.599> flavor<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:28.130> one<00:02:28.340> thing

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
the sharp strong flavor the one thing

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.000 
the sharp strong flavor the one thing
that<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.790> would<00:02:29.000> like<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.450> mention<00:02:29.810> is<00:02:30.620> that

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
that I would like to mention is that

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.979 
that I would like to mention is that
many<00:02:31.459> people<00:02:31.849> have<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.480> gluten<00:02:33.050> intolerance

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
many people have a gluten intolerance

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.840 
many people have a gluten intolerance
not<00:02:35.989> on<00:02:36.290> missile<00:02:36.830> are<00:02:37.069> gluten<00:02:37.580> free

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
not on missile are gluten free

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.539 
not on missile are gluten free
obviously<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.780> berry<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.680> used<00:02:40.160> for<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
obviously the berry is used for the

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.729 
obviously the berry is used for the
berry<00:02:40.760> me<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:41.510> this<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:41.780> not<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.230> gluten<00:02:42.709> free

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
berry me so so this is not a gluten free

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.570 
berry me so so this is not a gluten free
so<00:02:43.670> if<00:02:44.000> your<00:02:44.269> family<00:02:44.870> or<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.530> are<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.890> gluten

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
so if your family or you are a gluten

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.870 
so if your family or you are a gluten
intolerant<00:02:47.269> I<00:02:48.010> recommend<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.370> use<00:02:49.400> either

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
rice miso or being missile region to

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.789 
rice miso or being missile region to
region<00:02:52.549> we<00:02:53.180> use<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.599> different<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.140> me<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.560> so

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
region we use it a different to me so so

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.400

benefit of a missile I highly recommend

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.949 
benefit of a missile I highly recommend
to<00:04:14.870> purchase<00:04:16.150> unpasteurized<00:04:17.150> miso<00:04:17.630> which<00:04:17.930> is

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
to purchase unpasteurized miso which is

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.160 
to purchase unpasteurized miso which is
which<00:04:18.860> means<00:04:19.100> are<00:04:19.310> not<00:04:19.459> heated<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.360> enzyme

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
which means are not heated and enzyme

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.210 
which means are not heated and enzyme
it's<00:04:21.350> still<00:04:21.650> alive

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
it's still alive

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.370 
it's still alive
that's<00:04:22.640> why<00:04:22.760> when<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.120> make<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.330> miso<00:04:23.720> soup<00:04:24.080> we

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
that's why when you make a miso soup we

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.630 
that's why when you make a miso soup we
always<00:04:24.920> say<00:04:25.130> never<00:04:25.670> boil<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.510> miso<00:04:26.720> soup<00:04:27.140> with

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
always say never boil the miso soup with

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.820 
always say never boil the miso soup with
because<00:04:28.640> we<00:04:28.850> want<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.150> keep<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.870> goodness<00:04:30.590> of
