00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:12.360
Those who decide to follow Jesus Christ, will
face many trials, temptations and tribulations

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.860
but they will have to overcome, because only
those who overcome, will enter the Kingdom

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.560
of Heaven.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.970
As Jesus said: That those who endure until
the END, they shall be saved.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.520
Dear friends, the only way that we can overcome
is if we stay focused on Jesus.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.899
On our own we cannot make it, but He is with
us every step of the way.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:57.991
The devil will do his level best to get us,
to doubt in Jesus, to destroy our faith but

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:01.940
we must stand the tests and endure until the
end.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:10.540
The devil is a liar, a cheat and a murderer
and he wants to kill us and if we allow him,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.389
he will succeed in doing so.

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:18.759
I want to share with you some experience in
my life.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:28.579
I had a heart attack on July 28, 1998 and
I died but by His mercy and grace our Lord

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.950
Jesus allowed me to come back.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:43.090
Dear friends, after that, the trial did not
stop, because even though I was dismissed

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:52.810
from hospital and I had no pain, I had no
medication, the pain kept on coming back,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.549
the pain in my chest.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.119
I would wake up at night in a cold sweat and
wonder whether I would see the sun rise the

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.479
next morning.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:12.560
I would be praying all night, pleading with
God to keep me alive, rebuking the devil.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.330
I did not tell anybody about it, but I was
in a struggle for life and death.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:33.610
Dear friends, after a year the pain disappeared
but in that year I had to learn to truly trust

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.610
in Jesus.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.940
I had to overcome the devil, I had to resist
him.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.230
It was only when I decided not to fear the
devil anymore.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.270
When I said satan you cannot kill me, whatever
you want to do, you cannot touch me, I will

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.140
be around as long as Jesus wants me to be
here.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.850
You can do nothing to me, I donâ€™t fear you.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:10.790
I ignored him and I would be praising Jesus
and then the pain disappeared, the fear disappeared.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.820
It is because in that time I had learned to
put my focus on Jesus.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:27.760
The devil will send you symptoms of a pain,
he might send you some infirmity, a sickness

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.620
and you run to the doctor, the doctor cuts
you, he is just trying to help.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.090
But dear friend, the devil is trying to kill
you and he will succeed if you allow him.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.810
But if you focus on Jesus, then He will teach
you wisdom.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.980
Jesus said: Seek ye first the Kingdom of God
and His righteousness and all the other things

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.459
will be added unto you.

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:03.020
The devil wants you to fear, he wants you
to doubt God and then he had succeeded because

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.959
once doubt comes in, then the devil has planted
his seed in you and that seed will grow until

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.130
he kills you.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.629
Youâ€™ve got to kill that seed, you got to
reject satan, resist him in the Name of Jesus

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:26.830
and get your focus on Christ and on His Kingdom,
not on yourself, not on self preservation.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.639
Get your focus on Jesus and on seeking His
Kingdom.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.440
What can I do for the Kingdom of God?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.060
What value am I to the Kingdom of God?

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.560
Dear friend, if I am useless for the Kingdom
of God, there is no reason for me to stick

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.560
around.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.349
Why should God keep me here?

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:54.990
And that is where the Lord showed me that
the tree that does not bear fruit will be

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.460
cut off.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.729
The branch what does not bear fruit, will
be cut off.

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.229
The branch that does bear fruit, will be pruned,
yes.

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:11.130
But if we do not bear fruit, if we are just
focused on ourselves, there is no reason why

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.819
we should be here.

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:19.280
Dear friend, we must overcome, if we want
to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:27.520
The only way that we can overcome is when
we put our focus on Jesus all the way because

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.629
then we understand that He determines my life
and the devil cannot touch me and I will be

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.629
around as long as Jesus decides for me to
be around.

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:47.990
But I want to make use of everyday that He
gives me to build onto His Kingdom, to be

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.380
useful for His Kingdom.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.499
No man can touch me, if God does not allow
him.

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:04.219
I am here for His glory, I am here to please
Him and by His grace I will overcome, I will

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:08.050
overcome the flesh, fear, the devil.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:15.949
I will overcome everything in the Name of
Jesus as long as I stay focused on Jesus and

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.699
His Kingdom, on doing His will.

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:26.930
And when my time comes, He will fetch me,
an overcomer, not because I am good but because

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.680
my focus is on Jesus.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.720
Are you an overcomer?

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:39.410
Are you focused on Jesus or do you allow the
devil to come and plant seeds of doubt which

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.780
will eventually kill you?

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.080
The decision is yours my friend.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.949
Are you going to trust Jesus or will you allow
the devil to destroy you?

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:52.880
May Jesus bless you.
