00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.649
 new video here already we are 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.950
 now here at the one hand so at 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.190
 use because I have some principles to 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.570
 not to say exactly eleven pieces and the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.070
 i have gotten the maybe know 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.100
 Maybe some of you should already 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.519
 not here because it is a kind of slippery 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.330
 the only on the mobile versions of 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:29.849
 fifa 15 works on so ios 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.949
 android and how do i get you 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.430
 now the free pécs is easy 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.649
 It works with every tournament where it 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.969
 there is a pack to win 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.270
 here with me the us open cup 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.899
 I say now runs on amateur 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.600
 So I started with me 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.579
 i already made eleven times i still have 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.620
 six days three hours time so if 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.480
 the video up here is probably the cup 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.340
 also still have 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.290
 There is no reward for 3500 coins 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.909
 more in the beginning you get one this 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.060
 pack that then get the normal 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.070
 but you get the pack if you can 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.700
 Do what I show right now 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.500
 will 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.460
 everytime he does this tournament 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.420
 I'll show you this here now 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.070
 I've been to the final before 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.560
 it should be simulated amateurs should be there 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.340
 everyone with a normal team with the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.840
 rating from 83 to 85 or simply 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.790
 Win even when you team up 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.729
 again with and so on and so on 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.710
 sometimes barcelona something cooperates 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.450
 you should just make it yours 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.240
 just in front of the team 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.229
 simulate this game simulates me 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.479
 then contact me again if I am 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.040
 Simulation finished because I do that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.470
 Do not do it now, I guess 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.630
 So to equal as people have come to the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.399
 the end of the simulation arrived you see 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.009
 here already I won 4 1 against 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.729
 atletico madrid already 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.320
 here stands 3500 Munich as 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.509
 tournament reward what do we do now 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.340
 to get a pack 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.149
 you have seen yours I had eleven 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.049
 pécs here you can see it on the top right 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.370
 Another eleven becks here at the shop 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.709
 and yes, what we do now 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.470
 close now the 15 yes I live here 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:24.959
 just on my mobile phone on 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.940
 sometimes I take it with me, by the way 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.819
 because some people sometimes ask with 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.549
 this trick or here on cds 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.459
 record a video 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:39.360
 it's the sonics baz 3's with it 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.129
 antic intrigiert that I have loris yes 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.950
 every now and then when commenting 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:50.190
 because audio has given problems 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.989
 and then just new and now announce 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.230
 then luckily same again 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:00.150
 the live commentary because I noticed that 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:02.310
 so have it right up there and also briefly 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.500
 tap right away 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.209
 you see her already twelve packs up 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.470
 right so I'm not logical 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.359
 works so you can infinitely 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.859
 many packs get hold of this 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:18.060
 tournament is over and it works too 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.410
 at all other tournaments that was yes 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.989
 it even with the new video turn away 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.299
 the load has fallen is a 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.700
 positive rating so a total of one 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.180
 positive movement an abo could me 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.750
 also let there and years until 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.750
 next time
