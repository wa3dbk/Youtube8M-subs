00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
aside lifted the lid off mine yet but

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
aside lifted the lid off mine yet but
that's<00:01:44.490> where<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.820> filter<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.240> right<00:01:45.659> where

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
that's where that filter is right where

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.990 
that's where that filter is right where
the<00:01:45.930> gas<00:01:46.110> goes<00:01:46.350> into<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.800> this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.550> good<00:01:47.729> shot

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the gas goes into it this is a good shot

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.570 
the gas goes into it this is a good shot
of<00:01:48.030> min<00:01:48.409> me<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.530> Jos<00:01:49.710> sitting<00:01:50.070> around<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.369> man

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
of min me and Jos sitting around the man

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.420 
of min me and Jos sitting around the man
table<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:53.460> man<00:01:53.610> table<00:01:54.000> with<00:01:54.119> carburetors<00:01:54.690> I

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
table the man table with carburetors I

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.530 
table the man table with carburetors I
figured<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.759> another<00:01:56.850> update<00:01:57.360> before

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
figured I just do another update before

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.380 
figured I just do another update before
we<00:01:57.750> start<00:01:57.990> putting<00:01:58.140> these<00:01:58.350> back<00:01:58.409> together

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
we start putting these back together

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.670 
we start putting these back together
generally<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> carburetor<00:02:01.259> don't<00:02:01.500> work

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
generally if the carburetor don't work

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.050 
generally if the carburetor don't work
is<00:02:01.860> because<00:02:02.040> something<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.550> dirty<00:02:02.759> or<00:02:02.880> is

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
is because something is dirty or is

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.670 
is because something is dirty or is
leaking<00:02:03.390> air<00:02:03.860> guess<00:02:06.110> filter<00:02:07.110> stopped<00:02:07.409> out

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
leaking air guess filter stopped out

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.070 
leaking air guess filter stopped out
something<00:02:08.039> like<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.940> basically<00:02:09.840> we've

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
something like that so basically we've

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.630 
something like that so basically we've
cleaned<00:02:10.410> them<00:02:10.590> all<00:02:10.649> off<00:02:10.979> clean<00:02:11.370> them<00:02:11.489> all<00:02:11.610> up

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
cleaned them all off clean them all up

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.040 
cleaned them all off clean them all up
and<00:02:11.940> put<00:02:12.209> them<00:02:12.239> back<00:02:12.450> together<00:02:12.600> now

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.860 

that's<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.620> way<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:15.770> works<00:02:16.510> he's<00:02:17.510> becoming

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
that's the way it works he's becoming

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.040 
that's the way it works he's becoming
the<00:02:17.990> carburetor<00:02:18.410> man<00:02:18.650> very<00:02:18.920> quickly<00:02:20.050> hey

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
the carburetor man very quickly hey

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.300 
the carburetor man very quickly hey
listen<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.470> had<00:02:21.620> trouble<00:02:21.830> getting<00:02:22.070> this<00:02:22.250> thing

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
listen I had trouble getting this thing

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.450 
listen I had trouble getting this thing
well<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.000> wasn't<00:02:23.240> running<00:02:23.570> right<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.460> we

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
well it wasn't running right and we

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.860 
well it wasn't running right and we
redid<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.940> carburetor<00:02:26.300> put<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.600> on<00:02:26.690> there<00:02:26.810> and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
redid the carburetor put it on there and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.210 
redid the carburetor put it on there and
it<00:02:26.930> runs<00:02:27.080> exactly<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.710> same<00:02:27.920> as<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.070> did

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
it runs exactly the same as it did

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.180 
it runs exactly the same as it did
before<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:29.060> I'm<00:02:29.840> messing<00:02:30.650> around<00:02:30.740> with<00:02:31.070> the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
before so I'm messing around with the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.890 
before so I'm messing around with the
points<00:02:31.610> i<00:02:31.730> thought<00:02:31.940> well<00:02:32.180> Michael<00:02:32.510> show<00:02:32.720> this

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
points i thought well Michael show this

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.210 
points i thought well Michael show this
a<00:02:32.960> lot<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.230> people<00:02:33.320> has<00:02:33.500> never<00:02:33.680> seen<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> car

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
a lot of people has never seen a car

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.100 
a lot of people has never seen a car
with<00:02:34.370> points<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.620> rotor<00:02:36.890> cap<00:02:38.110> goes

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
with points this is the rotor cap goes

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.370 
with points this is the rotor cap goes
on<00:02:39.290> right<00:02:39.560> there<00:02:39.830> pulled<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.820> off<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:42.110> took<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
on right there pulled it off it took the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.290 
on right there pulled it off it took the
distributor<00:02:42.890> cap<00:02:43.130> off<00:02:43.370> which<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.670> this<00:02:44.000> thing

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
distributor cap off which is this thing

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.140 
distributor cap off which is this thing
you'll<00:02:44.750> see<00:02:44.900> there's<00:02:45.080> little<00:02:45.700> gizmos<00:02:46.700> inside

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
you'll see there's little gizmos inside

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.010 
you'll see there's little gizmos inside
there<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.660> thing<00:02:48.160> turns<00:02:49.160> around<00:02:49.580> and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
there this thing turns around and

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.630 
there this thing turns around and
transfers<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.230> fire<00:02:51.470> through<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.430> top<00:02:52.610> of

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
transfers the fire through the top of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.370 
transfers the fire through the top of
that<00:02:52.910> plug<00:02:53.180> out<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.720> end<00:02:53.840> of<00:02:53.990> here<00:02:54.200> and

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
that plug out to the end of here and

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.070 
that plug out to the end of here and

rides on it this was supposed to be
sixteen<00:03:04.520> thousands<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.240> if<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.720> notice<00:03:05.870> it's

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
sixteen thousands and if you notice it's

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.070 
sixteen thousands and if you notice it's
not<00:03:06.380> in<00:03:06.590> fact<00:03:06.770> I<00:03:06.860> believe<00:03:06.950> almost<00:03:07.900> what<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:08.960> have

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
not in fact I believe almost what I have

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.240 
not in fact I believe almost what I have
to<00:03:09.140> do<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.470> have<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.650> take<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.860> screwdriver

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
to do is I have to take a screwdriver

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.990 
to do is I have to take a screwdriver
loosen<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.390> screw<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.700> widen<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:13.790> out

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
loosen this screw and widen this out

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.210 
loosen this screw and widen this out
until<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.540> 16,000<00:03:15.440> Sandry<00:03:15.710> tighten<00:03:16.130> it

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
until it is 16,000 Sandry tighten it

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.220 
until it is 16,000 Sandry tighten it
once<00:03:16.700> out<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.000> right<00:03:17.150> gap<00:03:17.420> there<00:03:17.690> on<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.870> fact

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
once out the right gap there on the fact

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.570 
once out the right gap there on the fact
that<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:18.470> going<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.650> run<00:03:18.800> pretty<00:03:19.010> good<00:03:19.280> we'll

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
that it's going to run pretty good we'll

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.970 
that it's going to run pretty good we'll
give<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.880> try<00:03:19.959> when<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.020> wound<00:03:21.290> up<00:03:21.470> doing<00:03:21.680> was

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
give it a try when I wound up doing was

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.130 
give it a try when I wound up doing was
changing<00:03:22.489> this<00:03:22.580> thing<00:03:22.820> over<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.270> a<00:03:23.300> 12-volt<00:03:23.900> it

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
changing this thing over to a 12-volt it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.440 
changing this thing over to a 12-volt it
had<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.320> sixth<00:03:24.739> vote<00:03:24.920> coil<00:03:25.340> on<00:03:25.610> it<00:03:25.790> and

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
had a sixth vote coil on it and

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.110 
had a sixth vote coil on it and
basically<00:03:27.440> as<00:03:27.920> far<00:03:28.130> as<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.310> ignition<00:03:28.730> system

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
basically as far as the ignition system

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.790 
basically as far as the ignition system
goes<00:03:29.330> that's<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.840> only<00:03:30.050> six<00:03:30.290> bolt<00:03:30.560> piece

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
goes that's the only six bolt piece

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.640 
goes that's the only six bolt piece
ahead<00:03:31.190> on<00:03:31.400> there<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.820> had<00:03:32.060> my<00:03:32.090> hot<00:03:33.020> wire<00:03:33.290> running

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
ahead on there I had my hot wire running

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.620 
ahead on there I had my hot wire running
through<00:03:33.950> this<00:03:34.130> resistor<00:03:34.850> to<00:03:34.880> reduce<00:03:35.300> it<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.510> a

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
through this resistor to reduce it to a

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.260 
through this resistor to reduce it to a
six<00:03:35.900> volt<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.410> had<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:36.950> provo<00:03:37.430> coil<00:03:37.820> i<00:03:38.000> bought<00:03:38.239> a

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
six volt I had a provo coil i bought a

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.790 
six volt I had a provo coil i bought a
while<00:03:38.480> back<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:38.780> i<00:03:39.050> threw<00:03:39.320> it<00:03:39.410> on<00:03:39.560> there

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
while back so i threw it on there

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.960 
while back so i threw it on there
because<00:03:39.890> they<00:03:40.070> wouldn't<00:03:40.280> run<00:03:40.610> out

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
because they wouldn't run out

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.680 
because they wouldn't run out
gettin<00:03:41.270> spark'd<00:03:41.690> at<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.860> point<00:03:43.270> but<00:03:44.270> not<00:03:44.480> at

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
gettin spark'd at the point but not at

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.780 
gettin spark'd at the point but not at
the<00:03:44.810> plug<00:03:45.050> wires<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:45.680> obviously<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.490> old

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
the plug wires and obviously that old

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.210 
the plug wires and obviously that old
coil<00:03:47.030> gave<00:03:47.330> out<00:03:47.600> I<00:03:47.930> was<00:03:48.590> playing<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:48.980> change

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
coil gave out I was playing to change

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.100 
coil gave out I was playing to change
this<00:03:49.370> over<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.730> 12<00:03:49.970> volts<00:03:50.060> today<00:03:50.480> anyway<00:03:50.840> saw

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
this over to 12 volts today anyway saw

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.630 
this over to 12 volts today anyway saw
through<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:51.380> call<00:03:51.770> on<00:03:51.920> their<00:03:52.100> network<00:03:52.430> tout

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
through that call on their network tout

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.400 
through that call on their network tout
good<00:03:52.880> I've<00:03:53.120> been<00:03:53.150> adjusted<00:03:53.690> my<00:03:53.810> carburetor<00:03:54.200> I

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
good I've been adjusted my carburetor I

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.590 
good I've been adjusted my carburetor I
got<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.770> to<00:03:54.890> where<00:03:55.060> it's<00:03:56.060> getting<00:03:56.330> closer

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
got it to where it's getting closer

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.400 
got it to where it's getting closer
ain't<00:03:57.200> perfect<00:03:57.440> but<00:03:57.680> it's<00:03:57.890> getting<00:03:58.040> closer
