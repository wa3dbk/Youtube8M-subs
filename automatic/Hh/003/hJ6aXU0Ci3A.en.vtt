our general philosophy for multiplayer
in<00:00:11.880> Far<00:00:12.210> Cry<00:00:12.360> 2<00:00:12.450> was<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.080> try<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.290> take<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:14.070> most

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
in Far Cry 2 was to try to take the most

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.010 
in Far Cry 2 was to try to take the most
effective<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.179> interesting<00:00:15.690> parts<00:00:15.929> of

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
effective and interesting parts of

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.960 
effective and interesting parts of
single-player<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.859> fold<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:17.730> into

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
single-player and fold them into

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.660 
single-player and fold them into
multiplayer<00:00:18.690> experience<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:19.859> also<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.520> make

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
multiplayer experience but also to make

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.910 
multiplayer experience but also to make
something<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.180> was<00:00:21.390> not<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.470> be<00:00:22.590> too

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
something that was not going to be too

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.609 
something that was not going to be too
hardcore<00:00:23.480> but<00:00:24.480> sort<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.380> bit<00:00:25.470> more

hardcore but sort of a little bit more
broadly<00:00:25.920> accessible<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:27.510> was<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
broadly accessible so that there was a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.050 
broadly accessible so that there was a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.539 
actually go to those strategic points
and<00:01:13.560> capture<00:01:14.010> them<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.340> time-based

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
and capture them it's a time-based

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
and capture them it's a time-based
mechanic<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> rest<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> team<00:01:16.049> has<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
on the other side dynamic elements are a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.899 
on the other side dynamic elements are a
big<00:01:30.450> part<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.810> Far<00:01:31.530> Cry<00:01:31.650> 2<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.250> they're

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
big part of Far Cry 2 and they're

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.429 
big part of Far Cry 2 and they're
definitely<00:01:33.090> something<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.869> we've<00:01:33.990> tried<00:01:34.200> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
definitely something that we've tried to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.590 
definitely something that we've tried to
focus<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.520> multiplayer<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.299> Far<00:01:36.479> Cry

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
focus on in the multiplayer for Far Cry

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.399 
focus on in the multiplayer for Far Cry
2<00:01:37.189> fire<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.780> really<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> most

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
2 fire is really one of the most

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.960 
2 fire is really one of the most
powerful<00:01:40.650> dynamic<00:01:41.310> elements<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.939> have

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
powerful dynamic elements that we have

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.350 
powerful dynamic elements that we have
and<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:43.340> propagated<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.790> environment

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and it's propagated in the environment

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330 
and it's propagated in the environment
in<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.659> realistic<00:01:46.110> way<00:01:46.409> which<00:01:46.710> means<00:01:47.009> that

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
in a realistic way which means that

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.550 
in a realistic way which means that
things<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.390> should<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.689> able<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.110> catch<00:01:49.380> on

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
things that should be able to catch on

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.340 
things that should be able to catch on
fire<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:50.390> based<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.049> weather<00:01:52.200> conditions

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
fire can based on the weather conditions

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.550 
fire can based on the weather conditions
and<00:01:53.130> based<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.549> wind<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.840> we've<00:01:54.990> done<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.470> the
