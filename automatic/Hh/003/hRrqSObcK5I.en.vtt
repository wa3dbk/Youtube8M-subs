00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
on court I felt like the extra weight on

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.760 
on court I felt like the extra weight on
the<00:00:44.430> tour<00:00:44.670> version<00:00:45.000> really<00:00:45.899> helping<00:00:46.350> maintain

the tour version really helping maintain

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.860 
the tour version really helping maintain
control<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
control because as you can see I have a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.590 
control because as you can see I have a
very<00:00:49.140> long<00:00:49.410> swing<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> would<00:00:51.300> highly

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
on my forehand I went a little bit more

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.070 
on my forehand I went a little bit more
aggressive<00:01:13.619> shot<00:01:13.860> down<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> line<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.750> then

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
aggressive here on the approach I felt

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.249 
aggressive here on the approach I felt
like<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> good<00:01:23.040> depth<00:01:23.970> no<00:01:24.780> problem<00:01:25.110> maintaining
