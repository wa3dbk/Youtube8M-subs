minecraft ps4 or minecraft Xbox one so
we're<00:00:09.000> gonna<00:00:09.090> break<00:00:09.240> them<00:00:09.360> down<00:00:09.389> category<00:00:09.960> by

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
we're gonna break them down category by

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.570 
we're gonna break them down category by
category<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.950> we're<00:00:11.099> gonna<00:00:11.190> start<00:00:11.490> with

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
category and we're gonna start with

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.770 
category and we're gonna start with
graphics<00:00:12.090> because<00:00:12.300> that's<00:00:12.480> what<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> lot<00:00:12.719> of

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
graphics because that's what a lot of

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.850 
graphics because that's what a lot of
people<00:00:12.900> look<00:00:13.200> at<00:00:13.349> when<00:00:13.530> they<00:00:13.650> play<00:00:13.799> video

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
people look at when they play video

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.129 
people look at when they play video
games<00:00:14.190> yeah<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.790> get<00:00:15.150> related<00:00:15.509> there<00:00:15.690> no<00:00:15.929> okay

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
games yeah you get related there no okay

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.090 
games yeah you get related there no okay
anyway<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.619> viously

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
anyway so viously

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.099 
anyway so viously
both<00:00:17.940> games<00:00:18.180> are<00:00:18.300> gonna<00:00:18.390> look<00:00:18.600> roughly<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
both games are gonna look roughly the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.179 
both games are gonna look roughly the
same<00:00:19.289> they're<00:00:19.529> both<00:00:19.650> gonna<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.859> running<00:00:20.100> at

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
same they're both gonna be running at

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.580 
same they're both gonna be running at
1080p<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.850> 60<00:00:21.150> frames<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.420> second<00:00:21.810> that's<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
1080p and 60 frames a second that's a

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.140 
1080p and 60 frames a second that's a
design<00:00:22.920> goal<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.250> both<00:00:23.400> platforms<00:00:23.580> that's

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
design goal for both platforms that's

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.340 
design goal for both platforms that's
how<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.359> looks<00:00:24.539> right<00:00:24.600> now<00:00:24.779> that's<00:00:25.170> how<00:00:25.320> it's

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
how it looks right now that's how it's

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.950 
how it looks right now that's how it's
probably<00:00:25.710> gonna<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:26.060> but<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.480> differences

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
probably gonna be but the differences

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.779 
probably gonna be but the differences
are<00:00:28.019> going<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.560> be<00:00:28.650> minut<00:00:29.160> because<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> ps4

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
are going to be minut because the ps4

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.540 
are going to be minut because the ps4
isn't<00:00:30.300> objectively<00:00:30.779> more<00:00:31.050> powerful<00:00:31.560> platform

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
isn't objectively more powerful platform

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.950 
isn't objectively more powerful platform
for<00:00:32.610> games<00:00:32.880> because<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.300> has<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> 20<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.780> 30

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
for games because it has a 20 to 30

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.720 
for games because it has a 20 to 30
percent<00:00:34.230> more<00:00:34.290> powerful<00:00:34.530> GPU<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.520> means

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
percent more powerful GPU that means

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.580 
percent more powerful GPU that means
they<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.390> some<00:00:36.719> more<00:00:36.930> stuff<00:00:37.170> whether<00:00:37.440> they

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
they can do some more stuff whether they

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.319 
they can do some more stuff whether they
do<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:37.800> not<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.550> know<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.910> debate<00:00:39.149> but

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
do or not is you know up to debate but

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.389 
do or not is you know up to debate but
they<00:00:39.899> I'd<00:00:40.079> imagine<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.559> would<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.950> something

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
they I'd imagine they would do something

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.190 
they I'd imagine they would do something
a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.879> small<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.510> instance<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.140> see

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
a little small for instance you can see

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.869 
a little small for instance you can see
items<00:00:43.590> further<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> third

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
items further you can see have a third

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.850 
items further you can see have a third
render<00:00:45.210> distance<00:00:45.329> stuff<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.530> but<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
render distance stuff like that but the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.260 
render distance stuff like that but the
games<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.190> gonna<00:00:47.280> look<00:00:47.489> object<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
games are gonna look object to be the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.000 
games are gonna look object to be the
same<00:00:48.480> you'll<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.289> some<00:00:49.469> more<00:00:49.620> graphical

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
same you'll just get some more graphical

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.799 
same you'll just get some more graphical
capabilities<00:00:50.100> like<00:00:50.550> for<00:00:51.059> instance<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.539> further

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
capabilities like for instance a further

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.170 
capabilities like for instance a further
render<00:00:52.140> distance<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> ps4<00:00:52.980> or<00:00:53.399> something

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
render distance on the ps4 or something

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.490 
render distance on the ps4 or something
small<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.050> gonna<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> big

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
small like that it's not gonna be a big

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.900 
small like that it's not gonna be a big
big<00:00:55.739> deal<00:00:55.920> where<00:00:56.160> you're<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.399> wow<00:00:56.670> this

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
big deal where you're like wow this

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.700 
big deal where you're like wow this
looks<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.210> million<00:00:57.390> times<00:00:57.480> better<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.620> gonna

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
looks a million times better it's gonna

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.470 
looks a million times better it's gonna
look<00:00:58.920> at<00:00:59.070> least<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.309> little<00:00:59.460> better<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.180> you're

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
look at least a little better and you're

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
look at least a little better and you're
gonna<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:00.960> definitely<00:01:01.170> notice<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
gonna you know definitely notice the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.569 
gonna you know definitely notice the
slight<00:01:02.160> change

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
slight change

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.030 
slight change
so<00:01:03.180> yeah<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> ps4<00:01:03.719> wins<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.739> forest

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
so yeah the ps4 wins on this forest

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.770 
so yeah the ps4 wins on this forest
graphics<00:01:05.400> code<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.270> looks<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.659> little

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
graphics code because it looks a little

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.260 
graphics code because it looks a little
better<00:01:06.930> than<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.290> Xbox<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.770> by<00:01:08.580> how<00:01:08.760> much<00:01:08.909> is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
better than the Xbox one by how much is

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.520 
better than the Xbox one by how much is
you<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.990> whether<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.260> care

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you know up to you whether you care

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.130 
you know up to you whether you care
about<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.310> ps4<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.420> Xbox<00:01:12.869> one

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
about that or not but ps4 one Xbox one

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.950 
about that or not but ps4 one Xbox one
zero<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.950> guess<00:01:14.130> ironically<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.390> next<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.750> we're

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
zero I guess ironically so next up we're

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.570 
zero I guess ironically so next up we're
gonna<00:01:16.049> go<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.439> multiplayer<00:01:16.799> functionalities

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
gonna go for multiplayer functionalities

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.240 
gonna go for multiplayer functionalities
so<00:01:17.850> again<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.259> where<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.100> goes

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
so again this is one where it's it goes

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.160 
so again this is one where it's it goes
slightly<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.759> other<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.060> basically<00:01:21.479> Xbox

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
slightly the other way so basically Xbox

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.570 
slightly the other way so basically Xbox
one's<00:01:22.350> big<00:01:22.710> feature<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.159> they're<00:01:23.310> bragging

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
one's big feature that they're bragging

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.630 
one's big feature that they're bragging
about<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.939> their<00:01:24.630> cloud<00:01:24.840> service<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.409> have

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
about is their cloud service they have

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.620 
about is their cloud service they have
300,000<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> number<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.479> keep

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
300,000 I think as the number they keep

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.510 
300,000 I think as the number they keep
bragging<00:01:27.990> about<00:01:28.049> cloud<00:01:28.829> service<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.280> Xbox

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
bragging about cloud service for Xbox

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.460 
bragging about cloud service for Xbox
Live<00:01:29.670> which<00:01:30.509> basically<00:01:30.900> means<00:01:31.229> that

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
Live which basically means that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.960 
Live which basically means that
developers<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:31.979> use<00:01:32.189> these<00:01:32.340> servers<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
developers can use these servers and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.490 
developers can use these servers and
take<00:01:33.180> advantage<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.630> bigger<00:01:33.810> multiplayer<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
take advantage of bigger multiplayer and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.620 
take advantage of bigger multiplayer and
do<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.710> course<00:01:34.890> top<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.210> basically

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
do some course top of that so basically

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.890 
do some course top of that so basically
with<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:38.009> means<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.700> 4j<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.720> take

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
with this that means that if 4j do take

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.300 
with this that means that if 4j do take
a<00:01:39.930> bunch<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.380> which<00:01:40.560> I'd<00:01:40.740> imagine<00:01:41.189> they

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
a bunch of this which I'd imagine they

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.280 
a bunch of this which I'd imagine they
will<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:41.990> Microsoft<00:01:42.990> didn't<00:01:43.170> put

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
will do because Microsoft didn't put

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.690 
will do because Microsoft didn't put
them<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.470> some<00:01:43.680> serious<00:01:43.920> pressure<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.520> make

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
them on some serious pressure to make

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.789 
them on some serious pressure to make
sure<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.149> they<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.840> know<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.110> some<00:01:46.409> form<00:01:46.710> of

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
sure that they you know do some form of

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.319 
sure that they you know do some form of
something<00:01:47.220> with<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.820> least<00:01:47.939> they're

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
something with this or at least they're

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.700 
something with this or at least they're
gonna<00:01:48.450> point<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> give<00:01:49.110> them<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.560> many

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
gonna point out and give them as many

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.080 
gonna point out and give them as many
servers<00:01:50.040> as<00:01:50.250> they<00:01:50.399> need<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> make<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> better

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
servers as they need to make the better

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.270 
servers as they need to make the better
version<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:52.560> means<00:01:52.740> there's<00:01:53.009> gonna<00:01:53.070> be

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
version and that means there's gonna be

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.039 
version and that means there's gonna be
some<00:01:53.549> better<00:01:53.759> multiplier<00:01:54.299> functionality<00:01:54.869> on

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
some better multiplier functionality on

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:55.670 
some better multiplier functionality on
the<00:01:55.079> Xbox<00:01:55.470> one

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
the Xbox one

the Xbox one
whatever<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.189> means<00:01:56.460> instead<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.939> being<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
whatever that means instead of being a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.490 
whatever that means instead of being a
player<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.540> eight<00:01:57.689> people<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.200> play<00:01:58.320> with

12 or 16 or 64 or something or whether

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.569 
12 or 16 or 64 or something or whether
that<00:02:01.290> means<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.710> make<00:02:01.740> public<00:02:02.189> servers

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
that means you can make public servers

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.340 
that means you can make public servers
it's<00:02:02.790> yet<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.180> be<00:02:03.299> seen<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:03.990> there's<00:02:04.110> gonna<00:02:04.200> be

it's yet to be seen but there's gonna be

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.350 
it's yet to be seen but there's gonna be

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
some slightly better mother Montclair

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.639 
some slightly better mother Montclair
functionality<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.170> Xbox<00:02:07.439> one

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
functionality on the Xbox one

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.410 
functionality on the Xbox one
however<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> ps4<00:02:08.459> will<00:02:08.700> still<00:02:08.910> function<00:02:09.060> just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
however the ps4 will still function just

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.630 
however the ps4 will still function just
fine<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.869> do<00:02:09.989> its<00:02:10.140> whole<00:02:10.289> crazy<00:02:10.560> thing<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:11.580> as

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
fine and do its whole crazy thing but as

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.220 
fine and do its whole crazy thing but as
far<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:11.819> cost<00:02:12.060> goes<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:12.540> also<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:12.989> have<00:02:13.170> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
far as cost goes it's also you have to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.670 
far as cost goes it's also you have to
pay<00:02:13.349> on

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
pay on

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.080 
pay on
to<00:02:13.920> play<00:02:14.069> up<00:02:14.159> your<00:02:14.280> friends<00:02:14.609> which<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.879> think

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
to play up your friends which I think

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.140 
to play up your friends which I think
sucks<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:15.719> yes<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.109> basically<00:02:16.549> it's<00:02:17.549> gonna<00:02:17.849> be

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
sucks but yes so basically it's gonna be

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.670 
sucks but yes so basically it's gonna be
roughly<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.719> same<00:02:18.870> price<00:02:19.049> wise<00:02:19.349> but<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
roughly the same price wise but the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.020 
roughly the same price wise but the
Malta<00:02:19.890> players<00:02:20.069> can<00:02:20.189> be<00:02:20.310> better<00:02:20.519> on<00:02:20.640> Xbox<00:02:20.969> one

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
Malta players can be better on Xbox one

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.940 
Malta players can be better on Xbox one
so<00:02:21.390> for<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.629> money<00:02:21.780> you're<00:02:21.930> paying<00:02:22.079> it's<00:02:22.859> a

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
so for the money you're paying it's a

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.440 
so for the money you're paying it's a
better<00:02:23.129> multiplayer<00:02:23.579> on<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.760> Xbox<00:02:24.030> one

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
better multiplayer on the Xbox one

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.679 
better multiplayer on the Xbox one
one<00:02:24.689> two<00:02:24.870> Xbox<00:02:25.260> one<00:02:25.500> one<00:02:25.859> two<00:02:26.069> ps4<00:02:26.579> so<00:02:27.540> yeah

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:42.830 
because they're coming out at the same
time<00:02:41.609> they're<00:02:42.060> being<00:02:42.150> bug<00:02:42.389> tested<00:02:42.719> at<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
time they're being bug tested at the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.509 
time they're being bug tested at the
same<00:02:43.079> time<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:44.040> they're<00:02:44.189> gang<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.489> know

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
same time and they're gang you know

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.640 
same time and they're gang you know
tested<00:02:45.000> rigorously<00:02:45.209> at<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.810> same<00:02:46.019> time<00:02:46.260> any

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
tested rigorously at the same time any

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.379 
tested rigorously at the same time any
bugs<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.280> do<00:02:47.400> come<00:02:47.579> out<00:02:47.669> will<00:02:47.879> be<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.120> same

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
bugs that do come out will be the same

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.210 
bugs that do come out will be the same
across<00:02:48.720> both<00:02:48.989> platforms<00:02:49.169> unless<00:02:49.919> there's<00:02:50.159> a

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
across both platforms unless there's a

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.860 
across both platforms unless there's a
game<00:02:50.370> breaking<00:02:50.609> one<00:02:50.819> on<00:02:50.939> one<00:02:51.120> it's<00:02:51.689> very

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
game breaking one on one it's very

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.940 
game breaking one on one it's very
unlikely<00:02:52.200> we'll<00:02:52.409> see<00:02:52.530> something<00:02:52.709> like<00:02:52.889> that

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
unlikely we'll see something like that

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.159 
unlikely we'll see something like that
it's<00:02:53.370> very<00:02:53.760> likely<00:02:54.030> though<00:02:54.389> we'll<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:55.049> get

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.169 
it's very likely though we'll just get

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:57.170 
it's very likely though we'll just get
bugs<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.590> same<00:02:55.829> across<00:02:56.010> both<00:02:56.220> platforms<00:02:56.400> that

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
bugs the same across both platforms that

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.369 
bugs the same across both platforms that
we<00:02:57.299> fixed<00:02:57.629> at<00:02:57.689> the<00:02:57.780> same<00:02:57.930> times<00:02:58.200> both

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
we fixed at the same times both

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.470 
we fixed at the same times both
platforms<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.129> it's<00:02:59.430> basically<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.909> non-issue

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
platforms and it's basically a non-issue

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.869 
platforms and it's basically a non-issue
so<00:03:00.900> basically<00:03:01.200> as<00:03:01.379> far<00:03:01.439> as<00:03:01.650> bugs<00:03:01.859> go<00:03:02.099> it's<00:03:02.669> one

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
so basically as far as bugs go it's one

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.459 
so basically as far as bugs go it's one
for<00:03:03.090> each<00:03:03.150> because<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:03.689> a<00:03:03.780> tight<00:03:03.959> issue<00:03:04.169> so

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
for each because it's a tight issue so

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.610 
for each because it's a tight issue so
two<00:03:04.530> for<00:03:04.919> ps4<00:03:05.370> two<00:03:05.669> for<00:03:05.879> Xbox<00:03:06.150> one<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:07.169> next<00:03:07.379> up

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
two for ps4 two for Xbox one so next up

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.069 
two for ps4 two for Xbox one so next up
we're<00:03:07.859> gonna<00:03:07.950> go<00:03:08.250> with<00:03:08.700> basically<00:03:09.419> updates

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
we're gonna go with basically updates

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.379 
we're gonna go with basically updates
and<00:03:10.469> gameplay<00:03:10.919> features<00:03:11.370> or<00:03:11.609> gameplay<00:03:12.060> slash

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
and gameplay features or gameplay slash

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.050 
and gameplay features or gameplay slash
updates<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.889> reason<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.669> big<00:03:14.879> one

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
updates and the reason this is a big one

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.899 
updates and the reason this is a big one
is<00:03:15.239> because<00:03:16.010> if<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.189> compare<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.609> Pocket

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
is because if you compare the Pocket

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.610 
is because if you compare the Pocket
Edition<00:03:17.940> or<00:03:18.269> something<00:03:18.659> to<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> console

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
Edition or something to a console

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.140 
Edition or something to a console
Edition<00:03:19.949> or<00:03:20.159> you<00:03:20.430> compare<00:03:20.699> the<00:03:20.790> console<00:03:21.060> to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
Edition or you compare the console to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.640 
Edition or you compare the console to
the<00:03:21.329> PC<00:03:21.690> there's<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.019> lot<00:03:22.169> of<00:03:22.290> differences

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
the PC there's a lot of differences

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.379 
the PC there's a lot of differences
before<00:03:23.069> us<00:03:23.159> gameplay<00:03:23.489> goes<00:03:23.699> and<00:03:23.940> there

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
before us gameplay goes and there

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.369 
before us gameplay goes and there
getting<00:03:24.569> updates<00:03:24.870> first<00:03:25.139> is<00:03:25.290> obviously

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
getting updates first is obviously

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.009 
getting updates first is obviously
important<00:03:26.010> however<00:03:26.250> both<00:03:27.150> platforms<00:03:27.419> will<00:03:27.930> be

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
important however both platforms will be

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.929 
important however both platforms will be
ending<00:03:28.199> updates<00:03:28.500> exactly<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.220> same<00:03:29.400> time<00:03:29.669> if

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
ending updates exactly the same time if

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.550 
ending updates exactly the same time if
there<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.239> gonna<00:03:30.359> be<00:03:30.510> an<00:03:30.599> edge<00:03:30.720> as<00:03:30.959> like<00:03:31.439> for

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
there is gonna be an edge as like for

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.530 
there is gonna be an edge as like for
the<00:03:31.650> ps3<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:32.099> xbox360<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:33.239> gonna<00:03:33.389> be<00:03:33.479> a

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
the ps3 and xbox360 it's gonna be a

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.330 
the ps3 and xbox360 it's gonna be a
matter<00:03:33.659> of<00:03:33.780> hours<00:03:34.169> and<00:03:34.319> it's<00:03:34.620> completely

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
matter of hours and it's completely

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.210 
matter of hours and it's completely
negative<00:03:35.549> at<00:03:35.939> negligible<00:03:36.540> if<00:03:37.409> add<00:03:37.829> them<00:03:38.010> and

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
negative at negligible if add them and

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.679 
negative at negligible if add them and
that<00:03:38.489> can<00:03:38.639> even<00:03:38.729> go<00:03:38.939> the<00:03:39.060> other<00:03:39.150> way<00:03:39.239> like<00:03:39.569> it

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
that can even go the other way like it

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.149 
that can even go the other way like it
could<00:03:39.810> go<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.959> day<00:03:40.169> each<00:03:40.319> way<00:03:40.530> if<00:03:40.709> there's<00:03:40.949> a<00:03:41.010> big

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
could go a day each way if there's a big

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.789 
could go a day each way if there's a big
mistake<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:42.180> yeah<00:03:42.329> very<00:03:42.780> very<00:03:43.169> negligible

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
mistake so yeah very very negligible

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.110 
mistake so yeah very very negligible
difference<00:03:43.919> so<00:03:44.489> we're<00:03:44.579> gonna<00:03:44.669> give<00:03:44.879> that<00:03:44.909> a

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
difference so we're gonna give that a

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.330 
difference so we're gonna give that a
point<00:03:45.389> for<00:03:45.540> both<00:03:45.629> platforms<00:03:45.870> -<00:03:46.379> so<00:03:47.069> that's

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
point for both platforms - so that's

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.819 
point for both platforms - so that's
that's<00:03:47.819> free<00:03:48.060> all<00:03:48.209> right<00:03:48.419> now<00:03:48.599> so<00:03:49.290> next<00:03:49.500> up<00:03:49.680> we

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
that's free all right now so next up we

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.069 
that's free all right now so next up we
can<00:03:49.919> have<00:03:50.099> control<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.970> controls<00:03:51.389> is<00:03:51.659> the<00:03:51.840> big

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
can have control so controls is the big

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.509 
can have control so controls is the big
issue<00:03:52.229> of<00:03:52.409> their<00:03:52.680> minecraft<00:03:52.889> console

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
issue of their minecraft console

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.580 
issue of their minecraft console
addition<00:03:53.849> because<00:03:54.540> basically<00:03:54.989> playing<00:03:55.470> on

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
addition because basically playing on

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.199 
addition because basically playing on
the<00:03:55.680> console<00:03:56.099> your<00:03:56.280> big<00:03:56.459> advantage<00:03:56.939> to<00:03:56.970> make

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
the console your big advantage to make

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.939 
the console your big advantage to make
up<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.479> fact<00:03:57.689> that<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:57.900> get<00:03:58.199> the<00:03:58.409> slightly

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
up the fact that you get the slightly

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.280 
up the fact that you get the slightly
inferior<00:03:59.400> version<00:03:59.849> to<00:03:59.939> the<00:04:00.030> PC<00:04:00.359> is<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:01.139> you

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
inferior version to the PC is that you

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.170 
inferior version to the PC is that you
get<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.590> really<00:04:01.799> nice<00:04:01.979> controls<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.790> get<00:04:03.000> you

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
get the really nice controls you get you

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.490 
get the really nice controls you get you
know<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.449> nice<00:04:03.599> UI<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.169> you<00:04:04.259> get<00:04:04.470> just

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
know the nice UI and you get just

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.960 
know the nice UI and you get just
everything<00:04:05.040> done<00:04:05.220> for<00:04:05.400> you

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
everything done for you

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.149 
everything done for you
so<00:04:06.389> the<00:04:06.569> controls<00:04:06.989> these<00:04:07.379> this<00:04:07.709> is<00:04:07.859> up<00:04:07.979> for

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
so the controls these this is up for

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.099 
so the controls these this is up for
debate<00:04:08.280> but<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:09.209> ps4<00:04:09.389> controller<00:04:09.959> is

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
debate but the ps4 controller is

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.300 
on the Xbox one
might<00:04:27.030> not<00:04:27.270> be<00:04:27.449> quite<00:04:27.870> as<00:04:27.900> good<00:04:28.169> as<00:04:28.560> triggers

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
might not be quite as good as triggers

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.559 
might not be quite as good as triggers
on<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.460> ps4<00:04:29.669> because<00:04:29.969> they're<00:04:30.090> all<00:04:30.210> haptic

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569

for<00:04:32.340> Minecraft<00:04:32.759> it's<00:04:32.939> gonna<00:04:33.120> be<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.240> minor

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
for Minecraft it's gonna be a minor

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:34.850

there's<00:04:43.860> two<00:04:44.039> factors<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.580> can<00:04:44.729> do<00:04:45.030> or<00:04:45.330> I

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
there's two factors you can do or I

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.330 
there's two factors you can do or I
guess<00:04:45.539> free<00:04:45.780> back<00:04:45.960> as<00:04:46.139> you<00:04:46.259> could<00:04:46.770> shift<00:04:46.949> today

guess free back as you could shift today
if<00:04:47.520> you<00:04:47.610> include<00:04:47.879> price<00:04:48.120> basically<00:04:49.110> factor

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
if you include price basically factor

you look better if you like the x1 and
it's<00:04:56.340> all<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.969> know<00:04:57.090> slightly<00:04:57.599> bigger<00:04:57.810> appeal

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
it's all you know slightly bigger appeal

it's all you know slightly bigger appeal
which<00:04:58.469> makes<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:58.979> think<00:04:59.310> it's<00:04:59.460> a<00:04:59.520> pretty<00:04:59.669> cool

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849

expensive<00:05:32.370> by<00:05:33.000> about<00:05:33.659> $100<00:05:34.469> or<00:05:34.710> 80<00:05:34.949> pounds<00:05:35.430> or

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
expensive by about $100 or 80 pounds or

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.439 
expensive by about $100 or 80 pounds or
you<00:05:35.699> know<00:05:35.789> wherever<00:05:35.969> your<00:05:36.150> regional

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
you know wherever your regional

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.390 
you know wherever your regional
equivalent<00:05:36.750> is<00:05:36.870> so<00:05:37.529> it<00:05:37.589> looks<00:05:37.770> like<00:05:37.860> if<00:05:38.159> you're

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
equivalent is so it looks like if you're

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.070 
equivalent is so it looks like if you're
you<00:05:38.610> know<00:05:38.639> pretty<00:05:38.909> much<00:05:39.000> Tyne<00:05:39.449> is<00:05:39.690> Park<00:05:39.900> tight

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
you know pretty much Tyne is Park tight

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.649 
you know pretty much Tyne is Park tight
as<00:05:40.259> far<00:05:40.409> as<00:05:40.500> it<00:05:40.589> goes<00:05:40.740> buy<00:05:41.159> a<00:05:41.190> ps4<00:05:41.610> if<00:05:42.330> you<00:05:42.479> can't

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
as far as it goes buy a ps4 if you can't

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.029 
as far as it goes buy a ps4 if you can't

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
get on it stock buy an xbox one but the

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.159 
get on it stock buy an xbox one but the
ps4<00:05:44.279> is<00:05:44.520> cheaper<00:05:45.089> and<00:05:45.210> will<00:05:45.750> look<00:05:45.930> slightly

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
ps4 is cheaper and will look slightly

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.290 
ps4 is cheaper and will look slightly
better<00:05:46.589> and<00:05:47.009> obviously<00:05:47.520> in<00:05:47.789> exchange<00:05:48.120> for

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
better and obviously in exchange for

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.749 
better and obviously in exchange for
more<00:05:48.360> play<00:05:48.599> stuff<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.710> yeah<00:05:49.860> if<00:05:50.039> your<00:05:50.279> friends

more play stuff so yeah if your friends

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.610 
more play stuff so yeah if your friends
you<00:05:50.969> know<00:05:51.089> don't<00:05:51.360> or<00:05:51.599> split<00:05:52.020> even<00:05:52.229> across<00:05:52.379> the

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
you know don't or split even across the

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.769 
you know don't or split even across the
platforms<00:05:53.279> go<00:05:53.550> over<00:05:53.759> ps4<00:05:54.270> because<00:05:54.629> it's

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
platforms go over ps4 because it's

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:57.050 
platforms go over ps4 because it's
slowly<00:05:54.990> cheaper<00:05:55.469> however<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.310> Xbox<00:05:56.669> one<00:05:56.849> is<00:05:57.029> a

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
slowly cheaper however the Xbox one is a

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.629 
slowly cheaper however the Xbox one is a
still<00:05:57.599> pretty<00:05:58.020> viable<00:05:58.259> choice<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:59.039> there's<00:05:59.580> a

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
still pretty viable choice and there's a

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.339 
still pretty viable choice and there's a
very<00:05:59.879> very<00:06:00.000> minor<00:06:00.509> difference<00:06:00.960> between<00:06:01.199> them

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
very very minor difference between them

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.290 
very very minor difference between them
the<00:06:01.919> price<00:06:02.129> is<00:06:02.339> pretty<00:06:02.460> much<00:06:02.669> the<00:06:02.819> only<00:06:02.849> factor

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
the price is pretty much the only factor

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.059 
the price is pretty much the only factor
that<00:06:03.330> make<00:06:03.599> you<00:06:03.659> want<00:06:03.839> a<00:06:03.870> ps4<00:06:04.289> so<00:06:04.680> that's<00:06:04.889> the

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
that make you want a ps4 so that's the

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.550 
that make you want a ps4 so that's the
ps4<00:06:05.400> versus<00:06:05.909> Xbox<00:06:06.270> one<00:06:06.419> analysis<00:06:07.020> I<00:06:07.229> might<00:06:07.439> do

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
ps4 versus Xbox one analysis I might do

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.170 
ps4 versus Xbox one analysis I might do
another<00:06:07.710> one<00:06:07.860> once<00:06:08.009> they're<00:06:08.159> out<00:06:08.310> if<00:06:08.460> anything

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
another one once they're out if anything

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.089 
another one once they're out if anything
changes<00:06:09.629> so<00:06:09.900> yeah<00:06:10.110> likely<00:06:10.529> if<00:06:10.650> you<00:06:10.770> liked<00:06:10.979> it
