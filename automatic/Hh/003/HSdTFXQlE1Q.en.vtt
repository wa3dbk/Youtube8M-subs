now<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.670> then<00:02:11.060> one<00:02:11.240> solution<00:02:11.480> wins<00:02:11.870> he's

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
now and then one solution wins he's

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.890 
now and then one solution wins he's
going<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.860> go<00:02:12.950> faso<00:02:13.310> legacy<00:02:13.730> we<00:02:13.940> can<00:02:14.150> do<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.420> and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
going to go faso legacy we can do it and

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.740 
going to go faso legacy we can do it and
then<00:02:15.020> when<00:02:15.200> one<00:02:15.470> function<00:02:15.800> caps<00:02:16.010> again<00:02:16.750> jess

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
then when one function caps again jess

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.750 
then when one function caps again jess
is<00:02:17.780> going<00:02:17.990> to<00:02:18.080> go<00:02:18.140> more<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:18.620> think<00:02:19.280> if<00:02:19.400> he<00:02:19.520> loses
