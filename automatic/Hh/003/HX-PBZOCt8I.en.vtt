00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
going to go ahead and put that right

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.890 
going to go ahead and put that right
there<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:51.030> we're<00:02:51.150> gonna<00:02:51.240> make<00:02:51.450> sure<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.660> do

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
there but we're gonna make sure to do

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.050 
there but we're gonna make sure to do
one<00:02:52.080> thing<00:02:52.350> we're<00:02:53.250> gonna<00:02:53.370> make<00:02:53.550> sure<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.880> put

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
one thing we're gonna make sure to put

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.850 
one thing we're gonna make sure to put
that<00:02:54.090> all<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.480> way<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:54.780> there<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.590> it's

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
that all the way in there so that it's

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.380 
that all the way in there so that it's
sticking<00:02:56.220> down<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.790> side<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:56.970> needs<00:02:57.150> to

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
sticking down and the side that needs to

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.060 
sticking down and the side that needs to
be<00:02:57.420> washed<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.990> facing<00:02:58.320> down<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.890> water

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
be washed is facing down so the water

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.240 
be washed is facing down so the water
can<00:02:59.310> be<00:02:59.340> sprayed<00:02:59.670> up<00:02:59.820> into<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> container

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
can be sprayed up into the container

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.700 
can be sprayed up into the container
otherwise<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:03.090> will<00:03:03.240> flip<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:03.960> it<00:03:04.350> might<00:03:04.530> get

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
otherwise it will flip and it might get

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.040 
otherwise it will flip and it might get
like<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:05.250> not<00:03:06.060> everything<00:03:06.450> might<00:03:06.630> be<00:03:06.750> clean

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
like this not everything might be clean

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.190 
like this not everything might be clean
or<00:03:07.650> could<00:03:08.040> even<00:03:08.280> flip<00:03:08.550> all<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.420> way<00:03:09.570> like<00:03:09.900> this

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
or could even flip all the way like this

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.590 
or could even flip all the way like this
which<00:03:11.130> couldn't<00:03:11.730> make<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:11.880> tough<00:03:12.180> we're<00:03:12.390> end

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
which couldn't make it tough we're end

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.090 
which couldn't make it tough we're end
up<00:03:12.750> somewhere<00:03:13.140> like<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> back<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
up somewhere like in the back of the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.940 
up somewhere like in the back of the
dishwasher<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.230> we<00:03:16.230> want<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.470> put<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.740> face

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
dishwasher so we want to put it face

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.100 
dishwasher so we want to put it face
down<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.030> water<00:03:18.240> can<00:03:18.510> clean<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.900> dishes

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
down so the water can clean the dishes

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.060 
down so the water can clean the dishes
like<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.530> dishwasher<00:03:19.710> is<00:03:20.070> supposed<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.520> do

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
like the dishwasher is supposed to do

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.830 
like the dishwasher is supposed to do
again<00:03:23.070> there's<00:03:23.850> another<00:03:23.970> example<00:03:24.300> of<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
again there's another example of the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.500 
again there's another example of the
Tupperware<00:03:25.110> lid<00:03:26.060> sometimes<00:03:27.060> these<00:03:27.300> are<00:03:27.420> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
Tupperware lid sometimes these are the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.850 
Tupperware lid sometimes these are the
awkward<00:03:27.870> shapes<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.410> don't<00:03:28.590> know<00:03:28.710> where

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
awkward shapes that we don't know where

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.770 
awkward shapes that we don't know where
they<00:03:28.980> fit<00:03:29.250> we're<00:03:30.240> just<00:03:30.270> going<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.570> go<00:03:30.660> ahead

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
they fit we're just going to go ahead

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.170 
they fit we're just going to go ahead
and<00:03:31.020> put<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> back<00:03:31.740> there<00:03:31.980> or<00:03:32.460> really

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
and put that in the back there or really

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.170 
and put that in the back there or really
if<00:03:33.360> it's<00:03:33.540> more<00:03:33.780> full<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.290> fuller<00:03:35.190> we're<00:03:36.000> going

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
if it's more full and fuller we're going

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.520 
if it's more full and fuller we're going
to<00:03:36.300> go<00:03:36.450> ahead<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.780> put<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.020> wherever<00:03:37.170> we<00:03:37.350> can

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
to go ahead and put it wherever we can

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.630 
to go ahead and put it wherever we can
fit<00:03:37.740> it<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:38.210> maybe<00:03:39.210> here<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.620> here<00:03:41.100> notice

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
fit it so maybe here and here notice

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.890 
fit it so maybe here and here notice
that<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.060> part<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.600> needs<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.870> be

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
that the the part that needs to be

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.440 
that the the part that needs to be
cleaned<00:03:43.260> needs<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.190> be<00:03:44.310> clean<00:03:44.610> needs<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.360> be

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
cleaned needs to be clean needs to be

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.810 
cleaned needs to be clean needs to be
able<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.870> get<00:03:46.020> it<00:03:46.110> rinsed<00:03:46.590> therefore<00:03:47.520> we<00:03:47.670> don't

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
able to get it rinsed therefore we don't

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.920 
able to get it rinsed therefore we don't
want<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.150> put<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.450> like<00:03:48.630> this<00:03:49.410> or<00:03:50.750> any<00:03:51.750> other

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
want to put it like this or any other

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.600 
want to put it like this or any other
combination<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.800> won't<00:03:52.950> get<00:03:53.070> clean<00:03:53.310> so

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
combination that won't get clean so

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.280 
combination that won't get clean so
let's<00:03:54.330> just<00:03:54.510> go<00:03:54.630> ahead<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.930> stick<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.230> over

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
let's just go ahead and stick it over

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.420 
let's just go ahead and stick it over
here<00:03:56.270> next<00:03:57.270> comes<00:03:57.630> one<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.860> types<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.190> cups

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
here next comes one of the types of cups

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.040 
here next comes one of the types of cups
we<00:03:59.610> had<00:03:59.730> a<00:04:00.170> glass<00:04:01.170> cup<00:04:02.660> we're<00:04:03.660> gonna<00:04:03.750> go<00:04:03.930> ahead

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
we had a glass cup we're gonna go ahead

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.500 
we had a glass cup we're gonna go ahead
and<00:04:04.200> put<00:04:04.440> that<00:04:04.470> on<00:04:04.770> these<00:04:05.070> racks<00:04:05.400> these<00:04:06.180> aren't

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
and put that on these racks these aren't

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.120 
and put that on these racks these aren't
as<00:04:06.600> important<00:04:07.080> as<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.290> plastic<00:04:07.500> cups<00:04:07.920> when<00:04:08.040> it

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
as important as the plastic cups when it

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.160 
as important as the plastic cups when it
comes<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.430> placement<00:04:08.910> but<00:04:09.480> they<00:04:09.600> still<00:04:09.870> helps

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
comes to placement but they still helps

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.840 
comes to placement but they still helps
when<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.380> put<00:04:10.560> them<00:04:10.650> in<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:11.430> create<00:04:11.760> space<00:04:12.090> and

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
when you put them in to create space and

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.570 
when you put them in to create space and
efficient<00:04:14.850> izing<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.270> dishwashing<00:04:15.660> process

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
efficient izing the dishwashing process

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.910 
efficient izing the dishwashing process
next<00:04:17.580> comes<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.150> smaller<00:04:18.720> plastic<00:04:19.200> cups<00:04:19.410> now

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
next comes the smaller plastic cups now

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.979 
next comes the smaller plastic cups now
these<00:04:20.220> can<00:04:20.400> be<00:04:20.459> tricky<00:04:20.910> an<00:04:21.450> important<00:04:21.930> thing

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
these can be tricky an important thing

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.360 
these can be tricky an important thing

however<00:06:18.130> we'll<00:06:18.550> pretend<00:06:18.850> this<00:06:18.940> grater<00:06:19.300> is

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
however we'll pretend this grater is

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.140 
however we'll pretend this grater is
bigger<00:06:20.980> than<00:06:21.160> this<00:06:21.280> grater<00:06:21.550> so<00:06:21.760> we're<00:06:22.060> gonna

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
bigger than this grater so we're gonna

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.970 
bigger than this grater so we're gonna
go<00:06:22.300> ahead<00:06:22.510> and<00:06:22.630> put<00:06:22.750> on<00:06:22.870> top<00:06:23.110> here<00:06:23.320> one
