00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.980
 good night good this is the second 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.019
 part d 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.629
 of a video that I started doing about 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.090
 installation of an osmosis to 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.500
 water for human consumption and for a tank 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.300
 Marine 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.119
 on that occasion where he explains the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.630
 I did not even have the installation 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.240
 tds team right now I have it for 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.730
 can measure water inlet output 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.660
 water and exit the stage that I have 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.360
 here 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.730
 Well now I'm going to take advantage of 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.910
 make the measurements and I'm going to show you 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.250
 well first I'm going to measure the water as 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.710
 comes from the key of the key of the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.140
 house which enters the systems for 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.530
 Take out a little water, turn on the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.530
 pdf 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:04.739
 and he 's dialing me 229 230 228 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.060
 approximately 230 ppm but we reach 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.869
 to notice that it's 10 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.860
 that is, the water in my house is 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.789
 too hard 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.120
 yeah good remember now let's throw 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.850
 is water 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.170
 let's get some water out of which 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.170
 it is supposed to be for human consumption 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.200
 let's learn the theresa and measure 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:40.120
 for human consumption is dialing me 495 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.940
 497 490 and 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:48.220
 5 495 parts per million that is to say that 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.540
 for human consumption I need less than 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.040
 100 ppm about 80 50 40 is very good for 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 human consumption 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.460
 it is supposed that here he would not be working 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.260
 in the mussis voice but it's doing 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.850
 enough work because me is 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:08.460
 going down from 227,000 to 400 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.230
 90 ppm yes good 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.030
 let's see then 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.030
 the water that leaves the stage d 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.180
 this is from the tapadita 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.890
 we are a little 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:41.170
 we have the ts 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:48.980
 and he is dialing us 239 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:51.050
 238 237 237 parts per million still 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.300
 after the stage this is not suitable 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.420
 for human consumption much less for 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.650
 rift yes that means then that the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.620
 equipment that I buy in theory does not work 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.950
 it does not work or if it is working 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.590
 but I can not use it to 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.170
 me rif not even for human consumption 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.290
 because my water from my home is 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.379
 too hard yes good then 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.349
 consult this with my seller and I told him 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.140
 well what can I do so that I can 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.420
 use the equipment that you already spend for 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.819
 human consumption or for the rif for not 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.569
 have to sell or not have to throw away 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.629
 the garbage does not one expect to be able to use 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.379
 the investment that he made good because I 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.959
 I asked and he told me he told me that 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:44.620
 he is still the only system that lowers ppm 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.439
 is the good osmosis here in my city 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.640
 we buy equipment myself and a friend who lives 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:53.270
 very close to the house 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.130
 and he told me I told him to lend me your membrane 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.160
 so I said good if you connect a 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.800
 double membrane then it's going to lower me 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.750
 the ppm for both human consumption and 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.730
 for rift and it's as if I had two 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.470
 good equipment 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.990
 in my partner he lent me he lent me his 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.190
 his osmosis membrane together with his 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.190
 membrane holder 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.680
 and good connect it 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.320
 connect it but they think the bomb 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.930
 can not supply yes and if in itself the 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.260
 membrane has a waste outlet of 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.260
 Water 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:34.320
 the second membrane the second membrane 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.300
 connecting only the left water 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.070
 waste and did not reach the low pressure 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.260
 that he left, he could not cross the 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.140
 second membrane and all the water was going to 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.270
 waste therefore it was a practice 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.820
 that was not going to work 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.110
 but good that we believe that I also 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.449
 lent its according to its yes stage then 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.889
 What I did was 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:01.409
 at the exit of my tank connect it to your 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.089
 then I have good stage right now 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.520
 I unplug it but I have some water 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:08.060
 I took out from there 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.529
 connect double stage itself yes this is 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.459
 Water 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.459
 to stay there 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.520
 and contrary to what the 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:21.090
 seller that 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:25.370
 that osmosis was the only one that reduced 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.370
 the ppm I will do the test 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:36.229
 001 depends 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.280
 that is, I can already use my water according to 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:42.500
 me but good if there is an expert in 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.069
 osmosis systems or systems 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.990
 purification that can 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:51.060
 guide me not to discuss guide me in 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.740
 if what I am thinking is correct and 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.870
 I can already use my tank for rift 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.879
 Well, let me know not by 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.070
 of comments here on the channel 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:02.650
 youtube or comments on it 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.820
 in the group on facebook well 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.980
 thank you very much was what I wanted 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.040
 share with you and I hope your 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.040
