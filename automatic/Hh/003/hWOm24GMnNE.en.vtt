00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.450
 yes we now have two dvds in the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.090
 area made training and above all 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.759
 things from youth to seniors 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.759
 area usable complete amateur in 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.150
 youth area by doing the things 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.390
 can apply 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.510
 for me it is very important that the dvds 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.869
 have a certain division so that 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.789
 Let's do the training in different ways 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.359
 divide the third so the normal 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.439
 training work in the first third 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.989
 deal with and always with 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.610
 the prerequisites of the game that 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.790
 is also called warming up with the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.010
 Technique form then in bulk becomes itself 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.719
 that deals with the game forms too 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.620
 gain 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.390
 tactical prerequisites 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.120
 finish individual stories 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.129
 and in the first dvd it's just like that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.989
 made that completely around us 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.320
 The players take care of the prerequisite 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.449
 should have around then the second 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.930
 Part of the workout really good too 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.820
 that means we have ourselves in the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.340
 warm up a lot with ball 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.580
 busy and mindful that the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.290
 prerequisite for the game match and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.760
 We in the amateur area have a problem 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.950
 we just do not have that much time 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.960
 So if you think about every bundesliga 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.689
 profi trains seven units 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.030
 week in the youth performance area already 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.770
 from the c-youth if four 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.500
 workouts in the week off 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.909
 offered plus one to two games on 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.530
 weekend or tournaments in the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.509
 you just have to watch amateur area 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.180
 that one with his little time very much 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.500
 you can get along well at all 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.720
 do not waste time 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.030
 The ball is the central points 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.649
 trainings and we just want to 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.710
 try in our training always 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.460
 to use the ball again and the in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.500
 any task that both at 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.500
 Warmmachen and almost at 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.020
 leak and that's why we try 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.360
 all possibilities to use no time 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.399
 to waste as we said so we with 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.409
 Two or three workouts in the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.210
 week where most trainers still 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.950
 one and a half hours have time too 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.970
 to get along accordingly and they are fine 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.370
 to be able to use 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.530
 and if I run the time with many 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.200
 or endurance power 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.970
 I'm missing training 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.480
 reason reinforcement ingredient namely 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.150
 in the game and that is the performance 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.550
 limiting and the rest comes then 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.980
 Over time and over time and 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.620
 Every coach should be in his head 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.120
 maybe what he is doing on the plan 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.730
 want to reach with his team 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.709
 which way he wants to do that 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.360
 means I have to first this 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.709
 Prerequisites for creating ie the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.350
 Players are basic hand tools 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.570
 give to so that he is the one ball of 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.870
 take ball some ball 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.940
 then gain in the dribbling 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.260
 because not only run with soon that too 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.670
 dribbling is important because then 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.670
 At some point, yes , in every game 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.620
 finally the fight and then comes 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.810
 the matching game and then comes the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.989
 These are the basic form 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.640
 we have that we can easily reach 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.970
 need to make the player better 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.980
 so that when we are eleven on the field 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.920
 We can do that, we can 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.140
 never a big problem but too 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.310
 many players in the field have those with 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.680
 one or the other very strong 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.630
 have problems then we have a big one 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.310
 problem with our entire game 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.200
 then we do not need tactics 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.019
 to think a lot about 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.230
 then I can 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.420
 if I am a 4 4 2 or 4 3 3 game 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.370
 It does not matter if my players are not 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.980
 ball in its technical possibility 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.870
 can take one and we have 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.709
 very strong with the first dvd 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.910
 are concerned and want to be here any amateur 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.530
 and and youth coaches and also seniors 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.140
 trainer in the higher class 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.510
 Amateur area I've been working for since 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.549
 years with this tool and construction 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.250
 try it every week 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.790
 Expand my team easily 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.790
 to do better
