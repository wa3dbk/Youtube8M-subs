hi<00:00:07.870> welcome<00:00:08.710> to<00:00:08.860> another<00:00:09.280> video<00:00:09.640> in<00:00:10.120> my<00:00:10.150> series

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
hi welcome to another video in my series

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.890 
hi welcome to another video in my series
on<00:00:11.139> summing<00:00:11.950> series<00:00:12.430> using<00:00:13.210> Sigma<00:00:13.870> notation

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
on summing series using Sigma notation

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.330 
on summing series using Sigma notation
and<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:16.570> the<00:00:16.960> previous<00:00:17.380> videos<00:00:17.920> in<00:00:18.220> this

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
and in the previous videos in this

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.600 
and in the previous videos in this
series<00:00:18.580> we've<00:00:18.970> looked<00:00:19.270> at<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.930> sum<00:00:20.199> of<00:00:20.440> R<00:00:21.070> and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
series we've looked at the sum of R and

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.140 
series we've looked at the sum of R and
then<00:00:22.090> the<00:00:22.210> sum<00:00:22.480> of<00:00:22.689> R<00:00:22.900> squared<00:00:23.529> and<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.910> this

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
then the sum of R squared and in this

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.200 
then the sum of R squared and in this
one<00:00:25.390> it's<00:00:25.599> the<00:00:25.779> turn<00:00:26.019> of<00:00:26.189> summing<00:00:27.189> terms<00:00:27.880> of

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
one it's the turn of summing terms of

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.050 
one it's the turn of summing terms of
the<00:00:28.330> form<00:00:28.570> R<00:00:28.869> cubed<00:00:29.500> where<00:00:29.830> R<00:00:30.130> goes<00:00:30.400> from<00:00:30.429> 1<00:00:31.029> to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
the form R cubed where R goes from 1 to

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.000 
the form R cubed where R goes from 1 to
N<00:00:31.779> and<00:00:32.970> it<00:00:33.970> can<00:00:34.150> be<00:00:34.210> shown<00:00:34.420> by<00:00:35.010> mathematical

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
N and it can be shown by mathematical

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.380 
N and it can be shown by mathematical
induction<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:38.170> sum<00:00:38.800> of<00:00:38.950> R<00:00:39.160> cubed<00:00:39.580> going

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
induction that the sum of R cubed going

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.930 
induction that the sum of R cubed going
from<00:00:40.600> 1<00:00:40.780> to<00:00:40.810> N<00:00:41.140> is<00:00:41.560> equal<00:00:41.830> to<00:00:42.130> N<00:00:42.400> squared

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
from 1 to N is equal to N squared

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.680 
from 1 to N is equal to N squared
divided<00:00:43.510> by<00:00:43.720> 4<00:00:44.050> or<00:00:44.340> multiplied<00:00:45.340> by<00:00:45.580> n<00:00:45.820> plus<00:00:46.420> 1

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
divided by 4 or multiplied by n plus 1

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.910 
divided by 4 or multiplied by n plus 1
or<00:00:46.960> squared<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.840> if<00:00:50.050> you<00:00:50.170> would<00:00:50.290> like<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.710> see<00:00:50.890> a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
or squared so if you would like to see a

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.550 
or squared so if you would like to see a
proof<00:00:51.190> of<00:00:51.370> this<00:00:51.640> as<00:00:51.970> I<00:00:52.510> say<00:00:52.690> by<00:00:52.900> mathematical

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
proof of this as I say by mathematical

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.190 
proof of this as I say by mathematical
induction<00:00:53.710> just<00:00:54.280> go<00:00:54.430> on<00:00:54.520> my<00:00:54.550> website<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:55.390> look

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
induction just go on my website and look

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.840 
induction just go on my website and look
under<00:00:56.350> mathematical<00:00:57.190> induction<00:00:57.310> in<00:00:57.820> the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
under mathematical induction in the

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.110 
under mathematical induction in the
index<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.680> you'll<00:00:59.680> find<00:01:00.100> as<00:01:00.460> I<00:01:00.520> say<00:01:00.790> a<00:01:00.820> proof

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
index and you'll find as I say a proof

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.359 
index and you'll find as I say a proof
on<00:01:01.360> this<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:04.420> particular<00:01:05.019> video<00:01:05.320> is<00:01:05.770> very

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
on this so this particular video is very

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.880 
on this so this particular video is very
similar<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:06.990> earlier<00:01:07.990> ones<00:01:08.229> in<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.680> series

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
similar to earlier ones in the series

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.000 
similar to earlier ones in the series
only<00:01:09.369> we're<00:01:09.790> dealing<00:01:10.150> with<00:01:10.180> terms<00:01:10.690> in<00:01:11.080> R<00:01:11.620> cubed

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
only we're dealing with terms in R cubed

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.400 
only we're dealing with terms in R cubed
so<00:01:12.670> if<00:01:12.790> you've<00:01:12.910> been<00:01:12.970> watching<00:01:13.600> those<00:01:13.780> you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
so if you've been watching those you

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.130 
so if you've been watching those you
might<00:01:14.560> want<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:14.920> try<00:01:15.580> these<00:01:16.180> three<00:01:16.540> examples

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.710 

okay<00:01:20.140> well<00:01:20.470> welcome<00:01:20.890> back<00:01:21.100> if<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:21.820> did<00:01:22.480> have<00:01:22.690> a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
okay well welcome back if you did have a

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.300 
okay well welcome back if you did have a
go<00:01:22.960> at<00:01:23.110> these<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.590> let's<00:01:23.740> just<00:01:24.010> work<00:01:24.280> through

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
go at these and let's just work through

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.110 
go at these and let's just work through
them<00:01:25.440> for<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.500> first<00:01:26.740> one<00:01:27.040> this<00:01:27.580> is<00:01:27.790> just<00:01:28.000> the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
them for the first one this is just the

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.690 
them for the first one this is just the
basic<00:01:28.570> one<00:01:28.600> just<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.230> get<00:01:29.409> us<00:01:29.560> into<00:01:29.770> what<00:01:30.430> the

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
basic one just to get us into what the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.180 
basic one just to get us into what the
sum<00:01:30.940> of<00:01:30.970> our<00:01:31.240> cubes<00:01:31.600> all<00:01:31.840> about<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:33.070> this

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
sum of our cubes all about and in this

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.940 
sum of our cubes all about and in this
case<00:01:33.460> we're<00:01:33.760> summing<00:01:34.060> R<00:01:34.360> cubed<00:01:34.810> going<00:01:35.500> from<00:01:35.740> R

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
case we're summing R cubed going from R

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.390 
case we're summing R cubed going from R
equals<00:01:36.520> 1<00:01:36.729> so<00:01:37.000> that'd<00:01:37.120> be<00:01:37.150> 1<00:01:37.570> cubed<00:01:38.020> plus<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
equals 1 so that'd be 1 cubed plus and

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.230 
equals 1 so that'd be 1 cubed plus and
then<00:01:39.700> when<00:01:40.030> R<00:01:40.180> is<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.659> be<00:01:41.020> 2<00:01:41.350> cubed<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:42.100> then<00:01:42.880> 3

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
then when R is to be 2 cubed and then 3

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.450 
then when R is to be 2 cubed and then 3
cubed<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.320> on<00:01:44.350> all<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.340> way<00:01:45.370> up<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:46.320> 8

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
cubed and so on all the way up to 8

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.980 
cubed and so on all the way up to 8
cubed<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:49.840> we<00:01:49.960> can<00:01:50.140> just<00:01:50.350> substitute<00:01:50.590> N

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
cubed and then we can just substitute N

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.360 
cubed and then we can just substitute N
equals<00:01:52.990> 8<00:01:53.170> because<00:01:53.530> we've<00:01:53.680> got<00:01:53.830> eight<00:01:53.979> terms

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
equals 8 because we've got eight terms

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.600 
equals 8 because we've got eight terms
here<00:01:54.820> directly<00:01:55.810> into<00:01:55.900> this<00:01:56.290> formula<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:57.010> then

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
here directly into this formula and then

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.600 
here directly into this formula and then
we're<00:01:57.760> going<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.060> get<00:01:58.360> 8<00:01:58.780> squared<00:01:59.440> over<00:02:00.190> 4<00:02:00.870> x<00:02:01.870> 8

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
we're going to get 8 squared over 4 x 8

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.719 
we're going to get 8 squared over 4 x 8
plus<00:02:03.610> 1<00:02:03.729> all<00:02:04.180> squared<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:06.040> if<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:06.280> work<00:02:06.520> this

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
plus 1 all squared and if you work this

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.020 
plus 1 all squared and if you work this
out<00:02:07.000> you'll<00:02:07.720> find<00:02:08.019> that<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.349> get<00:02:10.980> 1296<00:02:12.030> and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
out you'll find that you get 1296 and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.110 
out you'll find that you get 1296 and
you<00:02:13.150> could<00:02:13.360> verify<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:14.049> this<00:02:14.260> formula<00:02:14.769> works

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
you could verify that this formula works

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.030 
you could verify that this formula works
rather<00:02:16.120> than<00:02:16.239> just<00:02:16.450> assuming<00:02:16.779> it<00:02:17.109> does<00:02:17.290> just

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
rather than just assuming it does just

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.110 
rather than just assuming it does just
by<00:02:18.279> checking

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
by checking

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.630 
by checking
at<00:02:19.150> 1<00:02:19.390> q<00:02:19.690> plus<00:02:19.930> 2<00:02:20.080> cubed<00:02:20.500> etc<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:21.310> your

at 1 q plus 2 cubed etc on your

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.000 
at 1 q plus 2 cubed etc on your
calculator<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.629> checking<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.709> does

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
calculator and checking that it does

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.039 
calculator and checking that it does
indeed<00:02:24.400> come<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:25.830> 1296

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
indeed come to 1296

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.360 
indeed come to 1296
okay<00:02:29.049> well<00:02:29.200> that's<00:02:29.290> number<00:02:29.530> one<00:02:29.860> very<00:02:30.129> basic

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
okay well that's number one very basic

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.830 
okay well that's number one very basic
question<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.390> pick<00:02:32.110> number<00:02:32.530> two<00:02:33.180> because<00:02:34.180> in

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
question I pick number two because in

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.740 
question I pick number two because in
this<00:02:35.140> example<00:02:35.590> we're<00:02:36.010> going<00:02:36.370> from<00:02:36.909> R<00:02:37.269> equals

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
this example we're going from R equals

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.520 
this example we're going from R equals
one<00:02:37.959> not<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.799> end<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.370> two<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:40.390> n<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:41.019> begin

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
one not to end but two to n to begin

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.569 
one not to end but two to n to begin
here<00:02:41.950> okay

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
here okay

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.559 
here okay
and<00:02:43.230> we're<00:02:44.230> also<00:02:44.530> summing<00:02:45.280> not<00:02:45.730> just<00:02:46.000> our<00:02:46.209> cube

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
and we're also summing not just our cube

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.789 
and we're also summing not just our cube
but<00:02:46.930> five<00:02:47.799> R<00:02:48.129> cubed<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.700> constant<00:02:49.390> times<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.409> R

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
but five R cubed a constant times the R

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.119 
but five R cubed a constant times the R
cubed<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.420> whenever<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.840> get<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.049> constant<00:02:53.859> in

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
cubed so whenever you get a constant in

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.110 
cubed so whenever you get a constant in
front<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.879> a<00:02:55.090> value<00:02:56.019> of<00:02:56.140> R<00:02:56.319> like<00:02:56.620> this<00:02:56.920> we<00:02:57.549> have

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
front of a value of R like this we have

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.180 
front of a value of R like this we have
seen<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:58.720> past<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.260> what<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.560> can<00:02:59.769> do<00:02:59.950> is

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
seen in the past that what you can do is

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.990 
seen in the past that what you can do is
pull<00:03:00.489> that<00:03:00.670> constant<00:03:00.989> out<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.519> in<00:03:03.519> front<00:03:03.700> of

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
pull that constant out of in front of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.349 
pull that constant out of in front of
the<00:03:04.209> Sigma<00:03:04.989> sign<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:06.190> we've<00:03:06.430> got<00:03:06.670> five<00:03:06.970> times

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
the Sigma sign so we've got five times

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.330 
the Sigma sign so we've got five times
the<00:03:07.750> sum<00:03:08.019> of<00:03:08.290> R<00:03:08.769> cubed<00:03:09.450> where<00:03:10.450> R<00:03:10.810> goes<00:03:11.440> from<00:03:11.470> one

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
the sum of R cubed where R goes from one

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.720 
the sum of R cubed where R goes from one
but<00:03:12.909> not<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.329> end<00:03:13.569> this<00:03:13.989> time<00:03:14.349> but<00:03:14.650> two<00:03:14.980> to

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
but not to end this time but two to

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.550 
but not to end this time but two to
begin<00:03:17.280> but<00:03:18.280> all<00:03:18.579> that<00:03:19.180> changes<00:03:19.810> really<00:03:20.319> is

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
begin but all that changes really is

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.339 
begin but all that changes really is
that<00:03:21.099> it's<00:03:21.250> going<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.579> be<00:03:21.700> five<00:03:22.090> times<00:03:22.599> the

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
that it's going to be five times the

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.000 
that it's going to be five times the
result<00:03:23.829> that<00:03:24.099> we<00:03:24.280> get<00:03:24.579> when<00:03:25.299> we<00:03:25.569> substitute<00:03:26.139> in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
result that we get when we substitute in

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.770 
result that we get when we substitute in
place<00:03:27.069> of<00:03:27.609> n<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:29.290> n<00:03:29.669> okay<00:03:30.669> so<00:03:30.730> we've<00:03:31.209> got<00:03:31.239> five

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
place of n to n okay so we've got five

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.110 
place of n to n okay so we've got five
times<00:03:32.579> 2n<00:03:33.579> all<00:03:34.169> squared<00:03:35.340> divided<00:03:36.340> by<00:03:36.370> 4<00:03:36.879> and

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
times 2n all squared divided by 4 and

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.909 
times 2n all squared divided by 4 and
that's<00:03:37.989> multiplied<00:03:38.739> by<00:03:39.129> 2<00:03:39.910> n<00:03:40.090> plus<00:03:41.079> 1<00:03:41.200> all

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
that's multiplied by 2 n plus 1 all

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.369 
that's multiplied by 2 n plus 1 all
squared

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
squared

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.490 
squared
well<00:03:44.379> 2n<00:03:44.889> all<00:03:45.160> squared<00:03:45.790> is<00:03:46.000> 4n<00:03:46.750> squared<00:03:46.989> and

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
well 2n all squared is 4n squared and

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.319 
well 2n all squared is 4n squared and
you<00:03:47.709> could<00:03:47.859> divide<00:03:48.160> by<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.430> force<00:03:48.879> that<00:03:49.120> just

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
you could divide by the force that just

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.559 
you could divide by the force that just
leaves<00:03:49.629> you<00:03:49.900> with<00:03:50.109> N<00:03:50.349> squared<00:03:51.160> there<00:03:51.489> so<00:03:52.209> 5

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
leaves you with N squared there so 5

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.379 
leaves you with N squared there so 5
times<00:03:53.470> N<00:03:53.919> squared<00:03:55.410> multiplied<00:03:56.410> by<00:03:56.440> 2<00:03:57.370> n<00:03:57.609> plus<00:03:58.269> 1

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
times N squared multiplied by 2 n plus 1

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.680 
times N squared multiplied by 2 n plus 1
all<00:03:58.840> squared<00:03:59.609> and<00:04:00.609> I'd<00:04:00.730> leave<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.000> like<00:04:01.329> that

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
all squared and I'd leave it like that

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:10.409 
all squared and I'd leave it like that
ok<00:04:03.660> now<00:04:05.250> example<00:04:06.250> 3<00:04:07.379> what<00:04:08.379> I've<00:04:08.500> got<00:04:08.709> here<00:04:09.250> is<00:04:09.430> a

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
ok now example 3 what I've got here is a

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.430 
ok now example 3 what I've got here is a
series<00:04:11.319> then<00:04:11.829> which<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:12.849> based<00:04:13.209> around<00:04:13.449> the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
series then which is based around the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.400 
series then which is based around the
sum<00:04:14.739> of<00:04:14.980> R<00:04:15.400> cubed<00:04:15.970> because<00:04:16.479> what<00:04:16.720> we've<00:04:16.959> got

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
sum of R cubed because what we've got

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.740 
sum of R cubed because what we've got
here<00:04:17.829> is<00:04:17.979> essentially<00:04:18.699> a<00:04:19.060> common<00:04:19.750> factor<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.289> 3

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
here is essentially a common factor of 3

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.550 
here is essentially a common factor of 3
multiplying<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:23.080> sum<00:04:23.349> of<00:04:23.699> R<00:04:24.699> cubed<00:04:25.449> where<00:04:26.289> R

multiplying the sum of R cubed where R
goes<00:04:27.550> from<00:04:27.580> not<00:04:28.570> one<00:04:28.840> but<00:04:29.530> from<00:04:29.890> five<00:04:30.520> for<00:04:31.090> the

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
goes from not one but from five for the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.260 
goes from not one but from five for the
first<00:04:31.210> term<00:04:31.750> all<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.229> way<00:04:32.740> up

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
first term all the way up

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.610 
first term all the way up
2:10<00:04:34.270> for<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.900> last<00:04:35.140> term<00:04:37.230> so<00:04:38.230> to<00:04:38.290> do

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
2:10 for the last term so to do

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.890 
2:10 for the last term so to do
something<00:04:38.980> like<00:04:39.130> this<00:04:39.370> when<00:04:39.670> our<00:04:39.970> doesn't

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
something like this when our doesn't

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.870 
something like this when our doesn't
start<00:04:41.170> from<00:04:41.350> one<00:04:41.650> as<00:04:41.860> we've<00:04:42.010> mentioned<00:04:42.190> in<00:04:42.640> the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
start from one as we've mentioned in the

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.510 
start from one as we've mentioned in the
earlier<00:04:43.360> tutorials<00:04:43.960> in<00:04:44.140> this<00:04:44.260> series<00:04:44.320> all<00:04:45.040> you

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
earlier tutorials in this series all you

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.690 
earlier tutorials in this series all you
need<00:04:45.730> to<00:04:45.880> do<00:04:46.120> is<00:04:46.680> first<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.860> all<00:04:48.010> think<00:04:48.520> about

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
need to do is first of all think about

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.860 
need to do is first of all think about
the<00:04:49.120> summation<00:04:49.420> of<00:04:50.110> R<00:04:51.100> cubed<00:04:51.670> in<00:04:52.360> this<00:04:52.600> case

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
the summation of R cubed in this case

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.280 
the summation of R cubed in this case
going<00:04:53.380> from<00:04:53.650> R<00:04:53.890> equals<00:04:54.640> 1<00:04:54.880> all<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.720> way<00:04:55.750> up<00:04:55.870> to

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
going from R equals 1 all the way up to

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.940 
going from R equals 1 all the way up to
10<00:04:56.790> but<00:04:57.790> then<00:04:57.940> you<00:04:58.150> need<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.480> subtract<00:04:59.140> 3<00:04:59.620> times

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
10 but then you need to subtract 3 times

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.780 
10 but then you need to subtract 3 times
the<00:05:00.310> summation<00:05:00.550> of<00:05:01.240> R<00:05:01.660> cubed<00:05:02.280> going<00:05:03.280> from<00:05:03.550> R

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
the summation of R cubed going from R

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.710 
the summation of R cubed going from R
equals<00:05:04.450> 1<00:05:04.810> up<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.400> one<00:05:06.580> before<00:05:07.030> this<00:05:07.390> term

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
equals 1 up to the one before this term

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.380 
equals 1 up to the one before this term
in<00:05:08.110> other<00:05:08.410> words<00:05:08.680> up<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.490> n<00:05:10.230> equaling<00:05:11.230> 4<00:05:12.180> all<00:05:13.180> we

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
in other words up to n equaling 4 all we

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.450 
in other words up to n equaling 4 all we
need<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.600> do<00:05:13.840> now<00:05:14.080> is<00:05:14.350> just<00:05:14.800> work<00:05:15.040> out<00:05:15.280> what

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
need to do now is just work out what

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.370 
need to do now is just work out what
each<00:05:15.580> of<00:05:15.610> these<00:05:15.850> are<00:05:16.150> so<00:05:16.630> for<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:16.930> first<00:05:17.110> one

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
each of these are so for the first one

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.460 
each of these are so for the first one
we've<00:05:17.620> got<00:05:17.650> three<00:05:18.220> times<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:19.060> then<00:05:19.750> we're

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
we've got three times and then we're

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.150 
we've got three times and then we're
doing<00:05:20.950> some<00:05:21.220> of<00:05:21.340> our<00:05:21.490> cubed<00:05:21.880> where<00:05:22.600> n<00:05:22.870> is<00:05:22.930> 10<00:05:23.500> so

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
doing some of our cubed where n is 10 so

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.140 
doing some of our cubed where n is 10 so
it's<00:05:24.340> going<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:24.820> be<00:05:25.000> 3<00:05:25.750> times<00:05:26.020> 10<00:05:26.800> squared<00:05:27.160> over

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
it's going to be 3 times 10 squared over

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.210 
it's going to be 3 times 10 squared over
4<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:28.750> then<00:05:29.910> multiplied<00:05:30.910> by<00:05:30.940> 10<00:05:31.810> plus<00:05:32.080> 1<00:05:32.350> all

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
4 and then multiplied by 10 plus 1 all

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.940 
4 and then multiplied by 10 plus 1 all
squared<00:05:33.280> and<00:05:34.120> then<00:05:34.690> for<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:34.990> second<00:05:35.470> term<00:05:35.500> it

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
squared and then for the second term it

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.910 
squared and then for the second term it
will<00:05:36.040> be<00:05:36.160> minus<00:05:36.580> 3<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:38.050> in<00:05:38.530> this<00:05:38.680> example

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
will be minus 3 and and in this example

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.420 
will be minus 3 and and in this example
is<00:05:39.580> 4<00:05:40.090> so<00:05:40.450> it's<00:05:40.630> going<00:05:40.870> to<00:05:40.960> be<00:05:41.080> 3<00:05:41.380> times<00:05:41.710> 4

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
is 4 so it's going to be 3 times 4

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.320 
is 4 so it's going to be 3 times 4
squared<00:05:42.910> all<00:05:43.390> over<00:05:43.450> 4<00:05:44.400> multiplied<00:05:45.400> by<00:05:45.610> n<00:05:45.850> plus

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
squared all over 4 multiplied by n plus

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.880 
squared all over 4 multiplied by n plus
1<00:05:46.660> or<00:05:46.900> 4<00:05:47.410> plus<00:05:47.680> 1<00:05:47.920> or<00:05:48.160> squared<00:05:49.530> and<00:05:50.530> if<00:05:50.650> you<00:05:50.680> work

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
1 or 4 plus 1 or squared and if you work

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.280 
1 or 4 plus 1 or squared and if you work
this<00:05:51.070> out<00:05:51.310> you'll<00:05:52.000> find<00:05:52.330> that<00:05:52.570> you<00:05:52.750> end<00:05:53.020> up

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
this out you'll find that you end up

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.760 
this out you'll find that you end up
with

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.200 

8775

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
8775

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.440 
8775
and<00:05:58.210> again<00:05:58.570> you<00:05:58.780> could<00:05:59.050> verify<00:05:59.410> that<00:05:59.919> this<00:06:00.100> is

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
and again you could verify that this is

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.470 
and again you could verify that this is
correct<00:06:01.830> because<00:06:02.830> you<00:06:03.370> haven't<00:06:03.790> got<00:06:03.970> too<00:06:04.240> many

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
correct because you haven't got too many

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.650 
correct because you haven't got too many
terms<00:06:04.810> here<00:06:05.260> so<00:06:05.440> you<00:06:05.919> could<00:06:06.370> easily<00:06:06.730> just<00:06:07.090> type

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
terms here so you could easily just type

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.010 
terms here so you could easily just type
this<00:06:07.870> into<00:06:08.140> your<00:06:08.380> calculator<00:06:08.590> and<00:06:09.660> as<00:06:10.660> I<00:06:10.810> say

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
this into your calculator and as I say

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.920 
this into your calculator and as I say
check<00:06:11.500> that<00:06:11.650> you<00:06:11.740> get<00:06:11.919> that<00:06:12.130> answer<00:06:12.760> but<00:06:13.690> this

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
check that you get that answer but this

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.830 
check that you get that answer but this
method<00:06:14.230> really<00:06:14.680> is<00:06:15.070> designed<00:06:15.669> for<00:06:16.180> whenever

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
method really is designed for whenever

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.070 
method really is designed for whenever
you've<00:06:17.290> got<00:06:17.320> a<00:06:17.919> lot<00:06:18.700> of<00:06:18.730> terms<00:06:19.180> here<00:06:19.450> where

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
you've got a lot of terms here where

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.480 
you've got a lot of terms here where
it's<00:06:20.200> going<00:06:20.410> to<00:06:20.530> be<00:06:20.620> totally<00:06:21.040> inefficient

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
it's going to be totally inefficient

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.280 
it's going to be totally inefficient
just<00:06:21.910> to<00:06:22.030> type<00:06:22.270> this<00:06:22.480> directly<00:06:22.990> into<00:06:23.260> your

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
just to type this directly into your

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.950 
just to type this directly into your
calculator<00:06:24.010> all<00:06:24.850> right<00:06:25.030> so<00:06:25.270> this<00:06:25.419> just<00:06:25.750> shows

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
calculator all right so this just shows

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.530 
calculator all right so this just shows
you<00:06:26.290> basically<00:06:27.070> the<00:06:27.220> principle<00:06:28.000> that's

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
you basically the principle that's

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.560 
you basically the principle that's
involved<00:06:29.970> well<00:06:30.970> I<00:06:31.000> hope<00:06:31.180> that's<00:06:31.360> been<00:06:31.510> useful

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
involved well I hope that's been useful

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.680 
involved well I hope that's been useful
to<00:06:31.990> you<00:06:32.200> and<00:06:32.650> in<00:06:33.580> the<00:06:33.850> next<00:06:34.180> video<00:06:34.330> in<00:06:34.600> this

to you and in the next video in this

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.540 
to you and in the next video in this
series<00:06:34.750> what<00:06:35.320> I'm<00:06:35.410> going<00:06:35.710> to<00:06:35.860> be<00:06:35.980> doing<00:06:36.220> is

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
series what I'm going to be doing is

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.460 
series what I'm going to be doing is
combining<00:06:37.200> all<00:06:38.200> the<00:06:38.590> series<00:06:39.460> that<00:06:39.910> we've<00:06:40.470> used

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
combining all the series that we've used

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.500 
combining all the series that we've used
so<00:06:41.800> far<00:06:42.130> that<00:06:42.640> is<00:06:42.820> Sigma

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
so far that is Sigma

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.050 
so far that is Sigma
our<00:06:43.630> Sigma<00:06:44.350> R<00:06:44.590> squared<00:06:45.010> and<00:06:45.130> Sigma<00:06:45.520> R<00:06:45.700> cubed

our Sigma R squared and Sigma R cubed

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.780 
our Sigma R squared and Sigma R cubed
and<00:06:46.600> also<00:06:47.260> sum<00:06:47.560> of<00:06:47.680> a<00:06:47.770> constant<00:06:47.800> we're<00:06:48.580> going

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:48.790 
and also sum of a constant we're going

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.510 
and also sum of a constant we're going
to<00:06:48.910> be<00:06:49.000> looking<00:06:49.360> at<00:06:49.480> combining<00:06:49.690> those<00:06:50.200> in<00:06:50.530> one

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
to be looking at combining those in one

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.980 
to be looking at combining those in one
particular<00:06:52.440> summation<00:06:53.440> all<00:06:54.220> right<00:06:54.490> so<00:06:54.970> I<00:06:55.300> hope

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
particular summation all right so I hope

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.300 
particular summation all right so I hope
you<00:06:56.140> all<00:06:56.230> have<00:06:56.440> a<00:06:56.470> look<00:06:56.680> at<00:06:56.770> that<00:06:56.890> if<00:06:57.130> you

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
you all have a look at that if you

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:10.600 
you all have a look at that if you
especially<00:06:57.940> if<00:06:58.150> you<00:06:58.240> found<00:06:58.480> this<00:06:58.720> one<00:06:59.020> of<00:06:59.310> yous
