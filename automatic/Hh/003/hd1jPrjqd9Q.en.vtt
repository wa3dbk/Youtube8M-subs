structure<00:00:24.860> and<00:00:24.980> shifting<00:00:25.460> maybe<00:00:25.610> a<00:00:25.700> little

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
structure and shifting maybe a little

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.580 
structure and shifting maybe a little
bit<00:00:25.939> of<00:00:26.000> homework<00:00:26.210> all<00:00:26.960> this<00:00:27.110> is<00:00:27.169> going<00:00:27.500> to

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
bit of homework all this is going to

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.260 
bit of homework all this is going to
keep<00:00:27.740> all<00:00:27.980> of<00:00:28.009> my<00:00:28.130> movements<00:00:28.640> going<00:00:28.730> forward

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
keep all of my movements going forward

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.780 
keep all of my movements going forward
into<00:00:29.419> his<00:00:29.540> core<00:00:29.840> I'll<00:00:30.349> explain<00:00:30.410> as<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:30.890> go<00:00:31.099> we're

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.590 

force<00:01:49.970> him<00:01:51.700> beyond<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.790> defense<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:56.270> we<00:01:56.420> took

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
force him beyond the defense so we took

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.570 
force him beyond the defense so we took
always<00:01:57.080> forwarding<00:01:57.500> energy<00:01:57.830> was<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.460> one

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
always forwarding energy was the one

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.770 
always forwarding energy was the one
thing<00:01:58.700> we're<00:01:58.850> looking<00:01:58.880> at<00:01:59.180> is<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.450> every<00:01:59.659> one

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
thing we're looking at is and every one

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.120 
thing we're looking at is and every one
of<00:01:59.869> your<00:01:59.960> techniques<00:02:00.380> are<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.920> doing

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
of your techniques are you doing

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.440 
of your techniques are you doing
forwarding<00:02:01.460> energy<00:02:01.729> when<00:02:01.940> you're<00:02:02.090> doing<00:02:02.330> that

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
forwarding energy when you're doing that

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.050 
forwarding energy when you're doing that
sochi<00:02:03.050> sounds<00:02:03.290> not<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.590> much<00:02:04.010> about<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.910> whole

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
sochi sounds not so much about the whole

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.510 
sochi sounds not so much about the whole
game<00:02:05.300> of<00:02:05.570> standing<00:02:06.380> here<00:02:06.530> taking<00:02:06.920> energy<00:02:07.100> it's

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
game of standing here taking energy it's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.279 
game of standing here taking energy it's
great<00:02:07.850> yeah<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.450> want<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.810> find<00:02:09.050> all<00:02:09.200> these

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
great yeah I want to find all these

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.779 
great yeah I want to find all these
movements<00:02:09.590> here<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.340> don't<00:02:10.490> have<00:02:10.580> full

movements here you don't have full

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.980 
movements here you don't have full
working<00:02:11.000> structure<00:02:11.240> behind<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.780> don't

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
working structure behind that you don't

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.780 
working structure behind that you don't
have<00:02:12.110> anything<00:02:12.290> remember<00:02:13.040> cheese<00:02:13.430> sauce<00:02:13.580> all
