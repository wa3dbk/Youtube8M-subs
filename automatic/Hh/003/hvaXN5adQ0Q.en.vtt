00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
here is reaching pump industry they

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.490 
here is reaching pump industry they
learned<00:01:57.070> about<00:01:57.189> Kathleen<00:01:57.880> because<00:01:58.390> all<00:01:59.079> the

learned about Kathleen because all the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.499 
learned about Kathleen because all the
entities<00:01:59.710> are<00:02:00.130> very<00:02:00.549> complicated

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
entities are very complicated

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.980 
entities are very complicated
the<00:02:01.960> work<00:02:02.170> was<00:02:02.939> difficult<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.390> intricate

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
the work was difficult to intricate

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.820 
the work was difficult to intricate
every<00:02:05.829> marks<00:02:06.459> the<00:02:07.030> rhythm<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.929> timing<00:02:08.289> the

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
every marks the rhythm and timing the

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.100 
every marks the rhythm and timing the
group<00:02:09.129> everything<00:02:09.789> changes<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.750> requires

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
group everything changes so it requires

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.589 
group everything changes so it requires
a<00:02:11.319> lot<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.500> energy<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.280> answer<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:13.390> is

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
a lot of energy of the answer this is

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.170 
a lot of energy of the answer this is
actually<00:02:13.959> just<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.470> routine<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.640> not<00:02:15.849> a<00:02:15.879> hurry

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
actually just a routine it's not a hurry

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.949 
actually just a routine it's not a hurry
up

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
up

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.830 
up
so<00:02:17.440> these<00:02:17.769> part<00:02:18.190> answers<00:02:18.640> have<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.629> sit

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
so these part answers have to just sit

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.540 
so these part answers have to just sit
better

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
better

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.380 
better
and<00:02:20.780> during<00:02:21.780> class<00:02:21.990> can<00:02:22.500> see<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:24.000> each<00:02:24.120> other

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.480 
and during class can see that each other
it's<00:02:25.290> very<00:02:25.350> difficult<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.070> makes<00:02:26.220> them<00:02:26.460> very

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490
