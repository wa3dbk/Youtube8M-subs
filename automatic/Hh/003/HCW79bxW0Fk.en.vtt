00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.710
Is it a bird?

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.340
Is it a plane?

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.960
Is it superman?

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.300
No! It’s a mosquito getting ready to feast
on your delicious blood.

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.579
Summer is the time that insects come out to
play.

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.820
From the bite-ey, stab-ey mosquitos and wasps,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.689
to the useful bees and ladybugs,

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.900
to the downright weird dragonfly.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.710
But why is it that insects seem to like

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.839
summer just as much as us?

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.699
Insects are poikilotherms.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.910
That means that their internal temperature

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.890
can vary hugely depending on

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.059
what’s going on outside around them.

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.520
In this way they are actually the opposite
to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.820
humans who are homeotherms.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.980
That means we keep our internal
temperatures nearly constant

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.739
and aren’t that fussed about
external temperatures.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.129
Biological processes are
temperature dependant,

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.510
which means that insects rely heavily
on the environment for both their development

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.059
and their behaviour.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.609
With increasing ambient temperature,
insects see an increase in development,

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.719
locomotion, population growth and metabolism.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.340
Basically the insects get
fitter and fitter… until they die.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.550
At very high temperatures insects die
because they basically just dry out.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.370
The lipids that retain moisture in insect
bodies start melting at higher temperatures.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.040
This combined with the fact that
water evaporation rates increase

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.740
with increasing temperatures as well,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.750
means that there is a point
where insects lose water faster

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.140
than they can take it on.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.100
On the flip side of this -
if the temperatures go too low

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.960
the biochemical processes in the body
don’t have enough energy to proceed.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.990
So insects either die
or enter a form of hibernation.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.310
So while all insects benefit from
warmer temperatures,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.530
there are some that have a…
peculiar reaction to summer weather.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.300
Butterflies for example can’t even
fly if it’s not hot enough.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.240
They have an optimal flight temperature
of between 35C and 39C at which they can lift off.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.370
If it’s not quite as hot outside they can
wiggle

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.150
their bodies to generate the rest of the heat
needed.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.540
This is because flight is a very expensive
form of energy consumption.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.959
It’s a bit like a jet plane.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.620
The wing muscles of the butterfly
need a steady supply of energy.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.769
In that fuel supply system,
if any part isn’t at the right temperature,

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.569
then the whole system won’t work.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.120
One of the more unusual direct effects of
temperature on insects can be seen in crickets.

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.090
Now, male crickets chirp to attract a mate.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.569
But their chirping is so closely linked to
ambient

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.170
temperature that in fact they’ve been called
nature’s thermometers.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.310
The exact chirping rate differs between species

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.569
but as a rule of thumb you can roughly calculate
the temperature in Celsius

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.280
by counting the number of chirps
in eight seconds and adding five.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.780
Just as the male’s chirping
is affected by temperature,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.680
a female’s preference for chirping
is affected by temperature too.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.660
Basically, the warmer the female cricket gets,
the faster she wants the chirping song to be.

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.959
Summer also brings something
that you don’t automatically connect with

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.379
insects -
a nice boozy drink in the sun.

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.969
Turns out some insects are just as
affected by alcohol as we humans are.

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.579
Wasps that feed on fermenting fruit are
known to get drunk and aggressive,

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.090
attacking many a garden lover or picnic aficionado.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.329
And drunken honey bees have been
observed spending a really, really long time

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.180
grooming themselves.
And loitering.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.849
And even in some cases drunkenly falling over.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.260
There are however other insects that
deliberately get drunk to get rid of parasites.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.069
A study has found that fruitflies infested
with wasps

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.209
seek out alcohol containing fruit as a form
of medication.

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.540
Essentially they are trying to
outdrink the wasps because of the

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.930
different rates at which alcohol becomes toxic
to them.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.099
But what protects flies against wasps
won’t protect you against mosquitoes.

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.060
Because one study found that drinking alcohol
actually makes you more attractive

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.010
to blood sucking parasites like mosquitoes.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.059
It might just be time to put down that lager
and have a pint of H2O instead.
