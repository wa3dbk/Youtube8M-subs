00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.130
 hello i am six years old and this is it this laserjet pro is talking about rpm 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.130
 175 and w 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:18.989
 in the reader's box are pulp under the köhler that has pmt 175 mb i 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.249
 naturally find it the printer itself 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.019
 a plus bk sphere 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.169
 supplying with such a cable also becomes a driver with software 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.169
 manual and a warranty papers 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.240
 if it comes to these 600 collen and sp and 175 and you know what closer look 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 we see this on top of the automatic dortmund 4 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.659
 with more compier conductors 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.540
 below the out for laren 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.670
 if they open this club the space where you can remove pepe jeans 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.060
 This little flippie ensures that if you have paper binding that the scanner knows 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.580
 that you had to use the doctor away so make sure you do not 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.980
 is missing 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.490
 if we call this the club 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.690
 to unlock 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.140
 and who can scan it surface with a module next to it 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.140
 for the a30 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.850
 then we have below 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.550
 and from front loader with natural weather 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.550
 a paper sounds such peer does not fall out 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.600
 if they do this club up because then we have 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.820
 set the tone 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.970
 this case black 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.270
 if you need a different color 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.240
 you can do this by pressing these buttons on the control panel 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.580
 being able to litigate 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.280
 and then you can replace the desired color 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.160
 there is another display on the left bullshit 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.640
 and then we have various assertions here 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.150
 underneath 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.360
 a panel to serve the copier 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.250
 and the stuff can also go up at least if sprinter is low of course 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.370
 easy to operate from above 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.290
 below we have the output tray with the paper guides in it 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.770
 a tap off switch and if this club is up here then 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.590
 Then we find below the pressure in the 10 kilometers at the back on TV too 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.749
 we see a plus b connection here 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.529
 a chain with sports 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.479
 one for the sport 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.389
 who sit in the lake with a panel like ours 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.389
 opens a flap so that you can remove pepe jeans 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.709
 and here all the way on the inside and another unless it continues to place a bid 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:31.389
 for the reader of the choir and for a five-setter and w for the first time in 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.109
 To use it is actually all you have to do is the UV B cable 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.109
 to put in your computer 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.239
 because very smart on the screen 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.499
 because place for driving 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:50.180
 and with it you can change the software 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.209
 four points is an honor to stop is for the first on the printer 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.469
 the prints installed is the pointed pointer's software to watch out for 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.439
 You can also put them directly on the hot snacks for example 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.049
 also directly indicate in the installation I can now do a heavy job points 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:05.820
 todenden 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.309
 we will also do wintour I have here the new record from mark wotte man 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.529
 and we are going to print it 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.529
 comes a pre enter 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.030
 that it is also printed on a screen document 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.030
 and the pinte will immediately start warming up 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.379
 and now it is printed see the result here 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:30.999
 and this willeke then go 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:32.269
 to copy 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.059
 with the copy function 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:35.459
 berchem on the 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.949
 glass plate 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.120
 and then we can here 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.219
 to indicate 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.059
 how many copies want 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.109
 much light or dark had to contrast 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.989
 the copy menu black and white or color copy in case the complainant has a black and white 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:48.999
 yeah 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:50.709
 youtube top black 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.169
 the boards that start with scanner and only then come to work against 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.169
 if copied 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.579
 here we see a black and white copy 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:04.980
 and here of course 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.789
 the original 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:09.889
 these two I would like the arias 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.349
 go use 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.109
 explains 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.069
 blaman on top with the text up 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.649
 And now it will be you can also find a down side that records the blades 

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.389
 upstairs it is also pressed 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.860
 so if I'm up now 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.309
 copy press 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:27.909
 then you see that he leaves bf 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.909
 is going to use 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.180
 and here we see 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.909
 the copied documents 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:48.059
 and here lie then 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:49.919
 the original on top 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.689
 of course you can also scan after a nice kball ball kyi mail 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:55.509
 or to the computer 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.069
 most z100 collen and 105 ndr transmitter is of course a real document 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:00.660
 to print 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.050
 and I will now also show that I will suffer from the first ten days 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.620
 print out the manual 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.450
 a little 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.999
 can see how you do that 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.539
 he is the one who controls the pinte on the pin the sea bar document is printed 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.520
 now he is warming up again and of course they would come out with that 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.090
 riyad the women throw the pages outside one another 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.930
 considering the earlier two pages in black and white that also makes him a tumor 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.250
 eneco tour wants to know the club then it is a bit slower but you can see it 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.330
 for example in the hp also just beautiful blue 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.250
 the colors are beautiful deep colors its boss for sure for documents 4 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.599
 of course again 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.629
 also hapoel is recognized by and won the five-setter and w supports i will too 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:51.889
 just show it 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.860
 out of selected winter it appears readers 100 köhler 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.029
 all copy one in this case 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:01.090
 and now it's his earth 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.520
 control the printer and, in addition, intend to display it on the display 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.900
 document 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.900
 printed 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.490
 and I seen here was printed the result 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.610
 which comes directly from 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.370
 In addition, it is also possible to use HP type and and you can go to 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.430
 a team and address 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.150
 the 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.780
 bring documents that is to the printer the romans that wants to mean points 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.569
 then come that bale you then also put the world out of the printer 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.539
 it's a shame he doesn't automatically print double-sided 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.200
 like someone, he can make up to 20,000 prints per month 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.880
 it is compact, multi-functional, easy to use and ball 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.880
 from a good points also not a good copier 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:54.349
 are you looking for a workhorse of a printer considering we are definitely one 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:07:00.339
 stack laserjet pro 100 and 175 and w do you want this you can order gadea pinte
