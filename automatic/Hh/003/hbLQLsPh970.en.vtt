00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.870
 Hello everyone, today we'll see how 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.730
 make the Apulian taralli i 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.800
 tarallucci are also called 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.929
 teheran the colleagues the savory version 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.190
 because a version is also made 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.439
 sweet good while I never hands of a 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.400
 palio I go to the show my recipe e 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.400
 the ingredients we need 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:38.980
 500 g of flour 150 ml of oil 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:45.120
 extra virgin olive oil 150 ml of wine 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.120
 dry white is a teaspoon of salt 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.370
 pour the flour into a bowl 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:13.240
 add the salt and pour the oil e 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:33.110
 we begin to knead later 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:36.069
 we'll add the wine now 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.069
 add the wine 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.190
 once all the ingredients come 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.500
 they are kneaded homogeneously 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.420
 we cover with a cloth and leave 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.630
 rest for an hour at a temperature 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.630
 environment 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.910
 after our pasta has rested 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.549
 we pick up pieces 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.030
 let's start making strips 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.299
 you can do it the size you want 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.950
 the important thing is that everyone is very much 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.700
 similar because if not when we go to 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.650
 cook them someone will be left more raw 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.959
 someone more cooked someone will burn 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.060
 someone will remain white then the thing 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.480
 it will be important to make them more or less all 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.480
 equal 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:12.040
 we take a price like this more or less than 8 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:14.849
 10 cm thick one centimeter and 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.849
 half a centimeter 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.400
 we take to unite the extremes doing 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.659
 a little pressure in this way 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.269
 we have created the tarallo we will do so 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:32.440
 with all the dough in the position 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:35.440
 all on a towel when done 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.859
 taralli we will go in the days in the water 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.859
 boiling 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.689
 I have finished giving the taralli shape 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.750
 we're going to soak in boiling water 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:09.010
 in this way 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.010
 when they come to the surface 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:21.169
 it will mean that they are ready then there 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:24.530
 we remove and put them to dry though 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.190
 at least a couple of hours and then we'll go to 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.190
 inform them 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:49.450
 with a skimmer and we collect and there 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.690
 let's dry again on a 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.690
 canvas 

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:08.439
 after about three hours our horses there 

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:12.189
 they will be annoyed as you can see but 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:16.509
 so let's put them in the oven for about 20 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:21.689
 25 minutes we will set by color in 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:21.689
 oven at 180 degrees in a preheated oven 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.330
 and after 25 minutes our taralli are 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.330
 ready 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.210
 well once they have cooled down 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.509
 we can eat safely 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.150
 I recommend eating there like 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.530
 aperitif accompanied by a good 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.229
 glass of fresh beer 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:59.909
 naturally made by you following 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:02.159
 the recipe found on my site 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:04.620
 well I eat a couple more and there 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:07.319
 we all see the next one for the idea 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.469
 is the recipe we thank cristina hello 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.469
