00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.599
 and because this is a video, everything happened as 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.509
 draw to the minimum and I had asked 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.000
 many times a step was taken 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.550
 step and then if you want to explain in the 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.150
 video that yes that is very 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.230
 quickly 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.699
 Well, I'm going to see them 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.699
 so they know how 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.370
 Y 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.610
 well here in the beginning the first thing that 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.140
 I did 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.140
 It is a circle 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.280
 that is, you do not see much x from 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:56.950
 circle the rectangle more so they are 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.950
 the basic figures to do the minimum 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.900
 after that I made the legs down 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.780
 from half of him 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.180
 circle and rectangle 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.400
 and I started doing the two circles that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.810
 are the lenses 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.210
 with my eyes and between the lines I made the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.430
 mouth 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.000
 here on the edges of our circle 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:30.150
 of the circle I do what the braces are 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.700
 before 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.460
 and in the bottom part of the circle where 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.210
 started the box I make the arms 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.210
 as it looks 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.540
 in the video 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.610
 to hands gloves here to do the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.120
 I recommend you to make some circles 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.120
 small 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.060
 here he does not say it because going 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.940
 here I start to emphasize with a marker 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.940
 all the lines our two crisis 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.300
 head 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.210
 I will highlight the clothes 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.110
 to highlight all of them all alive 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.110
 Thank you 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.790
 one 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.450
 I do not know how many 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.330
 It is also advisable to make some 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.330
 circles of our parts 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.360
 we have arms and here we put the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.870
 group logo 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.870
 i 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.300
 the lines of the bags 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.300
 it would be enough to throw him 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.610
 we are going to lower our arms and start 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.740
 to color the two 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.740
 the minion hairs 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.620
 he wanted to color for this to be done 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.370
 as the shadow that there remarked more 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.909
 strong 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.030
 so you can see this the shadows 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:32.690
 makes the drawing come to life 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.690
 little more alive 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.560
 so that the shadow of the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.560
 remarked and passed slightly 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.330
 with all that I do it 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:56.840
 same as it is 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.840
 here we use a yellow and orange 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.030
 Spanish orange something like that 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.440
 It is a Spanish dance according to the brand of 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.110
 colour 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.110
 and there we are a yellow channel 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.140
 Maria Canarias 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.960
 it's a little clearer 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.580
 here we use a blue 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.350
 and something like copenhagÃ¼e 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.969
 a celestial blue 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.460
 a permanent blue 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:56.000
 when I finish that blue color there 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.979
 doing the same thing with more remarked here and 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.260
 He ordered it lightly between the 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:05.270
 parts of light 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.270
 was his permanent ends everything else 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.040
 and the last post we finished with the 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.820
 lenses 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:26.220
 black products 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.220
 in terms with lenses and eyes 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.200
 we leave white parts to make it look 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.770
 as if he were 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.770
 the glasses 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.900
 with coffee 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.760
 and there was the minimum 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.810
 well thank you very much for this video if 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.950
 you liked it like this and we're going 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.950
 approaching thank you
