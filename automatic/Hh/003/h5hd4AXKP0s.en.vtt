00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
kinds of cranks one with zucchini and

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.470 
kinds of cranks one with zucchini and
one<00:02:40.890> without<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.730> think<00:02:41.790> let's<00:02:42.120> go<00:02:42.269> see<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
one without and I think let's go see the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.400 
one without and I think let's go see the

ones let's go to my dehydrator and go

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.750 
ones let's go to my dehydrator and go
see<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.950> keep<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> laundry<00:02:47.549> room

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.900 
this because when you cook them it's ok
to<00:04:47.440> have<00:04:47.680> them<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:47.919> little<00:04:48.070> thicker<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.699> bigger

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
to have them a little thicker and bigger

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.150 
to have them a little thicker and bigger
because<00:04:49.510> they'll<00:04:49.810> reduce<00:04:49.990> if<00:04:50.530> I<00:04:50.740> were<00:04:50.860> eating

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
because they'll reduce if I were eating

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.010 
because they'll reduce if I were eating
raw<00:04:51.310> onions<00:04:51.729> no<00:04:51.970> way<00:04:52.120> like<00:04:52.389> that<00:04:52.600> thick<00:04:52.870> I

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
raw onions no way like that thick I

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.810 
raw onions no way like that thick I
would<00:04:53.169> make<00:04:53.320> much<00:04:53.650> thinner<00:04:53.919> dice<00:04:54.310> them<00:04:54.580> it's

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
would make much thinner dice them it's

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.420 
would make much thinner dice them it's
them<00:04:55.030> anyway<00:04:55.750> I'm<00:04:56.260> keeping<00:04:56.680> myself<00:04:56.860> occupied

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
like that I decided to go for flavor so

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.290 
like that I decided to go for flavor so
I'm<00:06:44.930> doing<00:06:45.230> it<00:06:45.530> with<00:06:45.560> fennel<00:06:46.280> and<00:06:46.550> red<00:06:47.000> pepper

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
I'm doing it with fennel and red pepper

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.140 
I'm doing it with fennel and red pepper
and<00:06:47.810> it<00:06:48.590> could<00:06:48.680> be<00:06:48.800> sprinkled<00:06:49.070> on<00:06:49.340> top<00:06:49.370> or<00:06:49.880> they

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
and it could be sprinkled on top or they

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.570 
and it could be sprinkled on top or they
can<00:06:50.330> go<00:06:50.450> in<00:06:50.480> with<00:06:50.690> the<00:06:50.810> animals<00:06:51.170> let's<00:06:51.950> decide

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.180 

okay<00:06:55.580> so<00:06:55.640> i<00:06:55.880> decided<00:06:56.390> to<00:06:56.710> cook<00:06:57.710> the<00:06:57.980> mushrooms

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
okay so i decided to cook the mushrooms

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.890 
okay so i decided to cook the mushrooms
separately<00:06:58.910> because<00:06:59.090> i'm<00:06:59.330> using<00:06:59.660> the

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
separately because i'm using the

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.350 
separately because i'm using the
teeniest<00:07:00.350> bit<00:07:00.500> of<00:07:00.680> oil<00:07:00.920> because<00:07:01.370> the<00:07:01.850> moisture

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
teeniest bit of oil because the moisture

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.660 
teeniest bit of oil because the moisture
of<00:07:02.390> the<00:07:02.480> onions<00:07:02.990> won't<00:07:03.560> allow<00:07:04.010> the<00:07:04.070> mushrooms

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
of the onions won't allow the mushrooms

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.280 
of the onions won't allow the mushrooms
to<00:07:04.880> brown<00:07:05.120> like<00:07:05.420> i<00:07:05.540> like<00:07:05.750> them<00:07:05.960> and<00:07:06.170> they'll
