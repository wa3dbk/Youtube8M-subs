00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.719
 device let's make it a little 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.150
 review about its features it 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.119
 it's about a sony device it 's a 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.550
 sony called xperia is one is a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.490
 phone with one with an appearance 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.260
 quite similar the z1 and the pse all 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.480
 one compact more than anything because of the size 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.040
 if you are seeing it, it is the only one 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.840
 image that there is at the moment of this 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.730
 phone has not yet been released in 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.680
 the link will be in the description of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.450
 the news where there is a video so that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.969
 can see it if we are going to see the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.579
 characteristics of this we started with 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.950
 which is a low-end telephone has 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.789
 4 inch screen have a 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.000
 resolution of 800 x 480 that would be wv vga 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.030
 and a snapdragon processor 200 of 2 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.160
 nuclei to 1.2 giga hertz if we go with the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.579
 memory france would be 512 megabytes let me 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.620
 a little short I'll say I have 3g and hspda 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.870
 plus we do not reach 4g 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.370
 we have a battery of 1700 thousand pairs 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.610
 which I think is a little short 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.890
 Let's say to make 4 inches of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.260
 phone this phone was more than 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.050
 nothing focused on music because it has 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.060
 a technology that is capable of achieving 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.330
 the 100 decibels something that is pretty 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.660
 strong if we consider it has the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.150
 technology x loud clear audio plus that 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.400
 will ensure a clear sound and 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.900
 has a dedicated button for the walkman 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.390
 that would be the music player that 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.220
 helpers all sony ericsson when 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.370
 you are with ericsson they had a world button 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.920
 when the whole line walkman so 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.390
 we hope that unfortunately the bad 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.850
 news is that it will come out for the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.740
 peaceful middle east asia for those 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.600
 hours and will not get to Europe nor 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.240
 Latin America unless they change 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.010
 decision like that unexpectedly so 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.350
 unfortunately we will not be able to 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.770
 Acquire it easily this phone if 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.120
 we want is a low-end phone that 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.840

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.979

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.830
