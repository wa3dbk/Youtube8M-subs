00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
with a dock it's a very good pattern to

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.519 
with a dock it's a very good pattern to
start<00:00:23.090> and<00:00:23.450> just<00:00:23.630> check<00:00:23.869> I<00:00:24.080> mean<00:00:24.320> no<00:00:24.410> matter

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
start and just check I mean no matter

where you are when you're there you got
docks<00:00:26.539> you<00:00:26.779> probably<00:00:27.140> have<00:00:27.320> them<00:00:27.439> on<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:27.740> I've

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
docks you probably have them on and I've

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.740 
docks you probably have them on and I've
called<00:00:28.099> a<00:00:28.220> New<00:00:28.550> York<00:00:28.880> I've<00:00:29.119> called<00:00:29.420> them<00:00:29.480> under

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
docks I've caught them in Florida I

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.009 
docks I've caught them in Florida I
caught<00:00:31.490> them<00:00:31.580> in<00:00:31.670> California<00:00:32.599> called<00:00:32.900> them

everywhere<00:00:33.680> in<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.519> country<00:00:34.879> you<00:00:35.000> can<00:00:35.120> fish

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
everywhere in the country you can fish

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.090 
everywhere in the country you can fish
if<00:00:35.480> you've<00:00:35.629> got<00:00:35.870> them<00:00:35.989> it's<00:00:36.199> a<00:00:36.320> very<00:00:36.769> good

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
if you've got them it's a very good

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.460 
if you've got them it's a very good
starting<00:00:37.670> pattern<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:38.750> it's<00:00:38.960> like<00:00:39.110> they<00:00:39.260> have

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
starting pattern so it's like they have

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.799 
starting pattern so it's like they have
a<00:00:39.500> roof<00:00:40.160> over<00:00:40.370> their<00:00:40.670> head<00:00:40.879> they<00:00:41.239> have<00:00:41.450> shade

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
a roof over their head they have shade

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.560 
a roof over their head they have shade
shadows<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:42.829> they<00:00:43.370> love<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:44.030> hide<00:00:44.239> in<00:00:44.450> those

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
shadows and they love to hide in those

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.760 
shadows and they love to hide in those
shadows<00:00:44.989> because<00:00:45.200> they're<00:00:45.350> ambush<00:00:45.710> predators

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
shadows because they're ambush predators

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.760 
shadows because they're ambush predators
a<00:00:46.370> dock<00:00:46.730> always<00:00:47.360> has<00:00:47.629> you<00:00:47.960> know<00:00:48.050> algae<00:00:48.530> growing

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
a dock always has you know algae growing

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.470 
a dock always has you know algae growing
on<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.160> stuff<00:00:49.399> like<00:00:49.579> that<00:00:49.760> you'll<00:00:49.940> have<00:00:50.090> shad

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
on it stuff like that you'll have shad

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.060 
on it stuff like that you'll have shad
hanging<00:00:50.960> around<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:51.289> you'll<00:00:51.410> have<00:00:51.530> bluegill

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
hanging around it you'll have bluegill

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.060 
hanging around it you'll have bluegill
hanging<00:00:52.430> around<00:00:52.640> it<00:00:52.789> so<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:53.930> a<00:00:53.960> very<00:00:54.739> viable

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
hanging around it so it is a very viable

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.680 
hanging around it so it is a very viable
pattern<00:00:55.640> throughout<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.239> year

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
pattern throughout the year

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.750 
pattern throughout the year
you<00:00:57.170> know<00:00:57.260> when<00:00:57.410> I'm<00:00:57.530> going<00:00:57.920> down<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.219> bank<00:00:58.550> and

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
you know when I'm going down a bank and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.910 
you know when I'm going down a bank and
I'm<00:00:58.820> looking<00:00:59.149> for<00:00:59.329> good<00:00:59.480> docks<00:00:59.780> sometimes<00:01:00.590> its

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
I'm looking for good docks sometimes its

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.430 
I'm looking for good docks sometimes its
depth<00:01:01.280> that's<00:01:01.699> key<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:02.600> sometimes<00:01:03.050> you<00:01:03.199> want<00:01:03.320> a

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
depth that's key so sometimes you want a

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.430 
depth that's key so sometimes you want a
dock<00:01:03.649> that's<00:01:03.890> got<00:01:04.039> the<00:01:04.190> deeper<00:01:04.610> water<00:01:04.850> on<00:01:05.089> it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
dock that's got the deeper water on it

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.600 
dock that's got the deeper water on it
sometimes<00:01:06.440> it's<00:01:06.680> not<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.860> depth<00:01:07.190> sometimes

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
sometimes it's not the depth sometimes

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.570 
sometimes it's not the depth sometimes
it's<00:01:07.820> age<00:01:08.149> you<00:01:08.420> get<00:01:08.570> age<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.320> wood<00:01:09.890> poles<00:01:10.220> and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
it's age you get age and wood poles and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.889 
it's age you get age and wood poles and
things<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:10.940> have<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:11.270> been<00:01:11.479> there<00:01:11.630> for<00:01:11.869> a

them<00:01:16.069> off<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.369> that<00:01:16.399> one<00:01:16.670> in<00:01:16.849> the<00:01:17.390> fall<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.660> the

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
them off of that one in the fall of the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.199 
them off of that one in the fall of the
year<00:01:18.080> this<00:01:18.679> stuff<00:01:18.950> right<00:01:19.160> here<00:01:19.369> is<00:01:19.670> priceless

year this stuff right here is priceless
you<00:01:20.450> see<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.899> foam<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.470> see<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.830> the

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:22.599 
you see the foam you see the the

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:24.999 
you see the foam you see the the
platforms<00:01:23.599> that<00:01:23.720> are<00:01:23.869> laying<00:01:24.410> on<00:01:24.530> top<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.920> it

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
platforms that are laying on top of it

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.620 
platforms that are laying on top of it
because<00:01:25.099> of<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.550> lake<00:01:25.729> fluctuates<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:26.509> a

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
because of the lake fluctuates and a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.779 
because of the lake fluctuates and a
wintertime<00:01:26.959> drawdown<00:01:27.619> those<00:01:28.310> type<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:28.640> things

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
wintertime drawdown those type of things

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.880 
wintertime drawdown those type of things
the<00:01:29.240> shad<00:01:29.539> will<00:01:29.750> get<00:01:29.899> up<00:01:30.020> in<00:01:30.200> there<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:30.560> run

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
the shad will get up in there and run

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.949 
the shad will get up in there and run
the<00:01:30.920> edges<00:01:31.399> and<00:01:31.580> so<00:01:31.759> I<00:01:31.789> actually<00:01:32.090> look<00:01:32.690> for

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:32.959 
the edges and so I actually look for

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.339 
the edges and so I actually look for
docks<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.470> are<00:01:33.860> skinny<00:01:34.459> water<00:01:34.670> foam

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:35.349 
docks that are skinny water foam

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.690 
docks that are skinny water foam
sometimes<00:01:36.349> it's<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.649> very<00:01:36.679> last<00:01:37.130> couple

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
sometimes it's the very last couple

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.850 
sometimes it's the very last couple
docks<00:01:37.910> in<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.179> pocket<00:01:38.599> that<00:01:38.959> you<00:01:39.110> run<00:01:39.349> in<00:01:39.530> in<00:01:39.679> the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
docks in a pocket that you run in in the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.449 
docks in a pocket that you run in in the
back<00:01:40.069> so<00:01:40.479> analyzing<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.569> dock<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:42.319> simply<00:01:42.830> you

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
back so analyzing the dock is simply you

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.219 
back so analyzing the dock is simply you
really<00:01:43.729> want<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.000> fish<00:01:44.239> if<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.420> let<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.050> fish

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
really want to fish if you let the fish

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.870 
really want to fish if you let the fish
tell<00:01:45.259> you<00:01:45.590> what<00:01:45.709> they<00:01:45.860> want<00:01:46.130> what<00:01:46.459> they<00:01:46.520> like

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
tell you what they want what they like

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.760 
tell you what they want what they like
the<00:01:47.179> dock<00:01:47.599> that<00:01:47.810> they<00:01:47.929> want<00:01:48.080> to<00:01:48.140> be<00:01:48.259> around<00:01:48.530> and

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
the dock that they want to be around and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.859 
the dock that they want to be around and
then<00:01:49.280> just<00:01:49.789> start<00:01:50.030> taking<00:01:50.179> that<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.599> the<00:01:50.720> rest

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
then just start taking that to the rest

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:51.550 
then just start taking that to the rest
of<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.110> lake

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
of the lake

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.469 
of the lake
sometimes<00:01:52.310> it's<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.759> dock<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.300> looks

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
sometimes it's the dock that looks

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.089 
sometimes it's the dock that looks
absolutely<00:01:53.840> terrible<00:01:54.530> you're<00:01:54.770> like<00:01:54.920> oh

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
would have expected that to need another

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.580 
would have expected that to need another
year<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.850> sitting<00:02:17.570> in<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.780> water<00:02:17.870> oh<00:02:18.140> no<00:02:18.380> it

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
dogs and and you can see it's real flat

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.860 
dogs and and you can see it's real flat
and<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:25.070> need<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.340> see<00:02:25.460> on<00:02:25.610> my<00:02:25.760> lorentz<00:02:26.720> it's

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
and you need to see on my lorentz it's

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.960 
and you need to see on my lorentz it's
real<00:02:27.200> flat<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.860> don't<00:02:28.040> see<00:02:28.190> any<00:02:28.340> contours

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
real flat you don't see any contours

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.660 
real flat you don't see any contours
here<00:02:29.240> at<00:02:29.330> all<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.200> these<00:02:30.620> are<00:02:30.860> real<00:02:31.190> shallow

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
here at all so these are real shallow

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.760 
here at all so these are real shallow
skinny<00:02:32.360> docks<00:02:32.660> lotta<00:02:33.110> grass<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.440> lot<00:02:33.620> of

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
skinny docks lotta grass a lot of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.340 
skinny docks lotta grass a lot of
vegetation<00:02:34.190> when<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:34.910> get<00:02:35.210> right<00:02:35.420> up<00:02:35.600> here<00:02:35.900> and

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
vegetation when I get right up here and

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.500 
vegetation when I get right up here and
I<00:02:36.500> can<00:02:36.680> just<00:02:36.800> move<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:37.220> down<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.820> show<00:02:37.850> you

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
I can just move this down and show you

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.840 
I can just move this down and show you
that<00:02:39.110> right<00:02:39.410> here<00:02:39.710> where<00:02:39.980> these<00:02:40.100> contours<00:02:40.670> get

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
that right here where these contours get

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.610 
that right here where these contours get
closed<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.450> get<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.810> couple<00:02:42.170> dots<00:02:42.380> right

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
closed and I get the couple dots right

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.710 
closed and I get the couple dots right
here<00:02:42.860> right<00:02:43.130> next<00:02:43.460> to<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.640> deep<00:02:43.790> water<00:02:44.030> that's

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
here right next to the deep water that's

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.750 
here right next to the deep water that's
probably<00:02:45.470> where<00:02:45.740> I'm<00:02:45.860> going<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:46.130> find<00:02:46.340> them

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
probably where I'm going to find them

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.790 
probably where I'm going to find them
just<00:02:47.090> watching<00:02:47.390> your<00:02:47.660> electronics<00:02:48.290> can<00:02:48.440> tell

control<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.210> I<00:03:14.420> can<00:03:14.630> still<00:03:15.050> skip<00:03:15.380> up<00:03:15.590> under<00:03:15.860> the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
control so I can still skip up under the

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.920 
control so I can still skip up under the
docks<00:03:16.160> but<00:03:16.670> what<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:16.880> can<00:03:17.120> do<00:03:17.270> is<00:03:17.420> when<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.630> hook

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
docks but what I can do is when I hook

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.330 
docks but what I can do is when I hook
one<00:03:18.170> he's<00:03:18.350> way<00:03:18.590> back<00:03:18.800> in<00:03:19.010> there<00:03:19.160> you've<00:03:19.310> got

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
one he's way back in there you've got

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.920 
one he's way back in there you've got
enough<00:03:19.700> power<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.090> get<00:03:20.360> them<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.660> get<00:03:20.750> them

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
enough power to get them and get them

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.230 
enough power to get them and get them
out<00:03:21.020> and<00:03:21.530> work<00:03:21.740> them<00:03:21.920> around<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.280> poles<00:03:22.520> which

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
out and work them around the poles which

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.820 
out and work them around the poles which
is<00:03:23.420> really<00:03:23.750> important<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.290> see<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.590> lot<00:03:24.800> of

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
is really important you see a lot of

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.260 
is really important you see a lot of

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
so you're not going to bend it out

so you're not going to bend it out
tapered<00:04:24.020> head<00:04:24.230> if<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.740> look<00:04:24.890> at<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.100> tapered

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
tapered head if you look at the tapered

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.460 
tapered head if you look at the tapered
head<00:04:25.580> what<00:04:25.790> that<00:04:26.000> does<00:04:26.240> is<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:26.810> allows<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.440> to

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
head what that does is that allows it to

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.380 
head what that does is that allows it to
come<00:04:27.800> through<00:04:27.830> cover<00:04:28.280> easier<00:04:28.730> so<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.120> comes

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
come through cover easier so it comes

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.909 
come through cover easier so it comes

about this it's quarter ounce so 1/4

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.629 
about this it's quarter ounce so 1/4
ounce<00:04:49.050> means<00:04:49.349> I<00:04:49.560> can<00:04:49.830> skip<00:04:50.250> it<00:04:50.400> underneath

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
ounce means I can skip it underneath

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.149 
ounce means I can skip it underneath
docks<00:04:51.060> if<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.449> used<00:04:51.659> a<00:04:51.780> heavier<00:04:52.229> one<00:04:52.409> it's<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:52.919> lot

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:53.159 
docks if I used a heavier one it's a lot

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.100 
docks if I used a heavier one it's a lot
harder<00:04:53.639> to<00:04:53.909> get<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.210> underneath<00:04:54.479> those<00:04:54.810> docks

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
harder to get it underneath those docks

jig<00:05:39.389> I<00:05:39.629> I<00:05:40.500> like<00:05:41.310> it<00:05:41.520> when<00:05:42.089> I<00:05:42.120> look<00:05:42.419> at<00:05:42.539> a<00:05:42.569> dock

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
jig I I like it when I look at a dock

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.689 
jig I I like it when I look at a dock
the<00:05:43.379> first<00:05:43.620> thing<00:05:43.800> I<00:05:43.860> want<00:05:44.069> to<00:05:44.099> think<00:05:44.339> of<00:05:44.490> is

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
the first thing I want to think of is

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.550 
the first thing I want to think of is
boat<00:05:44.969> control<00:05:45.330> what<00:05:45.750> angle<00:05:46.110> do<00:05:46.199> I<00:05:46.229> want<00:05:46.500> to

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
boat control what angle do I want to

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.360 
boat control what angle do I want to
approach<00:05:46.800> it<00:05:46.860> this<00:05:47.610> angle<00:05:48.150> is<00:05:48.300> semi<00:05:49.199> okay<00:05:49.770> okay

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
approach it this angle is semi okay okay

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.640 
approach it this angle is semi okay okay
and<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.729> reason<00:05:50.909> I<00:05:51.150> say<00:05:51.389> that<00:05:51.419> is<00:05:51.810> because

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
and the reason I say that is because

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.249 
and the reason I say that is because
most<00:05:53.009> of<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.370> time<00:05:53.610> if<00:05:53.940> a<00:05:54.569> fish<00:05:54.779> is<00:05:54.930> under<00:05:55.169> the

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
most of the time if a fish is under the

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.200 
most of the time if a fish is under the
dock<00:05:55.409> now<00:05:55.440> up<00:05:55.800> here<00:05:56.009> he<00:05:56.190> can<00:05:56.339> face<00:05:56.580> anywhere<00:05:57.089> he

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
dock now up here he can face anywhere he

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.969 
dock now up here he can face anywhere he
wants<00:05:57.539> when<00:05:57.690> he<00:05:57.719> gets<00:05:57.960> on<00:05:58.110> those<00:05:58.289> poles<00:05:58.560> a<00:05:58.800> lot

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
wants when he gets on those poles a lot

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.430 
wants when he gets on those poles a lot

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.089 
and shade so start a little bit deep and
then<00:06:18.839> work<00:06:19.050> my<00:06:19.080> way<00:06:19.289> into<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.830> shallow

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
then work my way into the shallow

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:21.740 
then work my way into the shallow
because<00:06:20.520> a<00:06:20.550> lot<00:06:20.849> of<00:06:20.879> times<00:06:21.210> I'll<00:06:21.419> catch<00:06:21.659> them

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
because a lot of times I'll catch them

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.200 
because a lot of times I'll catch them
in<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:21.990> very<00:06:22.349> last<00:06:22.770> pole<00:06:23.159> just<00:06:23.729> before<00:06:24.150> it

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
in the very last pole just before it

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.019 
in the very last pole just before it
hits<00:06:24.389> the<00:06:24.479> bank<00:06:24.779> and<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:26.009> so<00:06:26.610> I'll<00:06:26.789> actually

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:27.029 
hits the bank and and so I'll actually

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:29.719 
hits the bank and and so I'll actually
make<00:06:27.419> one<00:06:27.779> or<00:06:27.900> two<00:06:27.930> casts<00:06:28.409> on<00:06:28.529> the<00:06:28.620> head<00:06:28.860> then

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
make one or two casts on the head then

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.909 
make one or two casts on the head then
I'll<00:06:29.879> fire<00:06:30.150> one<00:06:30.389> to<00:06:30.569> the<00:06:30.659> very<00:06:30.960> front<00:06:31.229> where<00:06:31.800> it

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
I'll fire one to the very front where it

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.070 
I'll fire one to the very front where it
hits<00:06:32.129> the<00:06:32.310> bank<00:06:32.520> and<00:06:32.729> then<00:06:33.270> I'll<00:06:33.389> work<00:06:33.599> back<00:06:33.870> in

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
hits the bank and then I'll work back in

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.140 
hits the bank and then I'll work back in
the<00:06:34.110> middle<00:06:34.469> so<00:06:34.919> what<00:06:35.339> happens<00:06:35.669> if<00:06:35.789> I<00:06:35.909> hit

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
the middle so what happens if I hit

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.619 
the middle so what happens if I hit
start<00:06:36.719> working<00:06:37.080> my<00:06:37.229> way<00:06:37.259> to<00:06:37.469> it<00:06:38.089> so<00:06:39.089> I<00:06:39.120> catch

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:39.629 
start working my way to it so I catch

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:41.749 
start working my way to it so I catch
one<00:06:39.659> here<00:06:40.199> one<00:06:40.379> there<00:06:40.409> one<00:06:40.620> there<00:06:40.830> well<00:06:41.580> one

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 
one here one there one there well one

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.189 
one here one there one there well one
that's<00:06:41.909> all<00:06:42.120> the<00:06:42.240> way<00:06:42.300> up<00:06:42.389> the<00:06:42.539> front<00:06:42.659> may<00:06:42.930> turn

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
that's all the way up the front may turn

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.079 
that's all the way up the front may turn
and<00:06:43.439> come<00:06:43.620> back<00:06:43.830> I'd<00:06:44.069> prefer<00:06:44.310> to<00:06:44.550> get<00:06:44.759> him<00:06:44.940> on

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
and come back I'd prefer to get him on

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:47.209 
and come back I'd prefer to get him on
the<00:06:45.569> first<00:06:45.750> cast<00:06:46.169> up<00:06:46.440> there<00:06:46.620> without<00:06:46.740> spooking

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:47.219 
the first cast up there without spooking

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.470 
the first cast up there without spooking
them<00:06:47.459> so<00:06:47.610> here's<00:06:48.149> my<00:06:48.330> here's<00:06:48.659> my<00:06:48.810> exact

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480 
them so here's my here's my exact

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.680 
them so here's my here's my exact
starting<00:06:50.080> hit<00:06:51.070> the<00:06:51.190> first<00:06:51.430> outside<00:06:51.910> skip<00:06:52.540> one

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
starting hit the first outside skip one

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.510 
starting hit the first outside skip one
up<00:06:52.840> underneath<00:06:53.110> go<00:06:53.860> all<00:06:54.070> the<00:06:54.190> way<00:06:54.220> to<00:06:54.340> the

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
up underneath go all the way to the

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.310 
up underneath go all the way to the
front<00:06:54.730> then<00:06:55.180> come<00:06:55.450> back<00:06:55.630> to<00:06:55.780> the<00:06:55.900> center<00:06:56.230> and

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:56.320 
front then come back to the center and

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.680 
front then come back to the center and
then<00:06:56.800> wrap<00:06:57.070> the<00:06:57.280> dock<00:06:57.490> so<00:06:58.000> that's<00:06:58.300> kind<00:06:58.630> of

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
then wrap the dock so that's kind of

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.940 
then wrap the dock so that's kind of
what<00:06:58.870> it<00:06:58.990> is<00:06:59.110> outside<00:07:00.070> all<00:07:00.880> the<00:07:01.150> way<00:07:01.270> up<00:07:01.450> to<00:07:01.630> the

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
inside and now you've covered the dock

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.410 
inside and now you've covered the dock
and<00:07:05.320> pretty<00:07:06.190> much<00:07:06.400> that's<00:07:06.580> my<00:07:06.790> attack<00:07:07.150> plan
