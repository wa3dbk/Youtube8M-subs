00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 I greet you in this video with you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.180
 Hoods Maxim 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.220
 and here we will consider such a question as 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.580
 temperature control devices which 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.590
 installed inside the computer we have 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.199
 on the blog is an article on this topic therefore 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.510
 You can see this article as well. 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.720
 I have additional materials 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.330
 here in this video I will show one 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.609
 the program with which I 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.320
 control the temperature of the devices and so 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.980
 why you need to control this 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.510
 temperature first is 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.410
 necessary to extend service life 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.090
 devices themselves for example if 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.540
 processor and video card installed 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.410
 cooling system and it cools these 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.980
 devices 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.590
 the system is usually on the hard disk 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.050
 cooling is not installed and if it 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.449
 it will heat up very much it will shorten 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.270
 its service life is also in some 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.420
 temperature control cases will help us 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.190
 determine the reason why for example 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.530
 the computer started to slow down 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.470
 that is, if the computer started to slow down 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.390
 for reasons you do not understand , that is, you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.380
 run regular applications and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.640
 the computer slows down first 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.740
 can look at the temperature 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.220
 processor and if it is very high then 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.500
 This suggests that the cooling system 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.460
 can not cope with the cooling processor 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.250
 he turns on protection to reduce 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.650
 CPU load and therefore 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.380
 the computer starts to slow down and here already 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.729
 need to look at the state 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.000
 cooling system if it is clogged with dust 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.040
 clean the cooling system from dust and 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.829
 perhaps this is to eliminate the cause 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.560
 why the processor overheats and 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.560
 the computer starts to slow down on 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.619
 Really reasons why it can slow down 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.500
 the computer is very much and this video is not about 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.210
 This I told you only about one of 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.350
 reasons and about how we can by 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.179
 programs which controls 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.030
 the temperature 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.819
 devices determine this reason why 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.739
 can update the computer then let's 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.260
 take a closer look at this 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.200
 the program is called speedfan 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.470
 You can download it from the official site. 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.110
 specify in the search engine speedfan 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:34.170
 and download the program from the official 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.170
 the site and the address you see on the screen 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.610
 go to the dunlop section 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.140
 and download the program for this link 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.590
 the installation is standard so I don't 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.990
 I consider and run the installed 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:57.470
 program and so here we have displayed 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:00.230
 fan speed here 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.760
 fan speed can be adjusted 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.430
 and here we have the temperature 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.720
 Jeep is the temperature of the video card 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.900
 core this core temperature 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:19.060
 in my case it is displayed exactly 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.500
 how can the core core in your case 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.010
 just the temperature is displayed 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.880
 CPU will be indicated by sip and hd 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.540
 this is the temperature of the hard drives I have them 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.810
 2 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:39.530
 so here is hd1 and hd2 and pace is one pace 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.150
 2 m3 are some sensors on the mother 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.170
 the board so here we are in the first place 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.340
 interested in the temperature of hard drives 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.579
 core processor temperatures and 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.180
 the temperature of the video card we see that 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.790
 My temperature is normal 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.900
 hard drive temperature 40 degrees 2 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.120
 38 is normal temperature if you 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.420
 You will see that the temperature of the hard drive 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.350
 comes to five ten degrees here 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.160
 already worth thinking about additional 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.340
 cooling 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.190
 hard drive may be necessary 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.769
 install the fan on the front panel 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.740
 basket casing 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.220
 hard drives possibly necessary 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.500
 to establish 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.880
 cooling system on the hard drive itself 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.580
 here already look depending on 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.010
 capabilities of your hull further by 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.820
 CPU temperature each 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.310
 processor 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.100
 its own critical temperature viz 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.720
 temperature to which the processor 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.300
 works and then the protection is turned on 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.400
 the frequency goes down so you and 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.400
 this reduces the load on 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.440
 the processor so this is critical 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.980
 each processor has its own temperature 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.080
 This information can be found in 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.570
 characteristics of the processor on the site 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.490
 I unfortunately do not have a manufacturer 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.330
 Internet is working now 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.660
 so i can't show an example of this 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.980
 temperatures on the site but i will show it in 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.040
 screenshot 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:24.000
 So in the characteristics of the processor 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:28.260
 There are two temperature parameters 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:33.090
 one parameter is the temperature inside 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:36.590
 processor and it can reach 90 or 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.240
 100 degrees and the second parameter is 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.380
 cpu temperature 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.190
 she usually is 60 70 degrees 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.270
 temperature is displayed here 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.750
 processor cores i.e. temperature 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.440
 inside the processor and it can be higher 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.320
 cpu temperature 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.360
 accordingly if you see here 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.900
 very high temperatures 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.860
 let's say 90 or 100 degrees then this 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.040
 says that the temperature comes to 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.160
 critical 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.070
 and you need to take some measures to 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.860
 improve processor cooling 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:20.250
 Well , also on the graphics processor 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.689
 if it comes to high temperatures 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.959
 100 degrees under load then 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:27.199
 pay attention to the cooling system 

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:31.249
 video cards 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:34.759
 clean it or replace it with more 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:37.669
 productive well or just 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:40.189
 arrange better cooling inside 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:43.699
 system unit, well let's 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:47.419
 Let's see how to make this information here. 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:51.529
 cover the notification area 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:56.259
 the program is running here 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:07:00.319
 graphics card information 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:07.989
 carried her say here here and here 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:10.159
 that is displayed in my case 

00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:12.159
 graphics card temperature 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:14.749
 if you need to display here 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:18.199
 some other temperature for example 

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:22.399
 cpu or hard drive then go 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:24.799
 In the settings, click on this button further 

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:27.079
 we choose the sensor that we 

00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:28.009
 need to display here in the area 

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:31.909
 notifications 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:32.360
 let's say hard drive and click here 

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:36.879
 here 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:40.369
 walked and ntray click ok 

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:44.149
 we cover there 40 hard drive 

00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:46.969
 degrees here displays 40 degrees 

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:49.429
 i.e. hard drive temperature is exactly 

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:51.769
 also if you want to display 

00:07:49.429 --> 00:07:56.499
 CPU temperature select 

00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:59.209
 the processor and there will already be a temperature 

00:07:56.499 --> 00:08:02.659
 one of the processor cores 

00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:05.089
 what is such a useful utility if you 

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:08.389
 it was not used before 

00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:09.369
 install and periodically check 

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:12.589
 the temperature 

00:08:09.369 --> 00:08:15.709
 devices on this all hope video was 

00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:17.749
 useful thank you for your attention with you 

00:08:15.709 --> 00:08:19.989
 was not in maxi before meeting in new 

00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:19.989
 lessons
