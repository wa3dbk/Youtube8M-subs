00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.830 
rifles because it's gone it's not
definitely<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:32.909> not<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> most

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
definitely not not one of the most

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.899 
definitely not not one of the most
consistent<00:01:34.590> weapons<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> game<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.670> more

consistent weapons in the game it's more
one<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> more<00:01:36.540> inconsistent<00:01:36.990> weapons

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
one of the more inconsistent weapons

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.679 
one of the more inconsistent weapons
just<00:01:38.430> purely<00:01:38.700> because<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.360> amount<00:01:39.540> of

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
just purely because of the amount of

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.690 
just purely because of the amount of
recoil<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:40.409> actually<00:01:40.500> has<00:01:40.740> gonna<00:01:41.520> see

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
recoil this one actually has gonna see

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.160 
recoil this one actually has gonna see
here<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.390> shooting<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.750> guy<00:01:42.869> pretty

much dead on and you know not getting
hit<00:01:45.149> markers<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.899> because<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.409> mass

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
say that the sands for an extended mag

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.569 
say that the sands for an extended mag
is<00:01:57.360> definitely<00:01:57.899> my<00:01:58.140> favorite<00:01:58.799> attachment<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
is definitely my favorite attachment to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.110 
is definitely my favorite attachment to
you

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
you

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.150 
you
attachment<00:02:00.570> combination<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.590> use<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:02.010> this

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
attachment combination to use on this

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.530 
attachment combination to use on this
weapon<00:02:02.340> along<00:02:02.580> with<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:03.060> drill<00:02:03.300> attachment

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
weapon along with the drill attachment

weapon along with the drill attachment
proficiency<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:05.670> reason<00:02:05.970> being<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.420> that

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
proficiency and the reason being is that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.000 
proficiency and the reason being is that
you<00:02:06.870> know<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.170> why<00:02:07.290> i<00:02:07.320> use<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.530> pretty<00:02:07.890> much

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
you know that's why i use on pretty much

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.380 
you know that's why i use on pretty much
all<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.310> mustard<00:02:08.580> machines<00:02:08.880> but<00:02:09.180> the<00:02:09.210> reason

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
all of mustard machines but the reason

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.390 
all of mustard machines but the reason
being<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.140> silencer<00:02:10.740> obviously<00:02:11.190> keeps

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
being is the silencer obviously keeps

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.980 
being is the silencer obviously keeps
you<00:02:11.490> off<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.610> radar<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.420> guys<00:02:12.570> already<00:02:12.780> know

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
you off the radar you guys already know

off the radar when i am shooting my gun
and<00:02:22.440> that's<00:02:22.740> especially<00:02:22.980> useful<00:02:23.490> when<00:02:23.730> you

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
and that's especially useful when you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.580 
and that's especially useful when you
are<00:02:23.970> using<00:02:24.240> some<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.720> week<00:02:24.900> weapons<00:02:25.380> like

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
those and the reason for the extended

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.660 
those and the reason for the extended
mag<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.330> because<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.960> weapon<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.590> uber<00:02:32.250> over

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670
