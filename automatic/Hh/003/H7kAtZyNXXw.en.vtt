very<00:00:58.590> impressed<00:00:58.770> by<00:00:59.270> the<00:01:00.270> Ninja<00:01:00.660> Turtles

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
very impressed by the Ninja Turtles

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.439 
very impressed by the Ninja Turtles
so<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.039> meant<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.359> sort<00:01:03.359> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
so it was meant to be sort of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.080 
so it was meant to be sort of
tongue-in-cheek<00:01:04.080> version<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.970> I

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
tongue-in-cheek version of this I

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.890 
tongue-in-cheek version of this I
thought<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.450> was<00:01:06.540> meant<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.840> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
thought it was meant to be a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.270 
thought it was meant to be a
tongue-in-cheek<00:01:07.110> version<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> Turtles

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
tongue-in-cheek version of the Turtles

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.910 
tongue-in-cheek version of the Turtles
so<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.000> kind<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.390> typical<00:01:10.290> example<00:01:10.439> of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
so it's kind of a typical example of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.980 
so it's kind of a typical example of
rares<00:01:11.250> looking<00:01:11.820> at<00:01:11.970> what<00:01:12.150> was<00:01:12.299> popular<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
rares looking at what was popular and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.350 
rares looking at what was popular and
then<00:01:13.140> kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> putting<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.159> spin<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.640> kind

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
then kind of putting a spin on it kind

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.149 
then kind of putting a spin on it kind
of<00:01:15.570> I'm<00:01:15.810> penny<00:01:16.049> took<00:01:16.259> making<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> bit<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:16.920> edgy

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
of I'm penny took making a bit more edgy

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.210 
of I'm penny took making a bit more edgy
a<00:01:17.340> bit<00:01:17.520> more<00:01:17.700> kind<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.060> violent<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.960> went

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
a bit more kind of violent we went

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.340 
a bit more kind of violent we went
through<00:01:20.220> all<00:01:20.580> kinds<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.150> ideas<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.930> names<00:01:22.140> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
through all kinds of ideas and names I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.179 
through all kinds of ideas and names I
think<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.619> was<00:01:22.710> gonna<00:01:22.799> call<00:01:22.979> them<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
think what I was gonna call them the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.450 
think what I was gonna call them the
amphibians<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.930> wants<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.380> him<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:25.890> we

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
amphibians that wants of him but we

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.399 
amphibians that wants of him but we
ended<00:01:26.640> without<00:01:26.790> sides<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.630> worked<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
ended without sides and that worked I

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.580 
ended without sides and that worked I
wanted<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.610> look<00:01:29.729> kind<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.180> Disney<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.689> it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
wanted it to look kind of Disney like it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.380 
wanted it to look kind of Disney like it
wasn't<00:01:31.950> anywhere<00:01:32.280> near<00:01:32.340> good<00:01:32.729> enough<00:01:32.790> artists

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
wasn't anywhere near good enough artists

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.170 
wasn't anywhere near good enough artists
for<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.460> we<00:01:35.460> came<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.939> few

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
for that so we came up with a few

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.270 
for that so we came up with a few
different<00:01:36.930> gimmicks<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.950> had<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> other

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
different gimmicks and we had the other

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.940 
different gimmicks and we had the other
hands<00:01:38.670> expanding<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.049> foot<00:01:40.320> turn<00:01:40.619> into<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
hands expanding and the foot turn into a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.130 
hands expanding and the foot turn into a
huge<00:01:41.250> booth<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.790> think<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> ability<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.020> be

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
huge booth I think the ability to be

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.350 
huge booth I think the ability to be
able<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.470> transform<00:01:43.950> limbs<00:01:44.369> rather<00:01:45.240> than

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
able to transform limbs rather than

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.240 
able to transform limbs rather than
carry<00:01:45.630> actual<00:01:45.990> weapons<00:01:46.380> around<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:47.009> what

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
carry actual weapons around that's what

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.420 
carry actual weapons around that's what
made<00:01:47.520> them<00:01:47.759> unique<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.799> think<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.220> picked

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
made them unique I think if you picked

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.330 
made them unique I think if you picked
up<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.509> original<00:01:52.320> NES<00:01:52.829> version<00:01:53.250> of

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
up the the original NES version of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
up the the original NES version of
battletoads<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.200> get<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.560> of

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
battletoads now I think you get a bit of

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.230 
battletoads now I think you get a bit of
a<00:01:55.680> shock<00:01:55.979> because<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.280> was<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> very<00:01:56.729> precise

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
a shock because it was a very precise

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.859 
a shock because it was a very precise
very<00:01:57.630> difficult<00:01:58.170> games

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
very difficult games

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.719 
very difficult games
back<00:01:59.469> then<00:01:59.679> there<00:01:59.829> were<00:01:59.920> kind<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.189> quite<00:02:00.399> short

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
back then there were kind of quite short

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.969 
back then there were kind of quite short
going<00:02:01.000> so<00:02:01.270> one<00:02:01.479> way<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.780> getting<00:02:01.899> more<00:02:02.259> kind<00:02:02.920> of

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
going so one way of getting more kind of

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.490 
going so one way of getting more kind of
playability<00:02:03.340> was<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:04.109> provide<00:02:05.109> the<00:02:05.259> player

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
playability was to provide the player

on Konev not only how challenging it was
everyone<00:02:49.030> lighting<00:02:49.299> but<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.540> yeah<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.690> think

the<00:02:49.959> variety<00:02:50.379> of<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.530> levels<00:02:50.860> was<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.760> key<00:02:51.940> to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
the variety of the levels was the key to

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.640 
the variety of the levels was the key to
how<00:02:52.239> well<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.540> was<00:02:52.629> a<00:02:52.690> receive<00:02:53.019> light<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:53.470> one

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
how well it was a receive light on one

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.740 
how well it was a receive light on one
level<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:53.980> would<00:02:54.160> be<00:02:54.310> solid<00:02:55.060> very<00:02:55.299> scroll<00:02:55.599> in

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
level it would be solid very scroll in

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.940 
level it would be solid very scroll in
doing<00:02:55.930> one<00:02:56.110> thing<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.379> next<00:02:56.410> level<00:02:56.769> you'd<00:02:56.860> be

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
doing one thing the next level you'd be

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.259 
doing one thing the next level you'd be
on<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.099> rope<00:02:57.310> going<00:02:57.610> down<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.760> think<00:02:57.940> then<00:02:58.150> you'd

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
on a rope going down I think then you'd

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.729 
on a rope going down I think then you'd
be<00:02:58.360> on<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.510> tunnel<00:02:58.959> then<00:02:59.170> you'd<00:02:59.319> be<00:02:59.440> on<00:02:59.560> from

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
be on a tunnel then you'd be on from

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.069 
be on a tunnel then you'd be on from
kind<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.010> like<00:03:00.269> weird<00:03:01.269> device<00:03:01.599> then<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.810> be<00:03:01.989> on

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
kind of like weird device then you be on

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.720 
kind of like weird device then you be on
the<00:03:02.140> back<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.530> snake<00:03:02.769> in<00:03:02.980> Eli<00:03:03.280> jumped<00:03:03.639> around

the back of a snake in Eli jumped around

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.699 
the back of a snake in Eli jumped around
all<00:03:04.000> over<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.269> place<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:05.049> was<00:03:05.170> such<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.380> breath

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
all over the place it was such a breath

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.220 
all over the place it was such a breath
of<00:03:05.799> fresh<00:03:05.859> air<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.310> terms<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.810> breadth<00:03:08.019> of

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
in the arcade version Battletoads we

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.880 
in the arcade version Battletoads we
were<00:03:14.270> able<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.540> be<00:03:14.660> even<00:03:15.140> more<00:03:15.530> over-the-top

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
were able to be even more over-the-top

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.860 
were able to be even more over-the-top
with<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.910> violence<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.510> comedy

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
with the the violence the comedy

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.960 
with the the violence the comedy
violence<00:03:18.290> than<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:18.950> NES<00:03:19.250> because<00:03:19.760> there<00:03:19.849> was

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
violence than the NES because there was

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.280 
violence than the NES because there was
obviously<00:03:20.209> certain<00:03:20.390> restrictions<00:03:20.989> on<00:03:21.110> what

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
obviously certain restrictions on what

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.949 
obviously certain restrictions on what
we<00:03:21.410> could<00:03:21.590> produce<00:03:21.800> for<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.610> console<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:23.599> we

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
we could produce for a console so we

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.320 
we could produce for a console so we
went<00:03:24.530> is<00:03:24.770> pretty<00:03:25.130> much<00:03:25.280> extreme<00:03:25.819> as<00:03:25.970> we<00:03:26.120> could

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
went is pretty much extreme as we could

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.780 
went is pretty much extreme as we could
be<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:27.050> I<00:03:27.140> think<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.500> was<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:28.430> was<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.700> the

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
be and I think that was that was to the

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.850 
be and I think that was that was to the
benefit<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.510> product<00:03:29.750> took<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.590> long<00:03:30.830> time

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
benefit of the product took a long time

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.590 
benefit of the product took a long time
to<00:03:31.100> produce<00:03:31.400> because<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:31.880> was<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.360> was<00:03:32.480> all<00:03:32.569> a

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
to produce because it was it was all a

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.320 
to produce because it was it was all a
new<00:03:32.900> kind<00:03:33.200> of<00:03:33.290> game<00:03:33.440> for<00:03:33.770> us<00:03:33.890> but<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.880> was<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.030> fun

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
new kind of game for us but it was a fun

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.840 
new kind of game for us but it was a fun
one<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.569> work<00:03:35.900> with<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:37.250> was<00:03:37.370> like<00:03:37.459> building<00:03:37.670> a

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
one to work with it was like building a

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.610 
one to work with it was like building a
car<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:38.450> start<00:03:38.510> with<00:03:38.840> no<00:03:38.989> parts<00:03:39.410> you've

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
car and you start with no parts you've

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.229 
car and you start with no parts you've
gotta<00:03:39.830> just<00:03:39.920> start<00:03:40.280> manufacturing<00:03:40.580> each<00:03:41.090> of

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
tweak it and we say up the hardware it's

some<00:04:03.049> changes<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.590> then<00:04:03.860> he'd<00:04:03.980> add<00:04:04.100> that<00:04:04.280> in

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
some changes and then he'd add that in

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.039 
some changes and then he'd add that in
and<00:04:04.640> then<00:04:04.730> we<00:04:04.850> change<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.330> software<00:04:05.600> again<00:04:05.870> so

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
and then we change the software again so

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.420 
and then we change the software again so
there<00:04:06.200> was<00:04:06.290> really<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.590> quite<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.280> bit<00:04:07.400> of

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
there was really a quite a bit of

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.120 
there was really a quite a bit of
collaboration<00:04:08.150> working<00:04:09.110> on<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.530> arcade<00:04:09.920> one

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.090 
collaboration working on the arcade one
was<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:10.370> great<00:04:11.090> experience<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.989> taught<00:04:12.890> me<00:04:13.040> a

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
was a great experience and taught me a

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.610 
was a great experience and taught me a
lot<00:04:13.220> about<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:14.330> very<00:04:14.870> different<00:04:15.290> part<00:04:15.470> of

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
lot about a very different part of

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.279 
lot about a very different part of
design<00:04:15.980> which<00:04:16.310> wasn't<00:04:16.519> all<00:04:16.760> about<00:04:17.109> let's<00:04:18.109> try

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.640 
but let's make sure that I'd have good
enough<00:04:26.630> time<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.050> they<00:04:27.140> want<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:27.380> put<00:04:27.500> more

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
enough time so they want to put more

hit upon this idea of of making him

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.219 
hit upon this idea of of making him
super<00:04:49.220> tough<00:04:49.400> at<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.700> start<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.539> even<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.140> the

super tough at the start to even to the
point<00:04:51.440> where<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:52.610> couldn't<00:04:52.850> actually<00:04:53.060> do<00:04:53.330> any

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
point where you couldn't actually do any

damage<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:53.930> him<00:04:54.289> for<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.740> first<00:04:54.979> 45<00:04:55.430> seconds

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970

nothing<00:04:56.600> you<00:04:56.930> did<00:04:57.110> actually<00:04:57.350> and<00:04:58.070> have

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
nothing you did actually and have

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.100 
nothing you did actually and have
affected<00:04:58.940> him<00:04:59.030> in<00:04:59.120> any<00:04:59.270> way<00:04:59.330> but<00:04:59.450> it<00:04:59.660> looked

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
affected him in any way but it looked

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:06.370 
affected him in any way but it looked
like<00:05:00.200> it<00:05:00.289> did<00:05:04.510> how<00:05:05.510> can<00:05:05.720> we<00:05:05.810> make<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.140> final

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
like it did how can we make the final

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.550 
like it did how can we make the final

boss techno on money I know

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.210 
boss techno on money I know
nice<00:05:09.560> Mikey<00:05:09.830> sorry<00:05:10.130> card<00:05:10.400> killer<00:05:12.100> there<00:05:13.100> was<00:05:13.190> a

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
nice Mikey sorry card killer there was a

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.950 
nice Mikey sorry card killer there was a
few<00:05:13.490> games<00:05:13.669> that<00:05:13.820> we<00:05:13.970> did<00:05:14.150> though<00:05:14.330> actually

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
few games that we did though actually

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.129 
few games that we did though actually
had<00:05:15.200> a<00:05:15.229> crossover<00:05:15.680> element<00:05:16.220> to<00:05:16.400> them<00:05:16.550> I<00:05:17.300> think

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
had a crossover element to them I think

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.240 
had a crossover element to them I think
one<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:18.889> the<00:05:19.010> ones<00:05:19.220> which<00:05:20.180> was<00:05:20.650> rather<00:05:21.650> odd<00:05:21.979> one

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
one of the ones which was rather odd one

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.950 
one of the ones which was rather odd one
was<00:05:22.970> Battletoads<00:05:23.720> Double<00:05:24.289> Dragon

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
was Battletoads Double Dragon

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.490
