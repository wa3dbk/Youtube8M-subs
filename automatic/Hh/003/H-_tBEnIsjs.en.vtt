00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.299
 bigger dear spectator here is the 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.240
 will and today we to the t 43 1 tank 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.730
 I have been with Panzers several times 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.360
 but got here one of the times 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:29.460
 better results brought recently 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.960
 and I want to show you here with mine 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.630
 explanations of how I played and 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.500
 why and why and why we have 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:42.179
 a fell stage of eight and I am one 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:46.179
 middle tank in the middle of the list 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:48.609
 That means I should try to actively 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:53.230
 play enlightenment and so on because of it 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:56.769
 There are possibilities and therefore drive 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.199
 I directly to the flank where the 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.469
 opponents always pass through guys 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.370
 and try enlightenment from there 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:11.620
 make a bit of damage as well 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:14.200
 the 25 km attempt hides 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.369
 first behind a building distracts me 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:23.409
 from and I get here already a first 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:26.590
 attention grenade around mine 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:31.350
 This colleague offers attention 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.640
 here why colleague because here's the next one 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.979
 might be fighting in my team 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.500
 could 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.170
 remember people this opponent in 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.060
 Your adversary team is not always 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.820
 your opponents it may be that the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.420
 Next are your friends and fight 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.509
 Help you pretty well and maybe 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.310
 even to win so why me 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.950
 go here to the left directly because of the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.780
 space an ally fights here on the left 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.250
 and I choose blankets before they 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.990
 Indirectly burglars push away and can do so 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.640
 Here you can easily play over the tower 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.640
 always see the tub infected 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.940
 wait until the enemy looks away from me 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.830
 if possible the 34 85 behind me 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.350
 I hope that my allied 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.910
 stand behind me in first time 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.940
 We do not deal with that directly 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.110
 drives and shoots me that he is 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.230
 do not trust he already has a few 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.360
 cashed yes so you look hard 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.660
 slightly butt shows shoot 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.200
 take a break and from it yes I one 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.540
 to press 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.850
 he gets directly from one of 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.120
 an ally looks away from me 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.209
 watch him shoot dead load benefit 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.000
 and pretty much shoot people like that 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.510
 easy in the application 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.330
 vk looks completely gone was you look 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.459
 so you have to get anyway also 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.050
 if he could not have but there 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.880
 of course you are very comfortable and away 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.480
 that one can very nicely into the tower roof 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.880
 shoot 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:16.940
 because stupid there has little armor at the 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.440
 just shoot in that way 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.440
 ally is of course right 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.459
 and because he helps me as far as I can 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.380
 we continue directly with allies 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.100
 So do not split up first 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.450
 divide 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.850
 Here I try the artillery first 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.090
 to shoot away that is very important and 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.489
 here is an enemy scout of the m 41 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.350
 bulldog before you can go away you have to 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.480
 Because of that, finally shoot away the 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.540
 eight is not the primary target 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.280
 this jag panzer of the revelation 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:05.450
 is the voted anyway the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.170
 French some 46 ii not anyway 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.180
 the best cannon in the game from 24 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:17.019
 punch shoots but seldom hits 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:20.480
 bad hits is still lawful and 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.240
 here we have an india tank of 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.340
 Almost got through already 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.200
 but somehow behind it and me 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.500
 I try to try that from here 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.650
 to uncover my so 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.110
 allies on the build up can do so 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.729
 that he practically does not flank us 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.919
 from the other side of here to 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.169
 For example , you can drive in with us 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.750
 but had not done very nice of 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.440
 I always find these opponents very much 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.120
 very very nice I must say 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.060
 Thank you mentally always with these 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.039
 adversaries 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.400
 we try to make a further appearance of the kv 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.590
 5 is behind me hope for his 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.740
 his previous support in yours 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.229
 Panzer is still here and we are 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:11.690
 suddenly see a basic shoots up 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:15.050
 its kv 5 miles allied use its 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.570
 Charge a shot twice her course 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.280
 shoot back what was here from the cellar 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.770
 I just hope he's on the 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.460
 Distance expires that I have now 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.650
 So hopefully that was my big mistake 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.780
 400 meters for cases namely with 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.410
 most accurate cannons always the opponents the 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.410
 always meet 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:42.280
 caution is down to 214 hp and 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.570
 I was still ridiculed here 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.880
 I do not know how to be 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.900
 I would have to set according to the game 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.760
 actually for the sake of being so 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.950
 it is 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.790
 then I stay enlightened because they are 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.270
 but comes back 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.980
 So in the new shot and dead 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.290
 of course my hs here completely 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.640
 Of course I forgot to use it 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.880
 that was my mistake 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.990
 but you can not decide on 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.000
 who shoots and I help with the 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.300
 decision so he was not 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.630
 More must decide shoot from India 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:26.410
 Panzer storms ahead and we save the way 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:27.669
 he also finishes fifth shot 3400 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:35.800
 damage 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:42.770
 banzers big caliber 3600 almost hurt 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:50.030
 five degrees 1478 base experience 417 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:54.460
 enlightenment 58 1942 800 net silver and 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:57.200
 Altogether there was 2395 experience for me 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.729
 but I hope this video helps you 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.950
 be able to handle the tank better 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:03.440
 a really good allrounder one 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.750
 tanks that always play 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.710
 can be on any card you can 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.110
 good use 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.880
 There is practically no map where you can 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.030
 because you did not need to go in 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.460
 contrary to many other tanks and 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.560
 I thank you for your attention 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.820
 what he has nice time and up to 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.820
 goodbye to the next video
