00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.230
 It's super simple to do. 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.719
 the fake victor or supersimple in a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.539
 even if it will give a dolphin ftx volume 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.980
 want to do is finally here with my combs 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.600
 I 'm going to fit it here well above the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.810
 mention it is in my ear 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.000
 optional and all this slice that get you 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.090
 So in my ear I make a 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.540
 window up here is more or less 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.820
 the region that I want to make an adu 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.129
 to make my fake victor 11 I 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.239
 I'll separate the rest of my hair here. 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.360
 with a piranha and I'm going to split the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.750
 kindle just to facilitate shredding 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.149
 and you do not apologize for the fact 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.390
 that such a rose here coming by purple here 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.329
 my hair needs to be touched up 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.520
 but I'm just going to say arak 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.930
 if you want too much volume to appear 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.330
 a little more convinced if you 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.900
 put enough volume will be a 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.750
 little more but you can feel 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.119
 free to advertise so I too 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.880
 I leave to divert this piece more 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.590
 is behind it will be my base 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.070
 real here of everything and also is more with 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.590
 right to leave everything to you 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:34.890
 cute here reported right 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:47.490
 on the outside I use the enem not only 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:52.409
 to diminish the appearance now I go 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.509
 give a twist here and here 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.240
 realize what you want to leave in that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.390
 more or less the same line as 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.280
 You drove, do you want to leave it here? 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 You can use a brush like those 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.310
 Grandmas to learn here but you 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.410
 Can you also use what I do? 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.040
 put the group here and put 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.170
 inside 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.840
 so I fit here diagonally and 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.879
 then it is correct into the false 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.709
 Victor Raul to form a base which gave 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.709
 a little more volume actually in it 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.319
 additionally the victor branches leave 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.689
 show your ears is not what they 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.760
 I 'll do it though normally after 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.040
 I like it a lot. 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.319
 something framing more of my 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.959
 face 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.049
 so let's do the same thing from the other 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.049
 side 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.930
 so I have to ask me I will 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.579
 let my fringe in case if you 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.799
 has fringes and may incorporate or 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.129
 let it out is quite according to 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.129
 your will 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:02.319
 I'll get my try I got it then 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:11.049
 in the sector not here I am separate the 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:14.500
 remaining here condominium island and let's 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.169
 indict will realize that I have more 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.930
 volume on this side is because I have here 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:23.109
 for my hair a little here is out of the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.239
 center and victor goals in my opinion 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.639
 It gets a lot nicer if you have a 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.650
 decentralized line 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.599
 although you may also take lessons in 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.750
 center nothing prevents you suddenly a 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.239
 monster that you think gets better 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.799
 always centralized risk and the same 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.959
 thing I'm going to make a cake then 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.849
 you can see that this false victor or 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.849
 become larger as this process has become 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.030
 a mmi and campinas symbol 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:04.959
 I do not have much hair so I use the 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:07.720
 two prizes only and you can leave the 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.540
 rest of your hair loose or you can 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.120
 leave it if you will leave the subject 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.819
 stay, I think it's cute when you 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.919
 leaves him to find some ripples and 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.639
 if in fact make two 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.200
 me the low feathers for the charm of 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.660
 bass dog 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.230
 then ae and brushes cissÃ© did not 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.840
 The teacher is really great. 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.389
 to download on any frist you 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.800
 have because of and told the then 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.350
 any hairstyle the accused does not 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.200
 it must be to this trick of the 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:46.280
 Schoolgirl is wonderful here behind me. 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.419
 I'm going to get half of my hair in two 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.190
 fingers 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:05:12.290
 Darm it up here and hold it here 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:14.419
 in the center of this little mine 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.210
 really like this kind of which that 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:23.680
 was used a lot and I think it 's 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.680
 especially in the 50's and 50's 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.700
 I put the source of this information 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.610
 I think it's very cute the way it's lonely 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.430
 My little brother here I think it stays. 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.620
 Beautiful if you upgrade with a flower 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.590
 or you can put tires for roseli 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.050
 I 'm going to put every sector or part here 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.229
 I'm going to put a killer on the back and I 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.450
 I left all my years people this 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:56.419
 I happen to like the bow to appear 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:58.220
 A little bit ahead here so you 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.770
 also if you want to put 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.150
 a chap well before victor rolls you 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.850
 can also 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.370
 and that's it I'll do the tutorial later 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.220
 how to make the sector the most 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.950
 that it is not as simple as that. 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.539
 but it's not as difficult as all of you 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.300
 want more videos as an inspiration 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:20.000
 little more beautiful more pretty it's only to give 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.530
 a jewel moves from here I walk a lot 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.060
 I do not like this kind of expression much 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.460
 lately it would be a pleasure to 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.710
 I share with you the things I 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.070
 I do not like to do that they send a little 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.690
 to a plan an older style and is 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.710
 I hope you have a day. 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.710
 magic sq
