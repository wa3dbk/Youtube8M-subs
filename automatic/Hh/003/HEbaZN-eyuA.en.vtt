gains new zealand we did play them in

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.299 
gains new zealand we did play them in
the<00:00:42.480> group<00:00:42.690> stage<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.620> strange<00:00:43.980> doubt

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the group stage so it's be strange doubt

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.119 
the group stage so it's be strange doubt
and<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.690> play<00:00:45.870> them<00:00:46.050> again<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.130 
and we have to play them again in the
quarter<00:00:47.430> finals<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:48.450> that's<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> way

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
quarter finals but that's just the way

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.319 
quarter finals but that's just the way
the<00:00:49.200> tournament<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:49.890> set<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.430> suppose<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.300> I

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the tournament was set up I suppose so I

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.439 
the tournament was set up I suppose so I
get<00:00:51.690> nearly<00:00:51.960> try<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:53.000> Aaron<00:00:54.000> Cruden

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
get nearly try and then Aaron Cruden

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.459 
get nearly try and then Aaron Cruden

it<00:01:10.979> wasn't<00:01:11.970> expected<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.930> far<00:01:13.140> ahead

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260

on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> inside<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.770> there<00:01:28.770> wasn't<00:01:28.950> much<00:01:29.220> we

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
on the inside and there wasn't much we

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.240 
on the inside and there wasn't much we
could<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.670> about<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.710> just<00:01:31.710> kicking<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
could do about that so just kicking the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
could do about that so just kicking the
bottle<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.640> play<00:01:32.850> hoping<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> buzzer<00:01:33.810> goes

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
bottle a play hoping the buzzer goes

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.490 
bottle a play hoping the buzzer goes
before<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:35.220> lands<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.299> does<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.869> we

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
before it lands out and it does so we

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.740 
before it lands out and it does so we
went<00:01:37.650> 21<00:01:38.130> points<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> 10<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.390> puts<00:01:39.630> us

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
went 21 points to 10 and that puts us

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.560 
went 21 points to 10 and that puts us
into<00:01:39.990> semi-final<00:01:40.920> against<00:01:41.220> south<00:01:41.460> africa<00:01:41.909> and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
of pressure and this was one of my

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
series so far and it's just such a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.289 
series so far and it's just such a
battle<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:57.829> really<00:01:58.829> hard<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.310> get<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
battle like is really hard to get the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.280 
talked one against the head in the scrum
and<00:02:05.369> i'm<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> look<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.840> clear<00:02:07.110> my

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and i'm just going to look to clear my

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.830 
and i'm just going to look to clear my
lines<00:02:07.530> here<00:02:07.829> if<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.399> Johnny<00:02:08.879> Sexton<00:02:09.179> no

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
lines here if I can Johnny Sexton no

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.290 
lines here if I can Johnny Sexton no
better<00:02:10.140> man<00:02:10.379> to

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
better man to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.210 
better man to
get<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.840> down<00:02:12.110> field<00:02:12.470> in<00:02:12.800> good<00:02:13.580> position<00:02:14.200> so

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
get you down field in good position so

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.740 
get you down field in good position so
thought<00:02:16.220> we<00:02:16.430> might<00:02:16.910> have<00:02:17.060> lost<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:17.510> rock

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
thought we might have lost that rock

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.420 
thought we might have lost that rock
there<00:02:17.780> but<00:02:18.200> we<00:02:18.350> committed<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.920> lot<00:02:19.160> of<00:02:19.280> numbers

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
there but we committed a lot of numbers

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.680 
there but we committed a lot of numbers
were<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.080> we<00:02:21.080> just<00:02:21.350> felt<00:02:21.620> retain<00:02:22.190> possession

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
were and we just felt retain possession

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.430 
were and we just felt retain possession
so<00:02:24.820> there's<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:26.150> there's<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:26.720> much<00:02:26.900> space<00:02:27.050> all

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
so there's it there's so much space all

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.310 
so there's it there's so much space all
right<00:02:27.710> then<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.250> they<00:02:28.670> only<00:02:28.850> have<00:02:28.940> one<00:02:29.450> player

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
right then and they only have one player

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.860 
right then and they only have one player
back<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.860> tackle<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.460> we'd<00:02:32.270> managed<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.720> throw

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
back to tackle and we'd managed to throw

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.590 
back to tackle and we'd managed to throw
the<00:02:33.050> ball<00:02:33.230> out<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:34.090> Fitzgerald<00:02:35.090> gets<00:02:35.300> into

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
the ball out and Fitzgerald gets into

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.170 
the ball out and Fitzgerald gets into
the<00:02:35.690> corner<00:02:36.050> there<00:02:36.200> Luke<00:02:36.440> Fitzgerald<00:02:37.180> making

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
the corner there Luke Fitzgerald making

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.670

a<00:02:38.270> rare<00:02:38.480> appearance<00:02:38.510> for<00:02:39.050> him<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:39.320> well<00:02:39.350> I

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
played or a bit and we end up making a

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
thought these were going to get in for a

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.530 
thought these were going to get in for a
