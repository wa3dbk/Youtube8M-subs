00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
I'm mark Stolberg from master drive and

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.230 
I'm mark Stolberg from master drive and
we're<00:00:09.450> here<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.809> talk<00:00:09.960> about<00:00:10.290> winter<00:00:10.530> driving

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240

grip the tire doesn't spin you'll get

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.510
