00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.530
 he left you as a leader 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.970
 because it is a cum of rum 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.890
 and people need a war hero 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.250

 Evgeny Ivashkin 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.730
 I did not deserve my respect 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.630
 I don't want the horde to break up 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.630

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.549

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.630
 contempt for yourself 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.110
 and when your lack of talent will become 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.750
 obvious to all 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.620

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.519

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.869
 a heart 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.509
 that is, he himself signed his sentence 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.189

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.569
 rashly break with her 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.569
 you need to think about it well 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.039
 but let elders think about it 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.149

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:08.089
