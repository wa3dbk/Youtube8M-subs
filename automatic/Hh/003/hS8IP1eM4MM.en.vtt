feature and what else are we gone it's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.889 
feature and what else are we gone it's
the<00:01:44.340> time<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> educational<00:01:45.240> market<00:01:45.630> now

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899

who's<00:01:46.170> I've<00:01:46.439> been<00:01:46.649> told<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.310> lot<00:01:47.880> it's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
who's I've been told that a lot it's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.490 
who's I've been told that a lot it's
been<00:01:48.390> nice<00:01:48.630> being<00:01:48.840> used<00:01:49.110> by<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> lot<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.409> people

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
been nice being used by a lot of people

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.200

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
not necessarily in the education market

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.760 
not necessarily in the education market
so<00:01:51.479> even<00:01:51.689> though<00:01:51.780> that's<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> marketing

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
so even though that's the marketing

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.100 
so even though that's the marketing
point<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.299> necessarily

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
point that's not necessarily

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.590 
point that's not necessarily
main<00:01:55.260> function<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:56.240> that's<00:01:57.240> what<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.510> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
main function and that's what I have to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.690 
main function and that's what I have to
say<00:01:57.750> about<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.440> it's<00:01:58.650> HP's<00:01:59.690> 2133
