00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and we are now on the search to find a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.100 
and we are now on the search to find a
replacement<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.630> where<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> story

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
replacement and that's where the story

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.460 
replacement and that's where the story
basically<00:01:07.380> starts<00:01:08.159> off<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.960> game<00:01:10.229> itself

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470

basically starts off and the game itself
the<00:01:11.130> core<00:01:11.400> engine<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.000> very<00:01:12.240> similar<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the core engine is very similar to the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.170 
the core engine is very similar to the
first<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:14.040> does<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.460> mean<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.850> improved

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
first one but does that mean it improved

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.020 
first one but does that mean it improved
in<00:01:15.360> any<00:01:15.509> way<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.009> stay<00:01:17.220> mostly<00:01:17.580> same<00:01:17.880> or

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
in any way or is it stay mostly same or

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.609 
in any way or is it stay mostly same or
as<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> got<00:01:18.360> worse<00:01:18.630> well<00:01:18.930> we're<00:01:19.110> about<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> go

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
theme of the story in the beginning and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.780 
theme of the story in the beginning and
where<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.659> ends<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.259> which<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.979> rescuing

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
Sasuke from the big evil thing even

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.219 
Sasuke from the big evil thing even
though<00:01:29.549> he<00:01:29.640> kicks<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:29.939> ass<00:01:30.000> um<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.960> story

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
though he kicks your ass um the story

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
though he kicks your ass um the story
itself<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.490> boring<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.210> felt<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.720> this

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
itself is really boring I felt and this

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.990 
itself is really boring I felt and this
isn't<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> great<00:01:34.380> arc<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.159> put<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.820> game

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
isn't a great arc to put in a game

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.630 
isn't a great arc to put in a game
because<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.479> mostly<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.900> chasing<00:01:37.640> but

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
because it's mostly just chasing but

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.789 
because it's mostly just chasing but
thing<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> make<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.570> worse<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.960> basically<00:01:40.590> put

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
thing to make it worse is basically put

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.649 
thing to make it worse is basically put
in<00:01:40.920> filler<00:01:41.189> I'm<00:01:41.670> talking<00:01:42.000> about<00:01:42.060> worse<00:01:42.360> filler

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
little done moving on to a gameplay

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.280 
little done moving on to a gameplay
which<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.480> core<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.810> game<00:03:16.930> played<00:03:17.169> as<00:03:17.260> a

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
which the core the game played as a

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.220 
which the core the game played as a
course<00:03:17.560> combat<00:03:18.310> it's<00:03:18.879> very<00:03:19.449> similar<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.989> the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
course combat it's very similar to the

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.770 
course combat it's very similar to the
first<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.949> it's<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.819> don't<00:03:21.940> know<00:03:22.359> why<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.599> just

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
first but it's I don't know why it just

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.680 
first but it's I don't know why it just
feels<00:03:23.139> different<00:03:23.260> than<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.160> first<00:03:24.569> but<00:03:25.569> it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
feels different than the first but it

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.270 
feels different than the first but it
does<00:03:25.840> have<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.079> same<00:03:26.290> core<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:26.769> terms<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.129> what

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
does have the same core in terms of what

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.189 
does have the same core in terms of what
you're<00:03:27.459> doing<00:03:27.819> same<00:03:28.419> moves<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:28.810> everything

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
you're doing same moves and everything

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.750 
you're doing same moves and everything
how<00:03:29.349> you're<00:03:29.500> doing<00:03:29.709> jutsus<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.190> everything<00:03:30.549> I

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
how you're doing jutsus and everything I

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.699 
how you're doing jutsus and everything I
don't<00:03:31.389> know<00:03:31.449> why<00:03:31.599> but<00:03:31.629> maybe<00:03:32.109> it<00:03:32.379> feels<00:03:32.560> more

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
don't know why but maybe it feels more

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.259 
don't know why but maybe it feels more
fun<00:03:32.949> of<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.129> first<00:03:33.340> only<00:03:33.579> because<00:03:33.790> they<00:03:33.909> added

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
yeah the fighting mostly stayed the same

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.530 
yeah the fighting mostly stayed the same
so<00:04:05.709> I'm<00:04:05.950> not<00:04:06.160> going<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.670> go<00:04:06.819> too<00:04:06.879> much<00:04:07.150> into<00:04:07.209> it

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
so I'm not going to go too much into it

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.040 
so I'm not going to go too much into it
I<00:04:07.660> just<00:04:07.690> felt<00:04:08.140> that<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.440> specials<00:04:08.890> overall<00:04:09.280> I

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
I just felt that the specials overall I

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.330 
I just felt that the specials overall I
like<00:04:11.050> half<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:11.440> them<00:04:11.560> were<00:04:11.709> much<00:04:11.920> better<00:04:12.099> in

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
like half of them were much better in

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.740 
like half of them were much better in
this<00:04:12.430> game<00:04:12.670> while<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:12.940> other<00:04:13.090> half<00:04:13.360> were<00:04:13.540> just

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
this game while the other half were just

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.660 
this game while the other half were just
a<00:04:13.840> pain<00:04:14.050> he<00:04:14.170> has<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.470> pull<00:04:14.650> off<00:04:14.800> like<00:04:15.069> following

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
a pain he has to pull off like following

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.699 
a pain he has to pull off like following
this<00:04:15.790> guy<00:04:16.000> what<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.239> trigger<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:17.350> all<00:04:17.560> this

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
this guy what a trigger and all this

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.039 
this guy what a trigger and all this
just<00:04:18.190> didn't<00:04:18.430> work<00:04:18.549> out<00:04:18.760> on<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.540> other<00:04:19.660> party

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
just didn't work out on the other party

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.900 
just didn't work out on the other party
gameplay<00:04:20.440> was<00:04:20.680> basically<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.370> adventure<00:04:21.790> and

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
gameplay was basically the adventure and

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.360 
gameplay was basically the adventure and
platforming<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:23.380> like<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.010> adventure

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
platforming and I like the adventure

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.280 
platforming and I like the adventure
part<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.729> like<00:04:24.910> searching<00:04:25.180> areas<00:04:25.720> i<00:04:25.750> think<00:04:26.139> that

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
part I like searching areas i think that

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.560 
part I like searching areas i think that
was<00:04:26.410> cool<00:04:26.620> but<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.340> platforming<00:04:27.910> itself<00:04:28.300> was

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
was cool but the platforming itself was

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.180 
was cool but the platforming itself was
still<00:04:28.810> paying<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.229> ass<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:29.620> falling<00:04:29.979> into

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
still paying the ass and falling into

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.500 
still paying the ass and falling into
the<00:04:30.310> river<00:04:30.430> like<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:30.729> hundred<00:04:31.060> fucking<00:04:31.270> times

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
the river like a hundred fucking times

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.780 
the river like a hundred fucking times
was<00:04:32.020> not<00:04:32.200> on<00:04:32.410> my<00:04:32.440> planner<00:04:32.860> to-do<00:04:33.250> list<00:04:33.490> in<00:04:33.639> this

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
was not on my planner to-do list in this

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.090 
was not on my planner to-do list in this
game<00:04:34.000> so<00:04:34.330> i<00:04:34.540> have<00:04:35.290> to<00:04:35.470> say<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.680> while<00:04:36.010> the

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
game so i have to say that while the

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.500 
game so i have to say that while the
adventure<00:04:36.490> was<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.669> cool<00:04:36.880> idea<00:04:36.910> the

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
adventure was a cool idea the

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.420 
adventure was a cool idea the
platforming<00:04:38.200> just<00:04:38.410> made<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.800> crap<00:04:39.130> and

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
platforming just made it crap and

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.180 
platforming just made it crap and
overall<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.570> combat<00:04:41.110> system<00:04:41.260> once<00:04:41.860> again

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
overall the combat system once again

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.340 
overall the combat system once again
just<00:04:42.550> feels<00:04:42.790> like<00:04:43.030> really<00:04:43.600> weak<00:04:43.840> Orlin

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
just feels like really weak Orlin

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.260 
just feels like really weak Orlin

definitely anime feel to it over trying
to<00:04:46.389> be<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.570> true<00:04:46.840> fighter<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.669> I<00:04:48.669> guess<00:04:49.120> our

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
to be a true fighter and I guess our

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.600 
to be a true fighter and I guess our
