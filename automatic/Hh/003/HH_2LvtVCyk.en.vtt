00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
to do is hit the silver button because

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.140 
to do is hit the silver button because
I've<00:02:42.379> got<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.680> green<00:02:43.010> light<00:02:43.310> for<00:02:43.549> go<00:02:43.760> right

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.569 
I've got the green light for go right
here<00:02:44.450> on<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.629> t45<00:02:45.169> so<00:02:45.709> let's<00:02:45.859> start<00:02:46.099> brewing

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.149 

so<00:02:49.579> again<00:02:49.819> the<00:02:49.939> t45<00:02:50.510> will<00:02:51.049> take<00:02:51.319> a<00:02:51.590> little<00:02:52.010> bit

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
so again the t45 will take a little bit

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.879 
so again the t45 will take a little bit
longer<00:02:52.430> than<00:02:52.699> some<00:02:52.969> machines<00:02:53.419> to<00:02:54.109> figure<00:02:54.680> out

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
longer than some machines to figure out

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.159 
longer than some machines to figure out
how<00:02:55.579> it<00:02:55.849> needs<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.209> brew<00:02:56.629> the<00:02:56.840> drink<00:02:57.109> that

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
how it needs to brew the drink that

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.619 
how it needs to brew the drink that
you're<00:02:57.469> creating<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:58.370> that's<00:02:58.639> because<00:02:58.909> it

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
you're creating but that's because it

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.589 
you're creating but that's because it
has<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.049> read<00:03:00.290> that<00:03:00.590> barcode<00:03:01.159> on<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:02.120> T<00:03:02.329> disk

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
has to read that barcode on the T disk

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.780 
has to read that barcode on the T disk
and<00:03:02.840> figure<00:03:03.199> out<00:03:03.260> how<00:03:03.500> much<00:03:03.620> water<00:03:03.919> it<00:03:04.519> needs

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
and figure out how much water it needs

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.360 
and figure out how much water it needs
to<00:03:04.969> put<00:03:05.180> into<00:03:05.750> this<00:03:05.930> t<00:03:06.199> disc<00:03:06.409> but<00:03:06.859> still<00:03:07.069> starts

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
to put into this t disc but still starts

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.759 
to put into this t disc but still starts
up<00:03:07.519> real<00:03:07.730> quickly<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.359> the<00:03:09.319> thing<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.590> like

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
up real quickly and the thing I like

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.920 
up real quickly and the thing I like
about<00:03:09.799> this<00:03:10.129> is<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.609> this<00:03:10.849> is<00:03:10.909> sort<00:03:11.689> of<00:03:11.840> a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
about this is that this is sort of a

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.780 
about this is that this is sort of a
more<00:03:12.169> traditional<00:03:12.199> hot<00:03:13.010> chocolates<00:03:13.459> coming
