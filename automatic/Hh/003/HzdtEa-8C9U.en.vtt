them<00:00:28.920> open<00:00:29.480> in<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:30.779> red<00:00:31.710> controller<00:00:32.160> I've

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
them open in my red controller I've

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.130 
them open in my red controller I've
broken<00:00:33.030> them<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.750> does<00:00:33.930> nothing

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
broken them but you see it does nothing

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.220

really<00:00:34.590> there's<00:00:35.309> no<00:00:35.430> difference<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
really there's no difference so it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.479 
really there's no difference so it
doesn't<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:37.530> matter<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.040> snap<00:00:38.309> them

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
doesn't really matter if you snap them

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069 
doesn't really matter if you snap them
but<00:00:38.820> obviously<00:00:39.210> some<00:00:39.450> people<00:00:39.750> want<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.930> keep

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
but obviously some people want to keep

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.010 
but obviously some people want to keep
their<00:00:40.140> controllers<00:00:41.300> neat<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.480> tidy<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:42.870> they

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.640 
a lot more easier make sure you don't
put<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.259> as<00:01:45.410> you<00:01:45.619> see<00:01:45.800> it<00:01:45.830> has<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.130> ribbon

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
put it as you see it has a ribbon

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.270 
put it as you see it has a ribbon
connecting<00:01:48.650> it<00:01:49.240> don't<00:01:50.240> feel<00:01:50.420> free<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:51.280> just

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
connecting it don't feel free to just

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.240 
connecting it don't feel free to just
pull<00:01:52.850> that<00:01:52.880> out<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:54.229> does<00:01:54.410> nothing<00:01:54.740> really<00:01:54.920> and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
pull that out it does nothing really and

pull that out it does nothing really and
then<00:01:55.460> there<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.670> go<00:01:55.820> your<00:01:55.970> controllers<00:01:56.450> open

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
then there you go your controllers open

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.380 
then there you go your controllers open
