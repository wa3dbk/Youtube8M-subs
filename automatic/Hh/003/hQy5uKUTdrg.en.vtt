here<00:00:15.530> at<00:00:15.770> model<00:00:16.160> services<00:00:16.640> and<00:00:16.849> Hasbro<00:00:17.300> and

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
here at model services and Hasbro and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.480 
here at model services and Hasbro and
what<00:00:18.200> we<00:00:18.349> do<00:00:18.560> is<00:00:18.770> we<00:00:18.950> create<00:00:19.099> all<00:00:19.369> the

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
what we do is we create all the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.220 
what we do is we create all the
prototypes<00:00:20.000> that<00:00:20.119> are<00:00:20.630> required<00:00:20.960> for

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
prototypes that are required for

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.010 
prototypes that are required for
development<00:00:21.619> of<00:00:21.770> any<00:00:21.890> of<00:00:22.040> our<00:00:22.189> samples<00:00:23.119> so

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
development of any of our samples so

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.780 
development of any of our samples so
what<00:00:24.230> you<00:00:24.349> see<00:00:24.529> here<00:00:24.770> is<00:00:24.829> a<00:00:24.860> nice<00:00:25.099> sort<00:00:25.730> of

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
what you see here is a nice sort of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.010 
what you see here is a nice sort of
selection<00:00:26.060> of<00:00:26.239> all<00:00:26.450> the<00:00:26.599> different<00:00:26.869> stuff

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
selection of all the different stuff

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.979 
selection of all the different stuff
that<00:00:27.050> we<00:00:27.259> work<00:00:27.470> on<00:00:27.680> in<00:00:27.860> a<00:00:27.919> given<00:00:28.189> year<00:00:31.989> we're

that we work on in a given year we're

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.900 
that we work on in a given year we're
roughly<00:00:33.320> a<00:00:33.410> group<00:00:33.620> of<00:00:33.739> about<00:00:33.920> 40<00:00:34.340> individuals

all different disciplines we have
traditional<00:00:36.739> model<00:00:37.040> makers<00:00:37.280> we<00:00:37.430> have<00:00:37.520> people

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
traditional model makers we have people

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.850 
traditional model makers we have people
to<00:00:37.940> do<00:00:38.090> CAD<00:00:38.390> we<00:00:39.020> have<00:00:39.170> photographer

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
to do CAD we have photographer

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.550 
to do CAD we have photographer
electronics<00:00:40.610> soft<00:00:40.880> goods<00:00:41.180> between<00:00:42.050> all<00:00:42.380> of<00:00:42.410> us

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
electronics soft goods between all of us

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:51.940 
electronics soft goods between all of us
we<00:00:43.010> can<00:00:43.040> make<00:00:43.220> stuff

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.590 

some<00:00:52.550> of<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.700> other<00:00:52.790> stuff<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:53.030> we<00:00:53.210> work<00:00:53.420> on

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
some of the other stuff that we work on

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.260 
some of the other stuff that we work on
or<00:00:53.810> animatronic<00:00:54.530> stuff<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:55.910> here<00:00:56.150> you<00:00:56.180> see

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
or animatronic stuff and so here you see

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.420 
or animatronic stuff and so here you see
Elmo<00:00:56.630> without<00:00:57.080> blush<00:00:57.350> on<00:00:57.620> them<00:00:57.740> and<00:00:57.950> this<00:00:58.280> is

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
Elmo without blush on them and this is

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.670 
Elmo without blush on them and this is
where<00:00:58.580> we<00:00:58.730> really<00:00:58.880> think<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.330> magic<00:00:59.780> is<00:00:59.960> so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.900 

everybody<00:01:03.680> understands<00:01:04.280> Elmo<00:01:04.520> when<00:01:04.670> he<00:01:04.760> has

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
everybody understands Elmo when he has

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.580 
everybody understands Elmo when he has
this<00:01:05.030> blush<00:01:05.330> on<00:01:05.540> but<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:05.840> magic<00:01:06.170> is<00:01:06.290> really<00:01:06.500> in

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
this blush on but the magic is really in

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.620 
this blush on but the magic is really in
the<00:01:06.650> mechanism<00:01:07.220> in<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.490> coating<00:01:08.300> to<00:01:08.479> get<00:01:08.600> a

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
the mechanism in the coating to get a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.050 
the mechanism in the coating to get a
look<00:01:08.960> lifelike<00:01:09.440> though<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:10.100> really<00:01:10.729> like<00:01:10.910> the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
look lifelike though I really like the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.100 
look lifelike though I really like the

hand painting actually was a natural
transition<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.770> me<00:01:37.040> but<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> coolest<00:01:38.430> thing

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
transition for me but the coolest thing

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.630 
transition for me but the coolest thing
about<00:01:38.640> all<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.740> any<00:01:40.740> store<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> go<00:01:41.580> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
about all of this is any store I go to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.630 
about all of this is any store I go to
and<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.480> carry<00:01:42.720> transformers<00:01:43.410> I<00:01:43.620> can<00:01:44.520> look

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and they carry transformers I can look

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520 
and they carry transformers I can look
at<00:01:44.760> the<00:01:44.820> back<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.150> package<00:01:45.480> and<00:01:45.870> see<00:01:46.440> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
at the back of the package and see the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
at the back of the package and see the
model<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.950> I've<00:01:47.040> painted<00:01:47.250> because<00:01:47.760> this<00:01:48.120> is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
model that I've painted because this is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.200 
model that I've painted because this is
the<00:01:48.330> exact<00:01:48.690> model<00:01:48.870> that<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> paint<00:01:49.830> on<00:01:50.210> every

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the exact model that I paint on every

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.900 
the exact model that I paint on every
package<00:01:51.690> they<00:01:52.050> photograph<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.800> so<00:01:53.729> that's

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
package they photograph it so that's

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.430 
package they photograph it so that's
kind<00:01:54.120> of<00:01:54.180> awesome<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.720> only<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.170> go

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
kind of awesome and only I can go

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.590 
kind of awesome and only I can go
wherever<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.890> want<00:01:56.190> pick<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.000> package<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.479> be

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
wherever I want pick up a package and be

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.910 
wherever I want pick up a package and be
like<00:01:57.780> yeah<00:01:57.990> that's<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> model<00:01:58.530> I've<00:01:58.710> danced

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
like yeah that's the model I've danced

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:51.900 
like yeah that's the model I've danced
so<00:01:59.670> it's<00:02:00.180> kind<00:02:00.330> of<00:02:00.360> cool
