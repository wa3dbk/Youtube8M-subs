00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 the knee joint is the biggest joint of the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.200
 human body 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.410
 it is very complex structure, it is 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.259
 laterally supported by the side edges 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.820
 support these movements and forward 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.990
 and behind it is supported by the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.510
 crossbands know the minis serve as 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.720
 shock absorbers so the shock loads 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.830
 less is the knee joint is added 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.250
 athletic activity very stressed 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.140
 team sports and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.809
 contact sports such as football or 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.420
 handball but also skiing or 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.210
 endurance sports weight this 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.590
 Knee very much it is important to have a strong 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.260
 to have musculature 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.899
 so that the knee is stabilized and supported 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.329
 something should happen nevertheless 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.789
 like an accident or a twisting of the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.020
 Knee would be the so-called pitch rule 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.000
 apply 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.840
 the pearl includes pause compression 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.539
 and camp by the high camp 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.210
 the whole pain receptors and 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.200
 toxins are recycled and the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.159
 Pain eases 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.439
 The pollen also helps with inflammation 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.049
 Here is a drop wrap 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.850
 I would prefer you to them 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.220
 few exercises show the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.259
 stabilization of the knee serve the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.000
 Squat is the functional exercise for 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.640
 the knee 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.570
 It is important to follow the butt 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.460
 at the back gives as if you sit down 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.190
 and knees are not in front of the cdu tip 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.479
 there else is behind the 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.460
 kneecap and very high pressure 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.320
 together 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.210
 Furthermore, the knee should not be more 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.210
 to be bent 90 degrees 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.430
 balance exercises are also 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.729
 Highly recommended that he was the little one 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.290
 Musculature train very well 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.619
 Citizen for the beginning 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.380
 you can go to the next step 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.910
 the closer one gets the harder it gets 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.030
 it 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.560
 you should be as free as possible 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.020
 and if this is easily possible 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.020
 you can change to a foot 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.420
 if at some point one of the legs stood 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.260
 maybe you can get one 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.970
 get the towel together 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.450
 thus stabilizing something 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.450
 becomes more difficult 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.900
 a bit more exhausting than the squats 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:53.610
 during the default step one becomes one 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.300
 with one leg back and again 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.770
 Forward 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:02.010
 The burden is then primarily one never 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.290
 it should be careful that the 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.310
 kneecap not outward or inward 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.760
 but always slides straight back 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.760
 going 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.319
 should the knee be sworn once 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.469
 would be the best sport cycling 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.319
 there's the knee good point what else 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:28.780
 good helps the so-called green jersey 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.319
 You take a chilled one 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.769
 congresses or directly out and rubs 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:40.480
 so that the knee directly 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:43.829
 but for a maximum of 25 seconds and moves 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.420
 it then for 1 in two minutes 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:51.579
 all can be repeated three times 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:55.530
 like the 25 seconds right on your knees and 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.530
 then move back two minutes
