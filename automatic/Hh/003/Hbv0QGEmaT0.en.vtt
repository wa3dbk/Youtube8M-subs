00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.510
 from minecraft that is to put your point 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.930

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.180
 it's called the king mini 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.220
 which is actually a map and a 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.500
 orientation to mix you can also 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.050
 see where you die to go pick up your 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.270

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.970
 openwork 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.800
 first they closed minecraft then we 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.640
 we go to the link in the description that 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.640
 caravaca abajito 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.980
 we go down we go down we go down and here 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.989
 where it comes from we look for our 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.070
 brand version in this case the one 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:50.699
 it came out yesterday that is the new 1.3 point 1 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.699
 it would be this we click on download 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.650
 when we tell you click it will reload a 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.290
 page and the upper right will come out 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.630
 please wait for 3 seconds 5 but 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.490
 wait a few seconds when they are finished 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.530
 where they give jump advertising 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.340
 then that is high speed will come out 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.580
 that was downloaded, double-click them and 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.560
 it will open an action winrar el win 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.500
 give also worked for them to download 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.130
 the program then they go to start and 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.440
 write percent to tata percent what 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.320
 I will also put here in a box 2 san 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.860
 Luis inside outgoing until now there 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.930
 is there and they are going to put on 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.480
 percent is percent are going to running 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.760
 the first folder that appeared to them 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.400
 then he pointed minecraft which is the first 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.230
 to Caesar in the second should be the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.720
 first then to dyn 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.790
 ya minecraft give you right click and 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.610
 open with good weird files 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.790
 then that is this we click on 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.010
 nothing else in the meta folder and they give in 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.320
 the button here riddick to eliminate city 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.030
 per se 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.590
 it is very important that you should eliminate 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.220
 this since if it does not give you the screen 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.670
 black and it will not work then we 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.890
 let's go to the winter file of minimum reis 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.140
 all these files hang the files 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.080
 it does not matter if with these two dots the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.300
 problem, nothing happens after the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.090
 governments are going to point minecraft 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.459
 minecraft here and copy it down here 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.870
 because the side does not give not try 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.390
 pick it up wait because it's the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.450
 people have a folder and it's not going to 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.360
 result so here all good everything short and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.880
 they give in to accept 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.660
 this is installed the rhythm we are going to 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.930
 test it or closed 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.270
 they carry everything 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.140
 and if they go to minecraft 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:53.530
 deliver let's create a world without light 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:57.420
 Bayern believes that it has not been greater 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.420
 and they wait for them to open 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.860
 it's a purple thing because I have many 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.280
 installed in minecraft so you have to 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.790
 wait 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.210
 The important thing to structure is to eliminate 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.030
 the meta folder and there it is as you see 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:17.800
 but in that I'm going to enlarge this 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.690
 there is such a rival you give in the letter m in your 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.370
 keyboard and the options for 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.900
 put a point they go to kan says 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:29.850
 waypoints then up and write as you 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.850
 will call on youtube 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.420
 and here they say the color of the point 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.240
 in my case it will be I think that just as 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.380
 they give in ok 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:47.470
 and it's not ready anymore and they give the ms 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.560
 bank rbak and exit less 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.450
 young wherever we leave the map 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.960
 forgive me for the lac but I have 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.970
 full screen will come out there the point 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.460
 that they saved and can save it in 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.340
 your home to make adventures further and 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.470
 Then come back and do not get lost too if 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.600
 bone installed remind the m 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.950
 new says dead point we give in this and 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.260
 6 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.840
 when they die they will have left 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.090
 saved the point where they die will come out 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.560
 this same thing that ends but in red and 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.889
 so you go where you die and you pick up 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.620
 your things if we go here 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:31.120
 surface plus option 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:34.120
 here was not at minimum option here they can 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.470
 see how they want to customize it 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.320
 by a little circle and bigger leads in 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.050
 where many things will also be seen 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.990
 can change the texture this will be like this 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.400
 which is a highly recommended mode for 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.729
 that they go far away from home and not 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.080
 they want to get lost this is a mod 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.199
 minimal reid I hope that they have 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.979
 enjoyed that they comment and subscribe 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.979
 goodbye
