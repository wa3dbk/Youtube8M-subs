00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:06.870
 best children the past six weeks Belgian flags have once been sold 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.409
 as has ever been the case in that 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.379
 in other words it is literally proven 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.990
 Sign up is but still it will not surprise you from the lower store 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.790
 that is not something we have had no cortenbach to do since our skill 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.130
 a few at the brave market need that flags are on 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.929
 that primary education 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.619
 Mackill on the nothing was someone from the record store that one said 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.350
 since the union 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.030
 but a King of Baudouin that comes in many ways 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.390
 who sold it and I think that is a bit of a semester 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.980
 I think a little but can rock and not the hole 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.080
 very good with buying 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.630
 then I know how to use dementia and the disease and method 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.920
 and she sees boy 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.319
 the nds it's one that is shattered 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:50.290
 to the bone of stress 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.080
 in April I was also immediately the injured ballmer because what someone 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.010
 did not want to ruin 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.140
 I like it because of the wind remains nice for the judiciary 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.640
 but let the people but even with a light they may do exactly what is 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.190
 life 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.909
 What is special about you is that it is not exactly what it is that you do best 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.820
 with Dutch kaag and braassem getting away in the looks I wanted 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.950
 where is the structure of that full hair 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.280
 so look 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.350
 so anyway room 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.009
 but what do you want with them is not worried there 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.610
 which amounted to articles 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.590
 I always find it very sad that you are starting to discover why park and something like that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.500
 however, as an afternoon church comes the next male fight 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.570
 if we had known that we had to split up like a bell 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.140
 the ambulance doom and seepage are split 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.270
 and Johan Hoornsevaart discussions about we must have our colleague at must 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.020
 split more than sol 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.580
 there is not much that can be said because both parties have developed this 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.960
 but it takes way too long 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.520
 or should we take a little less time to split up the college but if 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.920
 help someone nobody wanted and bottom the top that is a conscious then can 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.750
 You cannot exhibit anything below until now, but maybe we can 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.520
 nevertheless exhibit in the museum of tervuren as soon as less stand out 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.020
 but what now appears what is right now 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.740
 8 by which were 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.209
 I thought our fellow alderman like a ribbon like myself as a bach mayor 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.589
 sometimes a ribbon drogba danny koevermans keep but in red 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:20.739
 it is not the intention that people keep the tapeworm and that is funny x 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.619
 amount can ribbon in my ass the protest of the fact that 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:28.960
 main glass to shorten a nightclub tomtom fire department 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.970
 just sleep whatever you want 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.780
 posters of the fientje moerman ikink weertman mo messaoud trillion dollars 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.620
 has stuck to the walls this is a wonderful moment finding comes true 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.389
 protest against the closure of the ribbon factory in kontich 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.169
 at the expense of the alcohol 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.969
 the new front runner win the court prizes 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.529
 they also have a lot to cut short 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:54.789
 but now it turns out that our competitors are ahead of the city council's password 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.859
 probably because I have a documentation material where I have to 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.989
 say beware this is an april in the Broekhorst waltz king a powerful 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.900
 wind will now show that it is at knee 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.609
 is like being the world 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.939
 but now it appears that politicians are the nuclear reactors for this 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.729
 wormer spring also during the check during rush hour 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:18.429
 so this stage in terms of oceans spot laudrup parrots paul mccartney 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.850
 the snack bar in his blood 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.809
 so now it appears that the 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:26.069
 in addition, a canary paper only 9 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.599
 picking up 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:31.640
 just 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.379
 I can't be broken 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.379
 now that appears 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.509
 that can 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:42.829
 I was 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.579
