00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.650
 the classic ballet emerged in the 16th century in Italy 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.190
 at that time change is admired by the more dense artist mobilization 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.190
 developed when he arrived in France 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.220
 the 20th century national contemporary dance with the intention of making a 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 break with the principles of classical ballet 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.190
 these two types of dance also have differences in forms and 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.730
 transmission of ideas 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.729
 classic ballet 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.679
 to start is much more difficult contemporary terms of learning 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.550
 he has a whole technique he has every year he refused in the month 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.870
 and that it's all very straightforward very hard three boats because of the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.360
 increase in all this 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.220
 rigid earth 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.160
 tips 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.300
 and I have to do not to hire the athlete but only the present consider 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.450
 what the dance 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.880
 currently made every sector of the big field 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.770
 she explores it asks a bit of the art of classical dance agents and drinking 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.869
 enough depending on the unstructured subject but could also ask for shelter 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.500
 is to give up all of it intimidate 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.590
 other techniques other type of training 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.479
 another site with some waterfront driving, some of which we only train in 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.229
 November 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.880
 the former coach 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.460
 let's train sports entities 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.240
 the classical ballet and abbot for those who want to become the area 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.189
 even those who prefer contemporary dance must first learn 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.230
 The classic steps that makes classic ballet makes any kind of 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.880
 currently many people sought from the classical as a form of dance therapy 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.090
 helps to relax and is still a form of physical exercise we spend a time 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.960
 positive because 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 It's up to older people today. 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.250
 between 40 and two are already looking for ballet therapy 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.610
 and even gymnastics attitude because she will get that treadmill pedal walking 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.610
 or on a bike then entered the room are 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.609
 metaphor relate to her 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.129
 I think that these problems in order to work with the modern worker 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.849
 classic ballet almost nine months technical have to win practice it 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.209
 must obey to norms and traditional rules already the contemporary ballet 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.130
 does not care so much about the technique 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.460
 finally transmitting emotions and feelings this modern dance came 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.579
 breaking with the principles of the shack 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.849
 but mostly a hassle 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.569
 most of the time with the deconstruction of the movement while 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.239
 that classic ballet 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.169
 work full time with contemporary dance construction 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.979
 seeks to interact with reality 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.640
 through choreographies of dÃ©cio not 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.640
 world and society and points to new paths 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.689
 mandarin who practices this art has several techniques 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.639
 a thing that is defined very interesting in this contemporary dance 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.779
 possibility of centralizing all bodies 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.429
 do not wait another one of the ground floor the techniques of militant race in great 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.339
 velocity 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.339
 they are all possible in the contemporary scenario body 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.550
 but these two changes I can not think of differences 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.980
 for those who want to practice classical ballet to contemporary dance with the main 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.980
 It's all about having discipline. 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.159
 the dash fascinates and thrills my true majority can not convey 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.010
 palms choreographies the feeling of passion and complicity with the audience 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.299
 In this profession most dancers are passionate about what they do. 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.919
 I come here every day, and in my house I watch the video on the 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.399
 youtube and I love you 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:09.919
 our day knowledge of the great arenas and it is also essential to 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.919
 separation of parents at the time of registration 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:17.899
 I do not know if investing in the experience is sure to dance 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.939

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:22.179
