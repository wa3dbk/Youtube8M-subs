 free space I deleted the whole folder 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.859
 system32 that looked there and saw that it was 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.510

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.799
 Next I bought according to how to work 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.510
 on that computer that turned off the 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:44.510
 He ate the leather then he hit until I turned 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.939

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.169
 but it has what the comb that was the total is 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.120
 the reader our mother and passed 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.370
 hours here in the country saying pinto 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.439

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.519
 and looking at this image here made me 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.260
 remember the game I played the most 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.560
 windows 98 was the only game that ran 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.200
 neodi rech This was the game that I most 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.810
 played with 8 years of age and the best of 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.340
 all were the cutscenes of this game that 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.379
 marked a lot because it was too much 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.389
 violence to me that a child was okay 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.479
 connected not even know if this game was bigger than 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:25.040
 16 or 18 you look this the cop 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:27.859
 simply picked up that it was kind a 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.629
 motorcycle dealer and thief I 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:33.409
 he carried a bunch of weapons that was cool 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.299
 Current galley taco and then you could catch me 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.699
 I took everything I had that was 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.470
 me and then arrested me on that 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.030
 when I was caught and you ask me is until 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.759
 Why are you afraid of a big dog? 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.879
 because I really have and then one of the 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:48.960
 70% reasons why is because 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.990
 of that pool 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.540
 This is rottweiler I do not know who's a cop. 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.650
 Let it go, just get me on my 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.830
 God, that made a lot of difference. 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.220
 30% of my trauma for a dog that 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.530
 bit on Easter and mouth too 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.510
 was that it was then a bite of a 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.150
 dog that he wanted to give me a kiss and 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.840
 then it turned out to be a bit aggressive 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.540
 and others , and a splinter my kiss and then 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.120
 continuing the same realizing of 1 100 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.830

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.600
 I asked my brother to install windows xp 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.880

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.530
