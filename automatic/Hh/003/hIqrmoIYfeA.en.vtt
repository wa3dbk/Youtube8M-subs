00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.069 
create something really cool so if you
listen<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.460> Caius<00:01:47.759> if<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.600> listen<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> queen

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
listen to Caius if you listen to queen

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.170 
listen to Caius if you listen to queen
of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.259> Stone<00:01:49.500> Age<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> same<00:01:50.850> sound

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
of the Stone Age it's the same sound

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
of the Stone Age it's the same sound
ultimately<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.979> guess<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> whoever

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
ultimately so I guess if the whoever

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.880 
ultimately so I guess if the whoever
writes<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> most<00:01:54.689> songs<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.350> guess<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.770> there

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
writes the most songs I guess that there

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.560 
writes the most songs I guess that there
you're<00:01:56.310> trying<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.759> make<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> most<00:01:56.939> money<00:01:57.149> I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
you're trying to make the most money I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.959 
you're trying to make the most money I
guess<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.020> feel<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.159> you

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
guess they feel that they have to you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
guess they feel that they have to you
know<00:02:00.030> they<00:02:00.240> don't<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.899> bond<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.350> Eric

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
know they don't have this bond that Eric

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.770 
know they don't have this bond that Eric
