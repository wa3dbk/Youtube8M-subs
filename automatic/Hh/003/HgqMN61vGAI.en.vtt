our<00:01:51.600> tests<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:51.930> shown<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.409> gives<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> a

have<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.479> remember<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.930> steering<00:02:01.229> is

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
have to remember that steering is

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.800 
have to remember that steering is
directly<00:02:01.829> related<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.280> thrust<00:02:02.700> at<00:02:03.119> high<00:02:03.329> rpm

you'll<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.140> risk<00:02:04.530> steering<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.369> low

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
you'll have risk steering and at low

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.969 
you'll have risk steering and at low
speed<00:02:05.909> not<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.540> much<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> new<00:02:07.530> downward

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
speed not so much but the new downward

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.190 
speed not so much but the new downward
deflected<00:02:08.459> thrust<00:02:08.759> will<00:02:09.000> help<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:10.020> should

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
deflected thrust will help you should

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.460 
deflected thrust will help you should
also<00:02:10.319> get<00:02:10.530> into<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> half

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
also get into the half

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.809 
also get into the half
adding<00:02:11.740> a<00:02:11.800> bit<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:11.950> thrust<00:02:12.340> when<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:12.640> want<00:02:12.790> to

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
adding a bit of thrust when you want to

at low speed crank the wheel over and

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.170 
at low speed crank the wheel over and
add<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.260> burst<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.709> power<00:02:17.770> turn<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.790> straighten

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
add a burst of power turn to straighten
