was put on for example let's show you
this<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:03.420> around<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:04.009> like<00:01:05.009> this<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.339> frame

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
this one around here like this a frame

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.649 
this one around here like this a frame
panel<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.210> put<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.200> had<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:08.240> not<00:01:09.240> denser

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
panel was put on but had then not denser

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.450 
panel was put on but had then not denser
bits<00:01:10.020> were<00:01:10.140> raised<00:01:10.470> sticking<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.220> stuff

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
bits were raised sticking out and stuff

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.960 
bits were raised sticking out and stuff
like<00:01:11.610> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
like that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
like that
they're<00:01:12.570> obviously<00:01:12.659> pattern<00:01:13.140> panels<00:01:13.560> they've

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
they're obviously pattern panels they've

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
they're obviously pattern panels they've
been<00:01:13.829> welded<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.579> but<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> car

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
been welded as you can see but the car

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.429 
been welded as you can see but the car
was<00:01:15.930> actually<00:01:16.049> orange<00:01:16.829> originally<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.439> rather

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
was actually orange originally so rather

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.960 
was actually orange originally so rather
than<00:01:19.619> take<00:01:19.829> it<00:01:19.860> right<00:01:20.220> back<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.579> bare<00:01:20.790> metal

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
than take it right back to bare metal

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.160 
than take it right back to bare metal
because<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.450> obviously<00:01:21.720> been<00:01:21.869> sprayed

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
because it's obviously been sprayed

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.749 
because it's obviously been sprayed
about<00:01:22.470> three<00:01:22.680> or<00:01:22.770> four<00:01:22.920> times<00:01:22.950> wider<00:01:23.399> looks<00:01:23.640> at

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
about three or four times wider looks at

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.910 
about three or four times wider looks at
the<00:01:23.880> levels<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.299> paint<00:01:24.509> money<00:01:24.740> which<00:01:25.740> would

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the levels of paint money which would

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.499 
the levels of paint money which would
have<00:01:26.009> been<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> hell<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.460> lot<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.700> work<00:01:26.880> what

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
have been a hell of a lot of work what

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
have been a hell of a lot of work what
we<00:01:27.600> decided<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.770> take<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
we decided to do is just to take the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.149 
we decided to do is just to take the
service<00:01:30.210> down<00:01:30.420> smooth<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:33.290> around<00:01:34.290> 120

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
service down smooth with around 120

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.750 
service down smooth with around 120
paper<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:35.670> went<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:36.120> to<00:01:36.210> 240<00:01:37.640> until<00:01:38.640> we've

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
paper then went up to 240 until we've

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.280 
paper then went up to 240 until we've
got<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> smooth<00:01:39.210> surface<00:01:39.510> and<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.020> Prime

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
got a smooth surface and then we Prime

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
got a smooth surface and then we Prime
the<00:01:40.470> whole<00:01:40.620> lot<00:01:40.860> which<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.549> situation<00:01:41.760> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the whole lot which is the situation you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.420 
the whole lot which is the situation you
can<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.450> now<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.930> basically<00:01:43.890> filled<00:01:44.190> in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
can see now and basically filled in

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.740 
can see now and basically filled in
dense<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.970> high<00:01:45.210> spots

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
dense and high spots

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.480 
dense and high spots
treated<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.440> damnit<00:01:46.740> treated<00:01:47.010> high<00:01:47.159> spots

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
treated at the damnit treated high spots

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.580 
treated at the damnit treated high spots
and<00:01:48.270> filled<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.870> mean<00:01:48.990> there<00:01:49.080> wasn't<00:01:49.229> too<00:01:49.409> many

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and filled I mean there wasn't too many

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.350 
and filled I mean there wasn't too many
I<00:01:49.890> mean<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.310> example<00:01:51.080> down<00:01:52.080> here<00:01:52.110> was<00:01:53.360> some

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
I mean for example down here was some

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.760 
I mean for example down here was some
ripples<00:01:54.750> which<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.049> can<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.380> we're<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
ripples which you can see we're in the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.170 
ripples which you can see we're in the
process<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.190> just<00:01:56.310> finishing<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.790> repair

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
process of just finishing that repair

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.460 
process of just finishing that repair
now<00:01:57.500> there<00:01:58.500> was<00:01:58.680> been<00:01:58.979> sand<00:01:59.520> stuff<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
now there was been sand stuff in the

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.670 
now there was been sand stuff in the
side<00:02:01.470> of<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> wings<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.840> roof<00:02:04.440> had<00:02:04.650> a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
side of the wings here the roof had a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.530 
side of the wings here the roof had a
dent<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.520> which<00:02:05.670> has<00:02:05.790> now<00:02:05.940> been<00:02:06.119> filled<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
dent in it which has now been filled and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.080 
dent in it which has now been filled and
rubbed<00:02:06.780> down<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.619> basically<00:02:08.610> we're<00:02:08.909> at<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
rubbed down and basically we're at the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.490 
rubbed down and basically we're at the
stage<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:09.390> where<00:02:10.640> we're<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:12.170> finally<00:02:13.170> going

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
stage now where we're just finally going

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.990 
stage now where we're just finally going
over<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.890> whole<00:02:14.040> car<00:02:15.230> with<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:19.790> visual<00:02:20.790> look

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
over the whole car with a visual look

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.670 
over the whole car with a visual look
just<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.599> make<00:02:21.750> sure<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.170> there's<00:02:22.349> no<00:02:22.530> other

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
just to make sure that there's no other

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.550 
just to make sure that there's no other
spots<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.189> need<00:02:23.459> repairing<00:02:24.140> as<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.260> say<00:02:25.409> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
spots that need repairing as I say the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.420 
spots that need repairing as I say the
four<00:02:25.769> car<00:02:26.010> now<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.549> primer<00:02:27.019> and<00:02:28.220> it's<00:02:29.220> just

to put another skimmer filler over that

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.840 
to put another skimmer filler over that
once<00:03:00.310> we<00:03:00.430> put<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:01.560> cover<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.710> primer<00:03:03.370> on<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.640> just

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
it's not a small car easy to spray easy

the roof there as you can see and as I

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.330 
the roof there as you can see and as I

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
say all the glass has been removed so

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.460 
say all the glass has been removed so
you're<00:03:39.459> getting<00:03:39.700> full<00:03:39.910> spray<00:03:40.270> up<00:03:40.450> here<00:03:40.660> what

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
you're getting full spray up here what

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.940 
you're getting full spray up here what
we've<00:03:41.620> done<00:03:41.740> around<00:03:42.100> them<00:03:43.410> here<00:03:44.410> as<00:03:44.560> well<00:03:44.769> for

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
we've done around them here as well for

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.290 
we've done around them here as well for
example<00:03:45.370> there's<00:03:45.550> note<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.060> know<00:03:46.239> to

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
example there's note that you know to

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.240 
example there's note that you know to
collect<00:03:46.660> water<00:03:46.840> around<00:03:47.140> there<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:48.040> what<00:03:48.160> we

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
collect water around there so what we

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.250 
collect water around there so what we
actually<00:03:48.370> done<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:49.209> area<00:03:49.510> was<00:03:49.630> filled<00:03:49.900> and

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
actually done the area was filled and

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.070 
actually done the area was filled and
actually<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:50.980> dremel<00:03:51.519> drill<00:03:52.209> was<00:03:52.540> actually<00:03:52.900> put

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
actually a dremel drill was actually put

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.620 
actually a dremel drill was actually put
on<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.769> carve<00:03:54.100> out<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.760> new<00:03:54.940> crease<00:03:55.269> there<00:03:55.480> so

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
on to carve out the new crease there so

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.900 
on to carve out the new crease there so
it<00:03:55.750> looks<00:03:55.900> like<00:03:56.080> if<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:56.170> stand<00:03:56.410> back<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:57.730> looks

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
it looks like if you stand back it looks

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.430 
it looks like if you stand back it looks
like<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.239> actual<00:03:58.330> crease<00:03:58.780> between<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.290> wing

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
like the actual crease between the wing

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.500 
like the actual crease between the wing
and<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.739> front<00:03:59.980> scott<00:04:00.220> wall<00:04:00.340> panel<00:04:00.640> there<00:04:00.820> but

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
and the front scott wall panel there but

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.920 
and the front scott wall panel there but
in<00:04:01.600> actual<00:04:01.840> fact<00:04:01.900> there's<00:04:02.200> no<00:04:02.610> stuff<00:04:03.610> there

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
in actual fact there's no stuff there

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.090 
in actual fact there's no stuff there
right<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.050> water<00:04:05.260> can't<00:04:05.590> go<00:04:05.769> in<00:04:05.950> there

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
right the water can't go in there

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.530 
right the water can't go in there
because<00:04:06.160> obviously<00:04:06.550> it's<00:04:07.060> just<00:04:07.150> just<00:04:07.450> a

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
because obviously it's just just a

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.440 
because obviously it's just just a
filler<00:04:07.750> skim<00:04:08.110> made<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.130> look<00:04:09.250> like<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.489> crease

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
filler skim made to look like a crease

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.840 
filler skim made to look like a crease
in<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.810> bodywork<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:11.680> there<00:04:12.549> we<00:04:12.670> go

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
in the bodywork so there we go

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.490 
in the bodywork so there we go
so<00:04:13.420> come<00:04:13.690> on<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:13.810> get<00:04:13.930> let's<00:04:14.200> see<00:04:14.290> what<00:04:14.410> you're

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
light coats of primer now and we'll

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.040 
light coats of primer now and we'll
actually<00:04:36.130> see<00:04:36.520> whether<00:04:37.060> or<00:04:37.300> not<00:04:37.390> this<00:04:37.540> job<00:04:37.930> is

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.540 

again<00:04:46.169> we're<00:04:46.350> not<00:04:46.380> trying<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.770> deal<00:04:46.919> so<00:04:47.340> much

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
again we're not trying to deal so much

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.790 
again we're not trying to deal so much
painful<00:04:47.850> in<00:04:48.090> one<00:04:48.300> go<00:04:48.480> with<00:04:48.630> with<00:04:49.260> putting<00:04:49.530> one

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
painful in one go with with putting one

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.219 
painful in one go with with putting one
thin<00:04:50.190> base<00:04:50.430> go<00:04:50.699> one<00:04:50.880> first<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.330> all<00:04:51.449> we'll<00:04:52.199> let

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
thin base go one first of all we'll let

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.600 
thin base go one first of all we'll let
that<00:04:52.350> dry<00:04:52.500> which<00:04:52.919> will<00:04:53.040> be<00:04:53.130> about<00:04:53.310> two<00:04:53.550> or

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
that dry which will be about two or

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.300 
that dry which will be about two or
three<00:04:53.669> minutes<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:55.800> give<00:04:55.949> us<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.100> rest

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
three minutes and that give us the rest

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.860 
three minutes and that give us the rest
of<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.460> paint<00:04:56.699> something<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:57.060> hold<00:04:57.240> on<00:04:57.419> to<00:04:57.630> so

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
of the paint something to hold on to so

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.750 
of the paint something to hold on to so
it's<00:04:58.560> quite<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:58.800> simple<00:04:59.040> procedure<00:04:59.310> really

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
it's quite a simple procedure really

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.790 
it's quite a simple procedure really
it's<00:05:00.360> very<00:05:00.630> tempting<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.169> just<00:05:01.320> go<00:05:01.500> over<00:05:01.620> the

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
it's very tempting to just go over the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.350 
it's very tempting to just go over the
whole<00:05:01.830> lot<00:05:02.160> now<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.520> build<00:05:02.729> it<00:05:02.880> up<00:05:02.940> build<00:05:03.000> up

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
whole lot now and build it up build up

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.000 
whole lot now and build it up build up
build<00:05:03.479> up<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:03.930> find<00:05:04.169> that<00:05:04.229> what<00:05:04.800> might

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
build up and you find that what might

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.280 
build up and you find that what might
happen<00:05:05.190> is<00:05:06.090> it<00:05:06.270> will<00:05:06.449> start<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.870> Sag<00:05:07.080> them

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
happen is it will start to Sag them

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.390 
happen is it will start to Sag them
running<00:05:07.440> places<00:05:07.889> and<00:05:07.979> you<00:05:08.070> don't<00:05:08.220> want<00:05:08.370> that

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
running places and you don't want that

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.909 
running places and you don't want that
so<00:05:08.610> just<00:05:08.790> build<00:05:08.940> up<00:05:09.090> lightly<00:05:09.590> just<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.710> say

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
so just build up lightly just to say

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.500 
so just build up lightly just to say
before<00:05:11.100> Gary's<00:05:11.550> actually<00:05:11.940> sprayed<00:05:12.240> this<00:05:12.419> is

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
before Gary's actually sprayed this is

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.820 
before Gary's actually sprayed this is
actually<00:05:12.810> going<00:05:12.960> over<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.290> with<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.470> wax<00:05:13.650> and

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
actually going over it with a wax and

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.010 
actually going over it with a wax and
grease<00:05:13.860> remover<00:05:14.100> so<00:05:14.970> it's<00:05:15.120> nicely<00:05:15.300> nice<00:05:15.810> and

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
grease remover so it's nicely nice and

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.890 
grease remover so it's nicely nice and
smooth<00:05:16.229> oh<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:16.500> did<00:05:16.650> do<00:05:16.770> that<00:05:16.800> oh<00:05:17.720> you've<00:05:18.720> got

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
smooth oh you did do that oh you've got

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.000 
smooth oh you did do that oh you've got
it<00:05:18.960> on<00:05:19.050> the<00:05:19.139> roof<00:05:19.290> what<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.620> didn't<00:05:19.830> see<00:05:19.919> him

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
it on the roof what I didn't see him

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.050 
it on the roof what I didn't see him
actually<00:05:20.130> do<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.520> as<00:05:20.669> I've<00:05:20.729> only<00:05:20.850> just<00:05:20.910> come

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
actually do it as I've only just come

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.930 
actually do it as I've only just come
out<00:05:21.270> with<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.419> camera<00:05:21.720> so<00:05:22.580> because<00:05:23.580> what<00:05:23.729> can

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
out with a camera so because what can

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.790 
out with a camera so because what can
happen<00:05:24.090> when<00:05:24.300> you<00:05:24.360> spray<00:05:24.780> on<00:05:24.990> you<00:05:25.470> can<00:05:25.650> get

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
happen when you spray on you can get

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.140 
happen when you spray on you can get
round<00:05:26.100> where<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.490> filler<00:05:26.700> is<00:05:26.850> for<00:05:27.060> example

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
round where the filler is for example

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.360 
round where the filler is for example
you<00:05:27.690> can<00:05:27.840> get<00:05:27.960> sort<00:05:28.350> of<00:05:28.380> a<00:05:28.710> little<00:05:29.100> bit<00:05:29.190> of

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
you can get sort of a little bit of

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.909 
you can get sort of a little bit of
cracking<00:05:29.760> and<00:05:29.880> stuff<00:05:30.060> like<00:05:30.210> that<00:05:30.360> we've<00:05:30.510> got

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
cracking and stuff like that we've got

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.409 
cracking and stuff like that we've got
different<00:05:31.919> surfaces<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.400> imperfections<00:05:33.210> and

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
different surfaces and imperfections and

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.330 
different surfaces and imperfections and
stuff<00:05:33.600> and<00:05:33.870> perhaps<00:05:34.740> I<00:05:34.919> shouldn't<00:05:35.160> have<00:05:35.280> even

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
stuff and perhaps I shouldn't have even

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.440 
stuff and perhaps I shouldn't have even
where<00:05:35.550> have<00:05:35.639> my<00:05:35.669> finger's<00:05:35.760> Oh<00:05:36.120> everybody

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
where have my finger's Oh everybody

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.670 
where have my finger's Oh everybody
didn't<00:05:36.600> realize<00:05:36.840> it<00:05:36.960> actually<00:05:37.350> down<00:05:37.500> there

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
didn't realize it actually down there

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.560 
didn't realize it actually down there
but<00:05:37.830> hopefully<00:05:38.729> we'll<00:05:38.850> be<00:05:38.970> all<00:05:39.090> right<00:05:39.300> that's

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
but hopefully we'll be all right that's

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.290 
but hopefully we'll be all right that's
new<00:05:39.750> enough<00:05:40.020> tax<00:05:40.530> off<00:05:40.770> now<00:05:40.979> I<00:05:41.010> think<00:05:41.160> it<00:05:42.060> dries

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
new enough tax off now I think it dries

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.670 
new enough tax off now I think it dries
off<00:05:42.330> bit<00:05:42.660> through<00:05:42.780> that<00:05:42.810> quick<00:05:43.169> so<00:05:43.380> you<00:05:43.440> just

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
off bit through that quick so you just

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.129 
off bit through that quick so you just
got<00:05:43.830> over<00:05:43.949> that<00:05:44.039> again<00:05:44.310> now<00:05:44.520> with<00:05:44.729> a<00:05:45.110> coat<00:05:46.110> of

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
got over that again now with a coat of

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:46.640 
got over that again now with a coat of
primer

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
primer

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.670 
primer
it'll<00:05:46.860> be<00:05:46.950> heavier<00:05:47.190> this<00:05:47.310> time<00:05:47.370> just<00:05:47.880> to<00:05:48.680> get

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
it'll be heavier this time just to get

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.900 
it'll be heavier this time just to get
this<00:05:49.919> a<00:05:49.979> bit<00:05:50.220> of<00:05:50.310> coverage<00:05:50.610> is<00:05:50.729> tamas<00:05:51.120> better

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.790 

and<00:05:54.090> if<00:05:54.660> you<00:05:54.750> do<00:05:54.870> go<00:05:55.080> down<00:05:55.230> to<00:05:55.380> bare<00:05:55.620> metal

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
and if you do go down to bare metal

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.440 
and if you do go down to bare metal
issues<00:05:56.160> know<00:05:56.310> you<00:05:56.370> want<00:05:56.670> to<00:05:56.730> be<00:05:56.820> using<00:05:57.030> some

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
issues know you want to be using some

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.690 
issues know you want to be using some
sort<00:05:57.690> of<00:05:57.840> erm<00:05:57.990> actually<00:05:58.560> primer<00:05:59.130> like<00:05:59.400> we<00:05:59.520> use

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
sort of erm actually primer like we use

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.940 
sort of erm actually primer like we use
in<00:05:59.850> here<00:06:00.000> for<00:06:00.210> example<00:06:00.660> on<00:06:01.380> bare<00:06:01.680> metal

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
in here for example on bare metal

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.080 
in here for example on bare metal
because<00:06:02.750> normal<00:06:04.100> primer<00:06:05.100> lets<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:05.970> water

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
because normal primer lets the water

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.610 
because normal primer lets the water
through<00:06:06.420> so<00:06:06.600> if<00:06:06.660> you<00:06:06.720> actually<00:06:06.870> paint<00:06:07.290> a<00:06:07.410> wing

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
through so if you actually paint a wing

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.650 
through so if you actually paint a wing
leave<00:06:07.860> and<00:06:08.220> they're<00:06:08.400> in<00:06:08.580> the<00:06:09.150> open<00:06:09.450> with<00:06:09.570> your

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
leave and they're in the open with your

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.450 
leave and they're in the open with your
normal<00:06:09.840> sort<00:06:10.170> of<00:06:10.230> great<00:06:10.440> primer<00:06:10.740> for<00:06:10.860> example

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
normal sort of great primer for example

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.490 
normal sort of great primer for example
what<00:06:12.240> you'll<00:06:12.360> find<00:06:12.570> will<00:06:12.780> happen<00:06:13.080> is<00:06:13.200> is<00:06:13.470> that

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
what you'll find will happen is is that

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.530 
what you'll find will happen is is that
the<00:06:14.190> rust<00:06:14.430> will<00:06:14.640> start<00:06:15.210> coming<00:06:15.510> through

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
the rust will start coming through

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.900 
the rust will start coming through
underneath<00:06:16.110> the<00:06:16.380> primer<00:06:16.650> that's<00:06:17.370> because<00:06:17.700> the

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
underneath the primer that's because the

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.970 
underneath the primer that's because the
paint<00:06:18.300> hasn't<00:06:18.690> provided<00:06:19.230> a<00:06:19.560> waterproof

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
paint hasn't provided a waterproof

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.190 
paint hasn't provided a waterproof
barrier<00:06:20.390> so<00:06:21.390> I<00:06:21.420> mean<00:06:21.630> lucky<00:06:21.840> enough<00:06:22.050> we're

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
barrier so I mean lucky enough we're

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.600 
barrier so I mean lucky enough we're
doing<00:06:22.410> this<00:06:22.530> undercover<00:06:22.920> anyway<00:06:23.340> but<00:06:23.550> you

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
doing this undercover anyway but you

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.880 
doing this undercover anyway but you
must<00:06:23.790> always<00:06:24.060> treat<00:06:24.480> bare<00:06:25.110> metal<00:06:25.380> with<00:06:25.860> some

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
must always treat bare metal with some

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.910 
must always treat bare metal with some
sort<00:06:26.400> of<00:06:26.430> etching<00:06:26.730> primer
