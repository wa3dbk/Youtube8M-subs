00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.140
 Loin steak bacon burger 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.050
 Welcome to BBQPitBoys.com 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.600
 Today we are going to do the tenderloin steak bacon burger. 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.600
 It’s easy to do 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.960
 The good focus of this dish is the beef tenderloin. 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.960
 And good bacon 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.640
 As long as you are making a barbecue 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.840
 Must use high quality bacon 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.090
 These you definitely know 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.580
 This time we are going to use the apple wood smoked bacon. 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.620
 Oops 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.720
 The ratio of the quality of the fat and lean meat is just right. 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.000
 Can't be wrong like this 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.920
 There are 1.5 pounds of bacon here. 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.410
 We have to indirectly heat the drip tray below. 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.300
 The temperature is about 300°F (149°C) 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.680
 More than an hour 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.640
 Man 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.770
 Next 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.480
 This is the raw material we want to use for burgers. 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.260
 We chose the beef tenderloin 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 It’s reliable to buy this. 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.970
 You can let the butcher help you do this. 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.260
 Cut the beef tenderloin into this 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.960
 Or you can save money and fix it yourself. 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.240
 To prepare the beef tenderloin, you only need to do this. 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.900
 Cut off the fascia 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.730
 Because the fascia is very hard to eat 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.560
 Must be removed 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.880
 Use your finger or use the blade to insert it and peel it off. 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.400
 I am now squatting down 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.340
 This piece of meat is with the beef tenderloin. 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.240
 It is very chewy, so it can't be put together with the beef tenderloin. 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.410
 If you like, you can make it into beef broth. 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.450
 But be sure to handle it like I do 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.850
 Remove the fascia and connective tissue 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.050
 It’s very simple, just a few minutes. 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.280
 This saves 4 to 5 dollars per pound of meat. 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.840
 Otherwise, the money has to be given to the butcher. 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.930
 Oh yeah 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.040
 If you haven’t tried the beef tenderloin before 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.620
 Then you really have to give it a try. 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.770
 It’s delicious 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.880
 This is almost the most expensive part of the cow. 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.890
 The tenderness of the beef tenderloin is literally very tender. 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.260
 But in fact, the taste is not very rich. 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.680
 So put it on the oven 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.980
 Plus some flavor 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.210
 Next I cut the beef into 1-1.5 inch thick slices. 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.250
 like this 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.250
 This size is the most suitable for burgers. 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.610
 Between the wonderful magic 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.300
 Beef is ready 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.970
 It seems that I can eat it directly. 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.820
 you know what I mean 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.100
 Good to put the beef aside 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.360
 Take a look at Bacon 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.260
 Bacon has been baked for an hour. 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.770
 Can be taken from the oven 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.970
 Oh, it’s perfect. 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.420
 Good bacon looks like this 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.320
 Man 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.100
 Are you hungry? 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.420
 Then take three or four 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.160
 Cut it a little 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.840
 Because later we will put them in our homemade sauce. 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.060
 Just cut it. 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.860
 Oh man 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.770
 Ok 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.330
 Now make a quick hand sauce 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.970
 We have to put some sour cream 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.450
 Probably a pint of sour cream 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.260
 Nothing to say to you is better than roast beef tenderloin 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.900
 Next 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.380
 Use dry soup powder 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.140
 You guys are using it right. 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.920
 Have ready-made 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.920
 This is onion soup powder 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.600
 Choose the brand you like 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.890
 Very cheap 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.680
 Put the soup powder in sour cream 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.940
 Put some chopped bacon 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.610
 Oh yeah 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.660
 This dipping sauce is no problem. 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.020
 Of course, use your favorite dry soup powder. 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.020
 There are a lot of good things to sell outside. 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.330
 We want to use it in our burger and show it to you later. 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.160
 I have prepared some shallots here. 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.490
 This will make this dish look good 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.240
 So there must be some green inside. 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.840
 We also eat vegetables 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.800
 Dipping sauce is ready 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.860
 Ok, let's start making beef tenderloin burgers. 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.890
 First, I need to brush some oil. 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.220
 Use good oil to bake the perfect beef tenderloin 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.320
 Remember that there is not much fat in the beef tenderloin. 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.980
 So there is not much flavor 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.530
 This is why we have to add a lot of flavor 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.530
 First put some oil 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.970
 Both sides must be brushed 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.240
 Then sprinkle some salt and pepper 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.740
 Of course, you can season according to your preferences. 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.500
 But this dish is 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.850
 Freshly ground black pepper and sea salt are enough. 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.850
 a little oil 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.580
 Sprinkle on both sides 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.520
 Ok 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.520
 Can be grilled 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.490
 The current charcoal is medium fire 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.160
 Temperature is not too high 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.690
 must remember 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.720
 There is not much fat in the meat 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.610
 So be sure to use medium fire 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.770
 Slowly baked 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.240
 Can't dry the water inside 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.720
 It only takes a few minutes on each side. 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.520
 Oops 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.260
 Can eat it 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.450
 Man 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.770
 We have to put some dipping sauce on it. 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.170
 Full of flavor 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.050
 These are the best to eat beef tenderloin. 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.740
 Full of flavor 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.740
 Put some thick cut bacon 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.170
嘿嘿嘿嘿嘿

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.170
噢baby 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.810
 Of course, we have to say sorry. 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.690
 But we are going to eat in front of you. 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.520
嘿嘿嘿

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.980
 This is called the privilege of the barbecue master 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.450
 Next time you look for roast beef fillet recipes
