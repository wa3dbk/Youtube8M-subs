00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.120
 so 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.110
 no but I have work 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.129
 and 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.129
 bitter must be she recognizes b 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.129
 and 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.859
 I hope that these thirty years of 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.500
 research and 7 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:31.430
 this incessant questioning because 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.590
 that precisely I did not stop 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.470
 like many contemporary artists 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.480
 to a form that I could have invented 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.269
 stay on this form repeated this 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:48.500
 form all my life but on the contrary game 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:50.739
 for to get to a painting that is 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.550
 things to pass on 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.980
 I think it takes a work life 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.090
 already so I'm not yet but 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.880
 I had is very slowly we knew the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.740
 Asians think that up to 60 years 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.790
 we are still a young apprentice so I 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.440
 think I'm still a young 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:11.400
 apprentice but the fact of two meters 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.920
 confronted with having forgotten everything that 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.410
 I had learned in our schools 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.440
 European admit it confronted and 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.090
 to learn to think Chinese so to 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.200
 train my mind to an entirely different 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.210
 world Vision 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.600
 then to return to europe and to me 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.720
 compare well to reread all our 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.450
 culture because I was transformed by 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.160
 this Chinese education through 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.390
 important orders that have been 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.630
 do this command for example from the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.310
 red foundation beat the other bone that me 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.230
 asked to think and create 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.120
 a few 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.670
 four or five large formats 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.730
 around his abstract collection 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.850
 American 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.040
 of American minimal art and everything to 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.130
 I had to confront myself in the evening what 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.930
 that she is there and English in the jobs 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.890
 at 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.590
 from kooning and g that was a terrible challenge 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.390
 for me it is therefore at all 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.700
 cause again and see 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.069
 how I was going to react and like what 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.499
 existed 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.099
 a confrontation with it's with these 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.650
 great masters 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.160
 it was very impressive but 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.400
 stroke 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.950
 I slowly saw that my own 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.570
 language 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.170
 how to start to exist otherwise 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.120
 that the Americans' vision then 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.870
 I was lucky to have a beautiful 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.000
 command of the torlonia family in rome 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.220
 and I created his great works 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.360
 monumental for the palazzo torlonia 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.180
 so I had to immerse myself in all 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.930
 the history of Italian painting 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:03.700
 and his murals where I 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.740
 found spontaneity first teeth 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.840
 in the 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.410
 the expression the representations of the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.160
 the plant universe in these little ones 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.140
 birds its gardens 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.060
 eden 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.740
 so I had to take a position 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.440
 compared to all Italian painting and 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.230
 invent again something for 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.010
 these big monumental frescoes and 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.450
 so so recently this big comeback to the 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.850
 15th century painting at the masters 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.650
 Flemish who pushed me back to me 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.730
 questioning and inventing of 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.379
 incessant way 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.940
 so I think that actually this 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.030
 exhibition in singapore 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:55.020
 I am very grateful 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.030
 galloping sir and madam of his 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:03.420
 marks in two 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:05.940
 to have had the guts to exhibit in 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.060
 all this gallery they have spaces 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.400
 absolutely fabulous to exhibit all these 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.310
 different series that are on the 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.810
 four floors that are in one space 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:22.470
 equally formidable that are the fruit in 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.560
 matures 30 years of 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.560
 research
