00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.020
 Human anyone here tells me I'm not so much 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.719
 bad news here is a news 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.009
 auspicious that came out in a translation 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.509
 of the book the spiritual brain 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:20.340
 what is dodo 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:27.840
 the Canadian neuroscientist mário boiga 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:30.060
 morgan phrase b ea o rg a erdemar mouth is 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.149
 that comes very handy I gave 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.149
 recently this course on the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.190
 consciousness of immortality and he gives 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.680
 some of the scientific data that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.660
 not really new but that are 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.340
 there condensed it he said that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.530
 I would prefer an interview with cult magazine 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.480
 in Brazil it is in which it says the following 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.430
 when there is a cardiac arrest to the brain 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.660
 stops working after about 10 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.579
 to 20 seconds 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.440
 many patients in a state of stop 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.570
 appears fully capable of 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.460
 experience mental processes 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.290
 this year demonstrates the spirit advises 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.400
 are not generated by the brain 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.390
 now there is more case recorded this 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.659
 here than the seventh most demanding 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.150
 could require are thousands and thousands 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.580
 and thousands of houses without talking 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.400
 activity without activity 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.920
 brain and yet is seeing everything 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.509
 that goes on around and sometimes 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.810
 thing we are going through but with a 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.650
 neighboring rooms and sometimes in another 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.240
 place 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:42.350
 all this later confirmed until it has until 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.350
 the case to see that it is exactly in that state 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.340
 he saw that in the next house and a 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.659
 shoe on the roof you are this 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.790
 that the vision of him was not 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.420
 or conditioned place where his body 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.700
 is on the map of cases people see and 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.299
 fix more things than repair 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.969
 if they were alive and awake it would 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.640
 à the bibliography respect is so immense 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.500
 here is the mere pretense that 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.140
 consciousness is caused by the Serbian 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.510
 to be rejected at helm as 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.560
 something like a stupid thing a super 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.730
 simple legend a legend 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.920
 there is no evidence at all 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.980
 from which the consciousness will be caused 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.110
 by serious and there are thousands and thousands and 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.100
 thousands of proof that people without 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.830
 no cardiac or cerebral activity 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.690
 continue to have 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.700
 then the book keys the brain 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.880
 spiritual and went out by the best publisher 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.880
 seller
