00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
may look a little rough around the edges

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.780 
may look a little rough around the edges
but<00:02:56.739> that's<00:02:57.739> what<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:57.980> sand<00:02:58.160> papers<00:02:58.430> for<00:02:58.640> the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
but that's what the sand papers for the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.190 
but that's what the sand papers for the
same<00:02:58.910> paper<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.120> going<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.269> make<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.989> whole

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
same paper is going to make the whole

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.520 
same paper is going to make the whole
helmet<00:03:00.500> smooth<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.810> that's<00:03:03.049> what<00:03:03.319> we<00:03:03.500> are

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
helmet smooth and that's what we are

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.740 
helmet smooth and that's what we are
going<00:03:03.860> for<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.430> mean<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:04.970> pretty<00:03:05.269> much<00:03:05.390> made<00:03:05.660> the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
going for I mean I pretty much made the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.220 
going for I mean I pretty much made the
whole<00:03:05.870> helmet<00:03:06.110> smooth<00:03:06.430> with<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:07.730> file<00:03:08.239> but

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.150 

you<00:03:12.230> can<00:03:12.410> get<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.590> little<00:03:12.709> bit<00:03:12.860> better<00:03:12.980> than

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
you can get a little bit better than

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.860 
you can get a little bit better than
that

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
that

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.590 
that
okay<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.769> pretty<00:03:15.799> close<00:03:16.220> pretty<00:03:16.489> good<00:03:17.269> up

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
okay that is pretty close pretty good up

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.229 
okay that is pretty close pretty good up
that's<00:03:18.019> going<00:03:18.109> to<00:03:18.200> focus<00:03:18.639> you<00:03:19.639> can<00:03:19.670> see<00:03:20.030> that

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
that's going to focus you can see that

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.129 
that's going to focus you can see that
is<00:03:20.389> very<00:03:20.480> clean<00:03:21.190> it's<00:03:22.190> basically<00:03:22.780> gone<00:03:23.780> I

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
is very clean it's basically gone I

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.210 
is very clean it's basically gone I
don't<00:03:24.350> really<00:03:24.470> need<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.769> use<00:03:24.859> my<00:03:24.980> sandpaper

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
don't really need to use my sandpaper

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.370 
don't really need to use my sandpaper
but<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:25.609> am<00:03:25.790> just<00:03:26.090> make<00:03:26.269> it<00:03:26.389> a<00:03:26.510> little<00:03:26.959> smoother

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
but I am just make it a little smoother

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.960 
but I am just make it a little smoother
just<00:03:27.590> going<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:28.639> rub<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.849> on<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.000> sandpaper

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
just going to rub it on the sandpaper

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.289 
just going to rub it on the sandpaper
like<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:34.190> then<00:03:34.400> if<00:03:34.639> you<00:03:34.700> do<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.819> whole<00:03:35.060> top

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
like so and then if you do the whole top

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.300 
like so and then if you do the whole top
of<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.480> head<00:03:35.660> with<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.840> sandpaper<00:03:36.079> then<00:03:36.739> it

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
of the head with the sandpaper then it

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.940 
of the head with the sandpaper then it
might<00:03:37.459> take<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:37.700> shine<00:03:37.940> off<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.480> head<00:03:38.950> but

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
might take the shine off of the head but

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.900 
might take the shine off of the head but
at<00:03:40.220> least<00:03:40.340> it's<00:03:40.549> going<00:03:40.639> to<00:03:40.730> be<00:03:42.760> uniform<00:03:43.760> all

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
at least it's going to be uniform all

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.059 
at least it's going to be uniform all
way<00:03:44.000> around<00:03:44.500> which<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:45.530> going<00:03:45.739> to<00:03:45.829> be<00:03:45.919> really

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
way around which is going to be really

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.080 
way around which is going to be really
nice<00:03:46.250> so<00:03:46.280> there's<00:03:46.549> no<00:03:46.669> one<00:03:46.880> even<00:03:47.180> this

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
nice so there's no one even this

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.199 
nice so there's no one even this
