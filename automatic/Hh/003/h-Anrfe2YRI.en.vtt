LSU last year lost 23 ranked opponents
so<00:02:08.700> what's<00:02:09.000> realistic<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.750> them<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.989> 20-30

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
so what's realistic for them in 20-30

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.080 
so what's realistic for them in 20-30
problem<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.160> schedule<00:02:11.670> i<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:12.000> they

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
problem is that schedule i think they

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.699 
problem is that schedule i think they
rebuild<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.870> hurry<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.410> look<00:02:13.590> what

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
rebuild in a hurry but you look what

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.850 
rebuild in a hurry but you look what
they

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
they

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.410 
they
got<00:02:14.040> they<00:02:14.190> got<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.460> go<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.610> Ole<00:02:14.820> Miss<00:02:15.060> they<00:02:15.270> got

got they got to go to Ole Miss they got

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.210 
got they got to go to Ole Miss they got
to<00:02:15.510> go<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.660> Alabama<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.410> think<00:02:16.620> they<00:02:16.740> lose<00:02:16.980> those

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
to go to Alabama I think they lose those

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.680 
to go to Alabama I think they lose those
two<00:02:17.400> games<00:02:17.580> they<00:02:17.970> still<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.480> deal<00:02:18.630> with
