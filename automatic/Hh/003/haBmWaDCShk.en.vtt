00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 Did you see in the last video that I did? 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.429
 here 2015 will be a terrible year, everyone 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.290
 the indicators are terrible 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.469
 so the only way we can 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.730
 overcome this year which will be terrible in 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.699
 preparing how to become invincible in 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.750
 2015 invincibility she is not in the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.230
 her body she is not in the money that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.840
 you will win then people tend 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.230
 to think that money and a beautiful body are 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.390
 the goals you must have a year to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.050
 real invincibility there your 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.360
 lie in your heart then as 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.270
 achieve this invincibility 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.020
 first studies in your area of 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 job 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.559
 in this case my desktop is 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.690
 music 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.629
 so you have to fit your 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.629
 studies in a disciplined way to 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.270
 first the first way is to first use 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.760
 one hour of gross training a 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.580
 gross technical hour is in your 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.659
 work in the case of music is that they 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.659
 really difficult 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.549
 and keep training for an hour until 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:21.049
 able to win an hour of technique 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.119
 grossed out after an hour of 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.100
 harmony chord formation scales 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.159
 exotic etc. 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.340
 then an hour of repertoire goes 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.340
 to train that song that will be in 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.729
 of your repertoire and an hour of reading 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.649
 or you read the score one piece 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.689
 classic ne 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.270
 then look at the recommended books and 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.280
 You can take Almir Chediak's books. 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.039
 You can take it, look at it and look at it. 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.039
 of the song but you should know how to 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.259
 I study within your work area and I 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.689
 I recommend four hours of study per day 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.209
 but you can cut in half can 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.450
 two hours depending on your schedule 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.549
 so I recommend four hours in the area 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.369
 of work 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:12.109
 books you should read this year a goal 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:15.019
 between 30 and 40 books per year in the world 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:19.280
 the correct would be 60 books 70 books per 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:22.639
 year at least 30 to 40 books per year 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.780
 first you have to stop imagining 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:28.579
 things inside a test tube the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.829
 books I recommend are the three 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:35.269
 politically incorrect guides to the 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:37.459
 Leandro Narloch Minimal You Need 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.180
 know not to be an idiot of the 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.200
 Teacher Olavo the end of Brazil, Felipe 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.919
 Moor the author of novels too if you 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.169
 go read 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.540
 read some novels but these 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:55.130
 novels have a foot in history 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.329
 do not read things there are things mouths understood 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.959
 I do not know 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:03.220
 the ray hunter the parakeet boy 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.019
 none of this understood then read romance 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.470
 which has a historical foundation then 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.690
 I recommend for chronic saxonic co 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:16.010
 arthritic b chronicles on the cornea 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.260

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.180
 cool with one and dem I do not think so 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.989
 I remember head 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.390
 When are you watching movies series? 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.250
 I tried to watch what has some 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.069
 bazaah historical moment 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.930
 then you search for respect to know 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.030
 if this historical basis really 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.459
 proceeds is not that sometimes they change the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.200
 things in the movie or change things in the 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.250
 I recommend you thirst 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.120
 borges tudors marco polo

 vick in roma band of brothers pacific 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.239
 these are the series that have foundations 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.889
 historic 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.239
 You go there and do research on it. 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:02.549
 these series and movies each time you 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.129
 watch a movie this movie has 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.010
 some historical context as well or you 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:11.760
 can take some kind of 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.709
 Philosophical teaching is a good way to 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.910
 to see life then there were three 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.530
 things so far studies from two to 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.880
 four hours a day 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:27.120

 will be 4567 steps behind 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.729
 if you do not speak English 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.000
 You should start with simple things. 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.650
 You do not need to go to the isa course. 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.759
 difficult these people will never see you 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.560

 I'll never teach you English the only one. 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.810
 The thing that will teach you English is your 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.940
 willpower as well as evolve in the 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.909
 their work and evolve intellectually 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.310
 then also an English how are you 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:14.039
 Do you first get a 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.490

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:25.490
 charlie brown understood English each 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.500
 from those words you take and translate 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.050
 write every day an hour 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.550
 that you go to a book a little 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.650
 more full-bodied 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.710
 when you're watching a series 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.380
 a movie watch first 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.830
 the legend and then watch with the caption 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.930
 I assure you in a year you are 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.140
 speaking english 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.010
 then these were the four areas there that 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.010
 I recommend it to you at work. 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.980
 through the books, right? 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.240
 through the movies 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.220
 learn a new language by 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.840
 example english english is key because 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.910
 can go to something else Italian 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.010
 French German who knows on one side 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.340
 in this year 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.710
 if you can lower your head and 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.750
 ask Christ for help I'm sure 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.250
 that you will become a very person 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:26.370
 You can read about it in the 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.430
 are those that series of books 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.130
 I believe it's called august cury dodo 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.010
 master of masters are excellent books 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.350
 is a view of a respected psychiatrist 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.480

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.310
 the other his books but what if this

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.780
 excellent where he analyzes the 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.540
 Christ's intelligence 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:51.090
 then on this spiritual side that you 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.620
 can evolve as well that you can 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.040
