00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.820
 and then people who speak here are the bear and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.080
 Welcome to 19 games 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.830
 This time it would be showing to you. 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.530
 How to set up the microphone well and go 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.559
 to be a short video lesson is very simple 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.620
 Even then it's good to stop and let's go. 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.750
 there are basically two ways of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.800
 you get to where you set up 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.140
 the first one is more complex than I can 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 to start by clicking the panel menu 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 control is here to control us 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.239
 on top you click on the little 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:02.880
 click on all the items you go in 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.790
 Sound opens this window 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.960
 in separate sound recording talking and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.149
 77 is another way to get there is to click 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.070
 right button on the sound icon and 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.869
 recording devices notice that it will 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.659
 open a window 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.670
 here we have the microphone setup 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.890
 This accident has been wondering with the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.080
 difference of two microphones I go 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.610
 show you 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:33.210
 is in projects and realize that the pan is 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.770
 front panel is from the front slot but 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.840
 connecting to the front of the computer is 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.520
 this one you connect input 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.490
 later that would bring the computer 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.630
 This is this microphone. 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.360
 there are two 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.380
 This is the way this is here. 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.000
 logical connector and well this difference of 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.770
 your microphones and connect through the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.240
 computer is this one if you connect 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.340
 in front of the computer is that other 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.439
 so to configure what you do 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.790
 you and neither properties 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:08.899
 here we have is a basic information 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:13.739
 They will change it here to headset that is is 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:16.019
 You have to listen to it here, 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.760
 you enable this box you go 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.860
 listen to your device when you 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.959
 speak for example speak hello will be the same as in 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.660
 sound box was also mentioned in the 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.550
 microphone will be sound box it was kind of 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.260
 listening 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:34.760
 there is what is recording a loudspeaker 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.570
 only this does not floor them 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.940
 this will be the power configuration 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.970
 if you want the device as 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.140
 tino and working has with those who do not 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.140
 want to here would be the microphone volume 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.230
 and leave normally and will have a box 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.840
 underneath called sensitivity in my not 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.640
 I do not know why I would prefer 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.710
 microphone sensitivity or the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.690
 capacity to wave 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.180
 more sensitivity but let's see capita 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.220
 or you will start to close 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.240
 too high to start swollen and only 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.980
 it will get very annoying 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.550
 To tell you the truth, I think this is the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.760
 word that best fits well had 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.710
 advanced we will have is the default format in 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.860
 audio that would be the quality with which it 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.690
 will be recorded or stored is the board 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.950
 always leaving last or is the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:34.480
 maximum microphone or r 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:40.360
 764 where you are using the last 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:44.030
 we have service allows applications 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.970
 control your device in certain 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:52.250
 Sometimes I do not know how to set an example. 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.350
 this is a meeting where I 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.970
 set as default ie if by 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.959
 example that two microphones are connected 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.100
 in the rear entrance and the entrance is 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.030
 France 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:09.709
 this is going to define which of them should be 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.030
 used if the connected 23 is well 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.700
 That's it 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.549
 If you liked the video, click the 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.739
 button like that gave me the strength 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.220
 favorite scenes i do all that 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.370
 boring process that you already know're 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.270
 switched on 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.270
 I just went
