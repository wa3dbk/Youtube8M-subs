yeah<00:00:44.949> I<00:00:45.909> was<00:00:46.179> just<00:00:46.300> thinking<00:00:46.469> because

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
yeah I was just thinking because

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.770 
yeah I was just thinking because
obviously<00:00:48.100> these<00:00:48.550> not<00:00:48.940> obviously<00:00:49.420> don't

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
obviously these not obviously don't

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.209 
obviously these not obviously don't
one<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.229> my<00:00:50.289> pet<00:00:50.469> hates<00:00:50.679> when<00:00:50.890> people<00:00:51.100> say

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
one of my pet hates when people say

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:52.889 
one of my pet hates when people say
obviously<00:00:51.370> when<00:00:52.149> what<00:00:52.359> they're<00:00:52.510> about<00:00:52.629> to<00:00:52.780> say

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
obviously when what they're about to say

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.719 
obviously when what they're about to say
isn't<00:00:53.289> necessarily<00:00:53.920> obvious<00:00:54.129> because<00:00:54.609> you

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:54.729 
isn't necessarily obvious because you

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:56.399 
isn't necessarily obvious because you
might<00:00:54.940> be<00:00:55.120> watching<00:00:55.749> this<00:00:55.989> from<00:00:56.199> a<00:00:56.289> different
