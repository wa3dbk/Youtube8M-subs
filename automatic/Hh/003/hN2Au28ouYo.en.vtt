that's all of your strings are normal

YouTube that will teach you how to do

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.610 
YouTube that will teach you how to do
that<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.760> i'll<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.149> uploading<00:00:42.360> one<00:00:42.660> later<00:00:42.870> um

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.000 

so<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.780> song<00:00:49.050> starts<00:00:49.410> off<00:00:49.710> pretty<00:00:49.739> simple<00:00:50.489> and

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
so the song starts off pretty simple and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.180 
so the song starts off pretty simple and
it's<00:00:53.010> just

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.040 

so<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.990> hitting<00:01:01.380> the<00:01:03.050> lowest

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
so all that is is you hitting the lowest

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.820 
so all that is is you hitting the lowest
string<00:01:04.559> alone<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.780> without<00:01:06.780> any<00:01:07.140> frets<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.680> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
string alone and without any frets on it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.960 
string alone and without any frets on it
without<00:01:08.490> any<00:01:08.760> frets<00:01:09.030> held<00:01:09.270> down<00:01:09.480> and<00:01:10.820> then<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
without any frets held down and then you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.260 
without any frets held down and then you
go<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> first<00:01:12.540> fret<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.470> almost

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
go to the first fret and you almost

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.510 
go to the first fret and you almost
wiggle<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.420> finger<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.870> little<00:01:15.960> bit

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.330 

and<00:01:20.000> then<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:20.930> go<00:01:21.049> back<00:01:21.079> to<00:01:21.259> that<00:01:21.500> open<00:01:21.799> every

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
and then you go back to that open every

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.000 
and then you go back to that open every
time<00:01:22.520> so

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.370 

and<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:28.210> lot<00:01:28.390> of<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.570> song<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:28.990> based<00:01:29.140> around

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
and a lot of the song is based around

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.310 
and a lot of the song is based around
that<00:01:29.680> or<00:01:29.830> if<00:01:29.950> it's<00:01:30.190> it<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:31.210> predominantly<00:01:32.080> used

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
that or if it's it is predominantly used

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.420 
that or if it's it is predominantly used
through<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:32.710> whole<00:01:32.860> song<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:36.130> only

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
through the whole song the only

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.150 
through the whole song the only
variation<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.420> riff<00:01:37.870> that<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.800> see

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
variation to that riff that you see

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.980 
variation to that riff that you see
throughout<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.670> whole<00:01:39.820> song<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:40.120> um<00:01:42.990> during

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
throughout the whole song is um during

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.390 
throughout the whole song is um during
them<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.490> chorus<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:48.000> go

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
them the chorus you go

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.450

and<00:01:51.050> then<00:01:52.050> you<00:01:52.140> go<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.620> eighth<00:01:52.770> fret<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and then you go to the eighth fret and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.160 
and then you go to the eighth fret and
you<00:01:53.640> put<00:01:53.820> your<00:01:53.940> finger<00:01:54.150> across<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> lowest

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you put your finger across the lowest

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.180 

just<00:02:01.000> practice<00:02:01.390> making<00:02:01.570> that<00:02:01.810> movement<00:02:02.260> so

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.810

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
like the lowest is firing the lowest

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.470
