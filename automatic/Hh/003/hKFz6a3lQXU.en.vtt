00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 there is also graziano rossi here in latina a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.580
 remember simoncelli and how to do it if not 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.690
 with some beautiful traverses as to make the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.570
 Drifting and graziano yes yes there there 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.880
 have prepared two wonderful bmw that 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:24.119
 let's see back here there's a lot of track 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.400
 very beautiful that I will imagine a lot 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.760
 funny so let's do some smoke 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.650
 it's a bit of a fuss 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.020
 even now they gratefully at what time this does not 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.030
 I know I don't know but I think of the 11 in 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.239
 iv had told me the first entry 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.390
 but I'm not sure here was to be there 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.750
 with you also loris capirossi and you know it 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 because there is no one who was hurt 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.800
 something but what has it combined is in 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.420
 nothing serious hospital the reason is not 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.070
 still official but still safe 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.140
 nothing serious tweeted him right 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.940
 so let's be quiet or that many 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.629
 thank you thankfully there had to be 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.520
 loris which is a crossed reda da 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.810
 always since a few decades 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.770
 it would have been a pleasure to meet him 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.390
 instead I am sorry that there is not therefore 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.000
 the other machine will drive one of these 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.820
 drifting guys that are 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.120
 specialists and therefore 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:29.450
 I will be touched by me 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:37.220
 let's smoke the noise 15 to us 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:39.869
 the most annoying category most delinquents 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.390
 that also the best way in my opinion 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.060
 to remember the sic that was a 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.759
 invaded a renato intraversato 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.550
 an anecdote a nice memory of 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:56.960
 marco looks 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:01.460
 I always remember with great joy 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:06.170
 when he made the first laps with one 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:09.530
 car sideways on my bmw with 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.330
 which we held a demonstration mi 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.710
 it seems I would be wrong to believe it 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.990
 forlì airport 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.920
 forlì airport nisun stuff of the 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.310
 kind and he who was still a child 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.520
 He told me around that I know that 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.060
 the funny stuff I did these things 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:37.460
 the more we believe a bmw m5 I know that 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.920
 once a very sweet memory 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.140

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.820
