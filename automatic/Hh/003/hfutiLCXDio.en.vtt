00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.240 
but has a lot of cleansers that although
there's<00:02:12.750> sulfate<00:02:13.170> free<00:02:13.380> they're<00:02:13.590> kind<00:02:14.190> of

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
there's sulfate free they're kind of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.170 
there's sulfate free they're kind of
like<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.640> harsher<00:02:15.209> non<00:02:15.750> sulfates<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:17.180> I'm

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
like the harsher non sulfates like I'm

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.520 
like the harsher non sulfates like I'm
starting<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.599> realize<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:18.930> even<00:02:19.410> if

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
starting to realize that even if

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.630 
starting to realize that even if
something<00:02:19.830> isn't<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.700> sulfate<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.510> still<00:02:22.640> can

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
something isn't a sulfate it still can

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.520 
something isn't a sulfate it still can
be<00:02:23.670> harsh<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.540> hair<00:02:24.720> as<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.930> cleanser<00:02:25.260> so

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
be harsh on the hair as a cleanser so

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.440 
be harsh on the hair as a cleanser so
they're<00:02:25.739> kind<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.250> little<00:02:26.489> bit<00:02:26.610> harsher<00:02:26.940> but

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
they're kind of a little bit harsher but

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.680 
they're kind of a little bit harsher but
not<00:02:27.630> sulfates<00:02:28.140> yet<00:02:29.209> because<00:02:30.209> they<00:02:30.360> get<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.569> say

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
not sulfates yet because they get to say

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.100 
not sulfates yet because they get to say
sulfate<00:02:31.110> free<00:02:31.319> on<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.620> bottle<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.930> yeah<00:02:33.930> my

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
sulfate free on the bottle so yeah my

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.870 
sulfate free on the bottle so yeah my
opinion<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> shampoo<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.099> that<00:02:35.280> it's<00:02:35.580> a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
opinion on the shampoo is that it's a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.440 
opinion on the shampoo is that it's a
good<00:02:36.209> shampoo<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.930> don't<00:02:37.410> know<00:02:38.120> it's<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.239> little

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
good shampoo I don't know it's a little

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.740

same as the other stuff it's good I will
probably<00:03:40.170> give<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.160> away<00:03:41.400> though<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:42.359> a

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
probably give this away though to a

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.379 
probably give this away though to a
friend<00:03:42.799> just<00:03:43.799> because<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.310> has<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.910> silicones

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389

smooth<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.160> hair<00:04:35.540> so<00:04:36.540> I<00:04:36.570> don't<00:04:36.840> really<00:04:37.020> knew

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
smooth the hair so I don't really knew

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.480 
smooth the hair so I don't really knew
about<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.560> smoothing<00:04:37.890> properties<00:04:38.040> because<00:04:38.400> I

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
about the smoothing properties because I

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.920 
about the smoothing properties because I
sort<00:04:38.670> of<00:04:38.760> applied<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.180> to<00:04:39.210> my<00:04:39.330> natural<00:04:39.570> hair

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
sort of applied it to my natural hair

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.140 
sort of applied it to my natural hair
and<00:04:40.140> then<00:04:40.260> let<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.410> curl<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.830> then<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:42.030> know

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
and then let it curl and then you know

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.380 
and then let it curl and then you know
but<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:43.140> do<00:04:43.200> think<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:44.250> did<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:44.820> good<00:04:45.030> job<00:04:45.090> of

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
but I do think it did a good job of

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.970 
but I do think it did a good job of
protecting<00:04:45.600> my<00:04:45.840> hair<00:04:46.110> from<00:04:46.260> heat<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.680> didn't

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
protecting my hair from heat I didn't

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.490 
protecting my hair from heat I didn't
apply<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:47.280> lot<00:04:47.730> a<00:04:47.910> lot<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.270> heat<00:04:48.510> but<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:48.900> did<00:04:49.380> not

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
apply a lot a lot of heat but I did not

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.560 
apply a lot a lot of heat but I did not
smell<00:04:49.890> burn<00:04:50.160> my<00:04:50.460> hair<00:04:50.640> did<00:04:50.820> not<00:04:50.940> feel<00:04:51.150> damaged

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
smell burn my hair did not feel damaged

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.450 
smell burn my hair did not feel damaged
I<00:04:51.810> feel<00:04:52.320> like<00:04:52.440> this<00:04:52.620> is<00:04:52.740> my<00:04:52.860> protecting<00:04:53.370> my

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
protectant that matched my routine that

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.450 
protectant that matched my routine that

because a lot of them have alcohol in

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.080 
because a lot of them have alcohol in
them<00:05:40.050> usually<00:05:40.410> which<00:05:41.400> is<00:05:41.550> not<00:05:41.700> good<00:05:41.880> for<00:05:42.000> your

it<00:05:45.690> is<00:05:45.810> kind<00:05:46.440> of<00:05:46.500> pricey<00:05:46.710> I'm<00:05:46.950> sure<00:05:47.070> I<00:05:47.190> don't

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
it is kind of pricey I'm sure I don't

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.560 
it is kind of pricey I'm sure I don't
know<00:05:47.430> what<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.640> exact<00:05:48.000> price<00:05:48.210> is<00:05:48.420> I'll

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
know what the exact price is I'll

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.060 
know what the exact price is I'll
probably<00:05:48.690> look<00:05:49.020> it<00:05:49.140> up<00:05:49.230> oh<00:05:49.470> my<00:05:49.770> gosh<00:05:49.950> but<00:05:50.820> I

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
probably look it up oh my gosh but I

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.590 
probably look it up oh my gosh but I
would<00:05:53.070> probably<00:05:53.340> repurchase<00:05:53.850> this<00:05:54.330> if<00:05:54.510> I

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
would probably repurchase this if I

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.530 
would probably repurchase this if I
didn't<00:05:54.900> have<00:05:54.930> to<00:05:55.050> pay<00:05:55.230> for<00:05:55.290> shipping<00:05:56.180> if<00:05:57.180> I<00:05:57.390> had

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
didn't have to pay for shipping if I had

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.760 
didn't have to pay for shipping if I had
to<00:05:57.600> pay<00:05:57.690> for<00:05:57.720> shipping<00:05:57.900> on<00:05:58.230> this<00:05:58.350> I<00:05:58.500> might<00:05:58.650> not

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
to pay for shipping on this I might not

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.200 
to pay for shipping on this I might not
repurchase<00:05:59.010> it<00:05:59.310> because<00:05:59.610> that<00:05:59.820> might<00:05:59.970> just

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
repurchase it because that might just

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.030 
repurchase it because that might just
tip<00:06:00.390> me<00:06:00.690> over<00:06:00.870> my<00:06:01.200> price<00:06:01.410> budget<00:06:01.770> but<00:06:01.920> I<00:06:01.950> think

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
tip me over my price budget but I think

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.400 
tip me over my price budget but I think
this<00:06:02.490> is<00:06:02.670> a<00:06:02.700> really<00:06:03.090> nice<00:06:03.300> key<00:06:03.960> protection<00:06:04.320> if

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
this is a really nice key protection if

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.750
