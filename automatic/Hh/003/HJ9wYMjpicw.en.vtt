pigs cheek if you don't have this of

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.800 
pigs cheek if you don't have this of
course<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.100> can<00:00:20.250> use<00:00:20.369> streaky<00:00:20.820> bacon<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
course you can use streaky bacon so the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.269 
course you can use streaky bacon so the
first<00:00:22.020> thing<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.740> make<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.070> batter

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
first thing to do is make the batter

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.779 
first thing to do is make the batter
that's<00:00:23.760> very<00:00:24.119> very<00:00:24.330> simple<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.170> need<00:00:25.289> about

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
that's very very simple you need about

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.810 
that's very very simple you need about
150<00:00:26.789> 200<00:00:27.210> grams<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:28.019> flour<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> wheat

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
150 200 grams of flour this is wheat

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.269 
150 200 grams of flour this is wheat
flour<00:00:30.150> instead<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.900> using<00:00:31.140> white<00:00:31.710> I'm<00:00:32.070> using

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
flour instead of using white I'm using

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.790 
flour instead of using white I'm using
wholemeal<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.000> think<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.510> gives<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.989> little<00:00:34.440> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
wholemeal I think it gives it a little a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.470 
wholemeal I think it gives it a little a
little<00:00:35.040> bit<00:00:35.280> more<00:00:35.489> interesting<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.300> bit

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
little bit more interesting a little bit

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.410 
little bit more interesting a little bit
more<00:00:36.630> character<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.010> batter<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> my

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
more character to the batter so to my

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
more character to the batter so to my
flour<00:00:39.690> I'm<00:00:40.050> gonna<00:00:40.290> add<00:00:40.440> an<00:00:40.829> egg<00:00:40.980> I've<00:00:41.309> just
