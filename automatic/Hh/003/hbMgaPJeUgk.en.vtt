00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.279
 good evening everyone and welcome to this 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.700
 new concept minutes the return is 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.740
 true sorry obviously for for this 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.170
 waiting in any case sure about the sequel no 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.250
 it's not finished far from it all 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.020
 simply there was still a lot 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.609
 working precisely on the ball 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.609
 was coming when you might have been able to 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.670
 see bottom of hall 6 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.769
 if we can say and organization in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.689
 general rule so obviously it took 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.920
 a little bit of time but the council 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.050
 minutes in any case is not over 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.460
 so sorry again anyway 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.420
 we will go to the heart of the subject 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.250
 obviously this is what interests us 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.030
 and starcraft ii so we are in game 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.980
 the smap unit again and this 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.489
 will be followed also another video but 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.050
 of a game a classic that will explain 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.579
 obviously some moves 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.020
 we will see today in any case the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.010
 stimulant when stimulating what is it 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.090
 will just as a 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.590
 improvement that is being done in the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.989
 technical laboratory of the barracks 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.239
 that we can see here looking simulating 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.960
 voltaire quickly so the stimulant 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.980
 impact the marauders the marines and this 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.320
 not just allow you to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.090
 boost your units as you can 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.860
 see a minister and a minister of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.380
 human power that increases speed 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.820
 of attacking and moving the unit to 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.540
 the unit loses 10 points to a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.900
 obviously still makes a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.030
 counterparty if not guns we go 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.110
 see immediately in pictures 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.189
 it's very simple we have a navy 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.200
 classical 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.549
 this is a speed of travel to his 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.770
 standards we will press your so 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.780
 this is the shortcut for the hop stimulant 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.000
 right away we see his speed of 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.040
 greatly progressed displacement 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 obviously he lost 10 life 6 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.329
 35 of 45 so what an interest the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.729
 obviously not stimulating again 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.520
 it's increasing the damage and its speed 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.380
 attacked and obviously moving 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.970
 we will see him right away in action 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.049
 so the classic now we're going to 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.820
 put the simulant as you can 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.439
 see this will allow us to 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.579
 move to do a little iten attack 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.049
 I invite you to watch them too 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.240
 the other videos that explains you 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.799
 this beauf so the heat n attack and the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.860
 split you have you have two videos 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.530
 who performs this type of movement then 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.689
 what do you have to do dad does 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.000
 refers by the way with the stimulant so 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.170
 very very simple in general and that 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.760
 it is important 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.380
 the players tend in any case to 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.750
 tell steam and their unit 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.230
 a little too early, that is to say 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.420
 I'll explain imagine so your 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.420
 the army so your opponent is here 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.700
 and that you are a little bit in 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.650
 your base and it was a match but you 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.950
 have scan and you know exactly where 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.780
 he loves that he is here so we have our 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.660
 marine the main mistake is to 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.390
 want to get to the fight much too much 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.470
 fast and steam and to say I will 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.030
 I'll go I'll surprise 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.209
 go I'm going to go I'm going to kill them 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.459
 he did not see me and I'm going steam is in 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.900
 advance for obviously having a plus 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.799
 big moving speed you know 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.590
 came to the fight problem is that 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.209
 if you estimate for example now 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.549
 to pick them up 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.130
 so there you are still worried milan 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:05.360
 but it's going fast is over it's up to 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.870
 say that this one will obviously have 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.150
 down a simulant effect a lot more 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.010
 lighter end than if you waited for it 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.930
 last moment that is to say we still have 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.549
 in marine waters 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.920
 we are always in our base on 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.420
 resumes the same situation we know who 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.940
 is there anyway so here you have 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.640
 the information and your opponent does 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.709
 do not know where you are so in every 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.160
 case you can take a little bit 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.890
 more time to arrive is any 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.269
 way he will always be where even if he has 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.250
 a little bit moved you know of any 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.690
 way where he will go so in every 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.359
 case you can always in any case to 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.739
 intercept it so it is useless and 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.140
 that's very important it's not used to 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.320
 nothing of this team and to get more 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:54.390
 quickly in the fight is no no that's 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.829
 no one c to shit to another other small 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.950
 mistake is the double steam 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.840
 so that's pretty common in 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.130
 particular when using for example 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.230
 shortcuts that is to say that we will 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.519
 you're going to tell yourself the stimulants can 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.989
 maybe if we support several 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.450
 many times over six thousand years 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.549
 many times the attack bonus 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.270
 of moving speed is going to be 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.640
 doubled or even tripled 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.380
 no it's wrong you have everything 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.180
 just just lose points of 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.370
 life foolishly on your units so does 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.110
 it's not useless like you 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.520
 can see it we can spam and but 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.570
 exit poll has not got enough life 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.080
 of course, you still have to 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.480
 a margin 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.010
 he sees five life points and you are 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.770
 under stimulant but in with the same 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.840
 the same characteristics as a single or 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.920
 of classic stimulants so do not do 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.780
 not the mistake of spamming it's this 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.650
 stimulating it's still pretty silly 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.120
 so what to do 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.930
 simply when for example 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.280
 you will come to the fight there you 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.300
 go put the stimulant so it's up to 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.800
 to say that when they vary but almost 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.290
 ready here you are there you put 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.640
 stimulating and you go there and there good 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.720
 after again for the technique 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.920
 it's always in the same place 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.540
 hop and there we can put a shot 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.540
 stimulating and it's much simpler 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.690
 this is up so the hit and run you I 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.180
 invite you to go watch the video 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.710
 precisely who is available on this 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.120
 chain like you have the speed of 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.380
 marine so that again a leap 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.550
 very important micro which is 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.780
 available on this channel so so 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.660
 that's it for we did a little bit the 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.180
 turn of the stimulant obviously it's a 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.280
 it's an improvement very very very 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.050
 important in the field do not forget 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.840
 especially not if you go on organic 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.580
 ball if you want if this video forgiveness 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.370
 you liked it helped you do not hesitate to 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.650
 share like facebook page which is 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.390
 in the description and especially we 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.190
 will find again very soon for everything 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.780
 simply following this series is 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.080
 just after for a range a little bit 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.220
 more standard on the grounds I you 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.700
 kisses I find you very 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:56.070
 quickly either in stream points as either 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.070
 on this youtube channel at all
