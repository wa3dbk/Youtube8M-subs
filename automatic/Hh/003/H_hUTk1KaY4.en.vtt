00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
projects I've seen things like

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.130 
projects I've seen things like
three-dimensional<00:01:12.030> printers<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.960> can

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
three-dimensional printers that can

to<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.810> used<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.470> my<00:01:16.530> classes

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
to and I used that in one of my classes

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
to and I used that in one of my classes
to<00:01:17.070> build<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> robot<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.820> performed<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> mock

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
to build a robot that performed a mock
