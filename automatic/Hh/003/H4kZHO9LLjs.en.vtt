00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
push-ups that will make them a lot more

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.280 
push-ups that will make them a lot more
comfortable<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.090> will<00:00:42.690> actually<00:00:42.960> make<00:00:43.140> you

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
comfortable and will actually make you

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
comfortable and will actually make you
stronger<00:00:43.770> when<00:00:44.190> you're<00:00:44.340> doing<00:00:44.579> them<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.210> all

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
stronger when you're doing them and all

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.350 
stronger when you're doing them and all
it<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.289> holding<00:00:46.590> onto<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.950> set<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.610> hex

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it is it's holding onto a set of hex

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.340 
it is it's holding onto a set of hex
dumbbells<00:00:48.899> now<00:00:49.890> some<00:00:50.879> places<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.870> actually

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
dumbbells now some places it actually

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.880 
dumbbells now some places it actually
gets<00:00:52.730> actual<00:00:53.730> push-up<00:00:54.120> handles<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.289> there's

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
gets actual push-up handles but there's

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.130 
gets actual push-up handles but there's
no<00:00:56.010> need<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.219> go<00:00:56.489> out<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.640> buy<00:00:57.140> specific

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
no need to go out and buy specific

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.810 
no need to go out and buy specific
push-up<00:00:58.440> handles<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:59.399> these<00:00:59.579> hex

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
push-up handles because these hex

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.569 
push-up handles because these hex
dumbbells<00:01:00.210> work<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.170> well<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:02.430> plus

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
dumbbells work just as well and plus

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.280 
dumbbells work just as well and plus
your<00:01:02.789> dumbbells<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.480> curl<00:01:03.870> or<00:01:04.170> do

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
your dumbbells so you can curl or do

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.500 
your dumbbells so you can curl or do
stuff<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.710> them<00:01:04.830> backwards<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.580> push<00:01:06.420> your

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
stuff with them backwards to push your

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.270 
stuff with them backwards to push your
handles<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.170> didn't<00:01:07.770> wrap<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.430> anyway

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
handles you can do didn't wrap it anyway

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.880 
handles you can do didn't wrap it anyway
what<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:12.270> simply<00:01:12.810> hold<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
what I do is simply hold on to

what I do is simply hold on to
and<00:01:14.979> all<00:01:15.100> as<00:01:15.310> you're<00:01:16.120> doing<00:01:16.240> your<00:01:16.570> push<00:01:17.290> panel

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
and all as you're doing your push panel

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.740 
and all as you're doing your push panel
the<00:01:17.740> hex<00:01:17.950> dumbbell<00:01:18.370> using<00:01:18.970> it<00:01:19.060> as<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.390> push<00:01:19.600> up

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
the hex dumbbell using it as a push up

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.750 
the hex dumbbell using it as a push up
handle<00:01:20.110> while<00:01:20.950> you're<00:01:21.100> doing<00:01:21.280> your<00:01:21.310> push<00:01:21.520> ups

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
handle while you're doing your push ups

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:30.630 
handle while you're doing your push ups
like<00:01:22.600> so

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.190 

the<00:01:30.970> fact<00:01:31.210> that<00:01:31.330> you're<00:01:31.540> holding<00:01:31.720> on<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.170> a

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
the fact that you're holding on to a

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.440 
the fact that you're holding on to a
handle<00:01:32.710> is<00:01:33.160> going<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.460> keep<00:01:33.610> your<00:01:33.790> hands<00:01:34.300> in

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
handle is going to keep your hands in

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.720 
handle is going to keep your hands in
more<00:01:34.840> alignment<00:01:35.200> it's<00:01:36.190> not<00:01:36.370> gonna<00:01:36.520> have<00:01:36.610> your

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
more alignment it's not gonna have your

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.910 
more alignment it's not gonna have your
wrist<00:01:36.970> cocked<00:01:37.390> up<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:38.470> is<00:01:38.620> going<00:01:38.830> to

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
wrist cocked up and that is going to

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.220 
wrist cocked up and that is going to
make<00:01:39.580> it<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.730> lot<00:01:39.880> more<00:01:40.060> comfortable<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.660> this

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
make it a lot more comfortable and this

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.870 
make it a lot more comfortable and this
will<00:01:41.530> actually<00:01:41.740> allow<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.250> get<00:01:42.370> more<00:01:42.430> reps

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
will actually allow you to get more reps

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.790 
will actually allow you to get more reps
in<00:01:43.750> addition<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.230> that<00:01:44.350> you're<00:01:44.530> going<00:01:44.650> to<00:01:44.680> get

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
in addition to that you're going to get

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.230 
in addition to that you're going to get
a<00:01:44.830> better<00:01:45.040> stretch<00:01:45.400> because<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:45.880> can<00:01:46.000> go<00:01:46.090> down

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
a better stretch because you can go down

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.480 
a better stretch because you can go down
a<00:01:46.270> little<00:01:46.510> bit<00:01:46.660> deeper<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.170> it's<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.160> better

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
a little bit deeper so it's a better

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.840 
a little bit deeper so it's a better
push<00:01:48.790> up<00:01:48.970> variation<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:50.229> course<00:01:50.440> you<00:01:50.590> can

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
push up variation and of course you can

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.340 
push up variation and of course you can
mix<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:51.970> match<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.390> hand<00:01:52.600> positions<00:01:53.110> just

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
mix and match the hand positions just

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:02.700 
mix and match the hand positions just
where<00:01:53.620> different<00:01:53.979> areas<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.670> chest

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.650 

parallel

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.450 

and<00:02:11.170> whatever<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.650> different<00:02:11.920> variation<00:02:12.190> you

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
and whatever a different variation you

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.490 
and whatever a different variation you
want<00:02:12.490> so<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.660> next<00:02:13.810> time<00:02:14.020> you're<00:02:14.260> doing

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
want so the next time you're doing

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.460
