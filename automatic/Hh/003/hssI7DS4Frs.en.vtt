00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
aggressive game here on arid wastes and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.550 
aggressive game here on arid wastes and
we'll<00:01:32.180> see<00:01:32.329> what's<00:01:32.570> happening<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:33.170> just<00:01:33.469> a

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
we'll see what's happening in just a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.649 
we'll see what's happening in just a
moment<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.340> spawning<00:01:34.610> pool<00:01:34.939> will<00:01:35.180> allow<00:01:35.479> him

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
moment the spawning pool will allow him

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.510 
moment the spawning pool will allow him
to<00:01:35.750> train<00:01:35.960> up<00:01:36.079> about<00:01:36.290> six<00:01:36.649> Earthlings<00:01:37.189> yeah<00:01:37.369> he

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
to train up about six Earthlings yeah he

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.910 
to train up about six Earthlings yeah he
is<00:01:37.670> getting<00:01:37.969> that<00:01:38.060> Overlord<00:01:38.479> in<00:01:39.170> time<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:39.770> it

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
is getting that Overlord in time so it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.380 
is getting that Overlord in time so it
looks<00:01:40.130> as<00:01:40.310> though<00:01:40.340> he<00:01:40.670> will<00:01:40.820> be<00:01:40.939> able<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.180> train

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
looks as though he will be able to train

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.330 
looks as though he will be able to train
up<00:01:41.509> a<00:01:41.600> lot<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.930> servings<00:01:42.290> in<00:01:42.380> just<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:42.950> moment

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
up a lot of servings in just a moment

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.490 
up a lot of servings in just a moment
and<00:01:43.430> then<00:01:43.490> run<00:01:44.149> them<00:01:44.299> across<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.750> map<00:01:44.930> this<00:01:45.289> is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
and then run them across the map this is

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.950 
and then run them across the map this is
a<00:01:45.530> fairly<00:01:45.890> large<00:01:46.280> map<00:01:46.700> though<00:01:46.969> and<00:01:47.149> Hong<00:01:47.750> Kong

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
a fairly large map though and Hong Kong

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.840 
a fairly large map though and Hong Kong
did<00:01:48.229> not<00:01:48.409> go<00:01:48.649> for<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:48.920> fast<00:01:49.250> hatchery<00:01:49.670> he

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
did not go for a fast hatchery he

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.240 
did not go for a fast hatchery he
instead<00:01:50.329> went<00:01:50.659> for<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:50.930> spawning<00:01:51.259> pool<00:01:51.560> he<00:01:52.070> went

ramp<00:03:26.950> over<00:03:27.100> here<00:03:27.400> now<00:03:27.580> deciding<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.209> use<00:03:28.510> the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
ramp over here now deciding to use the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.229 
ramp over here now deciding to use the
supply<00:03:29.350> depot<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.830> now<00:03:30.070> we<00:03:30.130> see<00:03:30.310> what<00:03:31.120> the

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
supply depot and now we see what the

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.790 
supply depot and now we see what the
factory<00:03:31.660> already<00:03:31.989> double<00:03:32.260> training<00:03:32.530> Hellion

so<00:03:32.950> those<00:03:33.070> hellions<00:03:33.280> will<00:03:33.580> be<00:03:33.670> coming<00:03:33.910> out<00:03:34.000> in

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
so those hellions will be coming out in

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.850 
so those hellions will be coming out in
just<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.510> moment<00:03:34.810> liquid<00:03:35.290> hey<00:03:35.410> pro<00:03:35.590> does

even before the cloak was able to

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
cloak and it would burn a scanner

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.980 
cloak and it would burn a scanner
scripta<00:06:24.789> bantry<00:06:25.150> would<00:06:25.300> be<00:06:25.419> able<00:06:25.570> to<00:06:25.750> get<00:06:25.870> away

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
scripta bantry would be able to get away

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.249 
scripta bantry would be able to get away
as<00:06:26.259> those<00:06:26.500> Marines<00:06:26.949> do<00:06:27.280> not<00:06:27.520> have<00:06:27.960> the<00:06:28.960> Marines
