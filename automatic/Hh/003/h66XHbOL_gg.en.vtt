generation one of the biggest things and
this<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.090> something<00:00:21.210> they've<00:00:21.510> been<00:00:21.539> messing

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
this is something they've been messing

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.460 
this is something they've been messing
around<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> lot<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.630> micro<00:00:24.630> dungeons<00:00:25.140> and

adding micro dungeons and making any
changes<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.380> biomes<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.490> adding<00:00:29.970> new<00:00:30.150> planet

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
changes to biomes or adding new planet

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.319 
changes to biomes or adding new planet
types<00:00:30.869> will<00:00:31.560> always<00:00:32.130> cause<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.910> planet

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
types will always cause the planet

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.900 
types will always cause the planet
generation<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.320> change<00:00:34.739> which<00:00:35.460> makes<00:00:35.700> your

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
generation to change which makes your

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.959 
generation to change which makes your
entire<00:00:36.480> universe<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.739> different<00:00:38.520> so

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
entire universe look different so

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.670 
entire universe look different so
recently<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.930> has<00:00:40.079> been<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
recently that has been one of the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.440 
recently that has been one of the
biggest<00:00:40.920> struggles<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> biggest

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
biggest struggles and one of the biggest

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.910 
biggest struggles and one of the biggest
reasons<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:43.079> kind<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.469> holding<00:00:43.710> off<00:00:43.890> on

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
reasons that I'm kind of holding off on

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.760 
reasons that I'm kind of holding off on
coordinates<00:00:44.489> again<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:45.570> until<00:00:45.960> stable<00:00:46.649> has

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
coordinates again just until stable has

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.529 
coordinates again just until stable has
calmed<00:00:47.039> down<00:00:47.280> because<00:00:47.730> honestly<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.239> become

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
calmed down because honestly it's become

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.360 
calmed down because honestly it's become
the<00:00:48.660> new<00:00:48.780> nightly<00:00:49.079> outside<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.160> there

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the new nightly outside of this there

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.229 
the new nightly outside of this there
are<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> few<00:00:51.120> things<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.960> will<00:00:52.230> affect<00:00:52.710> your

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
are a few things that will affect your

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.299 
are a few things that will affect your
individual<00:00:54.239> planet<00:00:54.780> generation<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.949> biggest

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
individual planet generation the biggest

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.819 
individual planet generation the biggest
one<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.210> operating<00:00:57.870> system<00:00:58.020> believe<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
one is your operating system believe it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.299 
one is your operating system believe it
or<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:59.129> Windows<00:01:00.120> Mac<00:01:00.629> Linux<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.160> them

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
or not Windows Mac Linux all of them

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.880 
or not Windows Mac Linux all of them
have<00:01:02.640> different<00:01:03.000> planetary<00:01:03.899> generations<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
have different planetary generations and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.160 
have different planetary generations and
it's<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.670> they<00:01:05.970> changed<00:01:06.479> something

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it's not because they changed something

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
it's not because they changed something
about<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.549> because<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> code

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
about it it's just because the code

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.750 
about it it's just because the code
behind<00:01:09.960> each<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> operating<00:01:11.250> systems

that<00:01:11.970> makes<00:01:12.180> them<00:01:12.390> function<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.670> different

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that makes them function is different

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.310 
that makes them function is different
there<00:01:14.850> these<00:01:15.030> things<00:01:15.299> called<00:01:15.570> kernels<00:01:16.200> that

the entire code is different there

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.100 
the entire code is different there
they're<00:01:25.740> not<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.430> same<00:01:26.460> beast<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.930> other

they're not the same beast the other

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.210 
they're not the same beast the other
difference<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.650> you're<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.950> run<00:01:29.070> into

now if you're just joining your friends
server<00:01:51.090> chances<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.170> good<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.409> probably

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
server chances are good is probably

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.020 
server chances are good is probably
going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> normal<00:01:53.100> operating<00:01:53.610> system

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
going to be a normal operating system

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
going to be a normal operating system
like<00:01:54.119> windows<00:01:54.180> or<00:01:54.689> mac<00:01:54.869> another<00:01:55.530> thing<00:01:55.799> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
like windows or mac another thing that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.590 
like windows or mac another thing that
will<00:01:56.040> affect<00:01:56.369> your<00:01:56.430> planetary<00:01:56.939> generation

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
will affect your planetary generation

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.850 
will affect your planetary generation
and<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.899> isn't<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.350> because<00:01:58.829> of

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and this isn't really because of

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.700 
and this isn't really because of
anything<00:01:59.219> programming<00:02:00.149> related<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:01.229> another

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
anything programming related but another

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.319 
anything programming related but another
thing<00:02:01.979> you're<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.340> run<00:02:02.460> into<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
thing you're going to run into is if you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.020 
thing you're going to run into is if you
have<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:04.110> universe<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.189> you've<00:02:05.700> been<00:02:05.820> flying

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
have a universe and you've been flying

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.340 
have a universe and you've been flying
around<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.689> you've<00:02:06.780> got<00:02:06.960> all<00:02:07.170> these

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
around in it you've got all these

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.210 
around in it you've got all these
planets<00:02:07.920> in

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
planets in

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.249 
planets in
universe<00:02:08.759> folder<00:02:09.240> you're<00:02:09.810> not<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.200> to

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
universe folder you're not going to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.610 
universe folder you're not going to
notice<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.680> much<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.100> difference<00:02:11.670> because

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
notice as much of a difference because

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.380 
notice as much of a difference because
you're<00:02:13.620> being<00:02:13.890> pulled<00:02:14.160> into<00:02:14.370> an<00:02:14.640> old<00:02:14.820> universe

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
you're being pulled into an old universe

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.120 
you're being pulled into an old universe
so<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> lot<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.200> times<00:02:16.500> when<00:02:16.740> i<00:02:16.800> do<00:02:16.950> my

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
so a lot of times when i do my

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.850 
so a lot of times when i do my
coordinate<00:02:17.760> videos<00:02:18.120> i<00:02:18.420> actually<00:02:18.840> delete<00:02:19.650> my

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
coordinate videos i actually delete my

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.240 
coordinate videos i actually delete my
universe<00:02:20.370> folder<00:02:20.820> from<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.900> jur<00:02:22.380> at<00:02:22.620> the

universe folder from the jur at the
giraffe<00:02:23.520> storage<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.570> i'll<00:02:24.660> put<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.960> link<00:02:25.020> or

of that folder so that you can know

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.060 
of that folder so that you can know
where<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.360> find<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.990> delete<00:02:31.320> yours<00:02:31.710> if

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
where to find that and delete yours if

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.530 
where to find that and delete yours if
you're<00:02:32.340> having<00:02:32.700> issues<00:02:32.850> with<00:02:33.060> some<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.390> my

you're having issues with some of my

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.630 
you're having issues with some of my

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
coordinates now be careful with that i'm

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.280 
coordinates now be careful with that i'm
not<00:02:35.670> saying<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.270> delete<00:02:36.600> your<00:02:36.840> universe

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
not saying just delete your universe

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.960 
not saying just delete your universe
folder<00:02:37.650> willy-nilly<00:02:37.950> if<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.490> don't<00:02:38.670> want<00:02:38.880> to

folder willy-nilly if you don't want to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.850 
folder willy-nilly if you don't want to
do<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.150> then<00:02:39.810> definitely<00:02:40.110> don't<00:02:40.440> do<00:02:40.650> that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
do that then definitely don't do that

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.070 
do that then definitely don't do that
but<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.520> you're<00:02:42.240> having<00:02:42.390> trouble<00:02:42.510> with<00:02:42.870> one<00:02:42.959> of

but if you're having trouble with one of

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.900 
but if you're having trouble with one of
my<00:02:43.170> coordinates<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.860> really<00:02:44.580> want<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
my coordinates and you really want the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.790 
my coordinates and you really want the
item<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.390> I'm<00:02:45.570> putting<00:02:45.840> their<00:02:46.200> it's

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
item that I'm putting their it's

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.370 
item that I'm putting their it's
something<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.550> consider<00:02:47.850> if<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.870> do<00:02:49.140> decide

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
something to consider if you do decide

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.620 
something to consider if you do decide
to<00:02:49.770> do<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.310> would<00:02:50.550> heavily<00:02:50.970> recommend

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
to do that I would heavily recommend

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.320 
to do that I would heavily recommend
making<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.110> backup<00:02:52.459> just<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.730> case<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.120> go<00:02:54.270> to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
making a backup just in case you go to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.780 
making a backup just in case you go to
my<00:02:54.480> coordinates<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.080> it's<00:02:55.560> still<00:02:55.980> not<00:02:56.040> there

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
my coordinates and it's still not there

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.790 
my coordinates and it's still not there

biggest things that'll do it so
coordinate<00:03:15.269> videos<00:03:15.570> are<00:03:15.870> not<00:03:15.930> gone<00:03:16.560> just<00:03:17.370> want

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
coordinate videos are not gone just want

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.000 
coordinate videos are not gone just want
to<00:03:17.730> address<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.209> as<00:03:18.420> well<00:03:18.630> I'm<00:03:19.410> just<00:03:19.680> waiting
