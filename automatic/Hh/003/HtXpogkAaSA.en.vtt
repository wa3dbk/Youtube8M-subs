really deal with the BS the the
unfairness<00:03:08.019> at<00:03:08.350> times<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.890> there's<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.489> job<00:03:09.670> to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
unfairness at times and there's a job to

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.090 
unfairness at times and there's a job to
do<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.180> people<00:03:10.329> don't<00:03:10.480> know<00:03:10.600> that<00:03:10.840> we<00:03:10.959> have
