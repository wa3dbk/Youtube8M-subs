 with five good stars left them with 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.210
 the crepe and pasta cost me a lot to tell 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.640
 this story always when it reaches the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.869
 night my soul is tormented by fear what 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.029
 which does not let me sleep 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.730
 I used to study at a school called 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.250
 cuauhtémoc and you could always say that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.050
 I was the renegade in that school I had 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.230
 three friends with whom he lived in the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.120
 diary alex antonio and danielle a day to 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.790
 my friend Daniel came up with the idea 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.829
 Ouija game to school he told us 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.350
 that if we wanted to play and without any doubt 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.270
 we replied that if we stay from 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.430
 see at 12 o'clock at the door of 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.739
 the school as it is now there is no one 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.860
 taking care of the school or anything like that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.480
 hour we found it perfect to play 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.160
 we felt a little chill because 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.920
 next to the school there is a pantheon 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.780
 but at the end we ended up just as much 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.670
 well then we enter a room type 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.040
 antonio winery started 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.950
 a circle with candles while daniel 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.170
 and I observed then it started 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.450
 to the session we sit around the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.479
 ouija as we were beginners in this 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.430
 we asked him very stupid things the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.200
 spirit was a girl because she told us 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.539
 her name was Alejandra and it was a 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.640
 former student of our campus suddenly 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.500
 the candles began to turn off and 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.200
 we kept asking and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.659
 asking things for a long time already 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.729
 we were all fallen the only thing that 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.679
 we wanted was to sleep therefore we 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.539
 we say goodbye to Alejandra and keep the 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.550
 ouija we extinguish the candles by 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.780
 complete and also to retire to 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.549
 Our home 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.530
 Danielle and Alex could go together 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.569
 because they lived very close to each other 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.729
 Antonio was the problem since he lived 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.770
 very far from all of us but 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.289
 he decided to retire on his own after 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.149
 go to the bathroom, the three of us had 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.459
 waiting outside 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.649
 They spent 30 minutes and did not go out anymore 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.479
 worried we decided to enter great 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.759
 surprise we took when we saw 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.590
 blood all over the bathroom but antonio did not 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.720
 it was nowhere so what 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.400
 we started looking around the school and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.040
 we did not find it by law 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.079
 it was even impossible for him to leave the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.329
 bathroom because we saw it enter but never 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.189
 we saw him go out we separated to look 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.069
 better and find out why there was blood 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.230
 in the bathroom then daniel yelled I went 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.150
 to see what had happened he asked for help 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.400
 but I could not give it to him because he 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.230
 I was locked in a room the only 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.909
 remedy that I was left was to get down by the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.730
 extinguisher that was under the 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.890
 stairs I went up and broke the sheet I opened the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.599
 door and I saw the body of daniel thrown 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.450
 to the floor with a stab in the back 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.609
 the whole room was bathed in blood I 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.470
 I could not believe it and even behind the 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.750
 daniel's body there was a girl with the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.790
 school uniform and if I did not have 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.769
 the slightest doubt that it was Alejandra 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.290
 the girl with whom we had had 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.450
 contact in the ouija game she 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.670
 he just laughed with a very macabre laugh 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.439
 too mocking and very desperate 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.139
 so much that even she could not 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.030
 control was only holding the face his 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.790
 eyes were covered by so much darkness 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.370
 They were blacker than the night itself only 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.409
 I closed my eyes to no longer see her when 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.780
 I reopened them Alejandra was no longer 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.270
 and with great haste came alex but now 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.490
 we were only two daniel had died 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.130
 I was lost alone Alex and I 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.140
 we had been alive at that moment 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.030
 alex threw himself into daniel's body and 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.310
 I said what the fuck did you do 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.590
 desperately look at my hands and 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.690
 they were covered in blood in my hand 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.910
 right held a dagger and in it he had 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.620
 the blood of danielle in that fair 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.140
 I did not know what had happened 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.230
 how the dagger had reached my hand 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.180
 it was something that I did not know with certainty what 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.370
 What I did know was that Alex thought that I 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.050
 he had murdered danielle álex very 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.300
 enraged was launched against me 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.490
 hitting my face we were both 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.470
 lying on the floor in that turn my 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.660
 head and I saw alejandra watching us 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.180
 fight and with a macabre smile on his 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.450
 face she picked up the dagger that I 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.610
 had in his hand the throat slit 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:10.440
 taking away his life and held his head 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.570
 cut her throat and she showed it to me saying 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.240
 I got up and asked him why did you do 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.489
 this we did not do anything bad to you 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.739
 to receive us in this way 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.739
 she just watched me and told me 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.590
 but I did not ask him again, as if 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.050
 you were the one who killed them besides you 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.160
 you have the dagger in your hand she with a 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.140
 piercing look he answered me very 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.000
 scared I watched my hands and great 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.220
 surprise you owe me because in my hand 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.230
 right held the dagger draining from 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.180
 blood and in my left hand was holding 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.700
 the head of antonio which had 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.950
 gone for a long time 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.720
 seeing this I fell faint to the day 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.880
 next the cleaner 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.770
 He opened the living room door and noticed 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.720
 of everything that happened informed the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.880
 authorities and I explained what in 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.550
 reality had happened they never me 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.130
 they believed everything was pointing towards me all 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.050
 they believed that I had done everything now 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.150
 I write this story in a field of 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.160
 rehabilitation where they give me pills 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.290
 tranquilizers every time I remember what 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.420
 that happened that night they continue without 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.920
 believe me but well I'm used to 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.230
 to not do it every time they are 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.850
 story always had me with a shirt 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.080
 of force for fear of going to 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.120
 murder 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.250
 every night I dream of everything that happened 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.670
 I wake up and I see the girl Alejandra 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.340
 stop outside my room laughing 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.100
 what will happen because that 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.680
 girl will have attacked us like that nobody nobody 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.240
 will know by now I only have to live with 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.240
 the torment that I lived that night
