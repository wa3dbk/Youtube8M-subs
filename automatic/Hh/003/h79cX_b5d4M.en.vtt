giant bouncer

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.429 
giant bouncer
okay<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:20.910> bouncer<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.539> one<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> four

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
okay so bouncer is one of the four

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.259 
okay so bouncer is one of the four
original<00:00:22.769> giants<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.730> came<00:00:23.910> out<00:00:24.090> with

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
original giants that came out with

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.519 
original giants that came out with
Skylanders<00:00:25.050> Giants

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
Skylanders Giants

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.599 
Skylanders Giants
and<00:00:26.369> he<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.330> course<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.990> tech<00:00:28.439> giant<00:00:29.039> okay

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and he is of course the tech giant okay

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.400 
and he is of course the tech giant okay
so<00:00:29.670> let's<00:00:30.060> have<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.240> look<00:00:30.449> at<00:00:30.630> bouncer<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
so let's have a look at bouncer in a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.340 
so let's have a look at bouncer in a
little<00:00:31.710> bit<00:00:31.890> more<00:00:32.040> detail<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> he's<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> rather

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
little bit more detail and he's a rather

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.510 
little bit more detail and he's a rather
cool<00:00:34.649> looking

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
cool looking

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.990 
cool looking
Skylanders<00:00:36.239> giant<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.820> again<00:00:38.820> they're

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
Skylanders giant and again they're

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.310 
Skylanders giant and again they're
pretty<00:00:39.270> well<00:00:39.450> built<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.930> think<00:00:40.140> they're

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
pretty well built and I think they're

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.010 
pretty well built and I think they're
built<00:00:41.219> slightly<00:00:41.850> better<00:00:42.059> than<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> original

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
built slightly better than the original

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.350 
built slightly better than the original
Skylanders<00:00:43.730> he's<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> little<00:00:45.030> bit<00:00:45.149> flexible

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
Skylanders he's a little bit flexible

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.930 
Skylanders he's a little bit flexible
this<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.289> Dave's<00:00:47.039> got<00:00:47.160> some<00:00:47.370> rather<00:00:47.579> cool

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
this one and Dave's got some rather cool

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.170 
this one and Dave's got some rather cool
moves<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:49.379> I'll<00:00:49.590> run<00:00:49.890> through<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.969> this

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
moves which I'll run through in this

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.290 
moves which I'll run through in this
review<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.899> I'll<00:00:52.320> also<00:00:52.530> show<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.039> him<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.149> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.160 

okay<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.740> here's<00:01:50.920> bouncer<00:01:51.550> lit<00:01:52.120> up<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.900> looks

pretty<00:01:53.410> cool<00:01:53.650> I<00:01:53.890> mean<00:01:54.400> kind<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:56.560> really

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
pretty cool I mean kind of not really

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.500 
pretty cool I mean kind of not really
darkness<00:01:57.250> at<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.490> moment<00:01:57.820> so<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.270> can't

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
darkness at the moment so you can't

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.090 
darkness at the moment so you can't
quite<00:01:58.720> see<00:01:58.780> how<00:01:59.230> effective<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.770> is<00:01:59.800> I'll

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
quite see how effective it is I'll

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.490 
quite see how effective it is I'll
quickly<00:02:00.340> yeah<00:02:00.730> try<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.780> make<00:02:02.050> it<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.290> little

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
quickly yeah try and make it a little

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500 
quickly yeah try and make it a little
bit<00:02:02.770> darker<00:02:03.130> for<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:03.580> there<00:02:03.760> you<00:02:03.880> go<00:02:04.120> it's

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
bit darker for you so there you go it's

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.350 
bit darker for you so there you go it's
a<00:02:04.630> bit<00:02:04.810> darker<00:02:05.320> now<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.770> mean<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.790> daytime<00:02:07.150> bit

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
a bit darker now I mean the daytime bit

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.630 
a bit darker now I mean the daytime bit
is<00:02:07.480> shut<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.080> blinds<00:02:08.320> and<00:02:08.530> stuff<00:02:08.770> so<00:02:09.399> he<00:02:09.460> looks

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
is shut the blinds and stuff so he looks

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.190 
is shut the blinds and stuff so he looks
really<00:02:09.790> cool<00:02:10.060> on<00:02:10.330> either<00:02:11.140> portal

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.350 

okay<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.620> attacks<00:02:16.950> for<00:02:17.250> bouncer<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
okay so the attacks for bouncer and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.050 
okay so the attacks for bouncer and
these<00:02:18.900> are<00:02:19.320> lickable<00:02:20.130> for<00:02:20.460> all<00:02:20.580> console

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
these are lickable for all console

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.870 
these are lickable for all console
versions<00:02:21.510> apart<00:02:21.930> from<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> Nintendo<00:02:22.410> 3ds

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
versions apart from the Nintendo 3ds

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.310 
versions apart from the Nintendo 3ds
which<00:02:23.880> it's<00:02:24.060> got<00:02:24.180> slightly<00:02:24.720> different<00:02:25.080> moves

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
which it's got slightly different moves

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.700 
which it's got slightly different moves
so<00:02:26.160> attack<00:02:26.490> one<00:02:26.820> for<00:02:27.360> bouncer<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.900> finger<00:02:28.470> guns

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
so attack one for bouncer is finger guns
