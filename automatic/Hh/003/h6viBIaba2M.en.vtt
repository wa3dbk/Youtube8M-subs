00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 but all the kids will see this 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.640
 new video today we are here and with a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.670
 another video a little different from the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.099
 in fact I will usually tell you how it will be 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.019
 assembled my new gaming pc 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.990
 in fact in theory in the coming days 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.890
 will have to order me a pc that I found on 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.740
 a site we say where they mount and ppc la 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.960
 gaming as you wish they have their own 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.570
 therefore offers them their already 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.880
 computers that will still not mount you 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.489
 those are the computers to manufacture 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.989
 just assembled piece by piece and I will 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.210
 will still leave the link indiscretion 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.010
 maybe you too have the desire to 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.899
 change you thought like PCs 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.540
 this is a good site then anyway 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.140
 by contacting them you can change what 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.670
 want 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.210
 I have only changed the graphics card 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.739
 because for a price of 549 euros having 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.260
 a little more budget I decided to 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:01:04.500
 put a graphics card a little more 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:10.350
 powerful guys let's start with the processor 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.470
 then the cpu which will be an amd fx 6.300 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.470
 which has a maximum clock of 4.1 gigahertz 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.520
 it is also the possibility of making a lover 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.770
 clock so this will be mine there is more 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.689
 however, we immediately pass to the minimum 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.600
 details the thermal paste that will be there 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.299
 between the cpi the dissipator will not be the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.180
 the usual thermal paste we say 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.220
 simple but it will be a mx4 thermal pass 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.640
 for those who know 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.899
 I will have an 8 gigabyte ram from the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.920
 ballistix sport which will be on 8 giga 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.320
 ultra-fast s1600 megahertz 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.079
 also overclockable up to 1.866 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.009
 megahertz that we are the pc anyway 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.469
 this ram is very good at the price 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.479
 of almost 100 euros so you can well 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.320
 understand that it's something anyway 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.439
 really good 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.469
 let's move to the hard disk anyway a sata 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.879
 iii from a terabyte 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.849
 I have not thought yet of adding the 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.810
 ssd but maybe in the future I'll add it to 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.770
 place of the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.110
 gtx 750 gigabyte video card overclocked 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:25.980
 and I decided to put an e asus 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.800
 geforce gtx 960 with two gigabytes of 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.019
 precisely of dedicated video card 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.599
 and in any case it is really a good card 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.480
 video also with two processors 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.150
 which has the typical price of 220 euros 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.010
 instead the other graphics card that 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.269
 gigabyte and gtx 750 seems to me so on the 170 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.950
 still a little less 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.900
 it must however be said that between the two 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.900
 graphic cards there really is one 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.549
 difference we say quite remarkable 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:00.060
 because in the gtx venue 50 we find only 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:03.450
 processor is the geforce gtx laws 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:08.130
 960 as two motherboard decided 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.630
 to put the rock s 970 pro3r two that 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.760
 anyway with only one key the 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.970
 ability to increase performance 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.010
 of 16 percent and in any case compared to 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.430
 many others is much more robust and 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.790
 compact as a church of the darmian site 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.989
 keys from gaming however not a simple one 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.239
 we have two possibilities that it offers us 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.200
 however that site if you go to see it 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:34.799
 It offers us a very red gaming kaiser 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.319
 pretty and still very linear and one 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.569
 green ninja then green than me 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.510
 in fact, I like it a lot more 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.639
 will order there is sarah hicks that e 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.819
 I will choose we have a power supply 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.829
 anyway 600 watts which is more than good 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.389
 or maybe even with the video card 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.209
 maybe even something a little more 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:57.239
 powerful and in any case we keep low on 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.180
 price of the dvd burner reader a 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.049
 normal samsung simple by twenty 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.000
 of Euro 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.609
 however, this site adds the option 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.549
 to put the operating system is 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:11.970
 windows 8.1 at the price of only 44 euros 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.609
 so the system is very good anyway 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.289
 original operating takes off putting 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.419
 all the original without card form 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.390
 graphic and so the price of this 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.990
 computer would be about 549 euros putting 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.920
 instead a graphics card and maybe 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.070
 the power supply can more 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.100
 powerful we can get on 6 36 40 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.320
 maximum with shipping all this here 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.180
 and my gaming configuration are 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.190
 for a couple of days I've been traveling around 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.940
 internet to look for something that satisfies 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.640
 my needs and therefore play gta 5 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.710
 also i go there it fps fps play a 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.380
 minecraft with common with fashions 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.870
 lol league of legends ie league of 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.150
 legends world of warcraft games that 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.070
 however they require enough memory or 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.130
 however also let cry 4 and games of 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.290
 last generation though guys if 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.300
 you want to buy a pc or maybe a poor one 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.910
 assemble this site here as I have 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.740
 noted compared to others allows 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.410
 buying a pc has really very little 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.080
 they are experts, however, price 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.540
 who do this kind of work e 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.620
 they ship it throughout Italy 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.170
 for free if you want to pass 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.060
 pass the choice but the position in 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.040
 tell me what you think of this 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.110
 configuration also invites you 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.300
 subscribe to register in the next ones 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.340
 days and the second event will also be released 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.990
 a specialization for those who do not 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.940
 know we put ourselves in anyway 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.940
 next nice video guys
