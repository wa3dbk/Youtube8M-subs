the animation team is built over an hour
of<00:03:49.300> new<00:03:49.450> animations<00:03:49.959> just<00:03:50.230> for<00:03:50.410> Connor<00:03:50.620> alone

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
of new animations just for Connor alone

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.520 
of new animations just for Connor alone
we<00:03:51.730> started<00:03:52.150> by<00:03:52.330> looking<00:03:52.510> at<00:03:52.750> lots<00:03:53.349> of

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
we started by looking at lots of

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.369 
we started by looking at lots of
military<00:03:54.129> moves<00:03:54.640> and<00:03:55.090> even<00:03:55.690> traditional<00:03:55.840> ones

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
military moves and even traditional ones

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.080 
military moves and even traditional ones
of<00:03:56.590> how<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:57.190> would<00:03:57.280> fight<00:03:57.489> with<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.670> tomahawk

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
of how you would fight with the tomahawk

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.940 
of how you would fight with the tomahawk
we<00:03:58.540> looked<00:03:58.810> at<00:03:58.959> that<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.260> we<00:03:59.349> just<00:03:59.680> thought<00:03:59.739> it

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
we looked at that and we just thought it

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.339 
we looked at that and we just thought it
wasn't<00:04:00.400> awesome<00:04:00.640> enough<00:04:00.879> so<00:04:01.450> we<00:04:01.840> went<00:04:02.050> really

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
wasn't awesome enough so we went really

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.949 
wasn't awesome enough so we went really
brutal<00:04:02.769> and<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.099> wasn't<00:04:03.430> just<00:04:03.840> throwing<00:04:04.840> in

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
brutal and it wasn't just throwing in

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:14.009 
brutal and it wasn't just throwing in
board<00:04:11.790> we<00:04:12.790> put<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.120> lot<00:04:13.360> of<00:04:13.390> time<00:04:13.690> into<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
board we put a lot of time into the

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.439 
board we put a lot of time into the
navigation<00:04:14.650> elements<00:04:14.920> and<00:04:15.280> we've<00:04:15.910> completely

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
navigation elements and we've completely

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.900 
navigation elements and we've completely
redone<00:04:16.989> our<00:04:17.169> climb<00:04:17.440> system<00:04:17.889> we<00:04:18.250> really<00:04:18.639> wanted

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
redone our climb system we really wanted

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.810 
redone our climb system we really wanted
it<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.120> be<00:04:19.299> much<00:04:19.510> more<00:04:19.540> organic<00:04:20.489> there's<00:04:21.489> so

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
it to be much more organic there's so

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.580 
it to be much more organic there's so
much<00:04:22.000> variety<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.660> what<00:04:22.810> he<00:04:22.870> can<00:04:23.020> climb<00:04:23.290> and

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
much variety and what he can climb and

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.070 
much variety and what he can climb and
how<00:04:23.770> we<00:04:23.830> can<00:04:24.010> do<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:24.510> Connor<00:04:25.510> moves<00:04:25.810> are

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
how we can do it Connor moves are

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.400 
how we can do it Connor moves are
directly<00:04:26.620> inspired<00:04:26.919> by<00:04:27.430> parkour<00:04:28.090> parkour<00:04:28.410> is
