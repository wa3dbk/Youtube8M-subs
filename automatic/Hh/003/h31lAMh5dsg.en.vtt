00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you see this black box back here a three

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.720 
you see this black box back here a three
tabs<00:00:52.079> two<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.949> left<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> right

it up kinda hard and the air filter

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.090 
it up kinda hard and the air filter
comes<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:08.630> like<00:01:09.630> so

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100
