the<00:01:51.409> venue<00:01:51.740> we<00:01:51.920> were<00:01:52.009> playing<00:01:52.250> at<00:01:52.460> now<00:01:52.729> that

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
the venue we were playing at now that

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.560 
the venue we were playing at now that
one<00:01:53.840> got<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:53.990> lot<00:01:54.170> of<00:01:54.200> views<00:01:54.470> on<00:01:54.650> YouTube<00:01:55.159> I

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
one got a lot of views on YouTube I

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.760 
one got a lot of views on YouTube I
think<00:01:56.570> what<00:01:56.720> was<00:01:56.840> really<00:01:56.899> different<00:01:57.350> about

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
think what was really different about

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.920 
think what was really different about
the<00:01:58.159> weeks<00:01:58.340> in<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.850> every<00:01:59.030> other<00:01:59.060> Emery<00:01:59.540> album

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
the weeks in and every other Emery album

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.850 
the weeks in and every other Emery album
was<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:00.439> you<00:02:00.950> know<00:02:01.040> it<00:02:01.220> was<00:02:01.340> really<00:02:01.610> raw<00:02:02.860> not

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
was that you know it was really raw not

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.100 
was that you know it was really raw not
only<00:02:04.070> in<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.759> writing<00:02:05.090> style<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:05.689> also<00:02:05.840> in

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
only in the writing style but also in

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.740 
only in the writing style but also in
the<00:02:06.200> recording<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.179> that's<00:02:08.179> what<00:02:08.299> we<00:02:08.420> wanted

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
the recording and that's what we wanted

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.160 
the recording and that's what we wanted
and<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.890> know<00:02:10.009> we<00:02:10.250> just<00:02:10.459> love<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:11.170> that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
and you know we just love that that

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.560 
and you know we just love that that
really<00:02:12.350> raw<00:02:12.650> sense<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.160> emotion<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:13.820> guess

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
really raw sense of emotion I guess

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.120 
really raw sense of emotion I guess
that's<00:02:14.780> what<00:02:14.900> putting<00:02:15.110> on<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> crazy<00:02:15.560> show<00:02:15.860> was

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
that's what putting on a crazy show was

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.470 
that's what putting on a crazy show was
always<00:02:16.430> about<00:02:16.670> for<00:02:16.940> us<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.239> be

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
entertaining but also to show the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.470 
entertaining but also to show the
emotion

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
emotion

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.140 
emotion
was<00:02:20.870> behind<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.470> music<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.010> what<00:02:22.819> we<00:02:22.909> cared
