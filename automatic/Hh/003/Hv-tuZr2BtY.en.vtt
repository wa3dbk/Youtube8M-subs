with the regards to the light and I

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.690 
with the regards to the light and I
didn't<00:00:10.559> really<00:00:10.679> notice<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.130> till<00:00:11.309> they

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
didn't really notice it till they

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.910 
didn't really notice it till they
brought<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.059> up<00:00:12.179> but<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.450> do<00:00:12.509> see<00:00:12.990> just<00:00:13.710> on<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
brought it up but I do see just on the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.589 
brought it up but I do see just on the
bottom<00:00:14.099> edge<00:00:14.370> these<00:00:14.549> four<00:00:14.820> sort<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.269> darker

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
bottom edge these four sort of darker

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.560 
bottom edge these four sort of darker
areas<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.170> don't<00:00:16.740> see<00:00:16.949> any<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.220> my<00:00:17.570> paperwhite

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
areas I don't see any on my paperwhite

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.010 
areas I don't see any on my paperwhite
on<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> top<00:00:19.199> or<00:00:19.470> side<00:00:19.859> edges<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.750> really

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
on the top or side edges and it's really

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.080 
on the top or side edges and it's really
hard<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.560> I'll<00:00:23.400> try<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> get<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> better

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
hard to see I'll try to get a better

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.400 
hard to see I'll try to get a better
shot<00:00:25.580> with<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> light<00:00:26.880> off<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.779> isn't

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
shot with the light off but it isn't

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.849 
shot with the light off but it isn't
anything<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> felt<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.820> annoying<00:00:30.390> or

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
anything that I felt is annoying or

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.650 
anything that I felt is annoying or
bothersome<00:00:31.859> when<00:00:32.369> reading<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.210> dark<00:00:33.420> room

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
bothersome when reading in a dark room

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.450 
bothersome when reading in a dark room
and<00:00:33.870> certainly<00:00:35.480> it's<00:00:36.480> much<00:00:36.840> better<00:00:37.110> than<00:00:37.460> my

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
and certainly it's much better than my

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.220 
and certainly it's much better than my
former<00:00:38.879> alternative<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.870> headlamp<00:00:40.309> in<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
former alternative of a headlamp in a

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.470 
former alternative of a headlamp in a
dark<00:00:43.230> room<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.620> Kindle<00:00:44.309> Touch<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.300> let<00:00:45.420> me

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
dark room with a Kindle Touch so let me

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.319 
dark room with a Kindle Touch so let me
try<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> get<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.469> better<00:00:46.879> look<00:00:47.879> at<00:00:48.090> that

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
try to get a better look at that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.680 
try to get a better look at that
and<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.579> don't<00:00:50.579> find<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.090> annoying<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.660> I

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and I don't find it annoying but I

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.010 
and I don't find it annoying but I
definitely<00:00:51.960> once<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.940> saw<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.210> did<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:54.840> what

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
definitely once I saw it I did see what

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:21.050 
definitely once I saw it I did see what
was<00:00:55.230> being<00:00:55.379> referenced

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.010 

so<00:01:21.690> yeah<00:01:22.380> again<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.890> really<00:01:23.190> hard<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:24.020> but

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
so yeah again it's really hard to but

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
so yeah again it's really hard to but
there's<00:01:25.560> sort<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.950> these<00:01:26.070> four<00:01:26.369> little<00:01:26.640> darker

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
there's sort of these four little darker

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.800 
there's sort of these four little darker
areas<00:01:27.720> along<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.320> bottom<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.479> sort<00:01:30.720> of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
areas along the bottom and it sort of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.960 
areas along the bottom and it sort of
bleeds<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:32.040> know<00:01:32.130> maybe<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> bottom

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
bleeds in you know maybe to the bottom

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.109 
bleeds in you know maybe to the bottom
line<00:01:33.299> or<00:01:33.479> two<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:35.430> camera<00:01:35.820> doesn't

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
line or two and the camera doesn't

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.790 
line or two and the camera doesn't
really<00:01:36.299> pick<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> little<00:01:37.500> more

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
really pick it up it's a little more

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.790 
really pick it up it's a little more
definitely<00:01:38.430> more<00:01:38.610> noticeable<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.590> with

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
definitely more noticeable you know with

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.899 
definitely more noticeable you know with
just<00:01:41.340> eyes<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:44.509> mean<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.780> hard<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
just eyes but I mean it's just hard to

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:56.359 
just eyes but I mean it's just hard to
relate<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:51.950> into<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.039> camera<00:01:53.550> but<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.340> don't

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
relate it into the camera but so I don't

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.120 
relate it into the camera but so I don't
know<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.910> like<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.869> said<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.110> mean<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.740> see<00:01:58.979> him

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
know I like I said I mean I can see him

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.510 
know I like I said I mean I can see him
but<00:01:59.420> if<00:02:00.420> anyone<00:02:00.960> was<00:02:01.920> worried<00:02:02.250> about<00:02:02.340> that

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
but if anyone was worried about that

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.389 
but if anyone was worried about that
being<00:02:03.240> an<00:02:03.420> issue<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:04.440> waiting<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.220> buy<00:02:05.369> a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
being an issue not waiting to buy a

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.020 
being an issue not waiting to buy a
paperweight<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.509> non-issue

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
paperweight it's a non-issue

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.430 
paperweight it's a non-issue
hey<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.269> don't<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.600> can<00:02:09.690> kind<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.019> see<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.380> there

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
hey I don't you can kind of see it there

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.729 
hey I don't you can kind of see it there
those<00:02:11.100> four<00:02:11.370> but<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.030> pretty<00:02:12.180> faint<00:02:12.739> doesn't

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
those four but it's pretty faint doesn't

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.809 
those four but it's pretty faint doesn't
bother<00:02:13.890> me<00:02:14.069> at<00:02:14.310> all<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:16.530> upside<00:02:16.920> far

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
bother me at all and the upside far

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.449 
bother me at all and the upside far
outweighs<00:02:18.239> what<00:02:19.200> could<00:02:19.470> be<00:02:19.650> for<00:02:19.920> some<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> minor

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
outweighs what could be for some a minor

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.060 
outweighs what could be for some a minor
annoyance
