 I stand out brilliantly in the fight for

 to design venezuela in the world and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.740
 construction of a Latin American

 democratic and supportive role played a 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.019
 decisive in the formation of the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.930

 deep affinity with our beloved and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.149
 Wish friend hugo ChÃ¡vez 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.030
 the two shared the same ideas 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.700
 about the destiny of our continent and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.360
 major world problems more than 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.670
 that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.100
 they had the same 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.379
 conceptions in relation to the challenges 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.969
 venezuela had in front in defense 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.370
 of the poorest 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.829
 the great work of keys was that of 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.649
 to turn venezuela into a country 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.719
 fair by carrying out a massive 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.790
 transfer of oil income in 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.630
 benefit of the most suffering layers of the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 society 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.990
 chÃ¡vez but as always mature 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.720
 have been clear that Venezuela needs 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.560
 escaped that many call curse of the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.229
 Petroleum 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.750
 hence the importance they gave and that mature 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.390
 the need to industrialize the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.970
 develop their agriculture 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.030
 steps together in this direction and 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.790
 I'm sure I'm mature with the president. 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.400
 the decision to choose a new president 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.740
 it will be exclusively for the people 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.320
 Venezuela wants to not interfere with a 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.689
 internal source of the money but I can not 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.240
 cease to give my testimony on behalf of the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.460
 future of this country so dear to the people 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.070
 Brazilian but also on behalf of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.780
 mercosul in which venezuela 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.870
 in a sentence sums up everything I feel 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.320
 mature president is venezuela that xavi 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.320
