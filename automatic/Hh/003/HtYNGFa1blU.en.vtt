00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.450
 well let's explain a bit about the 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.580
 tensions of the chords that come to us 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.000
 it suits us well with the drexler theme 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.070
 because you realize it starts with the biggest 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.309
 and then it already makes a fake stereo minor 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.309
 eleven 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.400
 as I have told you many times 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.980
 tell can simply explain since 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.700
 we are in the minors all minors 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.800
 7 9 and 11 and to make it clear 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.570
 no more things so as not to mess up but it is 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.699
 important because it gives you a security and 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.330
 a color to things especially those 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.330
 minor these 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.760
 this is to count notes if we're going to 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.120
 catch a tone that can be told very 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.360
 easy on 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.240
 the smallest for example the youngest you are already 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:57.200
 Sustained content or flats 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:01:00.050
 so when we have a lower 72 in 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.330
 the minor means that we have 7 the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.280
 It has been re my fa sun that we put a 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.400
 sun then one of them we have it 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.900
 here 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.980
 and 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.500
 or we remove this 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.020
 that the earth has better sonority if 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.119
 we do it here we remove this 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.049
 we already have only one here and if we put 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.049
 a single added 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.700
 so if we have the ninth they usually go 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.410
 together seventh and ninth can be seven 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.480
 and it can be nine but when it's nine 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.820
 It's usually seven to say that we have 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.120
 nine has been re my fa sun and 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.350
 say that we give the youngest one a yes 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.689
 then and we put 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.930
 a simple the ninth we would remove here 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.930
 is 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.800
 which is a bit indefinite 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.800
 if we nap 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.690
 with a little sad person nice if what 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.630
 we make here is more clear 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:05.920
 we put the if here the ninth note 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.219
 I like it more and already there because it is better 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.219
 written 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.720
 do not 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.190
 and this this tone and this agreement what 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.769
 I use a lot to accompany I like 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.580
 a lot how it sounds because he's wearing the seventh 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.950
 and the ninth and the guitar is very 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.150
 recurrent for many things if we have 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.620
 the 11th 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:34.769
 if we count 11 we will have to put 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.769
 king then or we do well 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.299
 we also put the seventh to the ninth 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.100
 If you can put them all on a piano, 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.200
 can in a guitar the most complicated 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.980
 but here we have a very good position 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.980
 what is this 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.920
 and I also 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.920
 if we put the sun down 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.410
 we have here the light and the king 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.050
 here
