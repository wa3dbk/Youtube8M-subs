 a little by thrones we have a mix 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.989
 well diversified in relation to 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.360

 stronger colors and once again the 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.329
 mirror on the scene and to the highlight point 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.700
 here at this jungle table we proposed a 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.030
 oval table that is a good purpose 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.070
 today is also very modern and the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.109
 detail in this environment was corridor 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.720
 she's all over the table, she's not there either. 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.790
 gela also composed this environment with 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.440
 stool our benches with 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.859

 used based also in cool stainless 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.940
 also the stools is this it 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.850
 reduces the acquisition of space occupation 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.650
 it is not so great it optimizes the 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.140
 space has more accent are super 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.420

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.170
 with sophistication and we need many 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.880
 Sometimes it is to add another environment to them. 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.160
 are easy or are not leading to the other 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.859
 space of the house was to close also 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.230
 every ambiance here of course nothing 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.420
 better than putting works of art 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.850
 and this one is very colorful in cola 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.500
 mandate in 2013 we have brought several 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.570
