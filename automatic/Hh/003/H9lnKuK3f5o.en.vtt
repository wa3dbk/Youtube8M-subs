you've<00:00:13.460> probably<00:00:13.610> seen<00:00:13.910> a<00:00:13.970> bunch<00:00:14.210> of<00:00:14.360> racks

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
you've probably seen a bunch of racks

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.410 
you've probably seen a bunch of racks
they<00:00:14.840> tend<00:00:15.019> to<00:00:15.050> be<00:00:15.170> a<00:00:15.200> lot<00:00:15.320> wider<00:00:15.650> and<00:00:15.920> bigger

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
they tend to be a lot wider and bigger

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.090 
they tend to be a lot wider and bigger
it<00:00:17.420> took<00:00:17.599> us<00:00:17.750> a<00:00:17.900> year<00:00:17.960> to<00:00:18.440> figure<00:00:18.740> out<00:00:18.949> how<00:00:19.039> to

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
it took us a year to figure out how to

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.740 
it took us a year to figure out how to
make<00:00:19.250> it<00:00:19.400> small<00:00:19.789> enough<00:00:19.820> to<00:00:20.119> fit<00:00:20.270> everything

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
make it small enough to fit everything

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.210 
make it small enough to fit everything
inside<00:00:21.170> this<00:00:21.470> and<00:00:21.619> I<00:00:21.650> think<00:00:21.800> if<00:00:21.890> you<00:00:21.949> go<00:00:21.980> into

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
inside this and I think if you go into

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.500 
inside this and I think if you go into
our<00:00:22.369> website<00:00:22.760> you'll<00:00:22.910> see<00:00:22.940> some<00:00:23.180> inside

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
our website you'll see some inside

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.060 
our website you'll see some inside
photos<00:00:23.869> you'll<00:00:23.990> see<00:00:24.140> how<00:00:24.230> jam-packed<00:00:24.800> it<00:00:24.949> is

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
photos you'll see how jam-packed it is

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.450 
photos you'll see how jam-packed it is
truly<00:00:25.609> amazing<00:00:26.470> so<00:00:27.470> it<00:00:27.800> has<00:00:27.830> kind<00:00:28.250> of<00:00:28.279> like<00:00:28.400> a

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
truly amazing so it has kind of like a

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.490 
truly amazing so it has kind of like a
traditional<00:00:28.939> front<00:00:29.180> end<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.960> packets<00:00:30.350> called

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
traditional front end the packets called

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.439 
traditional front end the packets called
the<00:00:30.619> power<00:00:30.800> tube<00:00:31.070> you<00:00:31.310> have<00:00:31.550> a<00:00:31.789> trim<00:00:32.059> control

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
the power tube you have a trim control

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.200 
the power tube you have a trim control
and<00:00:32.689> you<00:00:32.750> have<00:00:32.870> a<00:00:32.899> gain<00:00:33.170> control<00:00:33.590> about<00:00:34.070> 65<00:00:34.880> DB

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
and you have a gain control about 65 DB

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.850 
and you have a gain control about 65 DB
of<00:00:35.480> gain<00:00:35.510> with<00:00:35.899> these<00:00:36.020> things<00:00:36.230> are<00:00:36.350> lots<00:00:36.680> of

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
of gain with these things are lots of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.170 
of gain with these things are lots of
level<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:37.340> can<00:00:37.489> drive<00:00:37.610> just<00:00:37.790> about<00:00:37.970> any

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
level so you can drive just about any

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.880 
level so you can drive just about any
kind<00:00:38.329> of<00:00:38.480> mic<00:00:38.660> into<00:00:38.870> it<00:00:39.110> certainly<00:00:39.680> all<00:00:39.860> the

very straight up polarity reverse to
make<00:00:47.450> sure<00:00:47.629> that<00:00:47.809> if<00:00:47.960> you're<00:00:48.079> using<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.500> Mike's

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
make sure that if you're using to Mike's

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.160 
make sure that if you're using to Mike's
you<00:00:48.950> get<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.190> best<00:00:49.370> stereo<00:00:50.180> imaging<00:00:50.629> you've

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
you get the best stereo imaging you've

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.880 
you get the best stereo imaging you've
got<00:00:51.469> a<00:00:51.680> high<00:00:52.719> boost<00:00:53.719> we<00:00:54.140> call<00:00:54.320> air<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:54.860> that

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
got a high boost we call air so that

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.440 
got a high boost we call air so that
adds<00:00:55.219> a<00:00:55.399> little<00:00:55.520> bit<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.760> shimmer<00:00:56.059> in<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.270> high

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
adds a little bit of shimmer in the high

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.139 
adds a little bit of shimmer in the high
end<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:56.899> then<00:00:57.289> a<00:00:57.440> low<00:00:57.710> frequency<00:00:57.920> cut<00:00:58.670> that

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
end and then a low frequency cut that

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.939 
end and then a low frequency cut that
gets<00:00:59.329> rid<00:00:59.480> of<00:00:59.539> resonance<00:01:00.110> so<00:01:00.289> very<00:01:00.620> straight

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
gets rid of resonance so very straight

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.250 
gets rid of resonance so very straight
up<00:01:01.129> very<00:01:01.370> easy<00:01:01.610> to<00:01:01.820> use<00:01:01.850> XLR<00:01:02.750> input<00:01:03.079> on<00:01:03.170> the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
up very easy to use XLR input on the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.469 
up very easy to use XLR input on the
front<00:01:03.289> so<00:01:03.980> what<00:01:04.460> that<00:01:04.489> means<00:01:04.789> is<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:04.969> lot<00:01:05.360> of

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
front so what that means is a lot of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:06.849 
front so what that means is a lot of
people<00:01:05.570> today<00:01:05.780> are<00:01:05.869> recording<00:01:06.409> in<00:01:06.529> the<00:01:06.679> same

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:06.859 
people today are recording in the same

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:08.260 
people today are recording in the same
student<00:01:07.279> that<00:01:07.369> they<00:01:07.549> you<00:01:07.850> know<00:01:07.909> that<00:01:08.119> they're

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
student that they you know that they're

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.519 
student that they you know that they're
working<00:01:08.389> in<00:01:08.779> there<00:01:08.959> so<00:01:09.139> they<00:01:09.259> can<00:01:09.289> put<00:01:09.499> a

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:09.529 
working in there so they can put a

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:11.529 
working in there so they can put a
microphone<00:01:09.889> up<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.459> patch<00:01:10.729> in<00:01:10.969> away<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:11.329> go

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
microphone up you patch in away you go

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.039 
microphone up you patch in away you go
really<00:01:11.869> fast<00:01:12.200> really<00:01:12.619> really<00:01:13.039> efficient

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
really fast really really efficient

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.199 
really fast really really efficient
other<00:01:15.049> than<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.319> 10<00:01:15.740> segment<00:01:16.310> LED<00:01:16.520> tells<00:01:17.090> you

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
where you're at hit it hard it distorts

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.809 
where you're at hit it hard it distorts
lovely<00:01:21.079> I<00:01:21.259> mean<00:01:21.469> it's<00:01:21.649> nice<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.279> this<00:01:22.490> is<00:01:22.639> not

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:22.819 
lovely I mean it's nice and this is not

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:25.149 
lovely I mean it's nice and this is not
a<00:01:22.849> glory<00:01:23.240> tube<00:01:23.539> this<00:01:23.749> is<00:01:23.899> a<00:01:23.929> hundred<00:01:24.439> and<00:01:24.590> forty

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
a glory tube this is a hundred and forty

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.849 
a glory tube this is a hundred and forty
volts<00:01:25.429> to<00:01:25.789> the<00:01:25.880> tube<00:01:26.090> very<00:01:26.899> very<00:01:27.170> cool<00:01:27.560> we've

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
volts to the tube very very cool we've

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.649 
volts to the tube very very cool we've
got<00:01:28.039> a<00:01:28.069> charge<00:01:28.369> pump<00:01:28.579> inside<00:01:28.939> that<00:01:29.209> does<00:01:29.479> that

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
got a charge pump inside that does that

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.959 
got a charge pump inside that does that
so<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:29.929> takes<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.439> plus<00:01:30.919> minus<00:01:31.130> 16<00:01:31.549> volt<00:01:31.759> out

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
so it takes that plus minus 16 volt out

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.779 
so it takes that plus minus 16 volt out
of<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:32.389> work<00:01:32.929> horse<00:01:33.259> or<00:01:33.529> that<00:01:33.770> API<00:01:34.159> rack<00:01:34.549> or

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
of that work horse or that API rack or

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.179 
of that work horse or that API rack or
whatever<00:01:34.999> you<00:01:35.149> have<00:01:35.419> and<00:01:35.689> then<00:01:36.229> increases<00:01:37.069> it

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
whatever you have and then increases it

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.620 
whatever you have and then increases it
