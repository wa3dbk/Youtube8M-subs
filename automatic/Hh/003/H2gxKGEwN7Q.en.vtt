we<00:02:02.939> are<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> look<00:02:03.329> at<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.810> flame<00:02:04.259> strike

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
we are going to look at is flame strike

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.359 
we are going to look at is flame strike
flame<00:02:05.460> strike<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.600> damage<00:02:07.560> where

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
flame strike is a damage where

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.089 
flame strike is a damage where
it<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.789> one<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.360> your<00:02:09.569> specials<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.739> get

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
it is one of your specials that you get

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.289 
it is one of your specials that you get
forgetting<00:02:11.849> glory<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.690> think<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.349> and

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
forgetting glory I think it is and

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.850 
forgetting glory I think it is and
basically<00:02:15.299> it's<00:02:15.540> just<00:02:15.659> some<00:02:15.989> damage<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.590> I

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
basically it's just some damage and I

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.770 
basically it's just some damage and I
like<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.310> over<00:02:17.760> hollow<00:02:18.000> ground<00:02:18.360> because

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
like that over hollow ground because

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.320 
like that over hollow ground because
it's<00:02:19.080> more<00:02:19.769> compact<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.549> it<00:02:20.700> pushes<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.180> guys

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
it's more compact and it pushes the guys

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.740 
it's more compact and it pushes the guys
up<00:02:21.599> but<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.830> powers<00:02:23.489> or<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:23.879> glory<00:02:24.269> powers

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
up but the powers or the glory powers

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.199
