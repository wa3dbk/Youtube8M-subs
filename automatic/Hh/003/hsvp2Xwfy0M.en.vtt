00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.779
 hello how about youtube friends today 

00:00:02.249 --> 00:00:06.420
 I will teach to play the song our 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:08.280
 panda fiction they had already asked me in 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.620
 repeated times more songs of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.930
 panda we already have the song of the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.309
 unfortunate do not cry for whom 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.570
 I want to find it on my channel 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.060
 this is also a song 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 relatively simple and we're going to 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.900
 use our fret capo so that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.940
 we get the perfect tuning takes 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.520
 very simple chords and they will be very 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.890
 easy with this tutorial well let's 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.529
 start with the song ok we're going to 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.440
 start merging our fret field 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.940
 in what would be the first fret the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.940
 chords that we're going to use are going to be 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.810
 re 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.519
 F sharp minor 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.240
 yes minor 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.610
 sun with a neighborhood in F sharp minor 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.059
 and the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.760
 let's start with the first stanza 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.409
 of the song and we 're going to do nothing 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.600
 more with an equal trait down and 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.600
 we counted four times we started 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.840
 i 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.400
 Now let's give it more input and let's go 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.400
 to occupy the next strum 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.320
 ok and then we start with the tickets 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.320
 we started again in a network 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.640
 all right 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.180
 all right 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.610
 and we finish in the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.130
 ok practically this is the whole song 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.220
 it's the same circle and good and where 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.500
 enter already as it would be like the maximum chorus 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.170
 that I believe we are going to use a series 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.380
 of different features to give you more 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.380
 so we begin again king 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.220
 and here the strumming does not do anything else 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.220
 down 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.310
 and again 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.800
 and well after this, they come as 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.870
 what would be an inter and that we do 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.910
 just doing nothing else radio towards 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.610
 below and after occupying the trait that 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.540
 I taught them ok we started with what will be 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.540
 the part of the inter 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.090
 all right 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.090
 i 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.200
 and here we occupy the same yardstick 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.510
 for you 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.770
 a relatively simple song I would 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.110
 I noticed that good used in the field 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.960
 fret and these are the chords that 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.540
 you can notice in the song you know that 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.640
 if you have questions, subscribe to my 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.590
 channel so that in this way the videos 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.040
 that I'm going up they decide directly their 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.560
 mail 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.430
 that would be all for today 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.430
