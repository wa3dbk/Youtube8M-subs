00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.930
 Hi guys, let's talk a little bit about United States behavior. 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.700
 borja made three sources of recipes to his people he cultural differences that 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.440
 Brazil had these birds and mammals that are very important to them. 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.350
 establish that the accountants and some games then made a list to 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.900
 you stay connected 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.439
 such as in the first thing that the rate considered a lack that the magazine is 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.089
 introduced 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.059
 we have that thing of 15 minutes everything related to it only 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.390
 in the United States if you arrive late at work if you take a 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.100
 Mixed team or yawn 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.340
 so always leave early from home especially if you are a region 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.670
 With the grandson you were under, you're going to be late, 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.550
 catch bad 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.969
 I'm going to talk a little bit about alcoholic drink here in Brazil. 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.479
 you can drink legally from 18 years after 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.280
 decision that in the United States legal age beyond being 21 years that they will 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.060
 see me pretend to be unfamiliar and with the Brazilian who always finds a way 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.830
 it is no use making false identities false happiness because they will ask 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.470
 your passport 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.470
 you will risk going back to Brazil the orange overalls 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.860
 but one thing in Brazilian life pdg in the work environment Americans have 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.360
 a very different culture from our super-nice edition and yes 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.840
 can be very dear more on the desktop they already have this 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.880
 habit of embracing once in front of the table the chest in the back has nothing 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.130
 they are already super strange 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.189
 and it's worth the thing you up to from harassment 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.120
 sex shop 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.460
 for release but is true especially in the work environment 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.850
 so he said that a handshake is more than enough and there is not 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.140
 childhood sign 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.520
 I'll tell you a little bit about passport, you have to take care of your passport. 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.750
 as if he were his son because he lost the US passport to 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.750
 Headache 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.020
 first because the country is huge so there is no embassy of brasil 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.340
 in the whole city sometimes you'll have to end up traveling somewhere else to 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.189
 be able to recover the passport or that headache will spend a 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.169
 money will give you a bigger job then 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.169
 In this case, your thompson right photo is fine. 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:16.370
 Let us now speak of the event students in common practice in the United States. 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.669
 Most employers peace yes the anti-drug examination even before you enter 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:24.529
 in the company so if you are Russian if you have experienced if you want 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:25.460
 to experiment 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.810
 You better stop there. 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.939
 see a doctor or the time to find out how long 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.599
 the substance stays in the body so you do not go through and never 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.310
 lost the job in united states occasion in fair of santana 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:43.040

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.069

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.099

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.060
 endorsing that it is on the outside at last all seasons unfortunately people 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.019
 There are several participants who have been injured but this happens. 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.889
 several times by reckless mean of the gang if you injured the leg a 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.469
 arm assured will cover her expenses marcela gets no work going 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.959

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:08.900
 all is not 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.980

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.329

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.569
 underneath 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.389
 I did not talk about bombs. 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.439
 It seems to be a joke, but it's just for you, you're not letting go. 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.139
 and 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.579
 I'm going to hit the river and avoid talking about boring situation. 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.220
 Nokia's American said she did not know mainly 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.279

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:39.529
