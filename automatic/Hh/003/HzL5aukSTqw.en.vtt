go for a seismic toss sneaking some
perhaps<00:03:33.220> which<00:03:33.579> was<00:03:33.700> good<00:03:33.850> for<00:03:33.880> me<00:03:34.060> but<00:03:34.840> he's

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
perhaps which was good for me but he's

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.930 
perhaps which was good for me but he's
draining<00:03:35.590> my<00:03:35.829> health<00:03:36.040> fast<00:03:36.400> with<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.670> lead

our<00:03:45.760> hacks<00:03:46.209> which<00:03:46.359> is<00:03:46.480> really<00:03:46.750> really<00:03:46.930> bad<00:03:47.019> for

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
our hacks which is really really bad for

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.190 
our hacks which is really really bad for
him<00:03:47.560> getting<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.190> /<00:03:48.370> hacks<00:03:48.579> in<00:03:48.700> row<00:03:49.019> but<00:03:50.019> i

here<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:51.940> side<00:03:52.120> switch<00:03:52.329> out<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.570> go<00:03:52.660> to

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
here so I side switch out and go to

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.750 
here so I side switch out and go to
hitmontop<00:03:53.079> and<00:03:53.500> he<00:03:54.130> goes<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.370> another<00:03:54.459> Rock

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760

hitmontop and he goes to another Rock
polish<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:56.320> was<00:03:56.620> okay<00:03:56.709> for<00:03:56.829> me<00:03:57.010> because

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
polish and that was okay for me because

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.580 
polish and that was okay for me because
he's<00:03:57.790> still<00:03:58.239> paralyzed<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.109> I<00:03:59.380> can<00:03:59.500> go

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590

straight for the close combat because I

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.810 
straight for the close combat because I
know<00:04:02.140> I'm<00:04:02.290> probably<00:04:02.350> still<00:04:02.590> faster<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.340> take

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820

it<00:05:00.410> in<00:05:00.470> for<00:05:00.500> fodder<00:05:00.830> basically<00:05:01.400> just<00:05:01.550> because

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
it in for fodder basically just because

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:02.860 
it in for fodder basically just because
that's<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:01.970> only<00:05:02.030> thing<00:05:02.300> I<00:05:02.390> could<00:05:02.450> do<00:05:02.660> at<00:05:02.780> this

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
that's the only thing I could do at this

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.220 
that's the only thing I could do at this
point<00:05:03.190> because<00:05:04.420> sleeping<00:05:05.420> red<00:05:05.570> shield<00:05:05.780> 85<00:05:06.110> hit

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
point because sleeping red shield 85 hit

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.080 
point because sleeping red shield 85 hit
points<00:05:06.530> isn't<00:05:06.650> enough<00:05:06.890> less<00:05:07.220> seismic<00:05:07.640> toss<00:05:07.760> so

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
points isn't enough less seismic toss so

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.330 
points isn't enough less seismic toss so

I<00:05:11.900> adore<00:05:12.140> he<00:05:12.350> thinking<00:05:12.680> I<00:05:12.890> would<00:05:13.340> over<00:05:13.490> dick

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700

I adore he thinking I would over dick
and<00:05:13.910> he<00:05:14.660> makes<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.870> prediction<00:05:15.200> again<00:05:15.440> and

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
and he makes the prediction again and

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.770

that's<00:05:31.550> really<00:05:31.820> really<00:05:31.970> bad<00:05:32.240> for<00:05:32.480> my<00:05:32.540> tokus<00:05:33.110> I

the<00:06:22.520> leasorn<00:06:23.030> too<00:06:23.210> much<00:06:23.360> so<00:06:23.540> I<00:06:23.570> go<00:06:23.690> for<00:06:23.870> a<00:06:23.900> tow

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
the leasorn too much so I go for a tow

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.140 
the leasorn too much so I go for a tow
kiss<00:06:24.470> and<00:06:24.680> he<00:06:24.860> power<00:06:25.130> with<00:06:25.310> my<00:06:25.460> tokus<00:06:25.910> and<00:06:26.120> I

kiss and he power with my tokus and I
think<00:06:26.600> tokes<00:06:26.960> is<00:06:27.200> pretty<00:06:27.470> much<00:06:27.560> uses<00:06:27.950> this

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
think tokes is pretty much uses this

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.120 
think tokes is pretty much uses this
point<00:06:28.390> because<00:06:29.390> I<00:06:29.570> know<00:06:29.630> he's<00:06:29.810> probably<00:06:30.800> gonna

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
point because I know he's probably gonna

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.700 
point because I know he's probably gonna
die<00:06:31.430> from<00:06:31.820> toxic<00:06:32.780> but<00:06:32.900> he<00:06:33.020> doesn't<00:06:33.410> this<00:06:33.500> turn

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
die from toxic but he doesn't this turn

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.440 
die from toxic but he doesn't this turn
either<00:06:33.890> which<00:06:34.490> I<00:06:34.610> was<00:06:34.730> hoping<00:06:35.060> it<00:06:35.180> would<00:06:35.300> be

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450
