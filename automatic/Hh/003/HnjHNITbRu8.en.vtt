00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
took it to the next layer

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.240 
took it to the next layer
yeah<00:04:55.170> and<00:04:55.770> so<00:04:56.120> what<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.150> wanted<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.780> do<00:04:58.070> was<00:04:59.070> to

options<00:05:16.350> but<00:05:16.680> well<00:05:17.160> we've<00:05:17.280> actually<00:05:17.460> done<00:05:17.790> to

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
options but well we've actually done to

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.020 
options but well we've actually done to
the<00:05:18.000> rear<00:05:18.180> we've<00:05:18.390> got<00:05:18.770> diamond<00:05:19.770> machining<00:05:20.430> you

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
the rear we've got diamond machining you

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.380 
the rear we've got diamond machining you
know<00:05:21.150> which<00:05:21.330> is<00:05:21.480> more<00:05:21.690> accurate<00:05:22.230> and<00:05:23.270> such<00:05:24.270> as

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
know which is more accurate and such as

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.460 
know which is more accurate and such as
that<00:05:24.570> piece<00:05:24.840> there<00:05:25.110> that<00:05:25.350> came<00:05:25.650> in<00:05:27.170> two<00:05:28.170> pieces

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
that piece there that came in two pieces

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.950 
that piece there that came in two pieces
it's<00:05:28.920> now<00:05:29.100> in<00:05:29.310> one<00:05:29.580> so<00:05:30.210> that<00:05:30.360> makes<00:05:30.600> you<00:05:30.750> more

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
it's now in one so that makes you more

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.470 
it's now in one so that makes you more
accurate<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.890> that<00:05:32.040> that<00:05:32.280> that<00:05:32.940> goes<00:05:33.120> into<00:05:33.300> the

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
accurate to that that that goes into the

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.600 
accurate to that that that goes into the
center<00:05:33.870> hit<00:05:34.020> that's<00:05:34.260> wrong<00:05:34.590> here<00:05:35.010> and<00:05:35.280> that's

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
center hit that's wrong here and that's

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.700 
center hit that's wrong here and that's
the<00:05:35.760> most<00:05:35.940> important<00:05:36.600> bit<00:05:36.780> way<00:05:37.020> you<00:05:37.080> can<00:05:37.500> see<00:05:37.680> a

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
the most important bit way you can see a

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.100 
the most important bit way you can see a
wobble<00:05:38.070> if<00:05:38.160> you<00:05:38.310> spin<00:05:38.610> a<00:05:38.640> center<00:05:39.060> pin<00:05:39.240> yeah<00:05:39.570> you

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
wobble if you spin a center pin yeah you

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.530 
wobble if you spin a center pin yeah you
know<00:05:40.230> if<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:40.800> get<00:05:40.980> more<00:05:41.730> than<00:05:41.970> say<00:05:42.150> two<00:05:42.210> or

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
know if you get more than say two or

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.500 
know if you get more than say two or
three<00:05:42.750> foul<00:05:42.990> cross<00:05:43.440> that<00:05:43.650> five<00:05:43.890> inches<00:05:44.510> then

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
three foul cross that five inches then

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.360 
three foul cross that five inches then
it'll<00:05:45.750> wobble<00:05:46.110> like<00:05:46.260> a<00:05:46.320> bite<00:05:46.590> will<00:05:46.860> you'll<00:05:47.100> see

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
it'll wobble like a bite will you'll see

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.550 
it'll wobble like a bite will you'll see
it<00:05:47.430> but<00:05:48.150> have<00:05:48.270> anything<00:05:48.570> one<00:05:48.780> piece<00:05:49.050> makes<00:05:49.410> it

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
it but have anything one piece makes it

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.740 
it but have anything one piece makes it
one<00:05:49.710> stronger<00:05:50.250> and<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.550> more<00:05:50.760> accurate<00:05:51.270> so

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
one stronger and to more accurate so

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.110 
one stronger and to more accurate so
that<00:05:52.140> that<00:05:52.410> else<00:05:52.590> with<00:05:52.830> running<00:05:53.669> of<00:05:53.790> the<00:05:53.880> real

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
that that else with running of the real

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.140 
that that else with running of the real
and<00:05:54.830> then<00:05:55.830> we've<00:05:56.370> done<00:05:56.400> a<00:05:56.580> stainless<00:05:57.120> steel

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
and then we've done a stainless steel

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.100 
and then we've done a stainless steel
shaft<00:05:58.640> we've<00:05:59.640> improved<00:06:00.090> the<00:06:00.300> clicker<00:06:00.630> gearing

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
shaft we've improved the clicker gearing

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.250 
shaft we've improved the clicker gearing
inside<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:03.270> that's<00:06:03.570> all<00:06:03.750> made<00:06:03.930> out<00:06:04.110> of

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
inside and that's all made out of

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.969 
inside and that's all made out of
stainless<00:06:04.470> steel<00:06:04.979> as<00:06:05.160> well<00:06:05.190> we<00:06:06.150> use<00:06:06.390> in<00:06:06.979> what

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
stainless steel as well we use in what

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.980 
stainless steel as well we use in what
they<00:06:08.070> call<00:06:08.250> a<00:06:08.280> back<00:06:08.700> five<00:06:09.320> bearings<00:06:10.320> in<00:06:10.530> it

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
they call a back five bearings in it

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.440 
they call a back five bearings in it
there's<00:06:12.990> a<00:06:13.140> really<00:06:13.560> really<00:06:13.590> high<00:06:13.890> quality<00:06:14.450> but

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
there's a really really high quality but

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.780 
there's a really really high quality but
then<00:06:15.570> also<00:06:15.810> we've<00:06:16.229> used<00:06:16.500> des<00:06:16.950> Pont<00:06:17.190> krytox

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
then also we've used des Pont krytox

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.290 
then also we've used des Pont krytox
grease<00:06:18.180> in<00:06:18.450> there<00:06:18.660> which<00:06:19.500> is<00:06:19.880> which<00:06:20.880> doesn't

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
grease in there which is which doesn't

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.050 
grease in there which is which doesn't
freeze<00:06:21.660> up<00:06:21.960> to<00:06:22.229> minus<00:06:22.740> 60<00:06:23.130> centigrade<00:06:23.700> it<00:06:23.850> also

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
freeze up to minus 60 centigrade it also

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.060 
freeze up to minus 60 centigrade it also
work<00:06:24.540> in<00:06:24.810> tropical<00:06:25.020> condition

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
work in tropical condition

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.780 
work in tropical condition
you<00:06:26.550> might<00:06:26.790> say<00:06:27.090> well<00:06:27.450> you<00:06:28.080> know<00:06:28.490> why<00:06:29.490> go<00:06:29.760> to

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
you might say well you know why go to
