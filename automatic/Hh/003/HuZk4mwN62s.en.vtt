 hello you forget how are you my name 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.680
 You are welcome to questions about 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.050
 aquariums and we are going to deal with topics like 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.120
 aloe vera liters per hour of filters to 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.000
 girlfriends spoiling females 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.220
 male bubis and reddened spiders and the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 first comment says well Jorge Luis 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.330
 visions back passes us a video that has 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.609
 made on aloe vera medication 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.699
 for homemade fish with aloe vera or aloe vera 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.670
 with dropper and says is this video 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.730
 well or not in our car show them 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.840
 how to make a medication for 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.079
 disease and / or stress for your fish with 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.120
 aloe vera or aloe many you ask very 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.890
 often unique by how to dose the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.510
 aloe vera in the award then here you have 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.640
 a good tutorial that is very good and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.680
 It also serves not only for diseases 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.960
 but also to help the fish to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.090
 recover and feed frames 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.000
 saavedra says I have an aquarium of 90 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.760
 liters with a power head for 700 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.309
 liters now water tempered to 25 degrees 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.229
 with zebra guppy fish marathon runners 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.030
 and a few prawns so far is 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.640
 also four months but 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.740
 I must go down to a new underwear 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.720
 Now this is going to depend on how you have 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.880
 configured the aquarium and the output of 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.009
 filter being bad that generates a lot 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.930
 current moving the plants and 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.570
 not letting the fish rest in the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.880
 meters what is really important is the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.100
 ability to hold water and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.920
 secondly the liters hours that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.140
 can move that must be at least 4 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.110
 times the volume of the aquarium and in your 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.030
 case is 8 times higher so if you see 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.340
 that the plants move too much and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.590
 the fish can not rest you would have 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.140
 to modify the filter output and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.820
 either with a flute or changing the output 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.250
 of direction and if it's not enough 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.710
 then if it would be appropriate to put a 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.530
 head of power between 300 and 500 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.270
 liters now agustÃ­n domÃ­nguez says hello 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.069
 I am new at this you could tell me 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.409
 what the leaves of misano days are put 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.030
 black can be seaweed the second with 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.950
 a liquid fertilizer like we do not have 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.080
 images and we do not know if they can be 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.630
 algae or that simply the leaves are 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.640
 spoil in both cases the beans are 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.590
 plants that require little fertilization and 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.490
 little lighting if for example you have 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.890
 few plants 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.020
 that most are rain or plants 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.710
 easy I would recommend you stop paying 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.960
 for a time and illuminate no more than 5 or 6 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.550
 hours a day the aquarium and then I'm going to 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.470
 do the basic care for 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.930
 plants make weekly water changes 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.730
 50% without chlorine and the same 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.470
 temperature that the aquarium or throw it 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.450
 little by little during the day and clean the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.100
 filter once a month with water from the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.530
 which with all this your sandals 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.330
 they should start to recover but very 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.230
 slowly since they are plants 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.600
 slow growth 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.090
 if you want to speed up the process you can 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.400
 to avoid co2 because it helps a lot 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.000
 any plant to improve faster 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.850
 erick ortega uganda comments hello jose mi 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.100
 male vein killed my female beta I made 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.440
 everything so that everything went well what should I do 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.990
 do I'm afraid they kill another 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.730
 female greetings from alvarado the betas 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.830
 they are especially violent with 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.110
 males but also harasses a lot 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.300
 females and that's why you should have several 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.100
 females for a single male and also with 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.380
 many hiding places in the aquarium so that 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.150
 the females can get away from their harassment 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.130
 everyday and if it is not possible then 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.270
 have them in another guard separately then 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.280
 we have some 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.870
 with certain conflicting females and 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.970
 Apparent females that happen to be 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.790
 males so with these fish to the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.550
 minimum that we see a conflict we must 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.410
 separate those from aquariums or put some 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.270
 container so that they are separated 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.270
 because if they do not fight until death 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.920
 Miguel Angel Davila says hello 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.530
 introduced 3 normal guti males and a 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.050
 jumbo also male in my aquarium of 63 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.850
 liters with plants trunks black gravel 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.710
 heater and cascade filters my 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.050
 question is can they live well without 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.960
 no female fish enabled 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.810
 as the guti are usually recommended with 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.580
 a single male in the small aquarium with 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.900
 several females but now well if the 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.820
 support when you say it's okay 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.740
 conditioned with shelter if in addition 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.840
 you have an acceptable amount of fish 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.270
 for the liters that are could work 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.250
 but this is already very difficult and it is going to 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.560
 depend on the character of each fish 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.360
 because if the fish have their own 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.459
 personality I also tell you that if 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.260
 it works has a bad part that would be 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.660
 put a single female with so many 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.400
 males because they either kill it from stress or they 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.700
 they will kill between them I'm sorry a little 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.520
 of water 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.950
 andy you will see his says help people by 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.830
 please read mandarin or mandarin 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.290
 completely oranges 2 male and female 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.240
 you can see the red gills I do not know 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.700
 if this is normal in this kind of 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.130
 molise but in which I have as silver 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.660
 ty black I have not noticed this besides the 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.940
 male moves violently swimming from 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.800
 side by side as your body rocking the 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.160
 female presents spots between black and 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.620
 reddish 2 in total one under the chin and 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.170
 another one on the side of the head already have 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.210
 two or three days in my aquarium is 24 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.250
 degrees I have about 30 three snails 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.340
 adults apples and the other little ones of 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.130
 1 to 2 cm and 4 or 5 or more moles 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.930
 aquarium is 112 liters but I stop 5 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.330
 to 8 centimeters of free space 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.580
 crystal is but this time you answer me 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.650
 It is urgent and I want to save these 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.870
 animals I understand that we are several already 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.150
 Sometimes you can not answer everything but in 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.190
 truth is urgent please thanks very much 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.020
 nice videos I always recommend you 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.150
 channel I really wait for your answer 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.640
 thank you very much for having the patience 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.680
 to wait for my answers although to 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.880
 sometimes leave us and especially thanks for 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.950
 understand when not 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.620
 first make sure you do the 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.900
 correct water changes weekly and 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.000
 discarding this we could start to 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.400
 think of some kind of disease if 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.320
 we see other symptoms as it can be that 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.750
 crawl in the gills or that 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.970
 breathe very quickly and then we could 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.830
 try to medicate with medicines to 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.560
 cream to all as can be the 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.990
 practical before him to cure floren gasol 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.790
 and multi cure among others following their 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.190
 instructions and this is important 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.870
 airing the aquarium when we use it 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.360
 If you do not have another aquarium to medicate 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.950
 these fish apart you'll have to take out the 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.470
 filter that aquarium and leave it 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.570
 running during the time of 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.970
 medication but that yes without stopping 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.260
 make water changes almost daily in 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.330
 the aquarium of the fish 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.130
 good guys and girls we have finished in 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.620

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.990
 thanks again to all those who 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.330

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.270

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.130
 impossible for me to answer all 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.120
 Well I'm leaving but I promise you 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.400
