like<00:00:27.359> something<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.840> might<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.380> March<00:00:28.650> or

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
like something you might see in March or

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.550 
like something you might see in March or
April<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:30.330> considering<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:30.990> time<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.439> the

advance of that and that will set the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.040 
advance of that and that will set the
stage<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.860> some<00:00:35.280> strong<00:00:35.550> storms<00:00:35.820> later<00:00:36.210> that

at SPC have a five percent circle over
Northwest<00:01:29.130> Alabama<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:30.780> means<00:01:31.020> there's<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
Northwest Alabama that means there's a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
Northwest Alabama that means there's a

25<00:01:33.720> miles<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.290> given<00:01:34.590> point<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:36.780> know

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
25 miles of a given point and you know

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
25 miles of a given point and you know
that<00:01:37.079> sounds<00:01:37.439> low<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.920> understand<00:01:38.340> tornadoes

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that sounds low but understand tornadoes

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.260 
that sounds low but understand tornadoes
are<00:01:38.909> very<00:01:39.060> small<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.490> even<00:01:41.490> large<00:01:41.729> tornadoes

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
are very small and even large tornadoes

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.719 
are very small and even large tornadoes
compared<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> big<00:01:43.170> county<00:01:43.560> small<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.280> we'll

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
compared to a big county small so we'll

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.889 
compared to a big county small so we'll
keep<00:01:44.939> an<00:01:45.090> eye<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.390> radar<00:01:45.509> pretty

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
keep an eye on the radar pretty

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.260 
keep an eye on the radar pretty
carefully<00:01:46.409> today<00:01:46.850> tornadoes<00:01:47.850> are<00:01:47.880> rare<00:01:48.240> in

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
carefully today tornadoes are rare in

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.469 
carefully today tornadoes are rare in
June<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:48.930> they<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.350> happen<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:51.360> then

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
know that becomes significant there's

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.920 
know that becomes significant there's
some<00:03:42.160> olicity<00:03:42.670> involved<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.269> is<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.600> zero

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
some olicity involved this is the zero

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.539 
some olicity involved this is the zero

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
sky-high but again there's significant

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.050 
sky-high but again there's significant
for<00:03:49.030> June<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:50.380> this<00:03:51.040> is<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.310> wind<00:03:51.549> field<00:03:51.850> at

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
for June and this is the wind field at

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.930 
for June and this is the wind field at
about<00:03:52.239> 5,000<00:03:52.959> feet<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.320> low<00:03:53.470> level<00:03:53.680> jet<00:03:54.130> this

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
about 5,000 feet the low level jet this

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.120 
about 5,000 feet the low level jet this

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
and again those numbers aren't screaming

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.310 
and again those numbers aren't screaming
but<00:03:59.440> they're<00:03:59.590> very<00:04:00.570> stout<00:04:01.570> for<00:04:01.900> this<00:04:02.049> time<00:04:02.290> of

this will be a major tornado outbreak
today<00:04:35.710> it<00:04:35.830> won't<00:04:35.979> be<00:04:36.250> but<00:04:36.490> there<00:04:37.270> could<00:04:37.479> be<00:04:37.539> a

today it won't be but there could be a

numerous showers and storms tomorrow the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.150 
numerous showers and storms tomorrow the
severe<00:04:52.630> weather<00:04:52.660> possibility<00:04:53.590> is<00:04:53.680> much<00:04:53.889> lower

severe weather possibility is much lower

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.010 
severe weather possibility is much lower
but<00:04:54.520> again<00:04:55.240> there<00:04:55.389> could<00:04:55.479> be<00:04:55.509> some<00:04:55.780> flash

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
but again there could be some flash

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.129 
but again there could be some flash
flooding<00:04:56.050> concerns<00:04:57.000> this<00:04:58.000> is<00:04:58.180> Thursday<00:04:58.930> the

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
flooding concerns this is Thursday the

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.640 
flooding concerns this is Thursday the
dynamic<00:04:59.710> support<00:05:00.130> weakens<00:05:00.789> so<00:05:01.389> perhaps<00:05:02.380> the

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
dynamic support weakens so perhaps the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.589 
dynamic support weakens so perhaps the
showers<00:05:03.039> will<00:05:03.220> be<00:05:03.310> fewer<00:05:03.729> in<00:05:03.970> number<00:05:04.389> and

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
showers will be fewer in number and

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.659 
showers will be fewer in number and
mainly<00:05:05.080> during<00:05:05.319> the<00:05:05.560> afternoon<00:05:06.190> and<00:05:06.400> evening

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
mainly during the afternoon and evening

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.149 
mainly during the afternoon and evening
hours<00:05:07.030> on<00:05:07.419> Thursday<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.139> pretty<00:05:08.800> much<00:05:08.860> the

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
hours on Thursday and pretty much the

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:10.830 
hours on Thursday and pretty much the
same<00:05:09.340> thing<00:05:09.610> on<00:05:09.789> Friday<00:05:10.120> but<00:05:10.270> even<00:05:10.569> Friday

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
same thing on Friday but even Friday

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.339 
same thing on Friday but even Friday
there's<00:05:11.139> a<00:05:11.199> surface<00:05:11.620> low<00:05:11.889> west<00:05:12.250> of<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.550> state

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
there's a surface low west of the state

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.779 
there's a surface low west of the state
so<00:05:14.349> certainly<00:05:14.919> a<00:05:15.009> chance<00:05:15.400> of<00:05:15.550> at<00:05:15.639> least

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
so certainly a chance of at least

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.350 
so certainly a chance of at least
