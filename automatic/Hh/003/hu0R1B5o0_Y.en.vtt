 transmit it live but here they 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.950

 white and the material of the part of 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.750
 back comes to be hyper glass I imagine 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.970
 which is to be a plastic and 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.760
 let's say good of good quality let's 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.830
 to see what is the name that is 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.620
 have given on the back is that 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.970
 there are rules now let's talk a little bit with 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.360
 Regarding the other things that are 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.070
 form presented in this event outside of 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.050
 that there are some additional accessories 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.950
 such as a smartphone or a 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.200
 front screen protector for the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.060
 galaxy s3 cell phone there are also some 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.770
 other very interesting accessories like 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.110
 the side that is a bank but 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.670
 what was that is let 's say it meets the 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.970
 type function comes to be an apple tv 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.830
 that one connects to a hd screen and 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.970
 will be able to transmit type of a mirror 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.970
 the information that you have in your 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.650
 cellular to a screen in hd of this 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.540
 so you can only play or navigate 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.850
 online from your cell phone looking at you 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.170
 use wirelessly there is another 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.080
 additional accessory that comes to 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.670
 be a wireless charger or a 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.350
 the only thing he does is to place your 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.760
 cellular on this flat platform and 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.850
 automatically the cell phone is going to 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.230
 upload and they also presented a base 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.209
 for the cell phone a desk stand 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.890
 so you can not charge your cell phone 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.510
 those are additional accessories that 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.700
 samsung has presented but 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.439
 another one of the very interesting points are 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.569
 some applications that already come with 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:35.409
 the device with what comes to be the 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.959
 s voice that is a way of commands 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.930
 that you give to your cell phone so that 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:45.159
 either to a call or to check what 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.049
 which is the temperature or how 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.579
 will be the weather at the moment in let's say 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.739
 in the city of your life your line of 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.849
 cellular how is the weather in 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.500
 example in virginia is going to be 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.420
 automatically in virginia the weather is 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.829
 The screen does not teach it so much 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.750
 it tells you from what I've been able to see 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.359
 the video let's say in the transmission in 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.769
 I live has other characteristics very 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.599
 interesting as for example if this one 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.180
 someone sends you an email or sends you a 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.650
 text message then in case 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.000
 you see that the person has sent you a 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.129
 message is you want to call that 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.290
 person and you put your cell phone in your 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.169
 heard the cell phone let's say it's so 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.639
 intelligent that will intuit that you 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.139
 you want to call that same person that 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.519
 is doing message and of 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.270
 will automatically call the person 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.930
 who just sent you the message 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.010
 it will automatically bring comfort 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.450
 approach it in your ear 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.640
 it's going to have some features 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.500
 interesting also the camera by 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.810
 example if one takes has a function 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.260
 that can take 20 consecutive photos in 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.990
 matter of 12 seconds 31 take say 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.880
 a group people taken the photo to a 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.890
 person and be taking people photos and 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.810
 then the camera automatically in shape 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.500
 intelligent and intuitive will choose the 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.830
 best photo of that range of 20 then the 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.750
 another interesting point is that that the 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.910
 camera has facial recognition 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.430
 that will be able to recognize it in the face of 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.690
 the person and in this way you can say 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.800
 if you have it hardened contact what 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.390
 you have on your facebook account when 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.160
 are you connected disguise that is to 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.140
 who belongs and you will have the option 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.060
 if you want to upload side send it to that 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.430
 group of people or the person who 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.410
 found in the photo either via mms or 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.510
 via email then how do you 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.470
 I say this new cell phone is very intuitive 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.850
 it's very interesting there are a lot of 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.500
 applications that I imagine comes in 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.660
 what is the suisse tag that comes to be 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.930
 the 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.130
 in the user interface of samsung 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.720
 then I have seen that there are a lot of 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.460
 very good things that really is in 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.430
 new user interface brings you in the 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.990
 same mobile device then I'm 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.140
 sure they will go spectacular with this 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.090
 new product I do not know the price I do not know 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.320
 exactly when will some 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.700
 Message control person my son 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.010

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.440
 product on sale I do not know that they are going to

 try to get to the maximum what we say 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.570
 to a lot of countries at the beginning 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.490
 because they want what they want 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.340
 logically sell your product that's why 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.900
 that they have taken it out in different 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.440
 connectivity and they do three that in 4g in 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.620
 hcp to more then they will try to

 world 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.540
 of grand was faster then yes 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.500
 they had in Latin America I have

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.800
 possible to enter as soon as possible 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.810
 possible to your market then it is a 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.249
 excellent final cell compared 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.879
 with iphone and iphone 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:35.679
 anything that is this is it is nothing 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:37.419
 it's really interesting and we're going to 

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:39.189
 see what price it comes here to the usa 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:41.229
 to see if I bought it would have to 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:44.319
 buy it directly without a contract or 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:46.989
 let's see what value places it 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:48.459
 samsung here in the usa without a contract 

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:50.889
 if it is inside the bar a reason 

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:52.149
 which I consider could spend what 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.279
 you will do to be able to do a review 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:55.599
 you and teach them how in what 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:58.599
 is this not only to give that in 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:01.209
 collective is something spectacular is something 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.729
 incredible and how I told you what 

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:06.879
 they do is convey the message very 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:09.639
 subliminal mind that is created for 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:11.110
 human beings is very intuitive and it is something 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.489

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.139
