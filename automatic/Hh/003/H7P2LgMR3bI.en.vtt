00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
get really I would recommend doing it

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.350 
get really I would recommend doing it
before<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.930> paint<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.290> car<00:03:02.940> however<00:03:03.940> this<00:03:04.090> it

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
before you paint the car however this it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.590 
before you paint the car however this it
doesn't<00:03:04.570> look<00:03:04.690> too<00:03:04.900> bad<00:03:04.930> on<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.320> one<00:03:06.600> there's

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
doesn't look too bad on this one there's

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.140 
doesn't look too bad on this one there's
the<00:03:07.750> light<00:03:07.900> lenses<00:03:08.290> fitted<00:03:13.350> they<00:03:14.350> have<00:03:14.710> it

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the light lenses fitted they have it

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.270 
the light lenses fitted they have it
window<00:03:16.150> rubbers<00:03:16.390> done<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.570> lot<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.320> windscreen

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
window rubbers done a lot the windscreen

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.160 
window rubbers done a lot the windscreen
doesn't<00:03:18.640> fit<00:03:18.820> perfectly<00:03:19.270> I<00:03:19.510> will<00:03:19.750> add<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:20.110> I

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
doesn't fit perfectly I will add but I

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.190 
doesn't fit perfectly I will add but I
think<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.800> just<00:03:21.190> doesn't<00:03:21.460> quite<00:03:21.610> sit<00:03:21.970> right

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
think it it just doesn't quite sit right

chuffed with this kit I really am
to<00:04:14.380> highly<00:04:14.740> recommend<00:04:15.160> doing<00:04:15.310> one<00:04:15.460> of<00:04:15.520> these

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
to highly recommend doing one of these

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.640 
to highly recommend doing one of these
jeeps<00:04:15.910> are<00:04:16.060> such<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.210> fun<00:04:16.510> little<00:04:16.660> build<00:04:16.989> simple

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
jeeps are such a fun little build simple

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.620 
jeeps are such a fun little build simple
kit<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:17.980> only<00:04:18.160> one<00:04:18.580> downside<00:04:19.120> is<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.420> fact

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
kit the only one downside is the fact

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.570 
kit the only one downside is the fact
that<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.900> interior<00:04:20.200> is<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.440> same<00:04:20.680> as<00:04:20.859> same

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
that the interior is the same as same

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.700 
that the interior is the same as same
part<00:04:21.880> as<00:04:22.060> at<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.630> bottom<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.990> chassis<00:04:23.229> that

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
part as at the bottom the chassis that

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.129 
part as at the bottom the chassis that
it's<00:04:24.100> not<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.310> major<00:04:24.550> thing<00:04:24.930> again<00:04:25.930> I'd

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
it's not a major thing again I'd

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.189 
it's not a major thing again I'd
recommend<00:04:26.710> doing<00:04:27.039> the<00:04:27.880> interior<00:04:28.180> first<00:04:28.720> if

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
recommend doing the interior first if

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.350 
recommend doing the interior first if
you<00:04:29.440> are<00:04:29.470> flocking<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.190> then<00:04:30.550> I'm<00:04:30.910> asking<00:04:31.270> it

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
you are flocking and then I'm asking it

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.659 
you are flocking and then I'm asking it
all<00:04:31.449> up<00:04:31.600> and<00:04:31.810> doing<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.080> chassis<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:33.430> makes

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
all up and doing the chassis it makes

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.110 
all up and doing the chassis it makes
life<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.120> much<00:04:34.270> easier<00:04:34.570> but<00:04:35.729> lesson<00:04:36.729> that<00:04:36.910> I

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
life so much easier but lesson that I

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.890 
life so much easier but lesson that I
want<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:37.990> know<00:04:38.080> what<00:04:38.259> you<00:04:38.530> think<00:04:38.830> this<00:04:39.729> is<00:04:40.060> by

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
want to know what you think this is by

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.140 
want to know what you think this is by
far<00:04:41.169> in<00:04:41.650> my<00:04:41.860> opinion<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.370> best<00:04:42.550> kit<00:04:42.759> I've<00:04:42.910> done

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
far in my opinion the best kit I've done

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.060 
far in my opinion the best kit I've done
so<00:04:43.360> far<00:04:43.389> in<00:04:43.870> terms<00:04:44.139> of<00:04:44.350> quality<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.800> how<00:04:44.949> it

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
so far in terms of quality and how it

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.969 
so far in terms of quality and how it
looks<00:04:45.280> etc<00:04:45.850> I'm<00:04:46.780> over<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.530> moon<00:04:47.590> with<00:04:47.800> it

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
looks etc I'm over the moon with it

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.610 
looks etc I'm over the moon with it
absolutely<00:04:48.610> over<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:48.880> moon<00:04:49.020> if<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.229> can<00:04:50.380> just

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
absolutely over the moon if I can just

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.050 
absolutely over the moon if I can just
sort<00:04:50.770> of<00:04:50.860> nail<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.400> flock<00:04:51.639> in<00:04:51.820> on<00:04:51.940> the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
sort of nail the flock in on the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.850 
sort of nail the flock in on the
interior<00:04:52.419> I<00:04:52.509> don't<00:04:52.690> know<00:04:52.750> why<00:04:52.900> I'm<00:04:53.080> I'm<00:04:53.500> not

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
interior I don't know why I'm I'm not

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.200 
interior I don't know why I'm I'm not
sure<00:04:53.919> if<00:04:54.160> it's<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.370> flocking<00:04:54.880> because<00:04:55.120> I'm

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
sure if it's the flocking because I'm

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.260 
sure if it's the flocking because I'm
using<00:04:55.389> a<00:04:55.570> different<00:04:56.490> brand<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:57.669> suppose<00:04:57.970> it's

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
using a different brand I suppose it's

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.629 
using a different brand I suppose it's
just<00:04:58.620> cheap<00:04:59.620> stuff<00:04:59.860> online<00:05:00.039> that<00:05:00.220> I<00:05:00.370> managed

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
just cheap stuff online that I managed

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.640 
just cheap stuff online that I managed
to<00:05:00.669> get<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.180> I'm<00:05:01.479> not<00:05:01.660> sure<00:05:01.870> if<00:05:01.990> that<00:05:02.020> might<00:05:02.500> be

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
to get and I'm not sure if that might be

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.330 
to get and I'm not sure if that might be
why<00:05:02.880> but<00:05:03.880> we'll<00:05:04.599> say<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:05.110> will<00:05:05.320> persevere<00:05:05.830> I

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340
