how<00:02:24.720> cheap<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.170> mean<00:02:25.440> considering<00:02:25.740> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
how cheap it is I mean considering the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.830 
how cheap it is I mean considering the
fact<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.220> Nintendo's<00:02:26.730> 3ds<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.660> same

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
fact that Nintendo's 3ds is the same

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.130 
fact that Nintendo's 3ds is the same
price<00:02:28.080> as<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.620> basic<00:02:28.920> Wi-Fi<00:02:29.250> one<00:02:30.020> for<00:02:31.020> how

price as the basic Wi-Fi one for how

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.600 
price as the basic Wi-Fi one for how
good<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.500> technology<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.280> looks<00:02:32.490> like

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
good the technology is it looks like

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.650 
good the technology is it looks like
they're<00:02:32.760> probably<00:02:32.940> going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.240> be<00:02:33.300> losing<00:02:33.510> a

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
they're probably going to be losing a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.390 
they're probably going to be losing a
lot<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.870> money<00:02:33.990> on<00:02:34.230> each<00:02:34.500> sale<00:02:34.800> which<00:02:35.160> means

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
lot of money on each sale which means

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.040 
lot of money on each sale which means
they're<00:02:35.550> really<00:02:35.850> banking<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.330> not<00:02:36.810> only<00:02:36.930> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
they're really banking on not only the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.180 
they're really banking on not only the
console<00:02:37.380> selling<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.860> lot<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.070> people

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
console selling but a lot of people

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.180 
console selling but a lot of people
buying<00:02:38.520> their<00:02:38.730> games<00:02:39.470> for<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.650> price<00:02:40.890> it's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
buying their games for that price it's

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.650 
buying their games for that price it's
very<00:02:41.460> surprising<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.270> think<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.540> actually

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
very surprising and I think it actually

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.510 
very surprising and I think it actually
could<00:02:42.960> end<00:02:43.080> up<00:02:43.200> working<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.530> their<00:02:43.620> favor<00:02:43.650> as

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
could end up working in their favor as

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.030 
could end up working in their favor as
long<00:02:44.730> as<00:02:44.760> they<00:02:45.750> get<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.930> decent<00:02:46.290> launch<00:02:46.680> title

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
long as they get a decent launch title

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.100 
long as they get a decent launch title
list<00:02:47.190> going<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.580> what<00:02:48.360> few<00:02:48.570> ones<00:02:48.750> they<00:02:48.900> showed

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
list going on what few ones they showed

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.570 
list going on what few ones they showed
right<00:02:49.350> now<00:02:49.500> such<00:02:49.890> as<00:02:50.040> uncharted<00:02:50.490> in

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580

of<00:02:52.800> them<00:02:52.890> were<00:02:53.010> massive<00:02:53.430> Wow<00:02:53.550> titles<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.030> I

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
of them were massive Wow titles that I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.370 
of them were massive Wow titles that I
think<00:02:54.300> pulled<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.780> lot<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:54.990> people<00:02:55.320> in

think pulled a lot of people in
instantly<00:02:56.390> looks<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.600> will<00:02:57.690> be<00:02:57.780> at<00:02:57.870> least

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
instantly looks like it will be at least

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.600 
instantly looks like it will be at least
solid<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:58.710> I'm<00:02:58.800> really<00:02:58.980> hoping<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.250> see<00:02:59.430> some

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
solid but I'm really hoping to see some

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.130 
solid but I'm really hoping to see some
stronger<00:03:00.000> launch<00:03:00.330> titles<00:03:00.690> from<00:03:00.750> them<00:03:00.960> if

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
stronger launch titles from them if

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.110 
stronger launch titles from them if
they're<00:03:01.350> hoping<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.680> completely<00:03:02.640> overtake<00:03:03.090> a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.950 
nintendo in the portable market which
looks<00:03:05.820> like<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.120> beetham<00:03:06.390> might<00:03:06.540> actually<00:03:06.720> be

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
looks like the beetham might actually be

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.870 
looks like the beetham might actually be
able<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.170> do<00:03:07.290> which<00:03:07.620> count<00:03:08.160> me<00:03:08.310> off<00:03:08.430> guard<00:03:08.670> a

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
its best it started off slow most of the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.840 
its best it started off slow most of the
game<00:03:13.470> announced<00:03:13.710> in<00:03:13.830> sport<00:03:14.070> very<00:03:14.280> good<00:03:14.490> but

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
game announced in sport very good but

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.790 
game announced in sport very good but
the<00:03:15.030> Vita<00:03:15.210> definitely<00:03:16.020> saved<00:03:16.290> them<00:03:16.530> they

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
the Vita definitely saved them they

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.470 
the Vita definitely saved them they
definitely<00:03:17.100> needed<00:03:17.340> one<00:03:17.640> upping<00:03:17.940> Microsoft

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
definitely needed one upping Microsoft

definitely needed one upping Microsoft
if<00:03:18.690> only<00:03:19.020> because<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.440> Vita<00:03:19.620> ended<00:03:19.950> being

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
if only because the Vita ended being

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.560 
if only because the Vita ended being
much<00:03:20.370> better<00:03:21.030> than<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.300> lot<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.480> people

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570
