00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.170
 and now how about people like I was 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.059
 seen in week 50 ship with this 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.040
 new video that recommended me a 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.710
 subscriber of the channel should do as 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.330
 he tell me what they want me to upload 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.700
 so he told me what I should do 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.310
 a 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.640
 guide list of places where you can 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.250
 get exotic objects this is 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.560
 obviously for beginners people who 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.110
 just bought the game because I know 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.600
 that to miss the kid genius that leads to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.000
 his 100 hours played just like me that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.940
 will think that this video is for those 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.700
 We do not have life, well, no, yes, 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.350
 effectively from them then you jump 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.200
 of the video you already know how to click on the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.220
 ad a dislike and 20 so they go 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.850
 do not go to the comment box 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.880
 so then to begin with if the first thing 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.800
 the first thing is good but one of the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.390
 points where we can get we have 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.870
 in quotes several opportunities is 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.330
 the root in the root in each section 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.650
 we have a chance to give us 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.230
 an exotic and good object because being the 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.360
 rai in difficult in the last we have the 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.440
 probability of giving us an object 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.180
 exotic already know very powerful or that 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.940
 they say they say yes the myth class 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.160
 some say it is strong some 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.000
 they say that it is strong of the market I do not 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.619
 it says the same thing good I deviated a little bit what 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.140
 next thing we have is when 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.970
 we ended up breaking the pot or 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.630
 games of the vanguard will have to 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.490
 remember that all these points in the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.310
 that we can get weapons are 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.060
 totally random will not give us 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.000
 plus an exotic weapon an equipment 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.580
 exotic because we opened because 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.590
 we play better than the teammates because 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.770
 we play better than the enemies and it's the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.290
 case in the crucible that does not assure us 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.869
 nothing this is totally random it has 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.900
 touched me finish first of 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.660
 its place and see that the exotic thing then 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.010
 there goes for the uncle who invested the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.680
 time he had 0.83 of reiterated that he did 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.010
 200 points good, I do not work either 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.799
 well are those cases so I do not know 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.370
 disappointment frustrate six people are 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.120
 disillusion we hope that the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.840
 the plan that will fix that soon then 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.530
 man guard vanguard list 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.349
 vanguard not to do missions of 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.170
 patrol they 're going to give you are lists of 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.780
 patrol strikes game of homeland 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.780
 lists of strikes of the vanguard 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.140
 I suppose that the bigger the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.510
 level and will increase the probability not 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.849
 I know a while ago that I do not play in the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.019
 vanguard of the truth as if good 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.870
 how is this video for those who come 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.390
 starting really recommendation no 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.010
 enter no sect or for war 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.799
 thor future or to beat or to 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.109
 new monarchy you feel that 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.030
 pot and art that because 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.609
 more likely that the equipment of 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.010
 legendary exotic took a bit in 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.860
 get them 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.170
 in these ways then 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.990
 what we are going to do is going to be 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.660
 level at level 2 the avant-garde and the level 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.410
 2 of the crucible and you can in this way 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.380
 get access to the armors 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.780
 then starting at 65 you teach either 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.240
 avant-garde either crucible we can 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.450
 get some equipment and asia 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.610
 boots helmets bibs whatever it is 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.690
 well my clear recommendation coming out 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.810
 our attitude of the subject 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.980
 another way to get it is 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.680
 decrypted in grass is all we know 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.630
 how it is injected into grass we do not take it out 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.060
 on the battlefield and we go with the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.800
 master raul already know how to jog here 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.770
 Well, they left it and on our altar 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.400
 here you can only give it obviously 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.800
 other exotic engrams I have never 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.650
 seen that they are released to someone in 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.600
 half departure to me whenever I've 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.890
 gotten it because I bought them 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.650
 to the south on the weekend and the other 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.680
 option for those who are lucky is that 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.870
 get exotic equipment 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.170
 decrypted something legendary there can 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.880
 see in legendary grass, well, I do not 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.010
 I have that luck to me has never 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.490
 happened but I have videos that up to two 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.340
 sometimes it has happened to him in a way 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:49.120
 then the following way of 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.969
 Obtaining is not because of strikes but not 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.480
 there are by list 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:58.320
 it's because of the mindfulness strike 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.530
 of the day perhaps that's the word 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.090
 assault week of sunset gives us the 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.090
 probability of getting 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:13.450
 an exotic grass then go to 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.610
 perform this assault on the case of good 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.860
 as he has also stressed this is for 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.830
 beginners when counting the assault 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.920
 exotic of sunset we will get a 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:28.300
 random reward either fragments 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:32.080
 ascending energies ascending coins 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.689
 you miss some exotic armor or 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.399
 legendary 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.080
 then those are the possible 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:39.779
 rewards at least are the ones that have 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.560
 touched and I did not say any that now yes that 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.570
 someone give it to me in the comments 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.669
 after we have our options 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.060
 we went through the engramados and we passed 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.230
 by the crucible and we went through the list of 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.669
 strikes of the vanguard and we passed 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.910
 by sunset 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:58.720
 we already went through the rae and well 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.700
 mention in the raid there is a hidden chest 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.990
 which gives us the probability of getting 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.150
 either ascending materials or a 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.730
 exotic weapon can also be a 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.470
 armor but I believe in this quite 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.090
 probability to me personally once 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.090
 Monte Carlo gave me and I've seen that 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.520
 given where I have not seen it has given pace 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.860
 johnson is then very simple then 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.340
 how is this video for the new ones 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.639
 players I already said it like 34 times them 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.380
 I will leave here in the description to 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.540
 end of the video will be served a link 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.860
 for the tracks of all weapons 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.650
 exotic that can not be achieved by 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.129
 contracts every contract I also have his 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.459
 video guide so you can go see it 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:44.729
 what you liked 59 we see you in 

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:44.729
 the next
