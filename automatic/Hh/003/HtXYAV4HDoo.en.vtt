00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Alright, go for it.

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:33.005
(Patricia) We are continuing our descent along the Sani Pass.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
(Chris - Camera man) 
Got anything to say?

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:54.025
(Joel) How are you getting down?

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.050
(Chris)
Hi Patricia. Got anything to say?

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:05.275
(Patricia)
How about a couple of Hail Marys?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
(Chris)
Have you ever had to pass a car on this route before?

00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:37.025
(Joel)
Oh yeah.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Sometimes lorries or taxis.

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:49.025
(Patricia)
It's great though because now you can enjoy the scenery as well.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.050
You get the whole perception of the depth.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Including all the hairpin turns and bends
and twists

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I think it's one ride like no other.
