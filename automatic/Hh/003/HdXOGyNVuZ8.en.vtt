around<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.109> system<00:00:25.560> since<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.160> system<00:00:26.369> is

very<00:00:26.820> very<00:00:27.090> complicated<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:28.380> often<00:00:28.890> happens

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
very very complicated this often happens

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.550 
very very complicated this often happens
if<00:00:29.460> your<00:00:29.609> pipes<00:00:29.820> aren't<00:00:30.090> sealed<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.439> owner

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
if your pipes aren't sealed so the owner

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.110

clean<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.750> told<00:00:33.989> them<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> best<00:00:34.440> way<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.710> do

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
clean and I told them the best way to do

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.549 
clean and I told them the best way to do
that<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.700> nonsense<00:00:36.329> our<00:00:36.780> odor<00:00:37.079> free

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559

color<00:00:38.309> free<00:00:38.640> super<00:00:39.059> cleaner<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.600> means<00:00:39.809> it

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
color free super cleaner that means it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.780 
color free super cleaner that means it
will<00:00:39.989> remove<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.770> degreaser<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.489> I'll

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
go ahead and leave the surface clean

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.700 
go ahead and leave the surface clean
without<00:00:44.489> harming<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.059> staining<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> paint<00:00:45.780> so

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
without harming or staining the paint so

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.779 
without harming or staining the paint so
first<00:00:46.950> thing<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.340> grab<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> yellow

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
one on the fender so if I lean over I

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.720 
one on the fender so if I lean over I
won't<00:00:52.469> go<00:00:52.649> ahead<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.890> damage<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> vehicle

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
