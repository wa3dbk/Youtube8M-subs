coming<00:01:28.720> in<00:01:29.760> this<00:01:30.760> guy's<00:01:31.000> on<00:01:31.210> fire<00:01:31.440> there<00:01:32.440> we

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
coming in this guy's on fire there we

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.960 
coming in this guy's on fire there we
are<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.860> also<00:01:33.190> look<00:01:33.400> at<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.550> pattern<00:01:33.850> that's

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
are and also look at the pattern that's

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.540 
are and also look at the pattern that's
now<00:01:34.210> forming<00:01:34.690> on<00:01:34.810> his<00:01:35.230> balls<00:01:35.470> very<00:01:36.190> good<00:01:36.370> line

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
now forming on his balls very good line

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.580 
now forming on his balls very good line
very<00:01:36.880> good<00:01:37.000> length<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:37.450> all<00:01:37.600> three<00:01:37.840> balls

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.220 

and<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.940> fourth<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.450> final<00:01:44.600> ball<00:01:44.930> for<00:01:45.170> the

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
and the fourth and final ball for the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.910 
and the fourth and final ball for the
forehand<00:01:45.680> short<00:01:46.300> is<00:01:47.300> also<00:01:47.810> within<00:01:48.440> one<00:01:48.710> mat

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
forehand short is also within one mat

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.860 
forehand short is also within one mat
length<00:01:49.160> so<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:49.910> really<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.570> perfect

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
length so that really is the perfect

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.070 
length so that really is the perfect
score<00:01:51.370> three<00:01:52.370> ends<00:01:52.520> each<00:01:52.730> way<00:01:53.000> going<00:01:53.630> up<00:01:53.810> and

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
score three ends each way going up and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.710 
score three ends each way going up and
coming<00:01:54.200> back<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.280> we've<00:01:55.610> got<00:01:55.729> six<00:01:56.180> ends<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.570> the

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
coming back so we've got six ends of the

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.810 
coming back so we've got six ends of the
backhand<00:01:57.110> short<00:01:57.380> then<00:01:58.040> we<00:01:58.130> go<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.580> six

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
backhand short then we go to the six

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.850 
backhand short then we go to the six
ends<00:01:59.030> of<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.240> forehand<00:01:59.690> long<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.229> finally

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
ends of the forehand long and finally

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.500 
ends of the forehand long and finally
we're<00:02:01.100> going<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.280> finish<00:02:01.460> now<00:02:01.790> with<00:02:02.360> the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
we're going to finish now with the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:15.400 
we're going to finish now with the
backhand<00:02:02.930> long<00:02:03.380> length<00:02:13.690> as<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.900> ball<00:02:15.080> comes

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
backhand long length as the ball comes

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.710 
backhand long length as the ball comes
to<00:02:15.530> rest<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.890> outside<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.880> one<00:02:20.270> mat<00:02:20.450> length

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
to rest it's outside of one mat length

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.190 
to rest it's outside of one mat length
but<00:02:21.410> it's<00:02:21.709> easily<00:02:22.280> inside<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.330> mat<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:24.020> half

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
but it's easily inside a mat and a half

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.060 
but it's easily inside a mat and a half
so<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.650> scores<00:02:25.130> one<00:02:25.370> point<00:02:26.680> similarly<00:02:27.680> with

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
so that scores one point similarly with

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.520 
so that scores one point similarly with
the<00:02:28.190> second<00:02:28.550> Bowl<00:02:28.870> that's<00:02:29.870> within<00:02:30.230> am<00:02:30.410> at

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
the second Bowl that's within am at

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.770 
the second Bowl that's within am at
length<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:31.130> once<00:02:31.430> again<00:02:31.580> one<00:02:32.150> point<00:02:34.780> third

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
length so once again one point third

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.440 
length so once again one point third
ball<00:02:36.020> coming<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.100> backhand<00:02:37.459> long<00:02:37.790> this

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
ball coming in on the backhand long this

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.540 
ball coming in on the backhand long this
one's<00:02:38.690> gone<00:02:38.900> through<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.410> time<00:02:39.709> but<00:02:40.400> it's

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
one's gone through this time but it's

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.150 
one's gone through this time but it's
still<00:02:40.880> well<00:02:41.360> within<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.780> mat<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.170> half<00:02:42.410> so

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
still well within the mat and a half so

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:57.820 
still well within the mat and a half so
scores<00:02:43.550> one<00:02:44.150> point<00:02:56.080> this<00:02:57.080> one<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.470> right<00:02:57.680> on

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
scores one point this one is right on

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.810 
scores one point this one is right on
the<00:02:57.920> jack<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:58.580> this<00:02:58.790> completes<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.360> exercise
