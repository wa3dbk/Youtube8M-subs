00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and basically she just saying that they

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700 
and basically she just saying that they
make<00:01:44.969> they<00:01:45.210> remaking<00:01:45.719> them<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.439> same

authentic<00:01:47.700> material<00:01:49.340> but<00:01:50.359> there's<00:01:51.359> still

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
authentic material but there's still

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.370 
authentic material but there's still
like<00:01:52.289> perfect<00:01:52.859> addition<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.369> guess<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.359> I<00:01:54.810> came

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
like perfect addition I guess so I came

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.969 
like perfect addition I guess so I came
to<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.829> conclusion<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:57.499> mostly<00:01:58.499> probably

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
to the conclusion that mostly probably

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.190 
to the conclusion that mostly probably
all<00:01:59.219> our<00:01:59.490> authentic<00:02:02.119> Jordans<00:02:03.119> are<00:02:03.689> probably

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
all our authentic Jordans are probably

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.889 
all our authentic Jordans are probably
just<00:02:04.380> remade<00:02:04.829> because<00:02:05.700> these<00:02:06.030> because<00:02:06.570> first

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
just remade because these because first

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.630 
just remade because these because first
