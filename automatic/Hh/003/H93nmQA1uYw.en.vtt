00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
bearings they come with ABEC nines but I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.770 
bearings they come with ABEC nines but I
personally<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.370> had<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> spare<00:00:45.149> set<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> Reds

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
personally just had a spare set of Reds

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.450 
personally just had a spare set of Reds
laying<00:00:46.079> around<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> replaced<00:00:47.190> them<00:00:47.399> with

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
laying around so I replaced them with

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.690 
laying around so I replaced them with
the<00:00:48.260> Reds<00:00:49.260> bearings<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.430> really

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the Reds bearings that I just really

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.180 
the Reds bearings that I just really
liked<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.000> my<00:00:51.120> skateboard<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.559> think<00:00:53.010> they

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
liked on my skateboard so I think they

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.090 
liked on my skateboard so I think they
spin<00:00:53.789> really<00:00:54.390> well<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> ABEC<00:00:55.649> 9s

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
spin really well with just the ABEC 9s

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.650 
spin really well with just the ABEC 9s
and<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.340> was<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:56.910> surprised<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.420> they

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and I was really surprised that they

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.200 
and I was really surprised that they
came<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.079> those<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> huge<00:00:59.850> plus

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
came with those so that is a huge plus

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.880 
came with those so that is a huge plus
besides<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> take<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> look<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
besides that if you take a look at the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.340 
besides that if you take a look at the
wheel<00:01:02.129> because<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.120> clear<00:01:03.480> wheel<00:01:03.780> that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
wheel because it is a clear wheel that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.740 
wheel because it is a clear wheel that
has<00:01:04.409> four<00:01:04.949> LED<00:01:05.400> lights<00:01:05.640> inside<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.299> does<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.450 
has four LED lights inside it does get a
little<00:01:06.900> dirty<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:08.040> doesn't<00:01:08.310> really

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
little dirty but that doesn't really

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.609 
little dirty but that doesn't really
matter<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.790> much<00:01:09.090> because<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
them so much and I highly highly

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.940 
them so much and I highly highly
recommend<00:01:35.250> these<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.450> anyways<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
recommend these but anyways and so the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.190 
recommend these but anyways and so the
wheels<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.880> run<00:01:39.119> off<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.420> batteries<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
wheels do not run off of batteries you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.600 
wheels do not run off of batteries you
don't<00:01:40.439> need<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.680> charge<00:01:40.979> them<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.220> don't<00:01:41.400> need

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
don't need to charge them you don't need

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.069 
don't need to charge them you don't need
to<00:01:41.729> replace<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.299> batteries<00:01:42.659> because<00:01:42.869> there

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
to replace the batteries because there

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.319 
to replace the batteries because there
are<00:01:43.320> none<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.310> LED<00:01:44.759> lights<00:01:45.090> actually

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
are none so the for LED lights actually

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.990 
are none so the for LED lights actually
work<00:01:45.869> off<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.380> kinetic<00:01:46.799> friction<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.670> when<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
work off of kinetic friction so when the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.850 
work off of kinetic friction so when the
wheels<00:01:48.180> are<00:01:48.329> turning<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.750> you're<00:01:49.409> standing

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
wheels are turning and you're standing

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.440 
wheels are turning and you're standing
on<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> board<00:01:50.280> putting<00:01:50.640> pressure<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
on the board putting pressure on the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.420 
on the board putting pressure on the
board<00:01:51.689> which<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.320> turn<00:01:52.530> puts<00:01:52.770> pressure<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
board which in turn puts pressure on the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.399 
board which in turn puts pressure on the
wheels<00:01:53.640> then<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.329> wheels<00:01:54.479> light<00:01:54.810> up<00:01:54.960> so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
wheels then the wheels light up so

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.649 
wheels then the wheels light up so
you'll<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.710> as<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> carve<00:01:56.399> or<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.090> turn<00:01:57.390> or

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
you'll see as I carve or as I turn or

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.090 
you'll see as I carve or as I turn or
lean<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> little<00:01:58.229> bit<00:01:58.380> some<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> wheels<00:01:58.890> of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
lean a little bit some of the wheels of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.620 
lean a little bit some of the wheels of
turn<00:01:59.310> off<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.090> again

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
turn off and on again

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.630 
turn off and on again
and<00:02:01.110> that's<00:02:01.259> because<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:01.770> kind<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.159> taking<00:02:02.579> a

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and that's because I'm kind of taking a

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.280 
and that's because I'm kind of taking a
little<00:02:02.759> pressure<00:02:03.090> off<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> wheels<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
little pressure off of the wheels and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.399 
little pressure off of the wheels and
that<00:02:05.009> way<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.460> kind<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.790> turn<00:02:05.969> off<00:02:06.290> so<00:02:07.290> I'm

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
that way they kind of turn off so I'm

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.990 
that way they kind of turn off so I'm
just<00:02:07.439> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.770> give<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.979> another<00:02:08.190> angle<00:02:08.729> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
just going to give you another angle of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.119 
just going to give you another angle of
the<00:02:09.060> wheels<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.050> dark<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.920> see

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
the wheels in the dark so you can see

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.860 
the wheels in the dark so you can see
what<00:02:11.280> they<00:02:11.400> look<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.360> besides<00:02:12.720> that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
what they look like but besides that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.650 
what they look like but besides that
onyx

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
onyx

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.500 
onyx
I kind<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.350> wish<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.880> wheels<00:02:16.060> did<00:02:16.360> not

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
I kind of wish that the wheels did not

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.000 
I kind of wish that the wheels did not
turn<00:02:16.750> off<00:02:16.870> when<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.140> leaned<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.470> certain<00:02:17.770> way

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
turn off when you leaned a certain way

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.300 
turn off when you leaned a certain way
and<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.340> wish<00:02:18.490> they<00:02:18.700> just<00:02:18.940> all<00:02:19.120> stayed<00:02:19.510> on

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and I wish they just all stayed on

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.250 
and I wish they just all stayed on
continuously<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:21.700> what<00:02:22.330> can<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.510> say<00:02:22.810> what

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
continuously but what can you say what

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.080 
continuously but what can you say what
can<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.500> do<00:02:23.650> really<00:02:24.070> like<00:02:24.280> they<00:02:24.670> don't<00:02:24.880> run<00:02:25.060> on

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
can you do really like they don't run on

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.390 
can you do really like they don't run on
battery<00:02:25.570> they<00:02:25.990> run<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.620> kinetic<00:02:27.070> friction

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
battery they run on kinetic friction

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.940 
battery they run on kinetic friction
which<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.730> super<00:02:28.000> awesome<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:29.020> love<00:02:29.770> these

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
which is super awesome and I love these

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.010 
which is super awesome and I love these
wheels<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.520> highly<00:02:30.880> recommend<00:02:31.300> them<00:02:31.390> alright
