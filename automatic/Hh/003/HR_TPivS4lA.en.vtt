00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.259
 Hello everyone, Ivan Savchuk 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.140
 Today we will learn to do Vains gay 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.720
 immediately advise those who are going to teach 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.970
 some weasel to begin with 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.160
 learn to pull up strengthen your 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:32.390
 hands so you can free yourself 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:34.730
 feel on the bar for what is it to us 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.040
 it is necessary that you have a good magician 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.020
 for you to gain altitude because if 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.480
 just time to roll a little blow bal 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.090
 donskov herring nothing you get 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.880
 you need to make good bread as well 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.780
 while letting go of your hands behind you like a bucket 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.630
 heat energy do 1 tears and ask 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.470
 yourself up here when you drop your legs 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.270
 hands and twist money why do they need it 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.670
 if we do n't do the tail time and here 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.950
 here is this energy here 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.320
 pick up then we get what we 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.140
 letting yourself down under your feet will be here 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.180
 do somersaults down we need to 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.100
 fortresses as much as possible find ask 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.100
 yourself up did you fly 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.229
 notes that in any case 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.960
 when the legs are already gone for the horizontal bar, we do not 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.390
 bend arms do not pull the bar and 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.640
 never throw back your head always 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.369
 I advise you to hold your head either 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.650
 breasts either look ahead and so she 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.850
 was even why because when you 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.680
 throw your head 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.290
 you try to see as soon as possible 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.380
 earth so you can twist yourself on 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.729
 double sites i.e. 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.400
 navigate you get worse a 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.160
 when the head is either straight or on it 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.340
 on the chest when you scroll one 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.340
 double flips you immediately see the disclosure 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.650
 where you land therefore advise though 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.840
 would be exactly desirable to hold a little 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.360
 on the chest head if you learned to do 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.760
 good one somersaults with horizontal bar advise 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.640
 you go to double because it's easier 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.800
 perfume doesn't exist here just 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.260

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.260
 before good sheets while letting go 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.780
 hands hold your head slightly on your knees 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.670
 pull up in yourself and this is the easiest 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.910
 double flip and I will give it to you now 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.910

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.860

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.510
 the fact that you can go to 2 gainer 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.820
