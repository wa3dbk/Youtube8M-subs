00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.740

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:31.129 
version of the game with pocket that was

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.489 
version of the game with pocket that was
released<00:06:31.369> only<00:06:31.520> in<00:06:31.699> Japan<00:06:32.029> only<00:06:32.479> about<00:06:32.809> 12,000

00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:33.499 
released only in Japan only about 12,000

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:39.040 
released only in Japan only about 12,000
were<00:06:33.559> made<00:06:33.770> I<00:06:33.949> to<00:06:34.819> my<00:06:34.969> knowledge<00:06:35.210> and<00:06:38.050> the

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
were made I to my knowledge and the

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.159 
were made I to my knowledge and the
biggest<00:06:39.379> difference<00:06:39.710> you<00:06:39.800> can<00:06:39.949> see<00:06:40.159> and<00:06:40.399> feel

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
biggest difference you can see and feel

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:45.070 
biggest difference you can see and feel
is<00:06:42.169> the<00:06:42.469> fact<00:06:42.710> that<00:06:42.830> as<00:06:43.479> I<00:06:44.479> mentioned<00:06:44.809> earlier

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
is the fact that as I mentioned earlier

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.299 
is the fact that as I mentioned earlier
the<00:06:45.199> game<00:06:45.319> the<00:06:45.469> color<00:06:45.649> uses<00:06:45.979> double-a

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:46.309 
the game the color uses double-a

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:48.459 
the game the color uses double-a
batteries<00:06:46.699> and<00:06:46.909> so<00:06:47.300> you<00:06:47.360> have<00:06:47.599> a<00:06:47.629> much<00:06:48.169> slimmer

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:48.469 
batteries and so you have a much slimmer

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:49.899 
batteries and so you have a much slimmer
profile<00:06:48.919> in<00:06:49.039> the<00:06:49.099> game<00:06:49.219> with<00:06:49.370> pocket<00:06:49.729> than<00:06:49.849> you

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:49.909 
profile in the game with pocket than you

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.129 
profile in the game with pocket than you
do<00:06:49.999> on<00:06:50.029> the<00:06:50.210> color<00:06:50.389> which<00:06:51.259> for<00:06:52.189> some<00:06:52.370> people
