00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
although he does worry about burnout

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.100 
although he does worry about burnout
he's<00:01:56.280> trying<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.759> find<00:01:56.969> balance<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.659> think

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
he's trying to find balance I think

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.270

I<00:01:59.310> think<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.030> very<00:02:00.210> intensive<00:02:00.780> program

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
I think it's a very intensive program

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.770 
I think it's a very intensive program
