it<00:02:34.310> first<00:02:35.310> let<00:02:35.580> me<00:02:35.610> preface<00:02:35.940> by<00:02:36.120> saying<00:02:36.299> Oberoi

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
it first let me preface by saying Oberoi

it first let me preface by saying Oberoi
percussion<00:02:37.709> makes<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.299> guess<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.659> called

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
percussion makes the I guess it's called

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.130 
percussion makes the I guess it's called
invader<00:02:40.409> and<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:41.549> is<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.849> best<00:02:42.140> probably

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
invader and it is the best probably

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.490 
invader and it is the best probably
practice<00:02:43.860> pad<00:02:44.129> money<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.970> buy<00:02:45.230> because<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
practice pad money can buy because the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.670 
practice pad money can buy because the
invader<00:02:46.890> has

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
invader has

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.949

quieter

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.820 

now<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:33.150> invader<00:03:33.480> sounds<00:03:33.959> great<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.440> has<00:03:34.650> its

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
now the invader sounds great it has its

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.160 
now the invader sounds great it has its
own<00:03:35.099> sound<00:03:35.489> this<00:03:36.000> has<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.420> same<00:03:36.629> dark<00:03:36.930> matter

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
own sound this has the same dark matter

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.080 
own sound this has the same dark matter
but<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.560> doesn't<00:03:38.069> sound<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.700> invader

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
but it doesn't sound like the invader

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.600 
but it doesn't sound like the invader
because<00:03:39.629> the<00:03:39.780> invader<00:03:40.110> has<00:03:40.409> a<00:03:40.769> very<00:03:41.159> thick

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
because the invader has a very thick

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.539 
because the invader has a very thick
layer<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.080> dark<00:03:43.319> matter<00:03:43.590> this<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.190> very

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
layer of the dark matter this is very

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.809 
layer of the dark matter this is very
thin<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.150> sounds<00:03:45.569> different<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:46.580> don't<00:03:47.580> have

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
thin that sounds different I don't have

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.059 
thin that sounds different I don't have
an<00:03:48.000> invader<00:03:48.360> but<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.750> saw<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.140> video<00:03:49.590> someone

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
hit one of these couple times and hit

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.229 
hit one of these couple times and hit
there<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.080> fader<00:03:52.500> totally<00:03:53.459> different<00:03:53.849> sounds

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239

I<00:03:54.330> can<00:03:54.569> hear<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.930> wood<00:03:56.239> under<00:03:57.239> this<00:03:57.750> dark

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
I can hear the wood under this dark

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.080 
I can hear the wood under this dark
matter<00:03:58.379> I<00:03:58.709> really<00:03:59.370> wished<00:03:59.640> they<00:03:59.879> would<00:03:59.970> have

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
matter I really wished they would have

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.740 
matter I really wished they would have
put<00:04:00.329> a<00:04:00.360> thicker<00:04:00.920> layer<00:04:01.920> in<00:04:02.519> this<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.480> would<00:04:03.659> have

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
put a thicker layer in this I would have

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.550 
put a thicker layer in this I would have
personally<00:04:03.959> liked<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.560> lot

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.320 

now<00:04:07.830> if<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.069> want<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.280> make<00:04:08.400> your<00:04:08.550> own<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:09.090> went

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
now if you want to make your own I went

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.270 
now if you want to make your own I went
ahead<00:04:09.390> measured<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.080> I<00:04:10.290> believe<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.650> was<00:04:10.740> 15

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
ahead measured this I believe it was 15

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.630 
ahead measured this I believe it was 15
centimeters<00:04:12.000> by<00:04:12.380> 34<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:14.100> about<00:04:14.340> two

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
centimeters by 34 and about two

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.430 
centimeters by 34 and about two
centimeters<00:04:15.270> thick<00:04:15.569> you<00:04:15.900> could<00:04:16.019> just<00:04:16.200> take<00:04:16.380> a

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
centimeters thick you could just take a

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.270 
centimeters thick you could just take a

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.970 
mousepad piece on a on a piece of wood
and<00:04:52.090> there<00:04:52.840> you've<00:04:53.050> got<00:04:53.080> your<00:04:53.260> practice<00:04:53.740> pad

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
and there you've got your practice pad

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.930 
and there you've got your practice pad
it<00:04:54.160> it<00:04:54.250> works<00:04:54.460> great<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:55.000> neoprene<00:04:55.420> actually

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940
