00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

I<00:00:00.149> hope<00:00:00.450> it's<00:00:00.659> the<00:00:00.719> way<00:00:00.900> that<00:00:01.170> it<00:00:01.469> always<00:00:01.650> feels

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
I hope it's the way that it always feels

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.649 
I hope it's the way that it always feels
like<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.310> Batmobile<00:00:02.550> should<00:00:02.939> have<00:00:03.030> been<00:00:03.179> you

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
like the Batmobile should have been you

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.269 
like the Batmobile should have been you
know<00:00:03.750> that<00:00:03.929> it<00:00:04.259> doesn't<00:00:04.470> feel<00:00:04.710> like<00:00:04.770> something

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
know that it doesn't feel like something

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.710 
know that it doesn't feel like something
that's<00:00:05.430> been<00:00:05.670> kind<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.060> bolted<00:00:06.359> on<00:00:06.540> it's

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
that's been kind of bolted on it's

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.240 
that's been kind of bolted on it's
something<00:00:06.990> that's<00:00:07.170> very<00:00:07.319> much<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.620> natural

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
something that's very much a natural

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.560 
something that's very much a natural
progression<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.880> everything<00:00:09.269> that's<00:00:09.450> there

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
progression of everything that's there

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.570 
progression of everything that's there
we've<00:00:10.080> known<00:00:10.260> it's<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:10.650> people<00:00:11.010> want<00:00:11.190> you

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
we've known it's what people want you

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.700 
we've known it's what people want you
know<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.420> do<00:00:12.540> listen<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.200> but<00:00:13.530> we

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
know like we do listen to that but we

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.350 
know like we do listen to that but we
don't<00:00:13.950> want<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.670> know<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:14.910> new<00:00:15.059> black

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
don't want to you know we new black

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.700 
don't want to you know we new black
people<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.660> mention<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.020> before<00:00:16.230> city<00:00:16.440> came

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
people that mention it before city came

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.349 
people that mention it before city came
out<00:00:16.920> but<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.460> don't<00:00:17.609> want<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.789> do<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.210> way

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.060 
out but we don't want to do it in a way
that<00:00:18.390> wouldn't<00:00:18.869> satisfy<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.710> know<00:00:19.859> so

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
that wouldn't satisfy that you know so

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.349 
that wouldn't satisfy that you know so
it<00:00:20.160> was<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.279> you're<00:00:20.760> going<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.210> wait

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
it was like you're going to have to wait

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.689 
it was like you're going to have to wait
we<00:00:21.779> can<00:00:21.960> do<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.320> justice<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.800> know<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.670> was

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
we can do it justice you know so it was

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.279 
we can do it justice you know so it was
satisfying<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.900> still<00:00:25.140> that's

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
satisfying to know that still that's

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.929 
satisfying to know that still that's
what<00:00:25.380> people<00:00:25.650> wanted<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.430> people<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
number one feature request confidence is

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.450 
number one feature request confidence is
such<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> big<00:00:31.590> part<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> creative<00:00:32.340> process

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
such a big part of the creative process

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.580 
such a big part of the creative process
when<00:00:33.420> taking<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.050> something<00:00:34.350> like<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
when taking on something like the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.979 
when taking on something like the
Batmobile<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.579> need<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.510> think<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
Batmobile you need to be I think a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.319 
Batmobile you need to be I think a
confident<00:00:37.530> developer<00:00:38.280> because<00:00:38.520> when<00:00:39.210> you

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
confident developer because when you

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.000 
confident developer because when you
start<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:39.899> even<00:00:40.260> internally<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:40.860> had<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
start it and even internally we had a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.340 
start it and even internally we had a
lot<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.250> people<00:00:41.550> saying<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.059> know<00:00:42.230> like<00:00:43.230> I'm

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
lot of people saying you know like I'm

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.100 
lot of people saying you know like I'm
not<00:00:43.500> sure<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.340> because<00:00:44.780> it<00:00:45.780> means

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
not sure we can do this because it means

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.299 
not sure we can do this because it means
that<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> lot<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> things<00:00:46.920> we've<00:00:47.280> been

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
that a lot of the things we've been

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.220 
that a lot of the things we've been
doing<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> lot<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> way<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.480> work<00:00:48.750> has<00:00:49.079> got

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
doing a lot of the way we work has got

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.049 
doing a lot of the way we work has got
to<00:00:49.320> change<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.890> bring<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.190> vehicle<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
to change to bring a vehicle in and the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.520 
to change to bring a vehicle in and the
way<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.360> vehicles<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:51.930> or<00:00:51.989> interact<00:00:52.350> with

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
way this vehicles got or interact with

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.439 
way this vehicles got or interact with
everything<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.340> very<00:00:53.430> physics<00:00:53.940> driven<00:00:54.270> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
everything it's very physics driven I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.090 
everything it's very physics driven I
think<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.050> confidence<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.920> those

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
think it's that confidence of those

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.220 
think it's that confidence of those
reviews<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.180> feedback<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.960> allows

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
reviews and that feedback that allows

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.740 
reviews and that feedback that allows
you<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.910> team<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.570> push

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you to and the team to really push

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.420 
you to and the team to really push
forward<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.289> try<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.649> something<00:01:01.680> new<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
forward and try and do something new and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.860 
forward and try and do something new and
when<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.609> experiment<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.180> bit<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.539> fouls

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
when you experiment a bit and it fouls

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.780 
when you experiment a bit and it fouls
people<00:01:04.470> still<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.040> belief<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.400> keep

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
people still have that belief to keep

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789 
people still have that belief to keep
trying<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.590> lack<00:01:07.770> that

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
trying I think if you lack that

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
trying I think if you lack that
confidence<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.610> give<00:01:08.909> up<00:01:09.030> early<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
confidence you can give up early and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.670 
confidence you can give up early and
then<00:01:09.689> think<00:01:09.900> well<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.080> won't<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.409> there

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
then think well we won't go there

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.289 
then think well we won't go there
let's<00:01:11.070> why<00:01:11.520> don't<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.790> what<00:01:11.880> other<00:01:12.030> games

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
let's why don't we do what other games

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
let's why don't we do what other games
are<00:01:12.510> doing<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:12.990> why<00:01:13.200> don't<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.460> like

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
are doing you know why don't we like

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.800 
are doing you know why don't we like
that<00:01:14.610> system<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.210> game<00:01:15.360> why<00:01:15.540> don't<00:01:15.720> we

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that system in that game why don't we

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.050 
that system in that game why don't we
use<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:17.700> looked<00:01:17.880> at<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
use that and when we looked at the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.270 
use that and when we looked at the
Batmobile<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.720> sort<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.680> didn't<00:01:19.920> think

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
Batmobile we sort of we didn't think

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.830

able<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.660> kind<00:02:44.870> of<00:02:44.900> burn<00:02:45.110> around<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.560> sea<00:02:45.769> a

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
able to kind of burn around the sea a

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.039 
able to kind of burn around the sea a
jet<00:02:46.430> out<00:02:46.640> straight<00:02:47.030> into<00:02:47.269> a<00:02:47.299> glide<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:47.840> pull

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
jet out straight into a glide and pull

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.780 
jet out straight into a glide and pull
up<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.470> start<00:02:48.680> gliding<00:02:48.860> across<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.430> Gulf<00:02:49.610> and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
up and start gliding across the Gulf and

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.300 
up and start gliding across the Gulf and
rooftops<00:02:50.269> just<00:02:51.200> really<00:02:51.470> makes<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.860> feel<00:02:51.890> like

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
rooftops just really makes you feel like

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.680 
rooftops just really makes you feel like
Batman<00:02:52.519> you<00:02:52.849> know<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.060> feels<00:02:53.299> like<00:02:53.420> something

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
Batman you know it feels like something

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.240 
Batman you know it feels like something
he<00:02:53.780> would<00:02:53.989> do<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.440> Batmobile<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:54.950> that

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
he would do in the Batmobile and that

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.280 
he would do in the Batmobile and that
the<00:02:55.849> way<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.209> Batman<00:02:56.569> and<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.959> battle<00:02:57.200> bit

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
the way the Batman and the battle bit

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.740 
the way the Batman and the battle bit
will<00:02:57.410> combine<00:02:58.150> rather<00:02:59.150> than<00:02:59.390> either<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.690> the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
will combine rather than either of the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.750 
will combine rather than either of the
two<00:02:59.840> things<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.380> isolation<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.220> think<00:03:01.489> the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
two things in isolation is I think the

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.449 
two things in isolation is I think the
thing<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.060> I'm<00:03:02.360> really<00:03:02.900> happy<00:03:03.140> with<00:03:03.530> because

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
thing that I'm really happy with because

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.890 
thing that I'm really happy with because
I<00:03:04.519> think<00:03:04.579> it's<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:04.970> combination<00:03:05.269> which<00:03:05.870> is

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
I think it's that combination which is

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.630 
I think it's that combination which is
unique<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.530> two<00:03:06.680> things<00:03:06.890> kind<00:03:07.129> of<00:03:07.220> sparking

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
unique the two things kind of sparking

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.699 
unique the two things kind of sparking
off<00:03:07.730> each<00:03:07.879> other<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:08.599> where<00:03:09.079> most<00:03:09.230> ideas

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
off each other it's where most ideas

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.620 
off each other it's where most ideas
come<00:03:09.890> from<00:03:09.920> really<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.549> just<00:03:10.790> thinking<00:03:11.269> that's

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
come from really is just thinking that's

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.240 
come from really is just thinking that's
what<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.780> want<00:03:12.109> to<00:03:12.200> do<00:03:12.350> when<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.650> play<00:03:12.889> you<00:03:12.950> know

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
new gadgets so there's we've refreshed

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.759 
new gadgets so there's we've refreshed
all<00:03:34.459> those<00:03:34.670> areas<00:03:35.150> as<00:03:35.389> well<00:03:35.450> as<00:03:36.260> adding<00:03:36.680> this

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
all those areas as well as adding this

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.740 
all those areas as well as adding this
vehicle<00:03:37.250> which<00:03:37.370> also<00:03:37.819> introduces<00:03:38.569> new

vehicle which also introduces new

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.629 
vehicle which also introduces new
elements<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:39.200> those<00:03:39.440> areas<00:03:39.650> as<00:03:40.069> well<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.609> I

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
elements to those areas as well so I

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.400 
elements to those areas as well so I
think<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:41.209> experience<00:03:41.660> as<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.810> whole<00:03:41.900> does

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
think the experience as a whole does

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.620 
think the experience as a whole does
feel<00:03:42.620> very<00:03:42.859> very<00:03:43.489> fresh<00:03:43.819> and<00:03:44.030> new<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.480> I<00:03:44.540> hope

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
feel very very fresh and new and I hope

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.970 
feel very very fresh and new and I hope
that's<00:03:44.900> what<00:03:45.019> we're<00:03:45.170> always<00:03:45.260> trying<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.650> do<00:03:45.829> is

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
that's what we're always trying to do is

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.339 
that's what we're always trying to do is
that<00:03:46.160> every<00:03:46.430> game<00:03:46.599> feels<00:03:47.599> like<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> new<00:03:48.139> game

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
that every game feels like a new game

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.099 
that every game feels like a new game
rather<00:03:48.739> than<00:03:48.950> another<00:03:49.690> episode<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:51.049> a

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
rather than another episode of a

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.839 
rather than another episode of a
previous<00:03:51.500> game<00:03:51.709> it<00:03:51.889> feels<00:03:52.190> like<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.430> whole<00:03:52.700> new

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
previous game it feels like a whole new

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.580 
previous game it feels like a whole new
experience<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.599> mean<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.840> think<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.109> controls

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
experience I mean I think the controls

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.110 
experience I mean I think the controls
themselves<00:03:54.889> are<00:03:55.280> pretty<00:03:55.430> tight<00:03:55.669> I<00:03:55.700> think

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
themselves are pretty tight I think

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.089 
themselves are pretty tight I think
adding<00:03:56.720> more<00:03:56.989> things<00:03:57.349> you<00:03:57.530> can<00:03:57.709> do<00:03:57.919> is

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
adding more things you can do is

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.349 
adding more things you can do is
something<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:58.459> we're<00:03:58.549> always<00:03:58.700> looking<00:03:58.880> at

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
something that we're always looking at

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.559 
something that we're always looking at
and<00:03:59.630> it<00:03:59.959> is<00:04:00.139> difficult<00:04:00.590> in<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:00.859> sense<00:04:01.040> that

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
and it is difficult in the sense that

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.970 
and it is difficult in the sense that
you<00:04:02.569> know<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.810> combat<00:04:03.169> system<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.680> predator

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
you know the combat system the predator

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.400 
you know the combat system the predator
system<00:04:04.400> are<00:04:04.579> fairly<00:04:05.480> well<00:04:05.660> refined<00:04:06.079> and

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
system are fairly well refined and

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.020 
system are fairly well refined and
they've<00:04:06.500> all<00:04:06.590> been<00:04:06.620> very<00:04:06.980> well<00:04:07.190> reviewed<00:04:07.400> and

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
they've all been very well reviewed and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.729 
they've all been very well reviewed and
you<00:04:08.120> don't<00:04:08.329> want<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:08.540> change<00:04:08.780> that<00:04:08.959> because

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
you don't want to change that because

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.349 
you don't want to change that because
people<00:04:10.069> are<00:04:10.310> used<00:04:10.519> to<00:04:10.609> that<00:04:10.849> but<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.120> want<00:04:11.299> to

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
people are used to that but you want to

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.210 
people are used to that but you want to
add<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.690> that<00:04:11.720> system<00:04:12.260> so<00:04:12.590> we've<00:04:12.739> worked<00:04:12.919> on

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
add to that system so we've worked on

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.310 
add to that system so we've worked on
adding<00:04:13.639> to<00:04:13.880> those<00:04:14.329> but<00:04:14.600> without<00:04:14.810> making<00:04:15.019> them

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
adding to those but without making them

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.620 
adding to those but without making them
more<00:04:15.410> complicated<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:16.400> players<00:04:16.759> can<00:04:17.150> come<00:04:17.509> in

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
more complicated so players can come in

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
kind of base experience so that's why we

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.910 
kind of base experience so that's why we
have<00:04:37.550> kind<00:04:37.760> of<00:04:37.790> charging<00:04:38.270> enemies<00:04:38.800> being<00:04:39.800> able
