this<00:03:09.250> crafting<00:03:09.670> square<00:03:10.000> cuz<00:03:10.510> i'm<00:03:10.600> pretty<00:03:10.810> sure

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
will work with any item so we have our

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.610 
will work with any item so we have our
torches<00:04:00.910> here<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:01.510> I<00:04:01.540> threw<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.050> down<00:04:02.350> that

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
torches here so I threw that down that

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.410 
torches here so I threw that down that
it<00:04:02.800> does<00:04:02.980> work<00:04:03.190> with<00:04:03.340> torches<00:04:03.580> so<00:04:03.880> anything

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
it does work with torches so anything

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.690 
it does work with torches so anything
that<00:04:04.450> you<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:04.959> put<00:04:05.140> in<00:04:05.260> there<00:04:05.500> if<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.519> does

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
that you just put in there if it does

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.330 
that you just put in there if it does
crap<00:04:07.209> so<00:04:07.780> knowing<00:04:08.530> that<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:10.030> could<00:04:10.630> make

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
crap so knowing that you could make

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.440 
crap so knowing that you could make
trying<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.400> think<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:12.700> can<00:04:12.820> make<00:04:13.030> infinite<00:04:13.420> um

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
trying to think you can make infinite um

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.870 
trying to think you can make infinite um
infinite<00:04:16.450> Pistons<00:04:17.070> infinite<00:04:18.070> just<00:04:18.640> anything

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
infinite Pistons infinite just anything

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.060 
infinite Pistons infinite just anything
that<00:04:19.090> crafts<00:04:19.540> really<00:04:20.019> well<00:04:20.560> not<00:04:20.680> Pistons

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
that crafts really well not Pistons

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.930 
that crafts really well not Pistons
because<00:04:21.220> they'll<00:04:21.489> have<00:04:21.640> to<00:04:21.669> be<00:04:21.820> in<00:04:21.910> that

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
because they'll have to be in that

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.190 
because they'll have to be in that
square<00:04:22.240> mushroom<00:04:23.020> stew<00:04:23.380> any<00:04:24.130> kind<00:04:24.370> of<00:04:24.490> wood

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
square mushroom stew any kind of wood

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.670 
square mushroom stew any kind of wood
any<00:04:26.200> kind<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.500> food<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.130> know

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
any kind of food I know

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.439 
any kind of food I know
wouldn't<00:04:27.949> work<00:04:28.100> I'm<00:04:28.910> just<00:04:29.060> trying<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.330> think

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
wouldn't work I'm just trying to think

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.850 
wouldn't work I'm just trying to think
if<00:04:32.449> you<00:04:32.570> wanted<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.870> make<00:04:32.990> colored<00:04:33.380> wool<00:04:33.650> you

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
if you wanted to make colored wool you

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.680 
if you wanted to make colored wool you
could<00:04:34.070> do<00:04:34.220> that<00:04:36.250> because<00:04:37.250> i'm<00:04:37.550> pretty<00:04:38.000> sure<00:04:38.449> i

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
could do that because i'm pretty sure i

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.790 
could do that because i'm pretty sure i
need<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.930> find<00:04:39.080> i<00:04:39.259> would<00:04:39.380> need<00:04:39.500> to<00:04:39.560> get<00:04:39.650> some

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
need to find i would need to get some

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.249 
need to find i would need to get some
died<00:04:40.270> but<00:04:41.270> i'm<00:04:41.300> pretty<00:04:41.479> sure<00:04:41.600> if<00:04:41.840> we<00:04:41.900> get<00:04:42.110> this

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
died but i'm pretty sure if we get this

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.300 
died but i'm pretty sure if we get this
wool<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:43.039> that's<00:04:43.639> how<00:04:43.880> we<00:04:43.910> would<00:04:44.330> make<00:04:44.570> it<00:04:44.750> so

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
wool that that's how we would make it so

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.760 
wool that that's how we would make it so
take<00:04:46.310> that<00:04:46.389> I<00:04:47.389> don't<00:04:47.720> have<00:04:47.840> any<00:04:47.990> all<00:04:48.320> I<00:04:48.380> can<00:04:48.620> use

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
take that I don't have any all I can use

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.689 
take that I don't have any all I can use
a<00:04:48.800> dandelion<00:04:49.220> yellow<00:04:49.639> there<00:04:51.130> so<00:04:52.130> basically

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
a dandelion yellow there so basically

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.640 
a dandelion yellow there so basically
anything<00:04:52.970> that<00:04:53.150> craps<00:04:53.630> is<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:53.900> graphical

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
anything that craps is a graphical

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.540 
anything that craps is a graphical
glitch<00:04:54.919> um<00:04:55.880> so<00:04:56.870> let's<00:04:57.350> take<00:04:57.500> this<00:04:57.830> put<00:04:58.250> this<00:04:58.370> up

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
glitch um so let's take this put this up

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.120 
glitch um so let's take this put this up
here<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:59.300> then<00:05:00.050> we'll<00:05:00.199> put<00:05:00.380> this<00:05:00.560> in<00:05:00.770> with

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
here and then we'll put this in with

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.850 
here and then we'll put this in with
that<00:05:01.750> throw<00:05:02.750> that<00:05:02.930> down<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:03.530> now<00:05:03.710> we<00:05:03.770> have

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
that throw that down and now we have

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.700 
that throw that down and now we have
yellow<00:05:04.250> wool<00:05:04.520> so<00:05:05.240> with<00:05:05.780> this<00:05:05.810> glitch<00:05:06.229> you<00:05:06.530> can

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
yellow wool so with this glitch you can

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.499 
yellow wool so with this glitch you can
pretty<00:05:06.919> much<00:05:07.009> just<00:05:07.490> about<00:05:07.729> get<00:05:07.970> anything<00:05:08.240> you
