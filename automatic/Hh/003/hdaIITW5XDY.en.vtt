00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 and hello again to you again i'm 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:11.730
 this will be a micro column review 21 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.960
 microlab and from 35 to such here 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.060
 wonderful name nothing 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.460
 unusual in principle there is not 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.850
 some kind of reasonable decision for my money 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.359
 It is very difficult to name, that is, I bought 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.990
 based on some of their own 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:34.620
 ideas about beautiful about beautiful 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.950
 here's a design very simple 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.410
 that is, well, that is from 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.079
 these columns mean the gutter themselves 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:52.050
 these are small squares 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.850
 diffuser with a small speaker that is 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.949
 to the edge as the sound of course it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.680
 especially not going but quite acceptable then 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:06.020
 eat at the household level play enough 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:11.479
 not bad at a height of about 15 elites 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:14.970
 9 10 centimeters is obtained somewhere like this 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.159
 It means a rigid fastening of the wire, that is 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.350
 in which case it will have to change 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:25.590
 completely disassemble means not very 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.600
 convenient and reason that is me 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.390
 exercises steady if the table doesn't stagger in 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.210
 principle okay not according to claims yes 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.700
 this is the black gloss about this 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.850
 forgot it was necessary to remove the white model 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.040
 such is white color 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.280
 but there was unfortunately I had to take 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.329
 black means but the subwoofer itself 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.329
 is such a pyramid 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.680
 speaker is located here, too, such 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.570
 pretty small as it is visited 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.000
 that is quite normal why are looking 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.729
 these particular columns took u take more 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 for this price but I have this place 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.649
 assigned to the sound itself and here 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.250
 It holds mostly only such 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.950
 little things 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.630
 that is, could take microlab solo take 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.590
 Other very interesting models 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.660
 I decided to be fine by design 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:25.800
 It means that we still have a connector 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.480
 that the subwoofer is very stable legs 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.350
 somewhere to drop it will be difficult though 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.150
 of course, you need to stand on the floor 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.510
 Now I will show you the connectors which 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.090
 there is on the back 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.390
 I'll start in order from me first thread 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.110
 by turning on then the power connector then 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.020
 connector remote then wire connecting 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.390
 computer speakers or other 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:03:00.400
 sources and two wires left right 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:02.820
 column such here it is our subwoofer 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.770
 fingers remain on it 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.860
 very cool i don't know how the camera 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:13.480
 It will capture all of this 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:17.370
 bold typos export axes 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.630
 the school premises will have to 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.590
 actually included was such 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.239
 wired pultik here it is in principle 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.040
 nothing interesting either 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.610
 It seems on the one hand he has 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.959
 3d buttons as it is well not to about 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:38.470
 than as a rule , you can connect here 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.900
 for example some kind of player mini jad 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.920
 minijack that is the column will be the address 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.900
 two sources 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.299
 this button to the laser set means and what 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.329
 our management means it when we 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.070
 it is lit in blue usually adjustment 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.620
 loudness 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.640
 that is, a lot of visual and clear 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.410
 backlight unlike so many 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.510
 speakers at night does not blind eyes that very 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.299
 great 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.610
 when you press the button once we can 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:15.150
 choose bass 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.549
 frequencies need to be pressed very quickly 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.200
 because for the sim she clicked in such 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.329
 position does not remain that is, through 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.050
 some time pretty fast socks 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:28.670
 Well, that is actually decoding by 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.670
 colors so now 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.729
 the wire is comfortable and relatively long then 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:44.389
 I had enough just in the morning on the deck 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:46.060
 arm minus some kind of whatcha for 2000 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.849
 of course I would like to have 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.770
 somewhere either here or on the remote 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.439
 still headphone out 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.099
 well, as my case thinks tolerant 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:05:02.960
 headphones including this one 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:04.999
 as if there are such nice speakers not 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.939
 especially justified choice for the money but 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:10.060
 nevertheless all thanks to all all 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.060
 good
