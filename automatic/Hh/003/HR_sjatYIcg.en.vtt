00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 But www is important to me it is indeed a showdown with 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.340
 800 electrical manufacturers right side unfortunately like this 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.980
 that the complaints from the fed had reported on Tuesday m so we did 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.839
 a serious match on the famous avenue 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:18.849
 by then couples next year 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.429
 the world that the united states cannois tend to clamecy brussels-capital 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.039
 in brussels in the heart this week items were seized but there 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.390
 it is thanks to this that the parquet floor has shaken the planet of its 35 dollar 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.380
 by the summer 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.570
 having managed to flee like this so he displays relieved here ok he 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.040
 must not be thrown 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.380
 for me he knows that there is too much negative mop the Nimes occupy 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.590
 the dates are apparently not money the blues ok that's it 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.850
 contempt en route battery performance they have enough 8 2 cm 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.490
 but benjamin standing fiercely three children billy too much marked 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.980
 the decline of the rising building on the nordschleife 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.700
 if ever m long has manhandled more for a few occasions when this 25 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.920
 march to a table and 6 me a year before 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.760
 to conclude you have unplugged let infuse the contest had too much 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:09.780
 need 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.100
 ok then for me but since the crisis cameron 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.180
 are supported by mona death the 28 folded text available from 28 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.710
 atheros price so it does not take in the course of three four years in the street 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.090
 by 5 5 to 11 years or a little more 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.090
 for his attitude has raised 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.700
 I bleed the strain as it should 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.180
 finally ask me 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.050
 and we put the fantastic number of homeless 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.130
 and to show how to apply it is doublettes formed open to all 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 quote them 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.210
 so if we can see that south africa has lost 29% 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.670
 gladbach site of the inpes 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.619
 so here we see that there is both mm the unfortunate same bag the mention of 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.520
 his team because even very bright 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.260
 now it's done 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.780
 the fight is at the baton 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.660
 and then if you have charge mayors 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.789
 if not this maximum load meziane belkacem which a week 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.089
 the terms of the exchanged the toxin 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.089
 we saw the clip here his dolphin seen from a stop breathless 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.049
 so to change a cleaver game 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.249
 it's very important was the key being the first installment 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:24.649
 yes the first races I'm going to sleep 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:28.159
 we give the key to the coach that I am it's good and it's simple 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.749
 we have in addition they will be accompanied 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.699
 note that their charge the hand is simply to plug the movie this is 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:36.259
 it 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.200
 and then our brain takes care of him 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.200
 it's a bit close at this point is to remember that the battery completely has 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.819
 said m 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.499
 and you're going to have a fifth act tintin autonomy 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.349
 according to apple intel 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.279
 why so much of this breakthrough 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.709
 a simple to marc mistreated as ungodly and toxin 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.189

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.459
 saint-germain-sur-avre storyteller here 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.459
 was it the qnap rubicon 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.069
 we saw worse 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.330
 if we are able to hurt ourselves this morning 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.479
 as for marc caisso in a boxing club 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.389
 it weighs about 60 countries and it was before 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.969
 for flash in the locker room 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.119
 20 20 for these outings to say it 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:21.229
