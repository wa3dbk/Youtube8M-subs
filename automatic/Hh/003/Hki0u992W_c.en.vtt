00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
so that was just a quick demo of the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.100 
so that was just a quick demo of the
pedal<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.820> as<00:01:19.060> more<00:01:19.360> wanting<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.930> show<00:01:20.080> you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
pedal and as more wanting to show you

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.990 
pedal and as more wanting to show you
what<00:01:20.380> what<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:20.980> eyes<00:01:21.100> do<00:01:21.370> on<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.580> front<00:01:21.850> of

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
what what the eyes do on the front of

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.400 
what what the eyes do on the front of
the<00:01:22.210> on<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.290> front<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.830> enclosure<00:01:24.640> and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
the on the front of the enclosure and

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.950 
the on the front of the enclosure and
it's<00:01:26.410> quite<00:01:26.710> easy<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:27.010> actually<00:01:27.340> do<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
it's quite easy to actually do that the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.880 
it's quite easy to actually do that the
the<00:01:29.290> glowing<00:01:30.010> eyes<00:01:30.750> actually<00:01:31.750> even<00:01:32.470> I'd<00:01:32.710> like

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
the glowing eyes actually even I'd like

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.490 
the glowing eyes actually even I'd like
to<00:01:33.040> take<00:01:33.250> credit<00:01:34.210> for<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.870> idea<00:01:35.320> I've

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
to take credit for that idea I've

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.780 
to take credit for that idea I've
actually<00:01:35.680> seen<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:35.980> done<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.250> couple<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.640> times

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
actually seen it done a couple of times

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.020 
actually seen it done a couple of times
on<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.150> forums<00:01:37.620> so<00:01:38.620> I<00:01:38.950> always<00:01:39.400> thought<00:01:39.700> I<00:01:39.790> was

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
on the forums so I always thought I was

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.370 
on the forums so I always thought I was
going<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.180> do<00:01:40.330> all<00:01:40.420> right<00:01:40.450> i'll<00:01:40.870> definitely

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
going to do all right i'll definitely

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.520 
going to do all right i'll definitely
want<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.530> do<00:01:41.650> those<00:01:41.800> eyes<00:01:42.690> this<00:01:43.690> is<00:01:43.840> actually

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
want to do those eyes this is actually

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.280 
want to do those eyes this is actually
for<00:01:44.650> a<00:01:44.680> friend<00:01:45.010> I'm<00:01:45.190> built<00:01:45.760> a<00:01:45.850> building<00:01:46.300> it<00:01:46.480> for

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
for a friend I'm built a building it for

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.340 
for a friend I'm built a building it for
a<00:01:47.320> friend<00:01:47.530> named<00:01:48.310> Dennis<00:01:49.150> so<00:01:49.930> that's<00:01:50.170> why<00:01:50.320> it's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
a friend named Dennis so that's why it's

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.480 
a friend named Dennis so that's why it's
called<00:01:50.620> the<00:01:50.740> dash<00:01:50.770> distortion<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.340> if<00:01:54.430> we

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
called the dash distortion and so if we

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.790 
called the dash distortion and so if we
just<00:01:54.700> open<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.150> up<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.530> i<00:01:56.560> went<00:01:57.100> with<00:01:57.220> 23<00:01:57.730> mil

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
just open it up so i went with 23 mil

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.670 
just open it up so i went with 23 mil
red<00:01:59.800> diffused<00:02:00.370> LEDs<00:02:01.360> because<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.990> five<00:02:02.320> mil

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
red diffused LEDs because the five mil

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.620 
red diffused LEDs because the five mil
are<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.070> bit<00:02:03.520> be<00:02:03.790> going<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.120> probably<00:02:04.390> look<00:02:04.600> a

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
are a bit be going to probably look a

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.780 
are a bit be going to probably look a
bit<00:02:04.780> stupid<00:02:05.050> on<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.410> front<00:02:05.650> of<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.800> um<00:02:06.010> it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
bit stupid on the front of the um it

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.830 
bit stupid on the front of the um it
kind<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.060> like<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.390> would<00:02:07.480> have<00:02:07.600> goggles

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
kind of like you would have goggles

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.350 
kind of like you would have goggles
goggles<00:02:08.470> on<00:02:08.800> because<00:02:09.070> um<00:02:09.310> yeah<00:02:09.640> they're<00:02:09.850> quite

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
goggles on because um yeah they're quite

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.780 
goggles on because um yeah they're quite
a<00:02:10.630> bit<00:02:10.899> bigger<00:02:11.110> than<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.350> three<00:02:11.710> mil<00:02:11.890> ones<00:02:12.100> so

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
a bit bigger than the three mil ones so

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.730 
a bit bigger than the three mil ones so
yeah<00:02:13.510> we're<00:02:13.690> for<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.930> 30<00:02:14.140> ones<00:02:14.440> for<00:02:14.590> that

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
yeah we're for the 30 ones for that

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.370 
yeah we're for the 30 ones for that
reason<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:16.630> did<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.840> quick<00:02:17.020> look<00:02:17.290> around

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
reason I just did a quick look around

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.010 
reason I just did a quick look around
and<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.190> forward<00:02:18.580> voltage<00:02:18.970> on<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.570> three

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
and the forward voltage on the three

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.890 
and the forward voltage on the three
mils<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.440> same<00:02:20.650> as<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> five<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:21.810> should<00:02:22.810> the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
mils the same as the five so should the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.160 
mils the same as the five so should the
main<00:02:23.050> difference<00:02:24.090> as<00:02:25.090> far<00:02:25.209> as<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.630> sound<00:02:25.900> goes

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
main difference as far as the sound goes

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.850 
main difference as far as the sound goes
so<00:02:27.040> if<00:02:27.880> you're<00:02:28.090> going<00:02:28.390> off<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.720> board<00:02:28.989> you've

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
so if you're going off the board you've

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.280 
so if you're going off the board you've
got<00:02:30.100> you've<00:02:30.940> got<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.300> red<00:02:31.450> LEDs<00:02:31.900> up<00:02:32.080> there

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
got you've got the red LEDs up there

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.560 
got you've got the red LEDs up there
I've<00:02:32.440> just<00:02:32.650> ran<00:02:32.890> some<00:02:33.130> wires<00:02:33.370> down<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.060> then

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
I've just ran some wires down and then

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.660 
I've just ran some wires down and then
you<00:02:34.720> can<00:02:34.870> see<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:36.010> might<00:02:36.190> be<00:02:36.310> able<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.489> see

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
you can see you might be able to see

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.440 
you can see you might be able to see
down<00:02:37.480> here<00:02:38.310> there's<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.850> that's<00:02:40.209> where<00:02:40.360> the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
down here there's that that's where the

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.060 
down here there's that that's where the
eyes<00:02:40.570> are<00:02:40.600> just<00:02:41.110> write<00:02:41.350> them<00:02:41.440> down<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.920> where

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
eyes are just write them down to where

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.260 
eyes are just write them down to where
the<00:02:42.190> young<00:02:42.340> eyes<00:02:42.640> are<00:02:42.850> on<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.000> front<00:02:43.209> and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
the young eyes are on the front and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.030 
the young eyes are on the front and
enclosure<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.200> actually<00:02:44.530> put<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.800> UM<00:02:45.010> the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
enclosure and actually put the UM the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.449 
enclosure and actually put the UM the
water<00:02:45.910> slide<00:02:46.209> on<00:02:46.500> first<00:02:47.500> sprayed<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.310> and

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
water slide on first sprayed it and

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.860 
water slide on first sprayed it and
everything<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:48.820> finished<00:02:49.150> in<00:02:49.330> closer<00:02:49.600> and

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
everything and finished in closer and

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.030 
everything and finished in closer and
then<00:02:49.989> drill<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.320> holes<00:02:50.470> because<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.739> fevers

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
then drill the holes because of fevers

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.320 
then drill the holes because of fevers
goin<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.310> be<00:02:51.370> no<00:02:51.400> way<00:02:51.820> I'm<00:02:51.970> going<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.180> be<00:02:52.270> able

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
goin to be no way I'm going to be able

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.479 
goin to be no way I'm going to be able
to<00:02:52.480> line<00:02:52.630> those<00:02:52.840> eyes<00:02:53.470> up<00:02:53.830> properly<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.310> i

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
to line those eyes up properly so i

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.970 
to line those eyes up properly so i
actually<00:02:54.790> drilled<00:02:55.209> them<00:02:55.330> after<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.840> UM<00:02:56.050> after

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
actually drilled them after the UM after

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.600 
actually drilled them after the UM after
the<00:02:57.100> entire<00:02:57.520> cloak<00:02:57.790> enclosure<00:02:58.330> was<00:02:58.600> done<00:02:58.840> I

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
the entire cloak enclosure was done I

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.400 
the entire cloak enclosure was done I
put<00:03:00.610> some<00:03:00.760> sockets<00:03:01.030> on<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.480> capacitor<00:03:01.690> next

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
put some sockets on the capacitor next

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.080 
put some sockets on the capacitor next
to<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.650> LM<00:03:03.220> 308<00:03:03.850> because<00:03:04.570> i<00:03:04.600> heard<00:03:04.930> that

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
to the LM 308 because i heard that

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.720 
to the LM 308 because i heard that
changing<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.330> capacitor<00:03:08.730> changes

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
changing that capacitor changes

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.680 
changing that capacitor changes
something<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.600> do<00:03:10.720> with<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.959> clipping<00:03:11.820> or<00:03:12.820> or

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
something to do with the clipping or or

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.350 
something to do with the clipping or or
maybe<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.110> mid-tone<00:03:14.800> i<00:03:15.070> can't<00:03:15.489> remember<00:03:15.610> but

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
maybe the mid-tone i can't remember but

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.390 
maybe the mid-tone i can't remember but
mean<00:03:17.110> when<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.530> want<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:17.920> give<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.310> my

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
mean when I want to give this to my

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.560 
mean when I want to give this to my
friend<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:20.170> plan<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.000> play<00:03:22.000> around<00:03:22.209> with<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.420> a

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
friend I plan to play around with that a

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.540 
friend I plan to play around with that a
bit<00:03:22.750> with<00:03:22.900> him<00:03:23.110> because<00:03:23.620> it's<00:03:24.070> obviously<00:03:24.370> for

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
bit with him because it's obviously for

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.070 
bit with him because it's obviously for
him<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:24.910> we're<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:25.060> gonna<00:03:25.210> I<00:03:25.450> was<00:03:25.660> thinking<00:03:25.990> I

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
him so we're just gonna I was thinking I

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.570 
him so we're just gonna I was thinking I
just<00:03:26.230> play<00:03:26.410> around<00:03:26.530> for<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.040> bit<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.280> see

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
just play around for a bit and see

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.740 
just play around for a bit and see
whichever<00:03:29.580> one<00:03:29.790> he<00:03:29.940> likes<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.420> then<00:03:30.540> leaving

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
whichever one he likes and then leaving

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.260 
whichever one he likes and then leaving
leave<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.380> in<00:03:31.740> there<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.250> then<00:03:33.000> I've<00:03:33.120> just

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
leave that in there and then I've just

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.310 
leave that in there and then I've just
got<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.570> sockets<00:03:33.960> on<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.260> diodes<00:03:34.710> and<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:36.320> I

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
got the sockets on the diodes and and I

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.020 
got the sockets on the diodes and and I
think<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:38.280> my<00:03:38.490> in<00:03:39.150> my<00:03:39.210> rat<00:03:39.750> I've<00:03:39.900> got<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:41.030> about

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
think in my in my rat I've got a about

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.600 
think in my in my rat I've got a about
41<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:43.140> that<00:03:43.800> might<00:03:43.980> be<00:03:44.010> something<00:03:44.130> else<00:03:44.460> that

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
41 so that might be something else that

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.370 
41 so that might be something else that
he<00:03:44.670> wants<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.000> change<00:03:45.210> so<00:03:45.480> i<00:03:45.510> was<00:03:45.630> just<00:03:45.780> i<00:03:46.020> just

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
he wants to change so i was just i just

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.640 
he wants to change so i was just i just
did<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.770> sockets<00:03:47.130> for<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.400> as<00:03:47.610> well<00:03:47.670> i<00:03:48.650> am

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
did the sockets for that as well i am

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.280 
did the sockets for that as well i am
putting<00:03:49.920> i<00:03:50.190> got<00:03:50.370> some<00:03:50.520> white<00:03:50.820> DC<00:03:51.750> Jax<00:03:52.050> and<00:03:52.200> I

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
putting i got some white DC Jax and I

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.080 
putting i got some white DC Jax and I
put<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.470> white<00:03:52.950> DC<00:03:53.370> jack<00:03:53.610> in<00:03:53.790> this<00:03:53.910> one<00:03:54.060> I

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
put a white DC jack in this one I

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.810 
put a white DC jack in this one I
thought<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.420> would<00:03:54.540> go<00:03:54.690> with<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.050> general

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
thought it would go with the general

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.020 
thought it would go with the general
general<00:03:56.820> look<00:03:56.940> of<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.710> did<00:03:58.830> obviously

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
general look of it and I did obviously

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.550 
general look of it and I did obviously
from<00:04:00.030> looking<00:04:00.300> out<00:04:00.420> into<00:04:00.630> a<00:04:00.780> battery<00:04:01.050> though

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
from looking out into a battery though

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.170 
from looking out into a battery though
and<00:04:01.800> I'm<00:04:01.890> quite<00:04:02.310> glad<00:04:02.490> it<00:04:02.730> into<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:02.970> battery

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
and I'm quite glad it into a battery

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.230 
and I'm quite glad it into a battery
because<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:04.320> would<00:04:05.010> have<00:04:05.100> been<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.550> pretty<00:04:06.030> big

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
because it would have been a pretty big

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.670 
because it would have been a pretty big
challenge<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.690> actually<00:04:06.960> fit<00:04:07.140> that<00:04:07.290> battery

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
challenge to actually fit that battery

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.210 
challenge to actually fit that battery
in<00:04:07.770> there<00:04:07.920> it's<00:04:08.310> already<00:04:09.000> crammed<00:04:09.390> as<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.660> is

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
in there it's already crammed as it is

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.030 
in there it's already crammed as it is
so<00:04:11.220> that's<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.910> yeah<00:04:12.870> that's<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.410> dentist

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
so that's it yeah that's the dentist

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.830 
so that's it yeah that's the dentist
distortion<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:16.220> mad<00:04:17.220> being<00:04:17.550> slow<00:04:18.480> loris

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
distortion and the mad being slow loris

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.160 
distortion and the mad being slow loris
