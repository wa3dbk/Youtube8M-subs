00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.509
 hello my name is jacques guy ben je 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.019
 am a cabinetmaker and today I'm going 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.090
 tell you about a technique for 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.470
 clean bronzes or times 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.520
 so I 'm going to demonstrate 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:23.680
 on two very old brass good objects 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.230
 and a small level for achievement 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.170
 of this work we will use a product 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.460
 which we call the dt ha which is actually 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.620
 one Bissau dick and diluted 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:42.400
 water for product application 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:44.440
 I will use gex so as 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.250
 always when using products 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
 chemical 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.570
 first of all have to read very 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.750
 carefully the safety instructions 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.089
 and use of products the cards 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.839
 are available on the website 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:01.239
 of beds nrs concerning the use of this 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.690
 product therefore take the protections 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.360
 adapted 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.899
 when rubber glasses any 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.420
 eye protection and an apron 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:15.479
 body protection so I 'm going to pour 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.479
 a little of this product in a cup 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.640
 and I close the original voice for 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.159
 treat the small against the small pump 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.159
 brass I'll be at peace the jex 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:40.530
 for the sole purpose of sodic and I'm going 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.530
 apply it on some of the fauna 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:45.549
 so you have to repeat several times 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.829
 the operation 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.200
 in a few seconds already wall 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.829
 change in appearance depending on the heap 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.890
 oxidation of the product to be treated, it will be 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.319
 obliged to apply more or less the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.450
 produces several successive layers or 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.499
 with more or less pressure on the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 I remind you that the jex the contribution of 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:11.440
 destructive effects on the product it's 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.450
 a light abrasive so it does not create a 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.650
 if we 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.220
 big scratches on the Latvian so 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.670
 after applying the product one can 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.269
 easily see two areas well 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.670
 separate yves the area before treatment 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:35.400
 strongly oxidized and the area after 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.500
 treatment so that actually gave back the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.769
 original color of the metal at the end of 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.660
 complete room treatment 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:51.989
 I advocate of reims and with water 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:54.510
 demineralized to remove the 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.060
 possible hard knocks of products 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.489
 small and small traces that would be 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.090
 requested the small cavities for the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.829
 phase 2 of cuttlefish 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.239
 I recommend using a small one 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:12.660
 household hair so as to dry 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.989
 places inaccessible by a 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.989
 cloth 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:28.260
 so they knew now how 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.720
 clean quickly and efficiently 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.670
 objects in bronze or brass or in 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.670
 strongly oxidized copper 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.680
 and
