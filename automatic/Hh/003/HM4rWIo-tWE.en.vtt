00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.570
 presented sync 16 500 which big 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.720
 nomadic helmet

 here today sync this reflex 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260
 I was looking for the name 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.399
 so this is an intra headset this is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.250
 quite visible which at the big 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.230
 particularity of being wireless in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.980
 bluetooth connection exclusively so 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.379
 who is destined 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.739
 it's visible here rather an activity 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.090
 sporty with a choco gentleman who 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.890
 explains to us that basically he has the eye of 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.660
 tiger and who will run very fast thanks 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.140
 in the headphones in any case information 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.420
 important 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.340
 he won the red dot award 2014 not the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.600
 sir to our helmets and we have a pretty 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.890
 damsel who explains us the same 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 thing a little bit near the back 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.820
 on the side an explanation on the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.070
 multifunction remote control that is 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.729
 present on the helmet at the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.710
 bundle we have a usb to micro usb in 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.650
 rubber that will allow to reload 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.420
 the bluetooth connection headset requires a 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:22.290
 series of new silicone tips 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.390
 black small or bigger sail to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.830
 seek greater for 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.869
 different sizes of ears I'm going 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.040
 push all that and a whole bunch of little ones 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.570
 papers which I will pass very 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.840
 quickly the guarantee clauses etc 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.850
 etc you explain that it will take them 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.100
 loaded before use and if possible 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.780
 using the micro usb and that's 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.180
 serra and the little starter guide 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.979
 fast for the remote 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.479
 multifunctional basically at the level 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.200
 from the description you'll see it's 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.689
 quite fast 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.570
 so we end up with an intra who does not 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.070
 have no wired connection 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.250
 we will have 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.720
 a black silicone part so with a 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.520
 corner that will come who will come to 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.690
 stall in the ear to isolate everything 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.510
 that a plastic body a part a 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.260
 little soft touch a nice badji turntable 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.440
 in plastic 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.050
 note that the second platinum is 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.130
 raises and access I'm going to have some 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.020
 big fingers I hope it's going to be 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.260
 put on camera and access to 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.709
 micro usb recharging the battery 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:26.780
 in the rubber sleeve there is a 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:30.720
 loving I'm trying to search for 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.209
 the cinemas here to be able to do it 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.410
 but to hold it around the neck when 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.000
 you do not listen to music not to 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.400
 loose it 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.950
 both ends are connected by a wire 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.840
 dishes whose paint or coating 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.459
 they think about wandering and 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.900
 reflections of light what is a plus 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.480
 early a plus for security we find 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.100
 a small remote control so more - for 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.570
 the volume and the multifunction button 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.040
 which will allow to surf a little bit 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.239
 better pieces put the piece on 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.800
 pause past the next piece in 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.030
 depending on the number of times it is 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.400
 press it's pretty classic 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.290
 two small plastic parts that 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.120
 will allow to lengthen or 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.780
 shorten the tour since necks 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.100
 will rather be around the neck 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.720
 here I am tangling a little brushes 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.180
 with all this is a sold helmet 99 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.110
 euros truly to a destination 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.579
 sports practice 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.100
 the proof is the absence of films 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.910
 so from a contrary point of view I do not 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.500
 can will pass on the dates 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.829
 since it only works in bluetooth 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.500
 to standard 3.0 at the spectrum level 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.450
 covered if I'm not mistaken he leaves from 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.310
 dissertation up to 22 thousand hertz I 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.850
 check on the box I'm right he does 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.799
 call for speakers of 8.5 mm so 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.680
 a helmet sold 99 euros which is 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.750
 quite expensive enough for an intra bluetooth 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.220
 moreover, therefore relatively limited to 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.350
 sound level it's all right 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.239
 we even pretty much nice to 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.620
 listen cons I use them on 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.120
 a race and yes at the farm we are a 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.970
 little bit sporty anyway mine 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.769
 nothing so I went running with and he 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.480
 disappointed me on a specific point by the 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.100
 quality of sound even the insulation is 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.630
 good even power too much since we 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.829
 do not hear cars at all 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.320
 the perverse effect of the intra when we 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.130
 short by cons he has microphones this 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.510
 academic 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.770
 cutoff so I do not know if that 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.810
 comes not light that starts to 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.310
 to age or the quality of the 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.180
 connection I can tell you in all 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.260
 the case what is certain is that my 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.760
 lumia works perfectly with 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.130
 other bluetooth headsets in micro 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.770
 cuts and there running I got 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.690
 a lot of micro - cuts on a piece 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.890
 amazing now the quality of his 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.780
 is not faulted there is no 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.220
 great thing to say about that a 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.570
 little bit of breath sensitivity but 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.240
 bluetooth makes it not surprising 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.460
 so a helmet really for the 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.290
 sporty what changes us a bit our 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.370
 huge helmets that we can wear 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.290
 in any case for a practice 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.000
 sporty for taking her away 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.170
 net really really sensible that 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.750
 avoid getting caught in the heat 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.220
 in the pass and that's the part to nothing 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.600
 hang a little bit in the shot but 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.340
 this is normal with sweating and 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.110
 flat son but beyond that it's 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.000
 really a very well designed helmet I 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.680
 took great pleasure in using it in 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.090
 sporting activity which makes it 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.260
 is not necessarily always very clean 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.180
 if we look very closely but you 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.460
 we will excuse it so it was 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.650
 of sync this reflex of summer 2 j -pl 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.060
 bayard man overcost tv i invite you to 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.590

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.000
 very soon and I tell you at
