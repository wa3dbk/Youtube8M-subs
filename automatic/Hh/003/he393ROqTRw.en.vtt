hello to a friend welcome back to the
total<00:00:03.360> maintenance<00:00:03.570> channel<00:00:04.560> this<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.460> for

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
total maintenance channel this is for

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.310 
total maintenance channel this is for
2007<00:00:07.589> highlander<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.730> just<00:00:09.540> discovered

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
2007 highlander and I just discovered

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.490 
2007 highlander and I just discovered
after<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.130> vehicle<00:00:12.090> was<00:00:12.269> perfectly<00:00:12.870> serviced

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
after the vehicle was perfectly serviced

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.250 
after the vehicle was perfectly serviced
by<00:00:13.920> someone<00:00:14.460> here<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.660> box<00:00:15.900> there<00:00:16.139> was

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
by someone here in the box there was

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.250 
by someone here in the box there was
concrete<00:00:16.830> nails<00:00:17.359> chunks<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.510> wood<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.170> on

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
concrete nails chunks of wood and so on

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.250 
concrete nails chunks of wood and so on
I<00:00:19.470> already<00:00:20.100> doubt<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.510> vehicle<00:00:22.109> was

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
I already doubt that this vehicle was

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.490 
I already doubt that this vehicle was
serviced<00:00:22.890> properly<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> part<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.260> air

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
serviced properly so part of the air

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.740 
serviced properly so part of the air
intake<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.160> course<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> MAF<00:00:27.060> sensor<00:00:27.090> you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
intake of course is the MAF sensor you

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.200 
intake of course is the MAF sensor you
can<00:00:27.810> see<00:00:28.170> how<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.500> dirty<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.640> also<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
can see how it's dirty and also the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.900 
can see how it's dirty and also the
throttle<00:00:30.660> body<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.260> I'm<00:00:31.349> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.910> inspect

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
throttle body so I'm going to inspect

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.260 
throttle body so I'm going to inspect
the<00:00:33.300> throttle<00:00:33.840> body<00:00:33.989> how<00:00:34.500> dirty<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.850> right

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the throttle body how dirty it is right

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.290 
the throttle body how dirty it is right
now<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.840> will<00:00:37.500> lose<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.219> clamp<00:00:38.610> which<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
now I will lose the clamp which is

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
now I will lose the clamp which is
holding<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.920> air<00:00:41.879> intake<00:00:42.420> tube<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
holding the air intake tube to the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.229 
holding the air intake tube to the
throttle<00:00:43.469> body<00:00:44.010> which<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.700> right<00:00:44.940> here

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
throttle body which is right here

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.819 
throttle body which is right here
loosening<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.489> clamp<00:00:47.539> from<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.829> throttle

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
loosening this clamp from the throttle

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.090 
loosening this clamp from the throttle
body<00:00:49.980> gave<00:00:50.579> me<00:00:50.820> chance<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.690> put<00:00:51.960> an<00:00:52.199> entire<00:00:52.469> box

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
body gave me chance to put an entire box

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.060 
body gave me chance to put an entire box
on<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> side<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
on the side and now I can do the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.299 
on the side and now I can do the
inspection<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.690> throttle<00:00:58.170> body<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.770> as

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
inspection of the throttle body and as

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.590 
inspection of the throttle body and as
you<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.670> see<00:00:59.730> like<00:01:00.270> me<00:01:00.920> there<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.600> carbon

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
you can see like me there is that carbon

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.990 
you can see like me there is that carbon
deposit<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> dirt<00:01:04.769> underneath<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:07.229> top

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
deposit and dirt underneath and on top

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.600 
deposit and dirt underneath and on top
side<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.640> butterfly<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.210> will<00:01:12.600> use<00:01:13.080> my

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
side of the butterfly that I will use my

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.870 
side of the butterfly that I will use my
throttle<00:01:14.610> body<00:01:14.850> cleaning<00:01:15.450> spray<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.700> I<00:01:17.700> will

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
throttle body cleaning spray and I will

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.999 
throttle body cleaning spray and I will
carefully<00:01:18.380> start<00:01:20.030> cleaning<00:01:21.409> set<00:01:22.409> carbon

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
carefully start cleaning set carbon

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.969 
carefully start cleaning set carbon
deposits<00:01:23.659> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:26.540> throttle<00:01:27.540> body<00:01:27.689> now<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
deposits of the throttle body now I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.690 
deposits of the throttle body now I
don't<00:01:29.820> want<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.270> spray<00:01:30.630> too<00:01:31.020> much<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
don't want to spray too much of the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.190 
don't want to spray too much of the
spray<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.840> don't<00:01:34.409> wanna<00:01:34.759> have<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
spray because I don't wanna have that

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.969 
spray because I don't wanna have that
fluid<00:01:37.200> inside<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> engine<00:01:38.689> look<00:01:39.829> what<00:01:40.829> is

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
fluid inside of the engine look what is

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.020 
fluid inside of the engine look what is
there<00:01:41.299> it's<00:01:42.299> really<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:43.140> dirty<00:01:43.970> after<00:01:44.970> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
there it's really really dirty after I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.149 
there it's really really dirty after I
perfectly<00:01:45.689> cleaned<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.619> would<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.979> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
perfectly cleaned it I would like to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.670 
perfectly cleaned it I would like to
show<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.000> difference<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.990> what<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
show you the difference and what was the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
show you the difference and what was the
purpose<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.340> cleaning<00:01:51.380> see<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.590> area<00:01:53.369> under

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
purpose of cleaning see that area under

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.480 
purpose of cleaning see that area under
needed<00:01:54.390> butterfly<00:01:55.140> valve<00:01:55.710> which<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.219> right

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
needed butterfly valve which is right

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.380 
needed butterfly valve which is right
now<00:01:56.729> open<00:01:57.590> there<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> space<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.360> space

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
now open there is a space and that space

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.920 
now open there is a space and that space
it's<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.560> air<00:02:02.430> which<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.360> responsible

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
it's for the air which is responsible

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.770 
it's for the air which is responsible
for<00:02:04.320> idling<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.310> go<00:02:05.490> around<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.180> butterfly

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
for idling to go around the butterfly

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.589 
for idling to go around the butterfly
valve<00:02:06.950> before<00:02:07.950> we<00:02:08.190> cleaned<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.759> space<00:02:09.300> was

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
valve before we cleaned that space was

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.740 
valve before we cleaned that space was
basically<00:02:10.340> blocked<00:02:11.340> by<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.790> dirt<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
basically blocked by the dirt and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.650 
basically blocked by the dirt and
carbon<00:02:13.230> deposits<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.670> engine<00:02:15.210> couldn't

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
carbon deposits so the engine couldn't

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.170 
carbon deposits so the engine couldn't
idle<00:02:16.020> correctly<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.100> computer<00:02:17.850> had<00:02:18.030> to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
idle correctly and the computer had to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.110 
idle correctly and the computer had to
adjust<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.990> new<00:02:19.680> situation<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:20.640> now<00:02:20.790> when

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
adjust to that new situation so now when

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.450 
adjust to that new situation so now when
you<00:02:21.240> will<00:02:21.450> all<00:02:21.660> put<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.080> together<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.130> start

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
you will all put it together and start

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.630 
you will all put it together and start
the<00:02:23.580> engine<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.150> idle<00:02:24.540> will<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.900> high<00:02:25.170> but

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
the engine the idle will be high but

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.850 
the engine the idle will be high but
computer<00:02:26.640> will<00:02:26.850> eventually<00:02:27.690> after<00:02:28.050> short

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
computer will eventually after short

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.340 
computer will eventually after short
test<00:02:29.370> drive<00:02:29.670> computer<00:02:30.420> will<00:02:30.630> eventually

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
test drive computer will eventually

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.590 
test drive computer will eventually
adjust<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.460> idle<00:02:32.850> will<00:02:33.090> go<00:02:33.270> slowly

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
adjust to it and the idle will go slowly
