dehydration<00:00:01.350> reactions<00:00:01.949> can<00:00:02.220> be<00:00:02.250> used<00:00:02.550> to

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
dehydration reactions can be used to

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.599 
dehydration reactions can be used to
turn<00:00:03.090> small<00:00:03.710> carbohydrates<00:00:04.710> into<00:00:05.040> larger

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609

group<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.450> removed<00:00:09.990> from<00:00:10.349> one<00:00:10.590> reacting

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
group is removed from one reacting

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.940 
group is removed from one reacting
molecule<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.450> hydrogen<00:00:13.019> from<00:00:13.290> another

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950

reacting molecule water is formed and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.279 
reacting molecule water is formed and
thus<00:00:17.460> water<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.000> removed<00:00:18.180> from<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.750> reacting
