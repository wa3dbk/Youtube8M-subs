00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:10.459 

keep<00:00:00.930> tape<00:00:01.170> investigation<00:00:08.990> so<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.230> didn't<00:00:10.410> get

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
keep tape investigation so I didn't get

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.160 
keep tape investigation so I didn't get
the<00:00:10.530> album<00:00:10.950> done<00:00:10.980> yet

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
the album done yet

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.939 
the album done yet
so<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.200> had<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.440> run<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:14.269> extension<00:00:15.269> cord

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
so I had to run the the extension cord

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.689 
so I had to run the the extension cord
no<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.539> haven't<00:00:18.539> he<00:00:18.690> tapes<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:19.550> but<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> ain't

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
no I haven't he tapes on but I ain't

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.279 
no I haven't he tapes on but I ain't
turned<00:00:20.910> them<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.090> very<00:00:21.330> early<00:00:22.310> it<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.369> melting

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
turned them on very early it is melting

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.839 
turned them on very early it is melting
and<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.470> give<00:00:25.680> me<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.800> spot<00:00:26.099> for<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.760> to

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and this give me a spot for this to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.560 
and this give me a spot for this to
go<00:00:30.199> so

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.880 

and<00:00:34.570> see<00:00:34.840> there<00:00:39.900> so<00:00:40.900> it<00:00:41.080> does<00:00:41.290> have<00:00:41.470> a<00:00:41.530> place<00:00:41.680> to

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
and see there so it does have a place to

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.710 
and see there so it does have a place to
go<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.540> I<00:00:44.700> think<00:00:45.700> the<00:00:45.790> gutters<00:00:46.120> are<00:00:46.330> burning

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
go and I think the gutters are burning

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.750 
go and I think the gutters are burning
clear<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.370> burning<00:00:48.670> free<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:51.070> you<00:00:51.100> have<00:00:51.340> that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
clear and burning free do you have that

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.530 
clear and burning free do you have that
I<00:00:52.150> need<00:00:53.050> to<00:00:53.140> put<00:00:53.290> on<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.620> side<00:00:54.540> little

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
I need to put on the side little

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:04.499 
I need to put on the side little
diverter<00:00:55.989> for<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.040> valley<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.760> I<00:01:03.509> think

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
diverter for the valley but I think

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.140 
diverter for the valley but I think
having<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.869> separate<00:01:05.199> switches<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.000> two

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
having the separate switches for the two

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.910 
having the separate switches for the two
circuits<00:01:08.940> is<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:10.030> good<00:01:10.210> idea<00:01:10.650> doesn't<00:01:11.650> think

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
circuits is a good idea doesn't think

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.160 
circuits is a good idea doesn't think
you<00:01:12.009> always<00:01:12.190> want<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.580> run<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:13.690> cutter<00:01:13.930> one

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
you always want to run the cutter one

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.359 
you always want to run the cutter one
first<00:01:14.950> and<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.450> roof<00:01:19.960> one<00:01:20.369> later

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
first and and then the roof one later

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.249 
first and and then the roof one later
because<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:22.300> other<00:01:22.479> one<00:01:22.630> needs<00:01:22.750> to<00:01:22.900> be<00:01:22.990> clear

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
because the other one needs to be clear

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.830 
because the other one needs to be clear
and<00:01:23.860> I<00:01:23.920> think<00:01:23.950> he<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.610> having<00:01:24.840> thermostatic

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
and I think he is having thermostatic

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.210 
and I think he is having thermostatic
controls<00:01:26.259> if<00:01:26.440> you're<00:01:26.590> not<00:01:26.680> around<00:01:26.800> you<00:01:27.100> can

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
controls if you're not around you can

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.830 
controls if you're not around you can
see<00:01:27.340> it's<00:01:27.460> dripping

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.120 

maybe<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:37.420> dripping<00:01:37.810> right<00:01:38.909> there<00:01:39.960> so

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
maybe it's dripping right there so

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.110 
maybe it's dripping right there so
anyway<00:01:42.130> there's<00:01:42.280> no<00:01:42.370> insulation<00:01:42.729> on<00:01:42.970> this

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
anyway there's no insulation on this

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.210 
anyway there's no insulation on this
part<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:44.350> we're<00:01:44.470> getting<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.650> lot<00:01:44.740> more<00:01:44.950> up<00:01:45.070> I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
part so we're getting a lot more up I

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.670 
part so we're getting a lot more up I
you<00:01:45.340> say<00:01:45.580> think<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:48.990> anyway<00:01:49.990> it's<00:01:50.229> about<00:01:50.290> 20

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
you say think so anyway it's about 20

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.600 
you say think so anyway it's about 20
degrees<00:01:50.770> out<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.159> have<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.370> on<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:53.610> obviously

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
degrees out and have it on is obviously

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.850 
degrees out and have it on is obviously
important<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.090> have<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:56.110> heat<00:01:56.290> tape<00:01:56.440> on<00:01:56.590> top

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
important to have the heat tape on top

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.710 
important to have the heat tape on top
of<00:01:58.830> the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
of the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.110 
of the
what<00:02:02.560> do<00:02:02.620> you<00:02:02.680> call<00:02:02.830> it<00:02:03.400> gutter<00:02:03.910> guard<00:02:04.920> so

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
what do you call it gutter guard so

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.930 
what do you call it gutter guard so
anyway<00:02:07.120> well<00:02:09.180> just<00:02:10.180> coming<00:02:10.479> along<00:02:10.570> I<00:02:11.850> wish<00:02:12.850> I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
anyway well just coming along I wish I

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.340 
anyway well just coming along I wish I
were<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.090> turn<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.330> on<00:02:13.420> sooner<00:02:13.780> but<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.020> didn't

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
were to turn it on sooner but I didn't

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.170 
were to turn it on sooner but I didn't
so<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.680> think<00:02:14.890> maybe<00:02:15.220> thermostat<00:02:15.730> control

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
so I think maybe thermostat control

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.840 
so I think maybe thermostat control
would<00:02:16.330> be<00:02:16.360> good<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.600> didn't<00:02:16.870> see<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.110> ice<00:02:17.850> he's

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
would be good I didn't see the ice he's

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:33.720 
would be good I didn't see the ice he's
dropping<00:02:19.240> down<00:02:19.390> there<00:02:19.660> after<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:32.730> I'm

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
dropping down there after it so so I'm

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.640 
dropping down there after it so so I'm
pulling<00:02:34.209> them<00:02:34.270> down<00:02:34.360> tighter<00:02:34.870> might<00:02:35.470> be<00:02:35.620> a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
pulling them down tighter might be a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.170 
pulling them down tighter might be a
better<00:02:35.770> idea<00:02:35.860> insulated<00:02:36.370> mr.<00:02:36.550> gallows<00:02:36.820> barber

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
better idea insulated mr. gallows barber

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.420 
better idea insulated mr. gallows barber
than<00:02:37.360> getting<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:37.690> ice<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.770> click<00:02:39.160> right

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
than getting this ice like click right

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.699 
than getting this ice like click right
there<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:41.170> that's<00:02:41.410> bad<00:02:42.959> anyway<00:02:44.020> well<00:02:44.350> it<00:02:44.590> is

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
there so that's bad anyway well it is

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.500 
there so that's bad anyway well it is
melting<00:02:45.130> so<00:02:45.520> yes<00:02:46.420> half<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.290> water
