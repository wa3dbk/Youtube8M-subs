00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:16.650
 hello guys welcome indeed well back 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:22.060
 on the second part of the gameplay of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:27.510
 supermario forever 2012 well let's get started 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.510
 even with the sego let's go gameplay 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:39.170
 well after the last let's say after the last one 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:45.110
 the last supermario gameplay man there is 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:50.270
 the first I decided to continue with a 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.220
 bit of series b these games though too 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.309
 tried to record unearthed movie of the 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.610
 letter because if you followed the first 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.150
 video I read that I would have done too 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.480
 I didn't know about bath and p3 game play 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:11.060
 how heavy this has I tried to 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:14.420
 I have to say that we say there is not 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.100
 I'm lake things various funds for me second 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.780
 I could start doing it too 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:35.180
 some gameplay tell you already that they are 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:39.020
 nice 2 eagle so if you have any 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.570
 Basic gameplay plus 3 means I have 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.800
 also beaten in two occupied wallpaper 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.810
 and has some gameplay to it 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.050
 understands that the multiplayer gameplay 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.660
 because I don't have graziani crackate or di 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.640
 health purchased so I can do 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.740
 multiplayer gameplay 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.090
 because it also follows the air it makes no sense 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.510
 even if it would make sense that the grandmother 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.510
 follows 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:26.010
