I want to research and found out that
Berkeley<00:01:45.350> online<00:01:45.730> offered<00:01:46.730> some<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:46.910> these

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
courses it was really great because

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.720 
courses it was really great because
there<00:01:48.560> were<00:01:48.620> some<00:01:48.950> holes<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.400> what<00:01:49.550> I<00:01:49.580> was

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
there were some holes and what I was

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.760 
there were some holes and what I was
doing<00:01:50.060> fundamental<00:01:50.750> things<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.200> had<00:01:51.380> had

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.730 
doing fundamental things that I had had
missed<00:01:52.070> for<00:01:52.670> obvious<00:01:52.820> reasons<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:53.510> just<00:01:53.840> would

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
missed for obvious reasons I just would

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.920 
missed for obvious reasons I just would
have<00:01:54.830> no<00:01:54.980> reason<00:01:55.010> to<00:01:55.430> know<00:01:55.580> them<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:55.970> didn't<00:01:56.870> go

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
have no reason to know them I didn't go

to school for film scoring I've never

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.390 
to school for film scoring I've never
orchestrated<00:01:59.870> so<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.770> was<00:02:00.890> time<00:02:01.040> for<00:02:01.280> me<00:02:01.370> to

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
orchestrated so it was time for me to

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.130 
orchestrated so it was time for me to
find<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.790> way<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.940> get<00:02:02.150> get<00:02:02.660> this<00:02:02.840> information

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
find a way to get get this information

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.110 
find a way to get get this information
and<00:02:03.590> get<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:03.890> education<00:02:04.550> there's<00:02:04.760> no<00:02:04.910> way<00:02:05.090> I

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
and get this education there's no way I

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.580 
and get this education there's no way I
would<00:02:05.360> have<00:02:05.450> been<00:02:05.570> able<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.810> do<00:02:05.930> that<00:02:05.960> without

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
would have been able to do that without

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.320 
would have been able to do that without
the<00:02:06.830> online<00:02:07.130> school<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.760> way<00:02:07.910> that<00:02:08.149> it's

the online school the way that it's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.570 
the online school the way that it's
outlined<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:09.320> Berkeley<00:02:09.710> is<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:10.009> you're<00:02:10.190> able

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
outlined in Berkeley is that you're able

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.060 
outlined in Berkeley is that you're able
to<00:02:10.880> really<00:02:11.230> hear<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.350> experience<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.950> other

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
students work the audio or the video in

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.410 
students work the audio or the video in
a<00:02:15.709> real-time<00:02:15.920> way<00:02:16.370> almost<00:02:16.970> like<00:02:17.120> if<00:02:17.300> you're

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
a real-time way almost like if you're

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.820 
a real-time way almost like if you're
playing<00:02:17.720> in<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.959> band<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.470> really<00:02:18.709> great

playing in a band of really great
musicians<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.610> hear<00:02:19.760> somebody<00:02:20.000> else<00:02:20.300> do

something and it gives you an idea to to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.910 
something and it gives you an idea to to
do<00:02:23.420> something<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:24.020> kind<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.320> interaction

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
do something that kind of interaction

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.880 
do something that kind of interaction
and<00:02:25.720> community<00:02:26.720> was<00:02:27.050> really<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.410> felt<00:02:27.709> like
