00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
bad hair day and that's when I always

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
bad hair day and that's when I always
put<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.399> hair<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> messy<00:01:44.820> bun<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.450> think

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
put my hair in a messy bun but I think

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.179 
put my hair in a messy bun but I think
it<00:01:45.930> looks<00:01:45.960> kind<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.350> cute<00:01:46.530> with<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> outfit

it looks kind of cute with the outfit

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.490 
it looks kind of cute with the outfit
since<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> outfit<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> little<00:01:48.500> bit

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
since the outfit is a little bit

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.710 
since the outfit is a little bit
slightly<00:01:50.009> more<00:01:50.369> feminine<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.060> decided<00:01:51.450> to
