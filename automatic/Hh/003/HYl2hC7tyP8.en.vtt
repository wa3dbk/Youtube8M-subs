00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:25.180
 more speed directly from the 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.279
 manifestation tuissi mi di roma we are 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.840
 in the company of Luigi and Fabrizio i 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.450
 fair organizers 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.899
 let's start immediately by asking these 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.760
 boys 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.620
 how did the idea of ​​organizing an idea come about? 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.309
 fair entirely dedicated to the toy 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.540
 vintage please fabrizio then us 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.850
 basically we are collectors 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.730
 so we made ourselves collectors 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.920
 I realize that to go and look for the 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.359
 toys and we collect 70s 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.949
 80 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.350
 we did nothing but do so many kilometers 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.300
 go to the north because there are the north 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.640
 we pay for such services but i 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.309
 30 c the center to the south there is little stuff indeed 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.730
 we say almost nothing so we have 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.600
 decided since it was still in the camp 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.689
 of 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.750
 to start thinking about making a 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.450
 demonstration in Rome also for let's say 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.970
 to help collectors in the south who 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.399
 in Milan maybe they can't do 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.590
 1,000 1,200 kilometers and therefore of 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.950
 consequently fail to become alle 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.520
 exhibitions 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.930
 so we decided with luigi that 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.960
 we are there for several years 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.420
 we know to make a demonstration a 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.080
 Rome has been held for several years now 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.670
 fair then this is the third year us 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.450
 we have taken this situation into our own hands 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.060
 and we have several exhibitors who 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.190
 they come all over Italy the whole south comes 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.740
 both as exhibitors and as visitors 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.350
 and the north also there are different 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.940
 people characters from the north and the 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.950
 previous event we had 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.020
 of people from Germany from the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.460
 france of collectors and gods 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.039
 sellers 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.049
 so we have about 200 tables of 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.420
 collectors who sell theirs 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.369
 collection or traders who 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.459
 in short, they sell toys that 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.500
 rounds perfect collections and who 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.390
 instead you want to tell us about the type of 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.670
 public that animates this fair then 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.049
 they are nostalgic collectors 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.299
 says a little something 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.200
 the audience is vast and heterogeneous 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.970
 all 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.650
 the collector and nostalgic like 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.989
 rightly you say but also simply 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.760
 the passionate person he wants to do 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.799
 a dip in the past wants to remember i 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.989
 toys that played as a child but 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.940
 curiosity also curiosity is often 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.980
 the spring that moves these manifestations 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.989
 the audience as you can see is 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.840
 really great there are so many 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:48.470
 people looking for the missing piece but 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.690
 or that they propose in turn 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.489
 exchanges but also want to exchange the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.030
 them their collections with others 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.250
 issues 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.560
 the theme and just a very big one 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.019
 beautiful audience and for how long 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.880
 it concerns the kind of products and 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.519
 so what toys are those 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.400
 most sought after and best selling 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.700
 then as possibly the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.069
 a fair is based on the toy of 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.079
 modernism 70's 80's 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.659
 so let's say the players that go 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.810
 for the greater part are the goldrake robots 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.849
 mazinga jeeg daitarn 3 in short everyone 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.220
 these kind of Japanese robots 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.050
 then the big jim that in short is the end 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.780
 was one of the 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.420
 of the myths of the 70's 80's like 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.230
 toy for the boy and also the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.890
 machines are all the rage, and 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.930
 toy soldiers and small trains different material 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.120
 I have seen this genre for myself 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.740
 not a bad sailor moon boys 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.810
 Luigi Count I wanted to open one 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.450
 then reflection on the value of 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.940
 toy that goes beyond his 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.550
 be material so let's talk a little 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.070
 of the memory that it also contains of the 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.280
 extra value he has for those who buy it 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.260
 often the economic side of this 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.300
 passion even if sometimes 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.170
 challenging goes into the background 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.790
 because the spring that also the seal that 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.270
 they are unleashed in a collector when 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.710
 find the missing piece when it finds the 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.859
 the last the last piece of this 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.660
 nostalgia puzzles and goes beyond this 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.690
 economic value that is more than anything else 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.550
 we also often see offers 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.350
 comes the collector who says to me 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.510
 missing this piece I offer you hicks 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.669
 take it off your collection for everything 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.410
 the gold of the world is not often talked about and 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.840
 this type of proposal also comes 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.230
 made but it is above all the value of 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.300
 piece is a sentimental affective value 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.500
 there is no transcendence and it leaves the side 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.730
 real economic 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.570
 although many make sacrifices 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.090
 anyway because collectors happen 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.760
 who have possibilities and therefore buy 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.510
 also for fashion often but also 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.910
 collectors who make sacrifices 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.910
 real sacrifices for per 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.980
 get to the coveted piece yes well yes yes into 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.470
 effects the value a toy has 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.330
 of the kind goes beyond its value 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.410
 no doubt you want material 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.360
 brief on upcoming events 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.930
 of the next appointment 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.940

 ergife the pantheon room of this one 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.790
