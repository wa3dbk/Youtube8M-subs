00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
about that but I just decided to go a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.519 
about that but I just decided to go a
little<00:00:04.859> different<00:00:05.130> route<00:00:05.250> because<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.700> figured

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
little different route because I figured

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.900
