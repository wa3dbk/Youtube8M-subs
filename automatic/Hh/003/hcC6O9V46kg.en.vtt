let's<00:03:54.019> unpack<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.650> cymbal

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.860 

very<00:04:01.090> sweet<00:04:01.470> small<00:04:02.470> slight<00:04:03.400> weight<00:04:03.870> can

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
very sweet small slight weight can

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.100 
very sweet small slight weight can
easily<00:04:05.320> carried<00:04:05.680> around<00:04:06.240> so<00:04:07.240> you<00:04:07.330> have<00:04:07.360> two

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
easily carried around so you have two

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.500 
easily carried around so you have two
speakers<00:04:08.470> here<00:04:08.980> this<00:04:09.790> is<00:04:09.880> not<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.300> powerful

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
speakers here this is not so powerful

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.040 
speakers here this is not so powerful
these<00:04:10.960> are<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.700> one<00:04:12.700> watt<00:04:13.000> or<00:04:13.270> in<00:04:13.600> ask<00:04:13.780> each

then<00:04:21.010> I<00:04:21.220> said<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:23.320> be<00:04:23.350> connected<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:24.040> external

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
then I said can be connected to external

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.190 
then I said can be connected to external
speaker<00:04:24.970> so<00:04:25.650> he'll<00:04:26.650> go<00:04:26.860> ahead<00:04:27.040> and<00:04:27.280> do<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.430> so
