in the air and let go of this stick and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.810 
in the air and let go of this stick and
just<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:56.610> way<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.820> drifts<00:00:58.820> drifting

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
just see which way it drifts drifting

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.660 
just see which way it drifts drifting
back<00:01:00.510> whichever<00:01:01.289> way<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.680> drifting<00:01:01.949> that's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
back whichever way it's drifting that's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
back whichever way it's drifting that's
the<00:01:02.879> legs<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.480> want<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:03.989> pieces<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the legs that you want to put pieces of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.390 
the legs that you want to put pieces of
paper<00:01:05.129> underneath<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:06.119> level<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:07.400> start

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
paper underneath to level it out start

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.750 
paper underneath to level it out start
with<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.390> two<00:01:10.220> it's<00:01:11.220> also<00:01:11.310> important

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
with just one or two it's also important

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.160 
with just one or two it's also important
you<00:01:11.850> put<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> same<00:01:12.390> places<00:01:12.689> where<00:01:13.049> you

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
you put in the same places where you

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.380 
you put in the same places where you
calibrated<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> before<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.850> same

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
calibrated it before do the same

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.800 
calibrated it before do the same
calibration<00:01:16.110> procedure<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.630> do<00:01:18.630> another

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
calibration procedure and do another

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
calibration procedure and do another
test<00:01:19.110> flight

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.889 

okay<00:01:25.030> it<00:01:25.119> looks<00:01:25.149> like<00:01:25.299> it's<00:01:25.509> still<00:01:25.630> drifting

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
okay it looks like it's still drifting

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.630 
okay it looks like it's still drifting
drifting<00:01:26.289> backwards<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.250> now<00:01:27.340> we're<00:01:27.460> going<00:01:27.549> to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
drifting backwards so now we're going to

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.789 
drifting backwards so now we're going to
put<00:01:27.820> some<00:01:28.659> business<00:01:28.990> cards<00:01:29.289> under<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.590> back

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
put some business cards under the back

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.340 
put some business cards under the back
there's<00:01:30.549> also<00:01:30.820> going<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.299> left<00:01:31.840> so<00:01:32.229> we're

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
there's also going to the left so we're

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.120 
there's also going to the left so we're
going<00:01:32.439> to<00:01:32.530> put<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.979> piece<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:34.000> paper<00:01:34.829> under<00:01:35.829> the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
going to put a piece of paper under the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.960 
going to put a piece of paper under the
back<00:01:36.340> left<00:01:36.759> leg<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.479> calibrate<00:01:38.140> again<00:01:41.970> now

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
back left leg and calibrate again now

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.279 
back left leg and calibrate again now
it's<00:01:43.149> getting<00:01:43.390> pretty<00:01:43.600> good<00:01:43.689> I<00:01:43.869> think<00:01:44.170> I'm

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
it's getting pretty good I think I'm

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.770 
it's getting pretty good I think I'm
happy<00:01:44.619> with<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.799> performance<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.399> this<00:01:45.659> if<00:01:46.659> I

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
happy with the performance of this if I

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.069 
happy with the performance of this if I
need<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:48.729> still<00:01:48.969> use<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.420> radio<00:01:49.719> to<00:01:49.780> put

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
need to I can still use the radio to put

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.510 
need to I can still use the radio to put
a<00:01:50.110> little<00:01:50.259> bit<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.619> trim<00:01:50.890> into<00:01:51.069> it<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:51.369> it's

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
a little bit of the trim into it so it's

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.160 
a little bit of the trim into it so it's
drifting<00:01:51.670> backwards<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.390> can<00:01:52.539> press<00:01:52.780> this<00:01:55.170> few

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
drifting backwards I can press this few

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.160 
drifting backwards I can press this few
times<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:56.649> take<00:01:56.799> care<00:01:56.979> of<00:01:57.099> it<00:01:57.189> that<00:01:57.220> way<00:01:57.520> oh

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:16.530 

yeah<00:02:02.170> perfect

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.599
