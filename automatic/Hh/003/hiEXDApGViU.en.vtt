 so I take a little bit of fat 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.939
 duck very little because anyway 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.860

 add a little carrot celery 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.870
 to perfume would pass secret time 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.370
 gasquet did not give a perfect name to 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:42.010
 keller and bubbling cosa bella 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:44.440
 leather so little ham orman I am very 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.060
 happy and some other things 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.300
 ears 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.220
 here and their mix well rico that I have 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:57.330
 white and I 'm going to add so 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:02:00.250
 with Tarbes beans and we go wet 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.240
 with this fund that I did so with 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.149
 the feet that I cooked that you 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.860
 arrive and there I will describe everything 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.500
 gently for three quarters of an hour 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.970
 okay then marc all the ingredients 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.800
 are there now that are fed up 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.270
 process or dressage of money 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.280
 so the first tip for at 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.100
 dressage in a large saucepan 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.200
 had a thick ground for which a 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.640
 good conduction once in the oven is this 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.110
 that this cassoulet we go do not know when 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.150
 even some time forcing the past two 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.519
 hours at the founder laurent first 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.989
 hints we will rub the pan with 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.370
 a grain of garlic and anxieties and 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:39.250
 messages and I took advantage 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.500
 just now to bring back a 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.660
 little bit of confit for two things 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.549
 first that of color and then 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.810
 quit scouring and as he 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:52.030
 wants this 6th 12 then being treated are 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.290
 passionate about not being automatic one 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.820
 can everything will put castrillon can 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.650
 to be a motorcycle to see and I can put 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.660
 rowing can I can do it 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.430
 because two turns is a full of 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.110
 poverty is a complete dish in our 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.299
 campaigns we close and put it in 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.950
 we had in production 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.900
 so it's still regional it remains 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.700
 with plant production 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.300
 so here is today the channel of 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.460
 South West 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.650
 in order to sausage well-crafted colorful 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.450
 here I am going to resort with a little more 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.200
 tarbes and because it's still 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.700
 it will suffice 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.090
 so you have to have slept 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.070
 generous they earn less generous there 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.750
 we find and ears lequan in 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.910
 ears so fond because everything to 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.650
 the time we go to table it cracked 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.040
 on a plate as in a real 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.470
 pleasure 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.570
 here I am going to get wet with the 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.500
 cooking broth and rico that is 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:45.290
 rich already aromatic taste and I'm going to 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.600
 put in the oven we will leave on the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.010
 baking sweet oven what could 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.900
 call the day yesterday temperatures 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.510
 but turns out kitchen stewed on 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.700
 took the time to do everything we go the 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.500
 watch for two hours before 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.880
 to reduce one's self 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:05.660
 Florence is beautiful cassoulet on 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.490
 will even hear him he was singing then 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.260
 what is important during all this 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.640
 power time is the control and 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.930
 m 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.030
 so we say we're crusting why 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.790
 it helps to control a little bit a 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.160
 christ in bean to be sure they 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.290
 not dry too depending area 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.290
 of the season their ecot more or less 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.330
 absorbed the broth so we are brought 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.490
 maybe so dare when the control 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.890
 everything and cooking it has to be that the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.950
 ricoh be then founded in May it must not 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.870
 that he is too drunk gold the only way to 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.880
 that someone of experience like you 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.460
 will cost us inhabitants fork 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.750
 take a little bean here and then he 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.750
 just have to be based either in 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.080
 that's dragon rain are delicious
