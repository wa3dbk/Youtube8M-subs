00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.219
 let's support our team pie 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.720
 this 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.720
 yes and who brush 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.000
 With victory you Leonid Stanislavovich 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.030
 how much headache 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.650
 caused problems with the midfield this one 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.330
 the best option if the pilot 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.489
 fireman how to call him correctly 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.060
 which had to be applied but not 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.040
 fireman to play at the training camp 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.410
 many very different bundles 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.299
 players different bundles of players 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.739
 shishkina standing today was of course 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.530
 for the first time why because we have 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.660
 the actual 6 were missing and skipped 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.319
 defensive midfielders we lost but 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.769
 will believe 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.739
 a lot of them but I had a little bit 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.599
 rebuild the game but i say satisfied and 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.540
 their game why in what are they all the same 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.849
 played very tenaciously 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.370
 and the first 25 minutes 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.670
 we played immediately abundance is not it yet 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.579
 it is possible to write a bit later let's say 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.870
 sunk low sat down and allowed the opponent 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:39.150
 let's say roll us left to right 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.739
 then when the center was already completely closed 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.459
 fields 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.900
 we had my chance to realize 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.819
 does any team need now 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.459
 additional pumping additional 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.769
 a reminder of how important a segment 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.280
 the championship we are going through now or all 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.530
 and it’s as clear as pitching I don’t understand 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.239
 means required 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.409
 readiness good knowledge of knowledge 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.700
 what do you want to do 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:09.409
 and the words pumped is how to download 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.409
 wheels but not a team
