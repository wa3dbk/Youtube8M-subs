00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.919
 I explained how to name the first official 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:16.430
 Next , how to name a certain dog I would like to explain this but there is basically 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:21.090
 In the prefecture that there feeling I'm is easy to understand considering the name of the dog a watch on the base there is this 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:25.290
 Such Fu in unusual clogging double bond has been changed to the prefecture there is a feeling that is can one with 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.700
 And whether the name to the Fu specifically what will be easier to understand and to understand is attached 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:32.340
 It is said that 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:37.140
 First of all, in the case of alkanes, one carbon was named methane. 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.079
 This but I say Why is that there is nothing carbon for a matter this is one 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.519
 Because it is a methane trimmer ca area, it is not like this structure 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.269
 It is impossible to be able to do a double bond here There is a double bond that there is a right 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.070
 That's why 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:56.199
 Double bond impossible It is called double bond because there is only one hit to hydrogen 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.890
 Is basically done in the middle of carbon, so if there is another carbon, double it here 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.070
 Bonding and 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.400
 In are now Well this say wind because it always will be that it is a dog 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.820
 When there is only one carbon, there is no such thing 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.979
 Well there is no reason for the money after this 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.730
 Basically , the right and certain gold means that the number of carbons is two or more. 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.860
 So much 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:22.490
 The word ending is Ann and there is a question of how two or more names are given . 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:29.060
 The ending is a plan because there is a sense that it may become 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.590
 Because it is a dog, it is only this that 5 b turns into a garden Basically it is then 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.750
 Day it's changes 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:38.250
 If you got that, this is a 10 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.090
 Since the ending that idea of turn is not change in the ending that circle er sputum to have the body 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.630
 Change 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:50.040
 Propane blows with a propene , so pentane seems to be this basic 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.740
 The name of the dog that there is it if changing the flattery of alkane I'm a mean there is a endings to 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.450
 If the number of carbons is the same , changing the ending and making a name 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.590
 This is the basis of this and it is very important, but it is just 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.000
 Well this 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:10.390
 Among the alkenes, two of the carbons that appear frequently are said to have prospered. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.680
 It is the name of this ethylene that is often used without using the name of the picture exhibition so much 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:19.610
 Or three carbons I say this like propene, but this is not used too much 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:24.230
 The name propylene is often used and these are what they say 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:29.480
 It does not mean that in a still customary names do You're especially rules for 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:34.340
 It is said that such names are used as idiomatic names and that one is used more often 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.610
 You will need to remember this usage for these two things, but 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.600
 Do it by changing the flatter it is basically in this kind of wind except for the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:45.540
 I know a certain prefecture name 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:49.680
 To you in it the name of the dog is not been found I further this is this will that 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:54.660
 If it is not made in a gold double bond is a triple bond 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:59.040
 It will be a certain amount of money , but the name of some of the money will be exactly the same. 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.590
 It is the members, not in the Garden is now because I'm walking the endings to 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.300
 5 seconds 9 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:09.640
 It means that I dare to do it, so basically that's fine, but there is already some money 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.870
 Also is the only little thing this carbon is of two other words hydrogen to appear I am in high school chemistry 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.760
 Two seeds 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.980
 It's about this , so I can say it like a chin 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.480
 But it changed to the hospital after the earlier of honor 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.849
 I can say it like Echin, but there is also a common name for this. 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.040
 In such Fu called the Holy Land communicates 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:34.510
 There is a common name so this is a common name, so it is usually called like this one year of sweat 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.140
 This also needs to be remembered. This carbon two sheets h for walking 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.970
 sweets 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.660
 It is sheets h 2 For information on this walk 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.710
 Not just fine if you remember this that there is such common name called acetylene 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.070
 This is more than this alkane alkene alkyne Well this cutting tree is it? 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:53.150
 Click here for it will say get the Fu say a name 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:57.110
 There is in it is another one one it is why there was also this dry That Hoop 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.960
 Such things but in is cycloalkane Toka cycloalkene at the end of the case went so 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.110
 What is your name 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.080
 Propane There is, for example, and say Tsukunda 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.520
 If you think about this 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:11.750
 Although c is 3 h 8 If this is the crime lab 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:17.870
 The number of hydrogen decreased by two when it was possible to ring 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:21.140
 The number of hydrogen decreases by two and it becomes an aquatic product like c 3 h 6 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.970
 What kind of name is attached and this is cyclo 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:28.490
 Proppant 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:33.380
 Or name, in this kind of Fu Fu say there is in other words this is also after all this here Tsukuwake 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:35.630
 It's based on propane, so it's based on propane. 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.840
 I always wear the black was to say to black 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.960
 Well it is in this kind of Fu and propane It is not get the name 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:47.310
 And if that dog is forensic, it's a cycloalkene 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:52.130
 I mean it comes to I mean becomes the four in two Ette hydrogen hydrogen if this 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.130
 This is also cyclopropento 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.790
 Healing the Fu like this I is not good to say the wind that black propylene in the Fu say 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:04.010
 It means that you will get a name 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:09.740
 Is in this kind of wind it is in the head when you are accustomed that is, if the Hoop to forensics in the fact that 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:12.420
 If it should be done like black , there will be cyclo and there as this ordinary cutting tree base 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.480
 It means that you will be given a name. 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.480
