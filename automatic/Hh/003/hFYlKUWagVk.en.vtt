00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
and the waist is hanging in at 48.5 I

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.720 
and the waist is hanging in at 48.5 I
really<00:02:24.630> think<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.960> no<00:02:25.830> he<00:02:25.980> was<00:02:26.100> measuring<00:02:26.460> he

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
really think that no he was measuring he

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.220 
really think that no he was measuring he
had<00:02:26.880> something<00:02:27.120> different<00:02:27.630> then<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.020> time

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
had something different then this time

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.610 
had something different then this time
yet<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.650> um<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.490> think<00:02:30.120> from<00:02:30.480> GNC<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.260> really

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
yet it um I think from GNC I really

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.560 
yet it um I think from GNC I really
think<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.190> probably<00:02:32.300> would<00:02:33.300> have<00:02:33.330> made<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
think that it probably would have made a

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.730 
think that it probably would have made a
difference<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:34.170> don't<00:02:34.440> think<00:02:34.590> they<00:02:34.680> were

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
difference I don't think they were

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.370 
difference I don't think they were
completely<00:02:35.250> accurate<00:02:35.550> sup<00:02:36.080> anyway<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.320> a

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
completely accurate sup anyway it's a

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.250 
completely accurate sup anyway it's a
total<00:02:37.680> interest<00:02:38.220> lost<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.760> 11<00:02:39.120> point<00:02:39.330> 25<00:02:39.840> so

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
total interest lost of 11 point 25 so

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.950 
total interest lost of 11 point 25 so

knew I man apparently weight off because

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.750 
knew I man apparently weight off because
I<00:02:46.290> didn't<00:02:46.500> think<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.860> was<00:02:47.010> even<00:02:47.220> down<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.460> 3

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
I didn't think that I was even down to 3

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.670 
I didn't think that I was even down to 3
20<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.390> when<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.630> got<00:02:48.780> on<00:02:48.810> his<00:02:49.050> scale<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.320> was<00:02:49.530> like

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
20 so when I got on his scale I was like

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.030 
20 so when I got on his scale I was like

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
what I just recently bought a new scale

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.610 
what I just recently bought a new scale
