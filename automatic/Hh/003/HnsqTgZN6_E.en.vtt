two<00:04:54.290> thousand<00:04:54.710> right<00:04:55.419> when<00:04:56.419> i<00:04:56.450> applied<00:04:56.810> for

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
two thousand right when i applied for

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.880 
two thousand right when i applied for
uni<00:04:57.200> and<00:04:58.240> I've<00:04:59.240> always<00:04:59.480> thought<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.110> it's<00:05:00.620> so

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
uni and I've always thought that it's so

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.940 
uni and I've always thought that it's so
unattainable<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.600> difficult<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.290> program<00:05:03.530> for

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
unattainable so difficult to program for

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.080 
unattainable so difficult to program for
example<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:04.970> I<00:05:05.000> never<00:05:05.120> even<00:05:05.510> tried<00:05:06.880> but<00:05:07.880> it<00:05:08.060> was

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
example so I never even tried but it was

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.920 
example so I never even tried but it was
encouraged<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.460> right<00:05:10.460> away<00:05:10.700> when<00:05:10.970> I<00:05:11.000> got<00:05:11.720> to

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
encouraged to right away when I got to

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.960 
encouraged to right away when I got to
university<00:05:12.710> and<00:05:12.890> into<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.310> games<00:05:13.490> Parliament

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
university and into the games Parliament

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.250 
university and into the games Parliament
was<00:05:14.740> heaven<00:05:15.820> yeah<00:05:16.820> so<00:05:17.510> what<00:05:17.720> do<00:05:17.810> you<00:05:17.930> program

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
was heaven yeah so what do you program

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.200 
was heaven yeah so what do you program
in<00:05:18.710> uh<00:05:20.200> well<00:05:21.200> everything<00:05:21.890> we've<00:05:22.820> been<00:05:23.000> using

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
in uh well everything we've been using

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.800 
in uh well everything we've been using
unity<00:05:23.720> Allah<00:05:24.080> make<00:05:25.070> five<00:05:25.490> projects<00:05:26.030> no

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.580 

stopping<00:05:29.919> straight<00:05:30.919> up<00:05:30.950> sequence<00:05:31.400> was<00:05:32.590> flash

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
stopping straight up sequence was flash

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.290 
stopping straight up sequence was flash
so<00:05:34.040> everything<00:05:35.290> what<00:05:36.290> would<00:05:36.440> you<00:05:36.560> say<00:05:36.800> to

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
so everything what would you say to

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.110 
so everything what would you say to
people<00:05:38.300> that<00:05:39.280> awesome<00:05:40.280> that<00:05:40.640> were<00:05:40.790> in<00:05:41.000> the

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
people that awesome that were in the

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.940 
people that awesome that were in the
same<00:05:41.300> place<00:05:41.450> that<00:05:41.810> you<00:05:42.050> were<00:05:42.140> in<00:05:42.320> that<00:05:42.620> feel

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
same place that you were in that feel

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.020 
same place that you were in that feel
like<00:05:44.020> it<00:05:45.160> programming<00:05:46.160> is<00:05:46.220> this<00:05:46.430> huge<00:05:46.580> barrier

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
like it programming is this huge barrier

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.460 
like it programming is this huge barrier
to<00:05:47.240> entry<00:05:47.270> into<00:05:48.080> gaming<00:05:48.700> well<00:05:49.700> um<00:05:50.300> start<00:05:51.140> with

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
to entry into gaming well um start with

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.140 
to entry into gaming well um start with
like<00:05:51.860> an<00:05:52.130> idea<00:05:52.430> of<00:05:52.520> what<00:05:52.729> you<00:05:52.880> want<00:05:52.910> to

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
like an idea of what you want to

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.200 
like an idea of what you want to
accomplish<00:05:53.919> normally<00:05:54.919> when<00:05:55.210> programmers

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
accomplish normally when programmers

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.150 
accomplish normally when programmers
teach<00:05:57.169> people<00:05:58.100> they<00:05:58.640> focus<00:05:59.300> on<00:05:59.890> semantics<00:06:00.890> and

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
teach people they focus on semantics and

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.090 
teach people they focus on semantics and
getting<00:06:01.760> stuff<00:06:02.000> right<00:06:02.800> starting<00:06:03.800> from<00:06:03.830> the

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
getting stuff right starting from the

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.740 
getting stuff right starting from the
beginning<00:06:04.220> but<00:06:04.700> nobody<00:06:05.060> knows<00:06:05.300> where<00:06:05.660> the

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
beginning but nobody knows where the

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.020 
beginning but nobody knows where the
beginning<00:06:06.050> is<00:06:06.320> I<00:06:06.560> would<00:06:07.190> say<00:06:07.430> start<00:06:07.490> with<00:06:08.000> e

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
beginning is I would say start with e

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.719 
beginning is I would say start with e
with<00:06:08.690> the<00:06:08.810> envision<00:06:09.260> of<00:06:09.380> a<00:06:09.500> finished<00:06:09.860> game<00:06:10.130> and

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
with the envision of a finished game and

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.219 
with the envision of a finished game and
make<00:06:10.910> it<00:06:11.030> as<00:06:11.150> small<00:06:11.330> as<00:06:11.539> possible<00:06:11.720> and<00:06:12.140> just

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
make it as small as possible and just

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.500 
make it as small as possible and just
start<00:06:12.590> hacking

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
start hacking

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.130 
start hacking
and<00:06:14.050> don't<00:06:14.530> care<00:06:14.830> about<00:06:15.070> the<00:06:15.910> quality<00:06:16.630> of<00:06:16.930> the

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
and don't care about the quality of the

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.500 
and don't care about the quality of the
code<00:06:17.550> care<00:06:18.550> about<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:18.880> quality<00:06:18.970> of<00:06:19.270> the

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
code care about the quality of the

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.950 
code care about the quality of the
finished<00:06:19.810> project<00:06:20.820> and<00:06:21.820> that's<00:06:22.540> our<00:06:22.750> time

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
finished project and that's our time

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.680 
finished project and that's our time
yeah<00:06:23.590> what's<00:06:24.070> an<00:06:24.190> example<00:06:24.310> of<00:06:24.790> a<00:06:24.910> small<00:06:25.330> game

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
yeah what's an example of a small game

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.740 
yeah what's an example of a small game
when<00:06:26.500> you<00:06:26.620> say<00:06:26.800> that<00:06:27.010> okay<00:06:27.550> it<00:06:28.090> isn't<00:06:28.540> hell

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
when you say that okay it isn't hell

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.600 
when you say that okay it isn't hell
they<00:06:29.140> have<00:06:29.320> a<00:06:29.350> world<00:06:29.650> equivalent<00:06:30.250> for<00:06:30.460> game

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
they have a world equivalent for game

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.480 
they have a world equivalent for game
programmers<00:06:31.270> isn't<00:06:32.110> it<00:06:32.230> just<00:06:32.950> a<00:06:33.130> space

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
programmers isn't it just a space

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.200 
programmers isn't it just a space
shooter<00:06:33.790> to<00:06:34.570> the<00:06:34.600> space<00:06:34.900> shooter<00:06:36.090> where<00:06:37.090> you

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
shooter to the space shooter where you

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.940 
shooter to the space shooter where you
just<00:06:37.420> put<00:06:37.630> it<00:06:37.750> put<00:06:37.960> a<00:06:38.020> plane<00:06:38.320> on<00:06:38.350> the<00:06:38.560> left<00:06:38.740> side

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
just put it put a plane on the left side

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.560 
just put it put a plane on the left side
and<00:06:39.250> go<00:06:39.340> up<00:06:39.490> and<00:06:39.640> down<00:06:39.760> the<00:06:39.970> shift<00:06:40.180> that<00:06:40.390> is

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
and go up and down the shift that is

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.980 
and go up and down the shift that is
from<00:06:40.780> the<00:06:40.900> right<00:06:41.400> and<00:06:42.400> it<00:06:43.270> right<00:06:43.570> from<00:06:43.720> there

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
from the right and it right from there

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.530 
from the right and it right from there
basically<00:06:44.860> I'm<00:06:45.070> you<00:06:45.430> can<00:06:45.580> start<00:06:45.820> in<00:06:46.060> something

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
basically I'm you can start in something

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.060 
basically I'm you can start in something
like<00:06:46.660> Game<00:06:46.870> Maker<00:06:47.580> it's<00:06:48.580> perfect<00:06:49.270> to<00:06:49.770> to<00:06:50.770> get

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
like Game Maker it's perfect to to get

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.130 
like Game Maker it's perfect to to get
you<00:06:51.190> into<00:06:51.400> it<00:06:51.820> and<00:06:51.970> then<00:06:52.360> you<00:06:52.480> can<00:06:52.660> sort<00:06:53.020> of

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
you into it and then you can sort of

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.600 
you into it and then you can sort of
branch<00:06:53.410> out<00:06:53.650> I<00:06:54.720> have<00:06:55.720> one<00:06:55.930> tip<00:06:56.140> for<00:06:56.170> you<00:06:56.610> or
