industry that the only way you get into

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.340 
industry that the only way you get into
owning<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.309> farm<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.910> marry<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.780> or<00:01:03.930> inherit

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350

owning a farm is to marry it or inherit
it<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.519> I've<00:01:05.519> taken<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> third<00:01:06.150> route<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
it and I've taken the third route and

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.020 
it and I've taken the third route and
built<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.350> myself<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.979> purchased<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.760> small
