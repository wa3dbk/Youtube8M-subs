00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.030
 Hello everyone , I have a non-working 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.320
 they are vino dex 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.180
 I have long been lying on the shelf 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.630
 would not repair because 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.220
 there was a problem with a laser and then another 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.680
 and on food that from the economic point 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 view simply does not make sense to repair 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.280
 well, plus I don’t see i don’t use 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.649
 already two or three years now I want to 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.980
 show one such small nuance 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.870
 it happens that if you fail you do not see 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.320
 the cat is not necessarily even there immediately 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.090
 The problem with the laser is that 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.620
 problem on the power supply here if 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.170
 problem somewhere 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.989
 more serious once there already meaning 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.280
 omen repair but are often 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.619
 so the problem is exactly there one or two 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.040
 capacitor swap power supplies all 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:16.520
 go see to 5 works and here we see 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.409
 swollen two capacitors 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:28.680
 one has already changed under warranty and again 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:33.659
 again with him the same thing 2 2 flowed 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.409
 from below it is also necessary to change the wise men 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.780
 right now I'll change them then the voltage will be 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.909
 ok that is and here now on this 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.570
 the moment is pulsating 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.950
 more less 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.950
 unstable business 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.050
 Now we connect the divine wardrobe to the network 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.160
 power supply work 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.110
 Well, here we can say the following 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.830
 if the problem surprised the LCD with the unit 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.980
 Power supply is not difficult 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.120
 change a couple of capacitors there 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.110
 often this is the problem 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.660
 But if the problem is not with the power supply 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.920
 with a laser or driver or something else 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.310
 others there will often already need 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.600
 knowledge specifically for repair well and 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.910
 funds i.e. financial costs and 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.910
 given the fact that now the divine buckle 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.610
 fade into the background here cream with this 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.680
 there is no sense to do 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:50.390
 thousand same problem in the power supply in 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.180
 principle often repairs end 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.770
 replacing them with just a couple 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.840
 capacitors did not see to have been 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.970
 Once upon a time in the repair of this one 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.650
 the capacitor was replaced it is under warranty 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.090
 people passed the 3 st repair is over 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.440
 replacing a single capacitor 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.959
 Now, by the way, I had to change it again. 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.880
 In principle, rice and do not see Cooney 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.030
 repair the power supply itself 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.470
 can use anything else without 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.140
 I will then find an application I will make a video about 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.360
 about this, in principle , that's all 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.360
 Thank you for your attention and see you soon
