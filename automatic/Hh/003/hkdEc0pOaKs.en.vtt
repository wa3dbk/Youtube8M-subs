00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
going to be replacing the spark plug and

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.480 
going to be replacing the spark plug and
I've<00:00:22.020> heard<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.380> people<00:00:22.560> are<00:00:23.010> having<00:00:23.310> issues

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
other end on the engine side so I'm

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.110 
other end on the engine side so I'm
making<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.570> little<00:00:30.810> video<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:32.759> first<00:00:32.969> thing

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and four at the other end so I used a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.970 
and four at the other end so I used a
number<00:00:58.530> seven<00:00:58.739> millimeter<00:01:00.380> socket<00:01:01.380> with<00:01:01.680> an

extension

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.660 
extension
and<00:01:03.680> I'm<00:01:04.680> actually<00:01:05.070> removing<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.259> now<00:01:07.670> there's

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
and I'm actually removing it now there's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.590 
and I'm actually removing it now there's
a<00:01:09.829> ground<00:01:10.829> there<00:01:12.649> ground<00:01:13.649> terminal<00:01:14.069> that<00:01:14.189> you

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
a ground there ground terminal that you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.770 
a ground there ground terminal that you
should<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.780> forget<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.380> reinstall<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:20.780> there

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
should not forget to reinstall and there

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:39.470 
should not forget to reinstall and there
is<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.380> last<00:01:22.679> bolt

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.030 

so<00:01:40.480> once<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.870> get<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.200> distributor<00:01:41.470> out<00:01:41.890> of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
so once you get the distributor out of

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:51.840 
so once you get the distributor out of
the<00:01:42.100> way<00:01:43.410> there<00:01:44.410> is<00:01:44.530> no<00:01:44.710> taxes

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.800 

there's<00:01:52.850> no<00:01:53.060> there's<00:01:53.660> no<00:01:53.870> access<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:56.690> the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
there's no there's no access to the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.590 
there's no there's no access to the
spark<00:01:57.140> plug<00:01:57.410> wire<00:01:57.830> underneath<00:01:58.730> right<00:01:58.970> here<00:01:59.030> I

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
spark plug wire underneath right here I

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.020 
spark plug wire underneath right here I
don't<00:01:59.930> have<00:02:00.290> a<00:02:00.410> flashlight<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.550> hope<00:02:01.820> you

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
don't have a flashlight and I hope you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.060 
don't have a flashlight and I hope you

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
could just see it so I'm going to pull

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.240 
could just see it so I'm going to pull
the<00:02:04.220> wire<00:02:04.370> out<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:08.649> just<00:02:09.649> pulled<00:02:09.860> out<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:09.979> wire

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
the wire out I just pulled out the wire

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:19.610 
the wire out I just pulled out the wire
and<00:02:10.930> I<00:02:11.930> have<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:13.700> little

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.830 

spark<00:02:20.620> plug<00:02:20.830> an<00:02:21.460> extension<00:02:22.300> maybe<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.660> two

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
spark plug an extension maybe a two

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.240 
spark plug an extension maybe a two
three<00:02:23.110> inch<00:02:23.320> extension<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.860> device

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
three inch extension and this device

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.780 
three inch extension and this device
right<00:02:27.460> here<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.910> forgot<00:02:28.420> what<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:28.840> called<00:02:28.900> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
right here I forgot what it's called and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
right here I forgot what it's called and
then<00:02:30.790> you're<00:02:30.970> gonna<00:02:31.090> need<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.480> longer

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
then you're gonna need a longer

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.920 
then you're gonna need a longer
extension<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:37.030> pull<00:02:37.240> out<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.480> spark<00:02:37.750> plug

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.610 
extension to pull out the spark plug
because<00:02:38.200> if<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:38.920> only<00:02:39.130> use<00:02:39.460> this<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:41.380> guys

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
because if you only use this to guys

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.770 
because if you only use this to guys
this<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:41.980> going<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.220> hit<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:44.190> impact<00:02:45.190> II<00:02:45.780> and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
this is going to hit the impact II and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.260 
this is going to hit the impact II and
you<00:02:46.930> won't<00:02:47.110> be<00:02:47.200> able<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.440> turn<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.770> so<00:02:48.270> with

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
you won't be able to turn it so with

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:57.570 
you won't be able to turn it so with
this<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.930> pre<00:02:50.530> loosened<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.070> spark<00:02:51.370> plug<00:02:56.580> so

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
this I pre loosened the spark plug so

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.820 
this I pre loosened the spark plug so
all<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.790> need<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.150> do<00:02:58.300> so<00:02:58.690> it<00:02:58.960> works<00:02:59.260> like<00:02:59.350> this

loosing it up I'm gonna pick up the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.580 
loosing it up I'm gonna pick up the
spark<00:03:10.360> plug<00:03:11.760> right<00:03:12.760> here<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.690> there's<00:03:14.470> the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
spark plug right here so there's the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.970 
spark plug right here so there's the
spark<00:03:14.860> plug<00:03:15.040> now<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.430> little<00:03:16.210> tip<00:03:16.860> when<00:03:17.860> you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
spark plug now a little tip when you

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.630 
spark plug now a little tip when you
reinstall<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.610> spark<00:03:18.880> plug

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
reinstall the spark plug

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.080 
reinstall the spark plug
it's<00:03:21.390> gonna<00:03:21.570> get<00:03:21.780> stuck<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.980> can<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.460> hard

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
it's gonna get stuck and can be a hard

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.220 
it's gonna get stuck and can be a hard
to<00:03:24.240> pull<00:03:24.450> out<00:03:24.620> because<00:03:25.620> there's<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.280> rubber

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
to pull out because there's a rubber

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.770 
to pull out because there's a rubber
grommet<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.410> there<00:03:28.680> what<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.700> did<00:03:30.090> was<00:03:30.480> to

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
grommet in there what I did was to

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.270 
grommet in there what I did was to
install<00:03:31.110> reinstall<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:31.830> spark<00:03:32.040> plug

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
install reinstall the spark plug

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.930 
install reinstall the spark plug
properly<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:32.940> remove<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.990> grommet

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940

I<00:03:38.730> remove<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.910> grommet<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:45.990> drop<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.110> spark

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
I remove the grommet and drop the spark

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.340 
I remove the grommet and drop the spark
plug<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:48.130> it's<00:03:48.610> easy<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.090> put<00:03:49.330> out<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:50.020> pull<00:03:50.200> it

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
pulling out this spark plug socket after

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.870 
pulling out this spark plug socket after
you<00:03:58.780> install<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.260> spark<00:03:59.650> plug<00:03:59.890> so<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.190> just

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
you install the spark plug so I just

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.500 
you install the spark plug so I just
pulled<00:04:01.150> out<00:04:01.240> grommet<00:04:01.710> okay<00:04:02.710> so<00:04:03.210> that's<00:04:04.210> how<00:04:04.360> it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
pulled out grommet okay so that's how it

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.830 
pulled out grommet okay so that's how it
is<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.830> I'm<00:04:06.730> going<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:06.910> be<00:04:07.030> installing<00:04:07.420> spark

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
is and I'm going to be installing spark

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.160 
is and I'm going to be installing spark
plug

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
plug

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.840 
plug
removing<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:08.800> spark<00:04:09.010> plug<00:04:09.280> on<00:04:09.460> the<00:04:09.580> front

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
removing the spark plug on the front

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:19.160 
removing the spark plug on the front
bank<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:11.590> remove<00:04:11.890> these<00:04:12.070> three<00:04:12.310> guys<00:04:12.520> here

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:26.840 

this<00:04:20.170> is<00:04:20.290> also<00:04:20.650> number<00:04:20.830> seven

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:55.039 

number<00:04:27.850> seven

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:55.049 

00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:58.579 

and<00:04:56.049> you<00:04:56.979> have<00:04:57.129> to<00:04:57.249> remove<00:04:57.399> these<00:04:57.639> guys<00:04:57.879> and

and you have to remove these guys and

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:02.509 
and you have to remove these guys and
then<00:04:59.589> the<00:05:00.039> spark<00:05:00.309> plug<00:05:00.519> wires<00:05:01.019> are<00:05:02.019> underneath

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:02.519 
then the spark plug wires are underneath

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.979 
then the spark plug wires are underneath
so<00:05:03.519> you<00:05:03.579> can<00:05:03.819> access<00:05:04.029> the<00:05:04.299> spark<00:05:04.539> plug<00:05:04.749> through

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:04.989 
so you can access the spark plug through

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:49.779 
so you can access the spark plug through
that<00:05:05.169> way<00:05:05.379> too

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
okay we're accessing the first bank

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.570 
okay we're accessing the first bank
there<00:05:54.960> you<00:05:55.110> go
