convergence can prune this is one of the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.030 
convergence can prune this is one of the
more<00:03:08.490> difficult<00:03:08.900> pruning<00:03:09.920> because<00:03:10.920> it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
more difficult pruning because it

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.240 
more difficult pruning because it
involves<00:03:11.780> pensando<00:03:12.780> right<00:03:13.170> we<00:03:13.740> got<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.010> think

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
involves pensando right we got to think

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.070 
involves pensando right we got to think
with<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:14.550> stuff<00:03:14.760> here<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.510> not<00:03:15.690> like<00:03:15.930> the
