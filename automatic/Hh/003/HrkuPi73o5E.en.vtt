watch let's take a look just at the

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.759 
watch let's take a look just at the
design<00:00:37.030> in<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.239> very<00:00:37.449> beginning<00:00:37.600> okay<00:00:38.199> the

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
design in the very beginning okay the

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:40.560 
design in the very beginning okay the
one<00:00:38.949> thing<00:00:39.129> I<00:00:39.220> do<00:00:39.280> want<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:39.850> show<00:00:40.120> you<00:00:40.180> from<00:00:40.449> the

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
one thing I do want to show you from the

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.930 
one thing I do want to show you from the
very<00:00:40.780> beginning<00:00:41.260> is<00:00:41.379> that<00:00:41.410> beautiful<00:00:42.159> blue

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
very beginning is that beautiful blue

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.469 
very beginning is that beautiful blue
dial<00:00:43.510> if<00:00:44.199> you<00:00:44.440> ask<00:00:44.620> me<00:00:44.920> it's<00:00:45.129> probably<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.699> the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
dial if you ask me it's probably the the

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.719 
dial if you ask me it's probably the the
major<00:00:46.720> reason<00:00:47.290> why<00:00:47.409> I<00:00:47.440> believe<00:00:47.769> this<00:00:48.309> watch

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:48.729 
major reason why I believe this watch

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:50.430 
major reason why I believe this watch
sells<00:00:49.180> a<00:00:49.360> little<00:00:49.720> better<00:00:49.960> than<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.260> black

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
sells a little better than the black

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.670 
sells a little better than the black
variations<00:00:51.339> because<00:00:51.519> of<00:00:51.940> this<00:00:52.150> dial<00:00:52.629> and<00:00:53.559> you

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
variations because of this dial and you

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.700 
variations because of this dial and you
notice<00:00:54.040> that<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.729> bezel<00:00:55.210> that<00:00:55.239> they<00:00:55.449> use<00:00:55.780> the

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
notice that the bezel that they use the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.759 
notice that the bezel that they use the
color<00:00:57.040> of<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.489> really<00:00:58.089> allows<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.320> watch<00:00:59.559> to

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
color of it really allows the watch to

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.469 
color of it really allows the watch to
look<00:00:59.920> a<00:00:59.949> little<00:01:00.220> bigger<00:01:00.640> than<00:01:00.879> it<00:01:01.000> actually

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
look a little bigger than it actually

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.210 
look a little bigger than it actually

day indication along with date now these
three<00:01:25.390> are<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.659> core<00:01:26.049> functionalities<00:01:27.039> of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
three are the core functionalities of

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.300 
three are the core functionalities of
this<00:01:27.820> watch<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.840> just<00:01:29.439> so<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.649> know<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:30.039> four

six nine caliber

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.609 
six nine caliber
now<00:01:32.799> this<00:01:33.039> has<00:01:33.189> been<00:01:33.219> a<00:01:33.549> whore<00:01:34.380> movement<00:01:35.380> for

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
now this has been a whore movement for

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.120 
now this has been a whore movement for
Orion<00:01:36.100> they<00:01:36.640> produce<00:01:36.909> over<00:01:37.359> 100<00:01:37.979> million<00:01:38.979> of

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
Orion they produce over 100 million of

Orion they produce over 100 million of
these<00:01:39.310> movements<00:01:39.640> so<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.149> can<00:01:40.390> imagine<00:01:40.719> and

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
these movements so you can imagine and

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.789 
these movements so you can imagine and
after<00:01:42.479> 63<00:01:43.479> years<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.960> can<00:01:44.079> imagine<00:01:44.619> they<00:01:44.770> got

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
after 63 years you can imagine they got

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.739 
after 63 years you can imagine they got
pretty<00:01:45.340> good<00:01:45.429> at<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:46.030> which<00:01:46.210> is<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.509> reason

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:46.749 
pretty good at it which is the reason

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.499 
pretty good at it which is the reason
why<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.619> lot<00:01:47.829> of<00:01:48.100> people<00:01:48.249> say<00:01:48.670> online<00:01:48.820> that<00:01:49.329> it's

why a lot of people say online that it's

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.880 
why a lot of people say online that it's
just<00:01:49.719> one<00:01:49.899> of<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.049> most<00:01:50.200> accurate<00:01:50.469> watches

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
just one of the most accurate watches

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.450 
just one of the most accurate watches
out<00:01:51.159> of<00:01:51.249> the<00:01:51.340> box<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:53.140> let's<00:01:53.530> go<00:01:53.679> back<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.340> the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
out of the box now let's go back to the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.130 
out of the box now let's go back to the
watch<00:01:54.670> components<00:01:55.359> and<00:01:55.509> let's<00:01:55.719> take<00:01:55.869> a<00:01:55.899> look

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
watch components and let's take a look

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.010 
watch components and let's take a look
at<00:01:56.259> each<00:01:56.530> little<00:01:57.130> part<00:01:57.579> now<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.240> crown<00:01:58.749> is<00:01:58.990> a

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
at each little part now the crown is a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.399 
at each little part now the crown is a
screw<00:01:59.469> down

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
screw down

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.410 
screw down
and<00:02:00.560> if<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.340> look<00:02:01.520> around<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.969> 2<00:02:02.149> o'clock

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
and if you look around the 2 o'clock

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.569 
and if you look around the 2 o'clock
position<00:02:02.539> there's<00:02:03.289> also<00:02:03.560> another<00:02:03.920> screw<00:02:04.369> down

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
position there's also another screw down

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.359 
position there's also another screw down
what<00:02:05.390> looks<00:02:05.689> like<00:02:05.780> crown<00:02:06.320> what<00:02:06.619> what<00:02:07.070> it<00:02:07.189> is

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
what looks like crown what what it is

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.839 
what looks like crown what what it is
it's<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:08.000> knob<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:09.289> that<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.590> can<00:02:09.769> pivot<00:02:10.130> the

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
it's a knob so that you can pivot the

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.740 
it's a knob so that you can pivot the
day<00:02:11.269> wheel<00:02:11.690> okay<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.180> case<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.599> you're
