orientation<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.280> want<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.490> set<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> portrait

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the wallpaper behavior you can pretty

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.710 
the wallpaper behavior you can pretty
much<00:01:47.310> leave<00:01:47.399> alone<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.060> i<00:01:48.119> suggest<00:01:48.329> just

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
much leave alone but i suggest just

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.480 
much leave alone but i suggest just
turning<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.140> static<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> again

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
turning it to static and again

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.069 
turning it to static and again
background<00:01:50.970> gradient<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.689> leave<00:01:51.840> that

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
background gradient just to leave that

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.679

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
disabled next thing is the workspace

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.590 
disabled next thing is the workspace
option<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.790> want<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.000> make<00:01:57.090> launch<00:01:57.329> bar

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
the number of screens to one I think the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.130 
the number of screens to one I think the
default<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.129> to<00:02:30.480> leave<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.629> default<00:02:31.959> screen

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
default is to leave the default screen

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.869 
default is to leave the default screen
is<00:02:32.349> number<00:02:32.560> one<00:02:32.739> you<00:02:33.129> then<00:02:33.310> want<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.519> extend

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
is number one you then want to extend

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.270 
is number one you then want to extend
both<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.329> these<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> maximum<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:36.040> does

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
both of these to the maximum this does

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.710 
both of these to the maximum this does
change<00:02:36.310> slightly<00:02:36.849> depending<00:02:37.120> on<00:02:37.329> your<00:02:37.420> device

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
change slightly depending on your device

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.569 
change slightly depending on your device
but<00:02:37.959> generally<00:02:38.409> it<00:02:38.530> tends<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.799> be<00:02:38.889> best<00:02:39.129> if

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
but generally it tends to be best if

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.449 
but generally it tends to be best if
you've<00:02:39.760> got<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:39.939> most<00:02:40.950> real<00:02:41.950> estate<00:02:42.189> to<00:02:42.310> work

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
you've got the most real estate to work

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.399 
you've got the most real estate to work
with<00:02:42.700> again<00:02:43.450> as<00:02:43.569> I<00:02:43.659> said<00:02:43.689> of<00:02:43.900> my<00:02:43.959> other<00:02:44.139> video

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
with again as I said of my other video

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.750 
with again as I said of my other video
about<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.829> i<00:02:44.980> recommend<00:02:45.370> doing<00:02:45.459> this<00:02:45.549> on<00:02:45.700> a

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
about this i recommend doing this on a

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.250 
about this i recommend doing this on a
tablet<00:02:46.180> because<00:02:46.329> you<00:02:46.540> do<00:02:46.689> have<00:02:46.720> more<00:02:47.019> space

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
tablet because you do have more space

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.710 
tablet because you do have more space
whereas<00:02:47.709> on<00:02:47.829> my<00:02:47.920> one<00:02:48.069> x<00:02:48.189> plus<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.389> grid<00:02:49.599> at

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
whereas on my one x plus and the grid at

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.479 
whereas on my one x plus and the grid at
the<00:02:49.780> bottom<00:02:50.049> of<00:02:50.079> applications<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:50.919> kind<00:02:51.400> of

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
the bottom of applications is kind of

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.119 
the bottom of applications is kind of
limited<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.959> gap<00:02:53.109> size<00:02:53.379> you<00:02:53.530> want<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.739> put<00:02:53.889> 24

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
limited the gap size you want to put 24

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.729 
limited the gap size you want to put 24
pixels<00:02:54.870> which<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:55.989> can<00:02:56.109> I<00:02:56.139> think<00:02:56.439> maybe<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
pixels which you can I think maybe the

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.229 
pixels which you can I think maybe the
default<00:02:57.099> and<00:02:57.310> then<00:02:57.609> you'd<00:02:57.760> want<00:02:57.909> to<00:02:57.970> go<00:02:58.030> back

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
default and then you'd want to go back

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.349 
default and then you'd want to go back
to<00:02:58.629> your<00:02:58.659> launcher<00:02:59.489> so<00:03:00.489> now<00:03:00.939> you<00:03:01.000> should<00:03:01.329> have

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
to your launcher so now you should have

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.149 
to your launcher so now you should have
a<00:03:01.720> completely<00:03:02.109> blank<00:03:02.260> launcher<00:03:02.829> and<00:03:02.980> I'm

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
a completely blank launcher and I'm

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.559 
a completely blank launcher and I'm
going<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.310> show<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.519> how<00:03:03.579> to<00:03:03.700> add<00:03:03.849> these<00:03:04.209> tiles

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
going to show you how to add these tiles

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.360 
going to show you how to add these tiles
I've<00:03:04.900> removed<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.560> top<00:03:05.739> point<00:03:05.889> I've<00:03:06.040> left<00:03:06.220> the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
I've removed the top point I've left the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.679 
I've removed the top point I've left the

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689

seeming at every single one you should

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.250 
seeming at every single one you should
get<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.609> idea<00:03:09.939> if<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.150> just<00:03:10.299> show<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.510> one<00:03:10.720> so

going to add calculator just for the
hell<00:05:59.580> of<00:05:59.610> it<00:05:59.760> so<00:06:00.570> you<00:06:00.600> drop<00:06:00.870> that<00:06:00.990> in<00:06:01.110> there<00:06:01.140> and

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
hell of it so you drop that in there and

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.530 
hell of it so you drop that in there and
then<00:06:01.770> you<00:06:01.830> want<00:06:01.980> to<00:06:02.010> hold<00:06:02.190> down<00:06:02.370> on<00:06:02.520> it<00:06:02.640> it<00:06:03.360> can

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
then you want to hold down on it it can

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.890 
then you want to hold down on it it can
figure<00:06:03.750> at<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:03.960> top<00:06:04.170> and<00:06:05.330> then<00:06:06.330> delete<00:06:06.750> the

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
figure at the top and then delete the

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.930 
figure at the top and then delete the
label<00:06:07.200> you<00:06:08.130> can<00:06:08.250> also<00:06:08.370> change<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.730> background

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
label you can also change the background

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.000 
label you can also change the background
color<00:06:09.270> however<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:10.320> background<00:06:10.680> colors<00:06:10.920> they

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
color however the background colors they

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.500 
color however the background colors they
choose<00:06:11.310> tend<00:06:11.640> to<00:06:11.700> work<00:06:11.850> quite<00:06:12.120> well<00:06:12.150> with<00:06:12.450> the

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
choose tend to work quite well with the

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.510 
choose tend to work quite well with the
colors<00:06:12.780> of<00:06:12.840> the<00:06:12.930> icons<00:06:13.320> so<00:06:13.800> I<00:06:14.040> suggest<00:06:14.400> is

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
colors of the icons so I suggest is

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.540 
colors of the icons so I suggest is
leaving<00:06:14.820> as<00:06:14.940> it<00:06:15.090> is<00:06:15.270> hit<00:06:15.540> save<00:06:15.810> and<00:06:16.490> there<00:06:17.490> you

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
leaving as it is hit save and there you

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.700 
leaving as it is hit save and there you
go<00:06:17.610> you've<00:06:17.910> got<00:06:17.940> a<00:06:18.210> nice<00:06:18.390> calculator<00:06:19.140> icon<00:06:19.470> at

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
go you've got a nice calculator icon at

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.820 
go you've got a nice calculator icon at
the<00:06:19.740> bottom<00:06:20.010> these<00:06:20.580> you<00:06:20.790> can<00:06:20.910> actually<00:06:21.830> remove

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
the bottom these you can actually remove

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.520 
the bottom these you can actually remove
and<00:06:23.130> you<00:06:23.280> can<00:06:23.400> also<00:06:23.520> resize<00:06:24.000> them<00:06:24.350> I've<00:06:25.350> only

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
and you can also resize them I've only

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.720 
and you can also resize them I've only
got<00:06:25.680> it<00:06:25.770> like<00:06:25.860> this<00:06:26.010> just<00:06:26.220> cuz<00:06:26.400> means<00:06:26.550> you<00:06:26.610> can

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 
got it like this just cuz means you can

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.220 
got it like this just cuz means you can
fit<00:06:26.940> the<00:06:27.030> maximum<00:06:27.450> amount<00:06:27.510> on<00:06:27.810> but<00:06:27.990> it<00:06:28.080> can

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
fit the maximum amount on but it can

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.630 
fit the maximum amount on but it can
look<00:06:28.380> quite<00:06:28.470> cool<00:06:28.770> if<00:06:28.890> you<00:06:28.980> have<00:06:29.130> certain<00:06:29.310> ones

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
look quite cool if you have certain ones

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.630 
look quite cool if you have certain ones
of<00:06:29.790> different<00:06:30.090> sizes<00:06:30.270> for<00:06:31.100> example<00:06:32.100> I've<00:06:32.340> just

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
of different sizes for example I've just

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.280 
of different sizes for example I've just
stretched<00:06:32.910> that<00:06:33.120> hexagon<00:06:33.450> game<00:06:33.810> down<00:06:34.050> there

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
stretched that hexagon game down there

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.810 
stretched that hexagon game down there
and<00:06:34.470> this<00:06:34.800> inmate<00:06:35.100> gives<00:06:35.310> a<00:06:35.430> little<00:06:35.520> bit<00:06:35.640> more

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
and this inmate gives a little bit more

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.950 
and this inmate gives a little bit more
variety<00:06:36.060> and<00:06:36.330> I<00:06:36.390> think<00:06:36.540> it<00:06:36.630> looks<00:06:36.660> like

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
variety and I think it looks like

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.300 
variety and I think it looks like
visually<00:06:37.320> quite<00:06:37.530> pleasing<00:06:37.800> but

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
visually quite pleasing but

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.560 
visually quite pleasing but
does<00:06:38.430> of<00:06:38.550> course<00:06:38.580> mean<00:06:38.940> you<00:06:39.090> can't<00:06:39.330> fit<00:06:39.480> as

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
does of course mean you can't fit as

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.530 
does of course mean you can't fit as
much<00:06:39.800> on<00:06:40.800> your<00:06:41.040> home<00:06:41.160> screen<00:06:41.190> and<00:06:41.790> that's
