00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
about is called the multiple bounce

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.940 
about is called the multiple bounce
stroke<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.750> involves<00:01:35.750> letting<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.680> stick

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
stroke it involves letting the stick

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.330 
stroke it involves letting the stick
achieve<00:01:37.760> a<00:01:38.060> sustained<00:01:38.750> or<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.050> long<00:01:39.260> sound<00:01:39.620> from

achieve a sustained or a long sound from
the<00:01:40.430> drum<00:01:40.640> a<00:01:42.370> great<00:01:43.370> example<00:01:43.790> that<00:01:43.820> would<00:01:44.000> be

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
the drum a great example that would be

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.530 
the drum a great example that would be
the<00:01:44.270> buzz<00:01:44.450> roll<00:01:48.280> okay<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.310> more<00:01:49.610> open<00:01:50.000> rudiment

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
the buzz roll okay a more open rudiment

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.130 
the buzz roll okay a more open rudiment
would<00:01:50.660> be<00:01:50.810> French<00:01:51.230> rolls<00:01:51.500> or<00:01:51.710> threes<00:01:55.960> which<00:01:56.960> as

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
would be French rolls or threes which as

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.170 
would be French rolls or threes which as
you<00:01:57.290> can<00:01:57.470> see<00:01:57.710> is<00:01:58.280> basically<00:01:58.640> a<00:01:58.910> combination

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
you can see is basically a combination

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.100 
you can see is basically a combination
of<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.840> legato<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.890> marcado<00:02:01.250> strokes
