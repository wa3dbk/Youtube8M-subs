00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.130
 every day people once again the 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.829
 shoe box today my other video from 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.399
 I probably wrote to me last and 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:26.329
 the one asked as well as mine 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:28.579
 control in mw2 and mw3 is and there 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.989
 I thought of it but you can 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.829
 make a video and the same 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:37.040
 Let's show it to people 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.200
 graphic here resolution 1280 x 27 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.730
 brightness is quite high with me 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.500
 See it all so far 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.170
 darkest corners expand 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.730
 graphics settings have mine 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.710
 Graphics settings a bit high 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.370
 made again because he a banner that 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.739
 sucks looked blah and all that 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.690
 times turned on aspects or web frequently 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:06.200
 I think so you can see the opponents 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:09.560
 better new sound 5.1 up so the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.370
 reader was my tax usd should he 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.690
 but so should his jump spacebar 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.770
 also be with everyone but then here 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.940
 I duck on a live cow sprint 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.520
 pause breath and nothing 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.409
 yes, this eq and the toggle that 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.720
 I think almost none of you think so 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.500
 that is why a separate start here is so 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.630
 I'm somehow best and clear 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.670
 action from blabla to land i have on 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.300
 airbags the advice on middle-range middle 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.620
 the mouse button you can see here all 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.630
 work a bit different control 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:53.860
 user phau plays the ghana the fag 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:02:00.700
 tube grad from a degree in on 4 and 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:04.270
 Blabla per mouse sensitivity I have 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.240
 pretty much done so I aim precisely 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.899
 may also be from further distance 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.630
 and yes, that was probably it 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.430
 here I come from mw2 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.730
 again to mp3 but that's almost 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.090
 that's exactly how we'll be right back 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.830
 there we would go already mw3 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.250
 We here on options dissolve like you 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.450
 have 1280 x 720 following activity too 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.880
 relatively high up was suddenly out 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.489
 more graphics namely a bit more 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:42.220
 Inside spec commercial inside and rest 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.650
 you can see everything is control 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:53.250
 stayed the same edo lie down 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.250
 something else statements series 45 67 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.290
 out of sensitivity the most pretty 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.580
 far below 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.380
 and yes, many say that they are his 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.840
 out of sensitivity who the whole time 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.790
 above is mega the pro and none 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.600
 idea 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.370
 I do not think so is everyone 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.990
 let's leave it if he's with us 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.820
 low mouse settings need 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.100
 skills get along but that's why 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.120
 allow 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:24.970
 that's it really well so far 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.210
 okay and I hope I liked it 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.760
 this little info video of me 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.760
 and then until next time
