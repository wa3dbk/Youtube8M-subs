00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
this map is kind of like a comparison to

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.629 
this map is kind of like a comparison to
jungle<00:00:12.599> i<00:00:12.660> would<00:00:12.840> say<00:00:13.049> it's<00:00:13.740> kind<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.009> open<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
jungle i would say it's kind of open and

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.210 
jungle i would say it's kind of open and
kill<00:00:15.179> shakes<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.570> pretty<00:00:15.750> good<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.890> you

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
kill shakes do pretty good on it and you

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.320 
kill shakes do pretty good on it and you
guys<00:00:17.340> are<00:00:17.550> probably<00:00:17.640> wondering<00:00:17.850> why<00:00:18.270> this

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
guys are probably wondering why this

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.880 
guys are probably wondering why this
game<00:00:18.630> plays<00:00:18.840> only<00:00:19.050> two<00:00:19.230> minutes<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.680> 30

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
game plays only two minutes in 30

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.040 
game plays only two minutes in 30
seconds<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.760> that's<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.810> first

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
seconds and that's because the first

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.310 
seconds and that's because the first
half<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.439> really<00:00:22.710> bad<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.330> the<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.630> back<00:00:25.050> half

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
half is really bad and the the back half

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.380 
half is really bad and the the back half
was<00:00:25.500> really<00:00:25.710> bad<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.580> what<00:00:26.730> makes<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.150> two

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
was really bad but what makes this two

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.029 
was really bad but what makes this two
minute<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.720> 30<00:00:27.869> second<00:00:28.199> video<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.619> special
