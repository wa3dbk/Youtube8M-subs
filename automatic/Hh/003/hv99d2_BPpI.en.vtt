00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879

 simply form of you answer the 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.049
 him more under my last interview 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.849
 posted this world and this is mine 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.110
 left to Instagram twitter and so on 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.480
 all are in the infobox 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 and I just want to come in today 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.089
 few of the approximately 300 ask 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.480
 answer 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.310
 That's why I'm going to go ask me smo 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.050
 what are your favorite series and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.640
 your favorite youtubers so 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.590
 favorite series are lately 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.820
 all these serials on prosieben because 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 I somehow do not like the long time 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.940
 I looked but I was really like that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.360
 how it tour helped men big bang theory 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.190
 two broke girls 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.040
 yes and then I still watch everyone 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.200
 evening at 17.30 among us so everyone 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.910
 fall in that way my favorite series and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.610
 my favorite youtuber that's one 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.440
 very serious question because that changed 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.730
 very fast but a person 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.190
 which is always my favorite youtube 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.559
 somehow it remains the Russian one 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.180
 makes videos of jaÃ©n 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.370
 or also known as 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.840
 klassist internal and the I link 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.579
 times in the infobox fries everyone clean 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.960
 what did you want to do if 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.909
 deleted your youtube channel at once 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.220
 I think I will somehow 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.290
 try to contact youtube or 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 to google somehow yes my youtube 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.530
 channel is because you can do that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
 Restore I think that would have to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.640
 I will not be such a big problem 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.009
 Just hope that it never comes to that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.340
 By the way, question was straight from sarah then 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.710
 I 'm happy lulu 0 2 but forces you yes 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.869
 I make up every day if you like it 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.130
 believe or not but somehow that is 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.049
 for me, it's a routine like 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.970
 get up in the morning and save me so 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.860
 It's not that I'm that bad 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.180
 being driven weekend sometimes 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.729
 if I just sit at home 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.409
 I do not make up my own but his 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.570
 school time and so on I drink myself 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.310
 daily then uli 01 asks you are you 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.060
 a man who talks a lot or he 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.549
 one of 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.159
 So it depends on me 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.530
 Do not talk so much because I stop 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.240
 is not such a quarrelsome human 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.320
 because I find such discussions the ends 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.420
 master in dispute 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.979
 and I can not so good from me 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.420
 to argue with people but I am too 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.649
 not so unforgiving man i can 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.330
 actually have that because I stop with 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.710
 People say so quarreled because if that 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.110
 girlfriend and me somehow so short 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.970
 then that's for me 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.259
 but in the next moment forget and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.880
 for me it is always like that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.019
 It does not happen because I do not 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.730
 You can have that clean one another 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.890
 In most cases, there is not 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.190
 That's why I always try 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.209
 not so much to discuss, especially 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.069
 a case when the best stuff 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.650
 then one if that's all cleared up 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.290
 and so on, that's me 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.540
 do not talk so much no max xx 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.280
 ask me which achievement courses do you have 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.269
 So you want me, I have the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.560
 performance courses p1 english p2 by the 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.390
 Three Politics P4 Biology and P5 Music 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.980
 I've got something in the comments 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.080
 you have so for performance courses if you 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.330
 in the upper school since respectively 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.489
 high school graduation and whether we are satisfied with it 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.040
 How do we do when youtube 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.870
 had not started so the medium 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.340
 hard to imagine on youtube 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.170
 already such a huge part in my 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.850
 live on 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.980
 even if I do not make a video synonymous 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.690
 if I say two weeks no video 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.060
 I'm still on it 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.250
 youtube and twitter on the way and me 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.019
 Answer also comments though 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.780
 I would get those currently on 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.239
 Every case should be closed 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.950
 and still shy person though 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.269
 otherwise I do not know exactly how 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.459
 my life would look the other way 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.650
 the question was from march to also only 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.239
 a question from mel xxx you will find the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.970
 advanced level very demanding 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.680
 yes I think so because I think 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.209
 Something is a bit wrong 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.519
 run because so up to the tenth grade 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.720
 I really say we almost say that 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.540
 nothing for the school 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.920
 So I 've rarely learned almost 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.870
 no homework done 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.609
 Most of the time you could hang around 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.920
 somehow I have the feeling like that 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.569
 get thrown after the notes and 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.889
 then from the eleventh grade probably already like that 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.650
 a bit harder I have one too 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.310
 but get a bit worse grades 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.270
 now is not so much worse 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.700
 grade point average has not even been around 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.440
 0.2 or 03 has deteriorated so 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.540
 is not that much now but it is 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.520
 already got worse and I think 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.080
 especially now in the 12th that is still 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.700
 times have become such a blow and 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.489
 I do not know what they mean now 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.680
 teacher there expect everything from one because 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.480
 we have the tenth grade 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.950
 almost nothing taught and suddenly 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.510
 against the twelfth from that one 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.790
 everything from the seventh and eighth grade 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.940
 and what do I know that you still have it 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.710
 knows and everyone knows anyway so yes 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.000
 I say so you have to stop very much 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.370
 that's why we're coming in too 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.870
 Lately almost no videos because of me 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.910
 Just me was now for example 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.650
 the last week because i always go to the 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.970
 then busy with homework 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.610
 of course I have other hobbies 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.020
 where I can not just say he goes 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.790
 not like youtube today 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.560
 if I just stop uploading video comes 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.510
 no man has much more to do 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.340
 I have to say that yes like what 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.050
 you like the most about youtube i like 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.200
 best that you can just do that 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.380
 what you want and you can just show 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.570
 what you can or can tell what you are 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.310
 thinks he had too many people that way 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.930
 I always get so many 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.250
 comments from you for example 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.990
 say yes I am in the same 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.000
 Situation like you or just give me 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.100
 very often tips or give you tips 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.500
 with each other and so on and that 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.210
 I really like verena marie 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.370
 you ask the band royal flash 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.630
 mascara if so how do you like me 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.220
 Unfortunately, I can not do that 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.169
 Do not tell you how I think they are 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.000
 winter so for short eyelashes and I have 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.289
 hold very short eyelashes and I am like that 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.900
 I think a little bit about myself 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.330
 who are too casual or not but yes 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.310
 Let's see 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.990
 14 06 13 you could ask yourself 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.860
 Imagine for a longer time later 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.720
 to live abroad 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.690
 if so, where would you like some job ? 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.770
 where i have in different places 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.080
 can work and so on where I go to 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.490
 example, in england live in the month then 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.020
 I come to germany one month 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.150
 Back then I can also go for a month 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.500
 to france or something like that 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.630
 I would like to have because I think 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.180
 that somehow boring so if I am myself 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.880
 so imagine every morning year for 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.350
 wake up in the same city year 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.450
 and do his job 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.640
 a company again and again I ask 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.890
 I'm bored before dani is questioned 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.230
 what are your fans actually called my 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.090
 fans not pretty it just so from the 1st 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.470
 Youtube took deduced yes okay there 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.420
 actually is not really in it 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.210
 usually bayer my name hugh 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.380
 Laurie plays whiting on schedule 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.000
 I'm just for professionals 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.440
 decided and easy because all 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.390
 That's why people call me beautiful 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.310
 also all my spectators pretty 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.640
 of course, keep laura nature's 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.260
 but you call pretty father still son 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.120
 deeper sense 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.100
 karl 03 asks if everyone on the 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.950
 world could listen for a few minutes 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.990
 what would you say that's natural 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.200
 really ne gross question I think so 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.210
 would tell everyone that everyone is beautiful 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.130
 is in his wise because it is easy for me 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.260
 are unique and that we are at it 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.120
 should hold on and not on us 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.520
 should stick to any pictures 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.760
 and mean that we look or think 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.440
 or in general should be like others 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.150
 people that we should not would 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.030
 just wish everyone that he is like this 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.790
 as it is and not somehow 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:01.390
 clinging to too strong a model or something
