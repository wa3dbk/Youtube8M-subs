00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 hello everyone today I want my video 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.569
 tell you about such a wonderful 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.790
 flowers like marshmallows or just 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.900
 people call it for the true flower and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.509
 upstart refers to the family 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.850
 amaryllic flowers here it happens 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.500
 as white-pink and yellow color 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:28.830
 it looks like a little bit of a daffodil flower 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.199
 as we can see here as far as here 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.440
 this flower 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.160
 flowers are like very fast 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.480
 dissolves and then quickly fade 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.489
 but new ones follow 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.770
 flowers just yesterday I had 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.809
 that's just such a stalk here today 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.640
 as we can see, I have this 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.329
 castle rome flower and in the evening he to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.649
 Unfortunately it will have to be cut off 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.129
 flowering occurs to occurs 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:01.410
 literally there a day and a half or two is very 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.850
 rarely some and some flowers 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.270
 but have a very pleasant aroma 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280
 which attracts butterflies of different 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.290
 insects 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.710
 as for the bulbs of this flower, they 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.030
 poisons 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.200
 i'm david and how do alkaloids contain 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.810
 go out for ferran test enough 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.930
 unpretentious for this he does not need 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.020
 provide a bright place and sufficient 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.960
 watering the composition of the soil he does not 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.549
 demanding feels good when 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.229
 room temperatures in winter 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:40.950
 can withstand temperatures as low as 10 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:43.229
 degrees here if you have a plant 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.840
 put it somewhere on the north windows then 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.759
 you won't get good enough 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:54.119
 blooms here you will only have me not 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.049
 there will be abundant flowering will only 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.780
 to grow out the leaves here in the summer you can 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.220
 take to the open air there balcony 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.770
 or veranda 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.610
 still sometimes transplanted into open ground 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.810
 zephyranthes 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.730
 the flowering period it requires active 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.150
 abundant watering here but without stagnant water 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.120
 in winter , reduce watering 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.620
 sometimes satisfied with the rest period that is 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.820
 don't water all the flowers 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:33.270
 transplants for ferrand from as usual 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:36.500
 All the flowers in the spring I will land 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.180
 bulbs here transplant bulbs 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.880
 so that the soil is visible 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.420
 only the tops of the bulbs themselves bulbs 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.959
 in diameter of about 1 3 centimeters i.e. 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.490
 quite small bulbs plant and 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.580
 by a few here is a bulb in a pot there 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:02.130
 because they are small need 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:05.310
 replant at least 1 time in 2 years 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.320
 as with large quantities when 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.400
 strong reproduction they can break 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.400
 pot here 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:19.370
 due to the fact that a large 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.500
 the number of bulbs it multiplies like 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.090
 bulbs and seeds if 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.110
 to propagate with bulbs then literally 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.750
 next year you will have flowers 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.090
 But if you breed mines that 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.090
 rather rarely does water occur behind 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.090
 Finance basically transplants everything 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:46.200
 disingenuous to the bulbs that the seeds give 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:50.170
 only bloom the third year from 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.030
 here are transplants but in principle are we ours 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.370
 all I wanted to tell about this 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.060
 wonderful flowers, thank you all for 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.490
