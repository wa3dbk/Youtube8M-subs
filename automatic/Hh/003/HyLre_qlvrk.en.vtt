of the two out of this is one of the two
free<00:00:25.740> packs<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.340> believe<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.000> they're<00:00:27.119> doing

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
free packs I believe that they're doing

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.609 
free packs I believe that they're doing
because<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.779> think<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.080> other<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.380> isn't

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
because I think the other one isn't

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.679 
because I think the other one isn't
gonna<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.250> here<00:00:29.970> innocent<00:00:30.359> villainous

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
rainbow bursts there it's actually a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.600 
rainbow bursts there it's actually a
cool<00:02:45.840> effect<00:02:46.760> let's<00:02:47.760> see<00:02:47.910> if<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:49.459> so<00:02:50.459> it's

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
cool effect let's see if we can so it's

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.850 
cool effect let's see if we can so it's
pretty<00:02:50.820> cool<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.450> then<00:02:51.720> he<00:02:51.870> can<00:02:51.990> shoot<00:02:52.260> god

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
pretty cool and then he can shoot god

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.010 
pretty cool and then he can shoot god
that's<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.130> good<00:02:53.310> angle<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.840> thumbs<00:02:54.840> up

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
that's a good angle in that thumbs up

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.460 
that's a good angle in that thumbs up
for<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.260> angle<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:57.390> he's<00:02:57.959> pretty<00:02:58.290> cool<00:02:58.410> I

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
for that angle so he's pretty cool I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.190 
for that angle so he's pretty cool I
love<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.860> design<00:02:59.190> on<00:02:59.220> him<00:02:59.810> pretty<00:03:00.810> much<00:03:00.930> just

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
love the design on him pretty much just

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.570 
love the design on him pretty much just
rainbows<00:03:01.590> because<00:03:01.740> that's<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.160> does<00:03:02.340> he

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
rainbows because that's we does he

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.180 
rainbows because that's we does he
controls<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.300> light<00:03:03.480> spectrum<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:04.709> the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
controls the light spectrum so in the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.970 
controls the light spectrum so in the
light<00:03:05.340> spectrum<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.660> rainbow<00:03:07.260> color<00:03:07.500> so

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
light spectrum is the rainbow color so

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.970 
light spectrum is the rainbow color so
if<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.850> guys<00:03:09.000> thought<00:03:09.240> anything<00:03:09.570> else<00:03:09.980> you

because it's supposed to have like those

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.009 
because it's supposed to have like those
little<00:04:10.130> bricks<00:04:11.480> colorful<00:04:12.480> bricks<00:04:12.630> underneath

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
little bricks colorful bricks underneath

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.500 
little bricks colorful bricks underneath
his<00:04:13.290> feet<00:04:13.700> but<00:04:14.700> it's<00:04:14.850> only<00:04:14.940> showing<00:04:15.030> when<00:04:15.480> I

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
his feet but it's only showing when I

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.690 
his feet but it's only showing when I
turn<00:04:15.959> maybe<00:04:16.950> that's<00:04:17.130> what<00:04:17.340> it's<00:04:17.430> supposed<00:04:17.669> to

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
turn maybe that's what it's supposed to

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.620 
turn maybe that's what it's supposed to
do<00:04:18.830> that's

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.110 

yeah<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.860> think<00:04:25.250> that's<00:04:25.430> just<00:04:25.639> a<00:04:25.820> cool

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
yeah so that I think that's just a cool

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.140 
yeah so that I think that's just a cool
added<00:04:26.389> touch<00:04:26.780> because<00:04:27.229> I<00:04:27.260> was<00:04:27.560> like<00:04:28.150> thinking

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
added touch because I was like thinking

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.700 
added touch because I was like thinking
that<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:29.449> wasn't<00:04:29.690> gonna<00:04:29.840> be<00:04:29.960> really<00:04:30.380> special

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
that this wasn't gonna be really special

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.540 
that this wasn't gonna be really special
at<00:04:31.220> all<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:31.960> I<00:04:32.960> was<00:04:33.229> wrong<00:04:33.410> because<00:04:33.710> rainbow

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
at all and I was wrong because rainbow

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.790 
at all and I was wrong because rainbow
Raider<00:04:34.729> has<00:04:35.030> very<00:04:35.449> unique<00:04:35.510> powers<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.590> think

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
Raider has very unique powers I think

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.070 
Raider has very unique powers I think
he'd<00:04:36.889> be<00:04:37.010> a<00:04:37.040> really<00:04:37.280> cool<00:04:37.520> figure<00:04:37.760> I<00:04:37.940> mean<00:04:38.210> it's

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
he'd be a really cool figure I mean it's

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.730 
he'd be a really cool figure I mean it's
a<00:04:39.110> nice<00:04:39.290> old<00:04:39.910> Silver<00:04:40.910> Age<00:04:40.940> comics<00:04:41.660> villain<00:04:42.350> so

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
a nice old Silver Age comics villain so

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.460 
a nice old Silver Age comics villain so
very<00:04:43.669> neat<00:04:43.970> so<00:04:44.540> I<00:04:44.570> guess<00:04:44.840> that's<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.199> for<00:04:45.229> this

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470
