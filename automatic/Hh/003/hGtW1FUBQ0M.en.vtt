00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:10.669
 to him everyone these ten ports then 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:13.759
 today I'm going to you the little video 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:15.499
 to show how you know but the 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.300
 cep of bordeaux sent today 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:21.790
 we did a little gathering okay 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.870
 good not too bad and well you prison who 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.660
 who not know how to cook it 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.210
 so we came up with basic recipe 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.140
 very simple to apply which is a 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.610
 handle of this space to opera then everything 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.130
 first you have to start with 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.050
 sailboats set when I play clean up that 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.750
 will remove all the little residues of 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.110
 earth or more that stays on the tail of the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.880
 set 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.220
 but be careful you never have to 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.620
 the opponent is very important because 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:53.060
 that it does not wash and we start again and 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.310
 here you remember a little and not been his 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.100
 2nd little bowl all that earth 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.730
 we met there because we are there 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.660
 to avoid catching him like castro 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.960
 or something 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.210
 and also it's not very nice when 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.039
 we eat at the end of the small rats 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.899
 movements on sand that will vote everything and 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:17.020
 here we are who deserves it's going to be from the 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.020
 clean 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.300
 then the second step 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:25.080
 it will be 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.660
 the couple let me be what I do 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.210
 at best I think that more intelligence 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.660
 and you start by separating the head from 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.320
 hat to cut them off in 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.760
 washers this is also this attention 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.290
 sometimes glue it a little bit of errors so 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.130
 everything that seems to us too much 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.570
 relics or remove the gait is a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:53.870
 little like that you see good on the end 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.870
 it's better to cut because it's the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.660
 see the end of the pieces pretty much 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.370
 like that it will serve me like that 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.140
 this is the time either she would make 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.140
 pikes report 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:19.400
 so the little squares like that no 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.150
 good there is some that separates the head from the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.660
 hello hello not too much difference I 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.660
 going with blood 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.790
 now I have finished cutting and that 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.160
 that's all so flies have so 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.630
 I try by help 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.580
 you see months his voices to the color 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.910
 that's much older that you 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.610
 so I have to start with what is 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.650
 cooler so we'll put that in a 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:03:00.900
 stove with nothing at all so we're going gonna 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:05.040
 ask the cep to sell the water I 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.920
 left by that seems well loaded but 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.240
 the scepter and much to intuition 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.370
 so we'll leave it a little while 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.660
 that it's going to make water sometimes 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.870
 a big tide all disgusting but 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.490
 you do not have to worry about this normal 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.290
 so very important step if we wanted 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.930
 have 17 crispy on arrival 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.670
 it's really doing well solo 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.010
 here we go I'll show you a little 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.000
 how does this water valve actually make me 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:38.010
 am passionate about royer up month well 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:43.560
 that rather that evaporates good again 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.110
 c 17 who are are very firm 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.209
 so I do not have a lot of water from a lake 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:55.709
 the other bags are a lot more water 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:59.810
 here is a fire not a very strong fire 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.630
 but not too much either 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.150
 new things to the minute like 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.360
 it 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.599
 so now we have daughters of 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.300
 different evils we are going to dive their 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:28.550
 remove the restaurant thÃ¼r estimate the number to 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:35.870
 evening by famous pj neck is good there it's 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:39.760
 done in iraq the years in cooking on 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.760
 love a little water that is a 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.540
 soro 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:05:03.110
 we are on the fire a little oil excuse 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:09.290
 me but we in europe him we do not put 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:15.650
 here to resist a set it needs the 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.650
 sail to metal good of all 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.220
 at least two opus 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.280
 the thermostat and here we go 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:33.990
 hear that it's good 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:38.180
 we are all a little too late 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:42.410
 this time it's over we're fine that 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.410
 it has golden nonsense 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:53.940
 good 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.940
 we added the saddles 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.099
 even 10 that of weight 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.650
 so what 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.000
 and I think that's what goes from 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:33.510
 better up to it is to add a 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:33.510
 little okay but no 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:53.770
 that's where we leave a little bit of 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:57.569
 time that it takes me well the taste of 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.569
 salt and to serve
