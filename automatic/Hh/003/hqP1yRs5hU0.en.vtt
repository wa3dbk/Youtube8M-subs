00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
you can either do a bite or you can do

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.789 
you can either do a bite or you can do
the<00:01:11.760> surge<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.210> power<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.990> usually<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.439> try<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the surge of power now usually I try and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.530 
the surge of power now usually I try and
do<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> bite<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:14.460> surge<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.970> power<00:01:15.090> just

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
do a bite and then surge of power just

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.999 
do a bite and then surge of power just
in<00:01:15.689> case<00:01:15.869> surge<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.259> power<00:01:16.380> doesn't<00:01:16.650> kill<00:01:16.920> them

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
in case surge of power doesn't kill them

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.160 
in case surge of power doesn't kill them
but<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.540> either<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.930> usually

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
but you can do either one usually

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.420 
but you can do either one usually
searcher<00:01:19.619> power<00:01:19.770> will<00:01:20.009> kill<00:01:20.189> them<00:01:20.340> because

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
searcher power will kill them because

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.910 
searcher power will kill them because
it's<00:01:20.729> also<00:01:20.909> doing<00:01:21.330> double<00:01:21.659> damage<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.680> it

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it's also doing double damage and so it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.740 
it's also doing double damage and so it

they're gonna be dead in five turns

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.950 
they're gonna be dead in five turns
anyway<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> doesn't<00:01:30.329> matter<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:30.900> do

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
anyway it doesn't matter what they do

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.319 
anyway it doesn't matter what they do
even<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> does<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> critical<00:01:32.610> hit<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.880> me<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
even if it does a critical hit on me it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.760 
even if it does a critical hit on me it
just<00:01:33.659> doesn't<00:01:33.840> matter<00:01:34.110> anything<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.680> they

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
just doesn't matter anything that they

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.620 
just doesn't matter anything that they
do<00:01:34.829> doesn't<00:01:35.369> matter<00:01:35.520> all<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.240> these<00:01:36.360> abilities

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
do doesn't matter all of these abilities

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.780 
do doesn't matter all of these abilities
also<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.710> one<00:01:37.979> hundred<00:01:38.280> percent<00:01:38.310> hit

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
also have one hundred percent hit

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.819 
also have one hundred percent hit
chances<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.780> there's<00:01:39.990> literally<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.560> one

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
chances so there's literally a one

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.170 
chances so there's literally a one
hundred<00:01:41.130> percent<00:01:41.159> chance<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.759> success<00:01:42.150> here

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
hundred percent chance of success here

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.300 
hundred percent chance of success here
there's<00:01:42.840> no<00:01:43.140> way<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.890> ever<00:01:44.040> go

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
there's no way that this can ever go

there's no way that this can ever go

see that was a Miss that was kind of
lucky<00:02:47.820> on<00:02:48.090> my<00:02:48.300> part<00:02:48.600> but<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.990> wouldn't<00:02:49.590> have

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
lucky on my part but it wouldn't have

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.230 
lucky on my part but it wouldn't have
mattered<00:02:49.800> because<00:02:50.130> he<00:02:50.430> was<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:50.760> that's<00:02:50.970> done

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
mattered because he was so that's done

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.910 
mattered because he was so that's done
there<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.840> would<00:02:51.990> have<00:02:52.110> everything<00:02:52.620> would

have pretty much happened the exact same
way<00:02:54.630> um<00:02:55.340> also<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:57.030> guess<00:02:57.390> obviously<00:02:57.840> you

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
way um also like I I guess obviously you

want<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.230> use<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.530> bite<00:02:58.740> whenever<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.310> does

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
want to use the bite whenever it does

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.360 
want to use the bite whenever it does
does<00:03:00.000> more<00:03:00.180> damage<00:03:00.260> but<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.740> ever<00:03:02.040> have

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
does more damage but if you ever have

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.980 
does more damage but if you ever have
any<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.760> them<00:03:02.910> died<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:03.570> for<00:03:03.870> whatever

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
any of them died you know for whatever

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.330 
any of them died you know for whatever
reason<00:03:04.410> or<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.560> have<00:03:04.710> both<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.950> them<00:03:05.130> died

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
reason or you have both of them died

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.830 
reason or you have both of them died
like<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:05.790> one<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.270> was<00:03:06.330> kind<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.630> close

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
like this one it was kind of close

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.020 
like this one it was kind of close
obviously<00:03:07.140> but<00:03:07.680> not<00:03:07.860> really<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.790> close

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
obviously but not really that close

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.370 
obviously but not really that close
because<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.420> pandaren<00:03:09.780> water<00:03:09.960> spirit<00:03:10.290> just

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
because the pandaren water spirit just

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.990 
because the pandaren water spirit just
comes<00:03:10.590> out<00:03:10.710> and<00:03:10.860> kills<00:03:11.070> them<00:03:11.100> anyway<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:11.880> you

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
comes out and kills them anyway but you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.820 
comes out and kills them anyway but you
can<00:03:12.180> just<00:03:12.330> add<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> third<00:03:12.870> pet<00:03:13.110> in<00:03:13.290> there<00:03:13.500> just

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
can just add a third pet in there just

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.320 
can just add a third pet in there just
in<00:03:13.980> case<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.460> know<00:03:14.550> if<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.760> want<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:14.970> be<00:03:15.090> safe

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330
