00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
sometime soon to again I'm just kind of

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.720 
sometime soon to again I'm just kind of
waiting<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:47.350> see<00:02:47.740> when<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.130> happens<00:02:48.490> I<00:02:48.700> think

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
waiting to see when that happens I think

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.280 
waiting to see when that happens I think
it's<00:02:49.000> supposed<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.690> know<00:02:49.900> goes<00:02:50.110> through

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
it's supposed to you know goes through

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.440 
it's supposed to you know goes through
customs<00:02:50.680> at<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:50.920> Chicago<00:02:51.550> or<00:02:51.820> something<00:02:52.270> I

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
customs at a Chicago or something I

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.910 
customs at a Chicago or something I
think<00:02:52.780> that's<00:02:52.930> right<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.410> evidently<00:02:53.739> it's

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
think that's right and evidently it's

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.430 
think that's right and evidently it's
really<00:02:54.160> bad<00:02:54.310> there<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.820> guess<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.480> yeah

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
really bad there I guess so yeah

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.050 
really bad there I guess so yeah
