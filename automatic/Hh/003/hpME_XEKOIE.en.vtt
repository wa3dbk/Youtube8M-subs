challenge<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:06.150> first<00:00:06.330> one<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> skull

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
challenge the first one is a skull

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.560 
challenge the first one is a skull
I<00:00:07.919> just<00:00:08.250> basically<00:00:08.429> used<00:00:08.970> red<00:00:09.269> black<00:00:09.540> and

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
I just basically used red black and

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.499 
I just basically used red black and
white<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.170> was<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> very<00:00:10.559> simple<00:00:10.860> pattern<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.610> got

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
white it was a very simple pattern I got

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.550 
white it was a very simple pattern I got
it<00:00:12.690> online<00:00:12.840> it's<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.500> sprite<00:00:13.860> image<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:15.410> it<00:00:16.410> was

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
it online it's a sprite image and it was

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.590 
it online it's a sprite image and it was
very<00:00:16.770> easy<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> draw<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.369> on<00:00:17.520> graph<00:00:17.880> paper<00:00:17.910> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
very easy to draw it on graph paper and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.140 
very easy to draw it on graph paper and
this<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.320> where<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.710> was<00:00:19.830> reduced<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.760> just

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
this is where it was reduced I just

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.849 
this is where it was reduced I just
reduced<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.840> down<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.199> was<00:00:22.289> pretty<00:00:22.470> big<00:00:22.680> when<00:00:22.830> I

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
reduced it down it was pretty big when I

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.599 
reduced it down it was pretty big when I
first<00:00:23.160> made<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> reduced<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.810> down<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
first made it but I reduced it down and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.810 
first made it but I reduced it down and
the<00:00:26.609> end<00:00:26.820> result<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.630> okay<00:00:27.960> not<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.189> hundred

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the end result it's okay not a hundred

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.659 
the end result it's okay not a hundred
percent<00:00:29.939> thrilled<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.750> okay<00:00:31.399> the<00:00:32.399> next

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
percent thrilled but it's okay the next

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.870 
percent thrilled but it's okay the next
cane<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> made<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.010> pac-man<00:00:35.250> cane

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
cane that I made was the pac-man cane

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.540 
cane that I made was the pac-man cane
took<00:00:36.570> about<00:00:36.750> five<00:00:36.989> or<00:00:37.140> six<00:00:37.290> hours<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> was

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
took about five or six hours but it was

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.690 
took about five or six hours but it was
big<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.800> from<00:00:40.800> start<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.219> finish<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.670> just

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
big and from start to finish I just

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.900 
big and from start to finish I just
rolled<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.980> yellow<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.129> black<00:00:44.309> clay<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
rolled out the yellow and black clay and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.660 
rolled out the yellow and black clay and
put<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:45.329> extruder<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.950> extruded

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
put it in my extruder I then extruded

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.979 
put it in my extruder I then extruded
out<00:00:47.789> pieces<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:49.020> lot<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:50.039> pieces<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.989> started

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
out pieces a lot of pieces and started

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.470 
out pieces a lot of pieces and started
to<00:00:52.199> stack<00:00:52.530> them<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.789> look<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> graph

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
to stack them if you look at the graph

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.330 
to stack them if you look at the graph
and<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.140> check<00:00:55.320> everything<00:00:55.469> off<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.160> you

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and you just check everything off as you

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.779 
and you just check everything off as you
go<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.809> difficult<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.379> all

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
go it's really not that difficult at all

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.900 
go it's really not that difficult at all
the<00:00:59.789> kids<00:01:00.000> helped<00:01:00.390> me<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.370> fun

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the kids helped me and it was a fun

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.280 
the kids helped me and it was a fun
project<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.870> didn't<00:01:04.290> take<00:01:04.439> us<00:01:04.619> very<00:01:04.710> long<00:01:04.949> I

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
project that didn't take us very long I

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.380 
project that didn't take us very long I
it<00:01:07.290> was<00:01:07.439> 14<00:01:07.890> across<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.090> just

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it was 14 across and so you just

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.300 
it was 14 across and so you just
basically<00:01:09.540> count<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> bottom<00:01:11.159> row

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
basically count you know the bottom row

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.210 
basically count you know the bottom row
was<00:01:11.460> 14<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.200> next<00:01:13.500> row<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.710> believe

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
was 14 and then the next row I believe

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.450 
was 14 and then the next row I believe
was<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.780> five<00:01:15.780> black<00:01:16.229> three<00:01:16.740> yellow<00:01:17.159> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
was like five black three yellow and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.730 
was like five black three yellow and
then<00:01:17.640> six<00:01:18.600> black<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:19.080> something<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.530> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
then six black or something like that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740 
then six black or something like that
but<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.030> all<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> way<00:01:21.390> across

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
but you just do that all the way across

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.580 
but you just do that all the way across
and<00:01:23.060> by<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> time<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.659> were<00:01:24.780> done<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.259> had<00:01:25.470> this

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and by the time we were done we had this

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.640 
and by the time we were done we had this
really<00:01:26.250> really<00:01:26.610> big<00:01:26.729> cane<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.990> took<00:01:28.380> quite<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
really really big cane that took quite a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.429 
really really big cane that took quite a
while<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.950> reduce<00:01:29.640> down<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.750> once<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.290> did

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
while to reduce down but once it did

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
while to reduce down but once it did
reduce<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.009> was<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.579> was<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:32.880> bad<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.390> I

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
reduce it was it was not bad at all I

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.950 
reduce it was it was not bad at all I
really<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.829> way<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.430> doing<00:01:35.460> canes<00:01:36.299> for

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
really like this way of doing canes for

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.840 
really like this way of doing canes for
certain<00:01:37.350> things<00:01:37.590> obviously<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.670> going

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
certain things obviously it's not going

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.609 
certain things obviously it's not going
to<00:01:38.939> take<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> place<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.409> other

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
to take the place of you know other

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.300 
to take the place of you know other
things<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:42.240> flowers<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.310> different

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
things but like flowers and different

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.530 
things but like flowers and different
things<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.180> kind<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
things like that but this is kind of

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.420 
things like that but this is kind of
cool<00:01:45.780> my<00:01:46.140> little<00:01:46.380> Pacman<00:01:46.590> came<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.250> pretty

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
cool my little Pacman came out pretty

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.639 
cool my little Pacman came out pretty
decent<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:48.420> I'm<00:01:48.509> gonna<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.960> ghosts

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
decent think I'm gonna do the ghosts

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.590 
decent think I'm gonna do the ghosts
next<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.579> see<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.030> drawing<00:01:51.299> there

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
next you can see it in the drawing there

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.139 
next you can see it in the drawing there
but<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.590> was<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> lot<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.950> fun<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.549> hope<00:01:54.000> you
