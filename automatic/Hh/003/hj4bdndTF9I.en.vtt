00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.029
 las meninas is the most famous work of Velázquez 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:16.529
 It was painted by the great Sevillian artist in 1656 according to Antonio 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.539
 palomino 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.189
 quite reasonable date if we consider that the infanta daisy 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.369
 was born on July 12, one thousand 651 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.480
 and looks about five years old 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.619
 however a Velázquez appears with the cross of the order of Santiago in his chest 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.620
 with which he got in 1659 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.430
 most experts agree that the cross was painted by the artist 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.520
 when he received the distinction by signing himself up 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520
 that it was the fourth felipe himself who did it 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.980
 the room in which the scene unfolds 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.020
 It would be she killed the port of the Prince of the Alcazar of Madrid 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.650
 stay that had a staircase in the back and that was illuminated by seven 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.510
 windows 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.100
 although Velázquez only paints five of them by shortening the room 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.380
 the prince's room was decorated with mythological paintings 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.680
 made by martínez del malzo 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.910
 copying original rubens canvases that can be seen at the bottom of the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.170
 stay 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.409
 in the composition the teacher 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.500
 it still presents us with all of them documented except one 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.640
 the scene 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.920
 It is presided over by the Infanta Marguerite and by her side 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.840
 Meninas Maria Agustina Sarmiento and Isabella de Velasco are located 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.800
 in the earth is Velázquez with his brushes before a huge canvas whose 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.850
 frame or we can observe 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.420
 on the right are the dwarves madrid barbosa 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.330
 and nicolás and I pertusato 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
 the latter playing with a companion dog 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.730
 after the infanta we observe the characters more than their small court 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.920
 Mrs. Marcela Ulloa 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.250
 and the unknown saved more 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.180
 reflected in the mirror that are the regal effigies of felipe or fourth and his 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.210
 second wife 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.010
 mariana from austria 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.259
 the composition 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.259
 closes with the figure of the room golos jose 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.779
 the opinions on what fifth Velazquez are very diverse 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.469
 is venerated with enough success considers that the painter shows us a scene of 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:23.849
 court 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.590
 the infanta margarita arrives accompanied by her court to the Velázquez workshop to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.799
 see how he works 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.999
 just arrived he has asked for water 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.049
 so maria sarmiento offers a bite to alleviate his being 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.579
 at that time the king and queen enter the ranch 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.790
 hence, some characters stop their activity 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.000
 and greet their majesties as Isabel de velasco 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.319
 this idea of ​​transit is reinforced by the presence of the figure of the room 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.109
 he worships the bottom whose mission was to open the palace doors to the kings 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.200
 dressed in a cape but without a sword or hat 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.599
 the little infanta was looking at nicola site 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.690
 but he notices the presence of his royal parents 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.909
 and looks sideways out of the box 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.390
 marcela ulloa has not noticed the arrival of the kings 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.889
 and continued talking with him aposentador 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.019
 like the dwarf who keeps playing with terror 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:25.959
 but the real mystery is in what is not seen in the picture that is 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.279
 painting Velázquez 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:29.649
 some authors 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.869
 think that the Sevillian painter is making a portrait of the king and his 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:35.509
 wife to the big format 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.649
 so the monarchs reflect their faces in the mirror 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.200
 carol justy considers that we are facing a snapshot of the 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.439
 life in palace 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.099
 a photograph of how one lived in the court of felipe cuarto 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:54.269
 Angel del Campo affirms that Velásquez make his work a reading of the 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.799
 dynastic continuity 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.949
 his two most interesting conclusions are the following 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.019
 the heads of the characters on the left and the spots on the paintings 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.019
 form a circle symbol of perfection 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.639
 in the center of that circle we find the mirror with the faces of the kings 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.699
 what assimilates the monarchy to perfection 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.799
 we raise the heads of the different characters the structure of the 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.240
 constellation called corona borealis whose central star is called 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.240
 daisy like the infanta 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.040
 in this way the continuity of the monarchy is in the person of 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.790
 Daisy flower 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.150
 in those moments heiress of the crown 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.219
 from the field 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.779
 is based to support those theories and the great erudition of Velázquez who 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.049
 it had one of the most important libraries of its time 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:48.079
 As for the technique with which Velázquez paints this masterpiece 

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:51.650
 considered by loca yordano the theology of painting 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.000
 the foreground is flooded by a powerful light bulb 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.090
 through the first window on the right 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.890
 the infanta is the center of the group and seems to float since we do not see her feet 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.099
 hidden in the shadow of their child guard 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.809
 the background figures are in semi-darkness while the part of the 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:14.479
 background we find a new light bulb 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.549
 impacting on the possessor who trims his silhouette on the staircase 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.610
 the brushstroke used by Velázquez can not be more hulk 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.020
 working each of the details of the dresses and ornaments 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.590
 based on pastel brushstrokes that anticipate the impressionist painting 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.729
 the silver tones of the dresses predominate while calling our 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.250
 attention the rhythm marked by the red notes that are distributed by the 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.110
 canvas 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.120
 the cross of santiago 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.389
 the colors of the Velázquez palette 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.490
 the vase 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.779
 the handkerchief of the infanta and isabel de velasco 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:55.059
 to finish and the red spot of the medical suit attended 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.030
 but what really impacts us 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.259
 it is the atmospheric sensation created by the painter 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:07.210
 the so-called perspective her kioto from the depth salaescena through the 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.349
 air that surrounds each of the characters and diffuses their contours 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.669
 especially the figures in the background 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.259
 that are appreciated with more inaccurate profiles and less intense colors 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.940
 It is also interesting how to get 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.139
 the spatial effect creating the feeling that the room is continued on the canvas 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.470
 as if the characters will share the space with the spectators 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:34.639
 as it says changes ti 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.300
 there is no stable 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.839
 ken hosanna I will forget this
