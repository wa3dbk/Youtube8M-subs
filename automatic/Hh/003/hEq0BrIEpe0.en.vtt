00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.619
 last button galley 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.480
 Because a lot of people come in here says our 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.329
 what kimi in stranger do not know what it is 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.219
 human microphone will not and will not 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.350
 here, but these 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.110
 modules have to see if you can complete 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.780
 or, for example, they start without these 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.079
 emissions because not in emissions in the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.199
 to see that some other objectives by 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.780
 example you kill those principles 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.910
 Enemies is a character I completed. 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.609

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.010
 The objective of the video is going to be 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.020
 shown this dragon yes because it was a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.400
 so I found it interesting 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.439
 before making the video was giving a 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.229
 I play and I think I'll show you guys 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.729
 That's a very interesting way for me. 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.159
 that most young people do not 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.990

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.390

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.619
 so let's go to the purpose of the video is this 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.159
 The way the guys pick one 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.530
 character to go fighting and people for 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.299
 example by increasing his life by training 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.610
 it's like a story with 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.650
 Of course, he chose to believe that this video 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.700
 It will only be to show even how 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.220

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.360
 We train ten o'clock ten days. 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.700
 training until you start a fight then 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.670
 I train here or a defense for example 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.490
 I'm going to attack there show scenarios 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.770
 neighbor and the bad training you 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.720
 loses life but it 's kind you have to act 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.390
 with intelligence here right? 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.000

 will you see some surprise guys like 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.790

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.800
 money 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.220
 I explored the bomb was one more than the people 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.650
 lose power of defense we have the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.750
 toys they play if I do not 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.610
 I sat all still but then I go 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.440
 join then I'm playing here I 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.220
 was interesting and we have this 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.260
 ref 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.209
 the latter here which is to increase 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.150
 Our life grows 50 so you can see 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.760
 with this strategy, the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.170
 Example, come on, I'll train here. 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.989
 workout training 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.090
 That's when I saw that it broke my 50's. 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.090
 Life is low so I go there and it increases. 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.310
 my Latin then we train here 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.730
 is increasing the defense attack on 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.910
 defense 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.410
 it's a mean way they tried not rpg 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.510
 It was great, but it was 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.209
 interesting thing I wanted to show for 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.540
 You were good at trying to make a 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.540
 battle 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:29.220
 I think something will always find you. 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:31.860
 something happens to me an option if 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.739
 you to say yes or no or will be 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.209
 bad thing how much it will be good 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.510
 will not train more than train our 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.510
 defense 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.090
 It was meant to get bigger, you do not understand why 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.310
 up there is 77 days already gone 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.410
 missing three of them those Tuscan marbles 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.690
 is the content day was once when every 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.180
 The time I click on one, it's up to date. 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.210
 what is explorei chan 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.650
 it going and then give the file or not 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:07.430
 Come on, everybody back there, put your hand on the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.510
 dwarf face conditioned km of defense 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.450

 my life in the third in the third option 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.670
 O practice then you see how it is that 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.590
 works then after ten days 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.750
 you will face the enemy with that 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.270
 there and there with the one with so much of there I think 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.480
 that you want and have and your strength is 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:40.250

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.740
 battle, I just wanted to show you how 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.320
 is that it is this way that a mode 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.419
 interesting, you do not have a star and I do not 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:05.240
 I know what, but I'm going to move and size 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:09.350
 I only screwed up here way over there 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.570
 fight against the sky I think that always the 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:17.810
 Of course, when I was playing it 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:19.880
 it was he also fucked me there is the cap 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.620
 Pulling this one then you can see 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.919
 such full game we have 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.780
 many ways there for you to play really good 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.970
 let's go beauty 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.830
 this classic map I think this one 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.270
 map by the group's struggle against a 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.050
 Language, of course not. 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:40.610
 peraí left nor ethical I think it is so 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.180
 he did not even get his clothes full 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.250
 face 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.190
 I think I can do it so let's go 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.520
 have a peak of course I'm not good 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.790
 gentle gilat arrive all watched me 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.410
 It was a good fight, analyzed the day is 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:58.760
 but I'm not a great person even playing in 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:01.820
 home the poison so to him one 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.990
 hit with the avaí took our 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.550
 capturing this very interesting 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.120
 There's a lot of battle I think it should 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.830
 Decrease the days a little but not everything 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.140
 well galera degree bronze and always with 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.970
 innovations innovations not right had 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.310
 done but a lot of people did not know how to 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.950
 It worked and I hope it tries. 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:31.030
 will help show whoever fires 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:34.039

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:53.870

 Well, people have been showing a little of 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.360
 it was a very interesting way 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.039
 even more interesting when generating 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.690
