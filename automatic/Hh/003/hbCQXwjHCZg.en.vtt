00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.290 
pins and you want to be especially
careful<00:03:58.080> view<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.560> bangs<00:03:58.910> I'll<00:03:59.910> show<00:04:00.180> you

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
careful view of bangs I'll show you

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.790 
careful view of bangs I'll show you
another<00:04:00.510> way<00:04:00.630> that<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:00.959> can<00:04:01.140> do<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:01.440> if<00:04:01.709> you

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
another way that you can do this if you

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.050 
another way that you can do this if you
have<00:04:01.920> things<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.520> they<00:04:02.670> don't<00:04:02.790> come<00:04:02.970> out

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
have things so that they don't come out

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.860 
have things so that they don't come out
either<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.730> if<00:04:05.819> you<00:04:05.940> pull<00:04:06.180> little<00:04:06.390> sections

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
either and if you pull little sections

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.470 
either and if you pull little sections
at<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.020> time<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:08.100> will<00:04:08.190> look<00:04:08.370> PC<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.030> even<00:04:09.239> more

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
at a time it will look PC and even more

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.000 
at a time it will look PC and even more
messy

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.129 

and<00:04:14.099> hopefully<00:04:14.819> where<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.299> tease<00:04:15.569> this<00:04:15.930> will

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
and hopefully where you tease this will

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.830 
and hopefully where you tease this will
help<00:04:16.290> kind<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.709> keep<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.729> standing<00:04:17.970> up<00:04:18.359> instead

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
help kind of keep it standing up instead

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:27.340 
help kind of keep it standing up instead
of<00:04:18.900> flopping<00:04:19.590> over

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.690 

okay<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:28.400> continued

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.400

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
having wispies around my face but

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.200 
having wispies around my face but
sometimes<00:04:48.500> it's<00:04:48.680> hard<00:04:48.890> to<00:04:48.980> tell<00:04:49.400> where<00:04:50.090> they

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
sometimes it's hard to tell where they

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.460 
sometimes it's hard to tell where they
are<00:04:50.240> in<00:04:50.420> your<00:04:50.690> hair<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:50.930> you<00:04:51.110> don't<00:04:51.290> want<00:04:51.410> to

pull down any long pieces of hair so the

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.640 
pull down any long pieces of hair so the
way<00:04:54.410> that<00:04:54.440> I<00:04:54.620> do<00:04:54.740> this<00:04:55.040> is<00:04:55.190> I<00:04:55.220> take<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:56.650> powder

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
way that I do this is I take a powder

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:05.340 
way that I do this is I take a powder
brush<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:59.140> just<00:05:00.140> kind<00:05:00.440> of<00:05:01.630> run<00:05:02.630> it<00:05:02.750> along<00:05:02.960> the

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:13.439 

sides<00:05:06.350> of<00:05:06.530> your<00:05:06.590> face

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:16.469 
and this will kind of just pull him down

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:19.920 
and this will kind of just pull him down
anything<00:05:17.469> that's<00:05:17.680> not<00:05:17.889> secured<00:05:18.900> into<00:05:19.900> the
