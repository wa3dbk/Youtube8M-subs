Scott is going to tell us what makes

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.870 
Scott is going to tell us what makes
this<00:00:24.900> thing<00:00:25.080> tick<00:00:25.369> this<00:00:26.369> comes<00:00:26.609> from<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> O

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
this thing tick this comes from the O

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.419 
this thing tick this comes from the O
our<00:00:27.150> series<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:28.019> 50<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.710> original<00:00:29.250> one

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
our series the or 50 is the original one

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.780 
our series the or 50 is the original one
from<00:00:29.910> 72<00:00:30.300> they<00:00:31.019> made<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.380> small<00:00:31.710> as<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.759> can

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
from 72 they made as small as you can

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.970 
from 72 they made as small as you can
see<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> small<00:00:33.420> head<00:00:33.719> version<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.469> 15<00:00:34.829> watt

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
see a small head version it's a 15 watt

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.200 
see a small head version it's a 15 watt
the<00:00:35.190> circuit<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> little<00:00:35.820> different<00:00:36.120> but

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the circuit is a little different but

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.319 
the circuit is a little different but
it's<00:00:36.360> still<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.630> Picts<00:00:36.870> only<00:00:37.410> meaning

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
it's still the Picts only meaning

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.790 
it's still the Picts only meaning
there's<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> speaker<00:00:39.750> instead<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> word

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
there's a speaker instead of the word

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770 
there's a speaker instead of the word
volume<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.520> there's<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> treble<00:00:42.329> clef<00:00:42.420> for

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
volume and there's a treble clef for

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.630 
volume and there's a treble clef for
trouble<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.860> thing<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.129> separates<00:00:44.520> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
trouble the thing that separates this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.310 
trouble the thing that separates this
from<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.969> line<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.450> there's<00:00:45.719> an<00:00:45.899> effects<00:00:46.170> loop

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
from the line is there's an effects loop

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.069 
from the line is there's an effects loop
built<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.100> that's<00:00:47.640> powered<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> 1287

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
built in and that's powered with a 1287

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.610 
built in and that's powered with a 1287
and<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.870> makes<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> more<00:00:52.320> transparent

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and so that makes it more transparent

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.869 
and so that makes it more transparent
and<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.890> another<00:00:55.890> thing<00:00:56.010> too<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and so I have a another thing too is you

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.080 
and so I have a another thing too is you
can<00:00:57.090> cut<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.899> 15<00:00:58.230> watts<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.890> 7<00:00:59.219> watts<00:00:59.430> it's<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
can cut the 15 watts to 7 watts it's a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.970 
can cut the 15 watts to 7 watts it's a
great<00:01:00.300> live<00:01:00.570> AM<00:01:00.750> 15<00:01:01.199> watts<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:01.739> really

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
great live AM 15 watts can get really

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.799 
great live AM 15 watts can get really
loud<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.609> pay<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> speaker's<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.480> you

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
loud to pay on the speaker's you you

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.810 
loud to pay on the speaker's you you
know<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.049> cab<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.559> use<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.100> yeah<00:01:05.610> I'll

know the cab that you use so yeah I'll
just<00:01:06.000> make<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.510> point<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.320> say<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.799> you

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
just make a little point to say what you

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.010 
just make a little point to say what you
guys<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.100> about<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.490> hear<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.840> have

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
guys are about to hear right now we have

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.940 
guys are about to hear right now we have
the<00:01:10.229> master<00:01:10.650> volume<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.490> set<00:01:11.970> at<00:01:12.600> about<00:01:13.229> 2

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the master volume on this set at about 2

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.719 
the master volume on this set at about 2
so<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.630> very<00:01:15.900> very<00:01:16.590> powerful<00:01:16.860> 15<00:01:17.490> watts

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so this is a very very powerful 15 watts

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.660 
so this is a very very powerful 15 watts
we<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> 15<00:01:18.630> watt<00:01:18.840> setting<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
we have it on the 15 watt setting and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.270 
we have it on the 15 watt setting and
let's<00:01:20.670> let's<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.330> start<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.630> seeing<00:01:21.810> some

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
let's let's get start with seeing some

00:01:22.280 --> 00:02:42.950 
let's let's get start with seeing some
heavier<00:01:23.280> sanitized

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.020 

you
