them for their for that and what I
basically<00:00:19.980> did<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.699> did<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> really<00:00:21.240> simple<00:00:21.689> I

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
basically did is I did a really simple I

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.040 
basically did is I did a really simple I
start<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.369> front<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.779> start

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
start with the front here and you start

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.349 
start with the front here and you start
with<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.199> swirl<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.880> kind<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.210> kind<00:00:27.330> of

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
with a swirl and you kind of kind of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.589 
with a swirl and you kind of kind of
think<00:00:27.599> about<00:00:27.660> Goldilocks<00:00:28.590> almost<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.599> lock

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
think about Goldilocks almost like lock

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.990 
think about Goldilocks almost like lock
so<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.050> create<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.470> simple<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.130> little

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
so you just create it simple a little

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.940 
so you just create it simple a little
twist<00:00:33.300> there<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.440> go<00:00:34.530> around<00:00:34.770> there

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
twist there and have it go around there

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.330 
twist there and have it go around there
and<00:00:35.160> then<00:00:36.000> from<00:00:36.239> there<00:00:36.530> you<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and then from there you can have the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.220 
and then from there you can have the
body<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.090> flower<00:00:40.040> come<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:42.079> then<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
body of the flower come up and then the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.260 
body of the flower come up and then the
stem<00:00:43.590> could<00:00:44.489> go<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:45.300> here<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:47.309> now

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
stem could go up here like that so now

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.209 
stem could go up here like that so now
take<00:00:48.420> how<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> simple<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:49.890> take

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
take how to do it simple you just take

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.549 
take how to do it simple you just take
your<00:00:50.430> marker<00:00:50.789> follow<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> line<00:00:52.050> make<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
your marker follow the line make it a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.590 
your marker follow the line make it a
twist<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:54.410> let<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> end<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.600> take

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
twist and let it end right there take

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.560 
twist and let it end right there take
your<00:00:58.250> take<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> line<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> going<00:01:00.300> in

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
your take a line and have it going in

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.219 
your take a line and have it going in
towards<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.079> center<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> rose<00:01:03.049> see<00:01:04.049> how

towards the center of the rose see how

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.870 
towards the center of the rose see how
I'm<00:01:04.320> creating<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.769> center<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.549> line<00:01:05.760> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
I'm creating that center the line is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.010 
I'm creating that center the line is
going<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:07.250> once<00:01:08.250> again<00:01:08.610> maybe<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.780> is

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
going in once again maybe there is

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:21.359 
going in once again maybe there is
another<00:01:10.049> leaf<00:01:11.659> right<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:14.240> so

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:30.999 

the<00:01:22.369> stem<00:01:28.659> take<00:01:29.659> your<00:01:29.840> red<00:01:30.020> just<00:01:30.500> pop<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:30.920> in

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
the stem take your red just pop it in

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.819 
the stem take your red just pop it in
there<00:01:31.159> real<00:01:31.310> quick<00:01:31.549> like<00:01:31.759> that<00:01:32.590> gives<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.740> a

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
there real quick like that gives it a

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.539 
there real quick like that gives it a
little<00:01:33.979> bold<00:01:35.920> maybe<00:01:36.920> there's<00:01:37.159> a<00:01:37.219> highlight
