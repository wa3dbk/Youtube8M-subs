00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.509
 cooperative game for four players 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.009
 giving players the opportunity to 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.810
 form a team to carry out a 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.490
 series of assaults and epic heists with 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.009
 several parts along the saints and 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.179
 the county of blaine and during the two 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.619
 next weeks we will have more 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.700
 information on the launch of 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.350
 blows and on new ones 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.130
 features that we will launch at the same 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.860
 time and good because that's what happened 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.670
 with respect to then to the blows to the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.280
 banks as well as they will leave 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.800
 let's hope it's not two blows to 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.780
 banks or three like those in the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.120
 campaign mode we hope they are minimal 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.860
 at least ten hopefully and that there 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.110
 different ways of doing them for 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.140
 that can vary what is the gameplay and 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.300
 good with regard to pc and good 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.489
 Well, now we are marked here that the 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.160
 Game is available until April 14 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.630
 and says good to thank the 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.400
 understanding reward we have all 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.739
 they wanted to reserve the game with 200,000 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.660
 additional ingame in what is the gt 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.269
 online you already know that well, that's what 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.920
 always look in that sense to compensate 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.950
 to the people that I made for sales 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.660
 when they delay the games but 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.330
 let's hope the game is good, I say 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.160
 I'm not going to buy it for PC but I know that 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.980
 it will be the best version is going to be the one that 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.800
 going to run 4k who's going to run at 60 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.200
 fps is then 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.360
 and obviously in these a semi-montreux 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.440
 of pc to be able to run this thing in 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.360
 ultra 4k I already have it to 60 pictures sorry 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.640
 and it's good that the requirements 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:16.090
 recommended mark us an intel core i5 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:19.780
 34 73 points already hertz or the x8 efe x 83 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.660
 50 that good recommend us 8 gb of ram 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.430
 a nvidia gtx card 662 gigabyte or 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.140
 one mdh 78 70 and 65 gb space 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.690
 on the hard drive obviously this is for 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.190
 run it if I'm not wrong the ones 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.430
 recommended or to run it high 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.290
 then as now imagine what 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.050
 we are going to need to run it in ultra 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.020
 and good nothing else in ultra not the 4k and 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.240
 good at 60 fps if you are going to need a 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.940
 good processor a good graphic for 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.340
 to be able to run this beast on pc ok 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.500
 So, good people, this is the 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.840
 information that I bring to you today 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.700
 with respect to what is gta iv 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.500
 Obviously, we will be waiting 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.660
 the hicks we've been waiting for 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.430
 the blows from practically the 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.019
 principle announced them why 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.790
 part of the content that we could bring 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.519
 we stop raising people because they no longer 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.230
 had content to perform in what 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.700
 was the game no longer do we know out the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.890
 online missions and what the fuck 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.109

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.050
 hour they took in what they think of the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.940
 gta delay I started was the best 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.460
 option and obviously we know it's going to be 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.410
 a little gem this game I started but then 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.300
