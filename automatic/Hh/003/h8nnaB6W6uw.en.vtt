00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.549
 young people i am your palmers and 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.889
 welcome to the further gta 4 with video 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.750
 here on a canal and we heavy 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.810
 I can find myself here in 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:26.029
 This year's rich territory in gta 4 and 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.730
 who could already have realized otherwise 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.429
 I shiver the tree of yesteryear 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.860
 andreas beese won by gta 5 1 and 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.140
 one can consider here 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.500
 landscape is strong in any case 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.380
 it's ajar and we'll be the whole 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.030
 look at the topic in detail 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.010
 So it's one of the best mods of 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.000
 cards I would be every month 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.740
 had and that would definitely times 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.630
 demonstrate 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.440
 this density is very high as you could 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.920
 think he's in the game right from the start 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.440
 was in it 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.280
 as you can see on the left the map me 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.430
 mothballed the radar so much 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.420
 simply very important because that's one 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.380
 Large road network will also the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.850
 I suspect that I'm too easy 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.920
 So the street so the radar with three 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.670
 Murder just looks better that way 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.929
 just say the school very clearly 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.259
 and here, too, should not be surprised 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:31.369
 the higher I drive up so far away 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.439
 the camera goes from the car because quite 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.780
 simply it is not easy in the game 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.210
 provided that you have a car so high 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.109
 drive until silent because he walks around 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.789
 or something else and it's going on now 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.840
 not noticeable when it so it looks 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.970
 just different from a grandiose 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.570
 get a great look 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.970
 everything from her looks really looks 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:02.270
 strong out there with the lighthouse 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:06.260
 I'll just go there then 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:21.830
 here with the valley in any case 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:23.550
 already send her out to join her 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.540
 fate 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.540
 the doors open 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.349
 good wm first a bit further 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.090
 go up but is very scarce because 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.099
 drive up and a bit usual 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.670
 to get this over so smaller ones 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:43.550
 field lanes so far trampling lanes man out 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.920
 the car a partner with supercross 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.599
 So that handkes because you just want 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.739
 make it that's exciting as 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.739
 the mountains so down 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.020
 Just come and do it now 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.030
 Carspotting exactly I always get 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.230
 again the question how it with the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.000
 make all the space or here with the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.000
 Trainer 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.070
 You can find her video description too 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.770
 again the links to the tutorial where I am 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:22.960
 just show everything how to model so the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.160
 basis tricks or the basis thing and 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.920
 if he could take a look in 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.670
 linked to the video description 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.530
 Germany, of course, as always 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.240
 the link to the motto and this 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.820
 process also always a readme 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.350
 file where you exactly 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.670
 see how the murder is inserted and 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.930
 now because what I meant you see 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.240
 the camera is much further away from the 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.350
 motorcycle although not on the camera 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.350
 had changed perspective 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.500
 but it is steep 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.730
 the bridge too exactly 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.069
 we drive through the valley over the notes 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.360
 the valley 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.670
 I have to be real I like it a lot 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.500
 well, I'll be in the game in it 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.770
 to let 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.770
 in any case 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:25.229
 oh god now just above that 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.229
 go 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.379
 can you always look at the map 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.259
 you look very tall too 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:39.129
 in detail so it must say so it is 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.900
 a similarly good map as well as that of 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.219
 gta san andreas this red dead 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.219
 redemption app I presented because times 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:47.669
 would have 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.669
 torque approx 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.890
 boppard 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.550
 Oh oh oh 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.550
 it goes steep 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.450
 job 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.450
 the ampera we drive out of it 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.230
 I 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.870
 just a bit sporty 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.620
 Of course, they are really great here 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.440
 great cliff overhang 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.949
 can not be younger 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.949
 but the judge 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.630
 I'm pretty awesome 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.740
 i have got back where its true exactly 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.250
 at the bridge just over it 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.250
 jump 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:23.250
 we should go in the middle of the mountains besides 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:25.030
 through drum 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.039
 but somehow I have nothing 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:39.159
 spectacular 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:41.460
 the feeling it is serious if he 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.460
 get 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:49.989
 so we can go up there 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:07:01.979
 on the other hand, pauses stuck down 

00:06:49.989 --> 00:07:01.979
 God does not matter much to early 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:17.610
 he lubricates full pipe happens yes 

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:22.449
 exactly floating brakes made back 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.979
 can not shut down a bit 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:25.209
 his 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:26.559
 yes from this point wanted that 

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:29.259
 Recording program just stopped 

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:31.179
 join in and say goodbye 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.709
 Now this way I hope 

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:34.569
 Of course now if you like it 

00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:35.079
 liked the video one time 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:37.269
 thumbs up 

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:38.679
 and if you liked the mod then 

00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:40.209
 can you still take loud as ever 

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:41.439
 since he finds the link in the 

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:43.059
 video we'll see you next 

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:46.019
 video again I'm out 

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:46.019
