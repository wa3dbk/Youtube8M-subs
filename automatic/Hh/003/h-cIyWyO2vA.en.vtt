00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
called strain into it and you're into

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.620 
called strain into it and you're into
where<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.860> real<00:01:56.340> tough<00:01:56.640> blend<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.090> modules<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
where a real tough blend of modules and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.450 
where a real tough blend of modules and
placements<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.469> can't<00:01:58.740> falter

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460

ease<00:02:00.329> your<00:02:00.630> way<00:02:00.750> into<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.829> good

ease your way into it really is good

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.160 
ease your way into it really is good
straight<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> full-time<00:02:03.149> job<00:02:03.420> which

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
straight it's like a full-time job which

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.510 
straight it's like a full-time job which
is<00:02:04.320> something<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.710> was<00:02:04.920> really<00:02:05.130> good<00:02:05.340> really

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
is something that was really good really

is something that was really good really
I<00:02:05.610> mean<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> three<00:02:06.149> year<00:02:06.329> course<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.750> was

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
I mean the three year course I was

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.500 
I mean the three year course I was
perhaps<00:02:08.250> coming<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.850> one<00:02:09.060> day<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.270> week<00:02:09.450> for

perhaps coming in one day a week for

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.560 
perhaps coming in one day a week for
maybe<00:02:09.900> a<00:02:09.990> dissertation<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> workshop

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
maybe a dissertation with a workshop

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.830

stress that enough really is you know
you<00:02:57.180> probably<00:02:57.420> only<00:02:57.720> spend<00:02:57.960> twenty<00:02:58.350> one

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500

twenty two weeks of the course in school
you<00:03:01.320> know<00:03:01.380> if<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.770> was<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:03.000> know<00:03:03.030> tell<00:03:03.750> the

you know if I was to you know tell the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.080 
you know if I was to you know tell the
people<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.230> PGCE<00:03:04.620> what<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.340> would<00:03:05.820> like<00:03:05.970> to

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
people of the PGCE what I would like to

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.430 
people of the PGCE what I would like to
see<00:03:06.270> more<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.810> would<00:03:06.900> probably<00:03:07.170> be<00:03:07.290> more

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
see more of it would probably be more

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.830 
see more of it would probably be more
time<00:03:07.710> in<00:03:07.890> school<00:03:08.010> because<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:09.270> experience

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
is just you can't it's just all so pasty

there's<00:03:19.410> even<00:03:19.680> heavy<00:03:19.830> strategies<00:03:20.390> that's<00:03:21.390> how

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
there's even heavy strategies that's how

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.660 
there's even heavy strategies that's how
you<00:03:21.630> assess<00:03:22.020> pieces<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.410> work<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:23.250> can't

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
you assess pieces of work you can't

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.490 
you assess pieces of work you can't
actually<00:03:24.030> do<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.660> unless<00:03:24.780> you've<00:03:24.989> got<00:03:25.200> into

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
actually do it unless you've got into

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.990 
actually do it unless you've got into
the<00:03:25.560> schools<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.250> find<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:26.670> out<00:03:26.880> for

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
the schools and you find that out for

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.590 
the schools and you find that out for
yourself

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
yourself

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.900 
yourself
so<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.560> behavior<00:03:28.680> strategies<00:03:29.100> for<00:03:29.489> example

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
so the behavior strategies for example

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.449 
so the behavior strategies for example
that<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.060> learned<00:03:30.450> in<00:03:30.840> university<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:31.890> guess<00:03:32.280> are

that I learned in university I guess are

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
being able to go into that and apply

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.470 
being able to go into that and apply
them<00:03:34.140> but<00:03:34.800> if<00:03:35.550> it<00:03:35.760> doesn't<00:03:35.940> work<00:03:36.180> with<00:03:36.360> our

them but if it doesn't work with our

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.350 
them but if it doesn't work with our
school<00:03:37.640> you're<00:03:38.640> not<00:03:38.790> going<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.030> get<00:03:39.120> anywhere

so it's about adapting and about finding

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.720 
so it's about adapting and about finding
what's<00:03:42.360> best<00:03:42.600> for<00:03:42.930> your<00:03:43.410> teaching<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.310> then

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
what's best for your teaching and then

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.310 
what's best for your teaching and then
