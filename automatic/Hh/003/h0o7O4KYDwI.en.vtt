00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
exotic effects USA this pedal it sounds

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.929 
exotic effects USA this pedal it sounds
really<00:00:22.540> really<00:00:22.840> sweet<00:00:23.619> it's<00:00:24.189> designed<00:00:24.579> to<00:00:24.730> be

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
really really sweet it's designed to be

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.630 
really really sweet it's designed to be
absolutely<00:00:25.540> 100%<00:00:25.989> transparent<00:00:26.890> well<00:00:27.040> 99

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
absolutely 100% transparent well 99

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.490 
absolutely 100% transparent well 99
percent<00:00:27.970> transparent<00:00:28.570> and<00:00:28.779> I<00:00:29.079> had<00:00:29.230> quite<00:00:29.410> a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
percent transparent and I had quite a

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.109 
percent transparent and I had quite a
bit<00:00:29.649> of<00:00:29.739> gain<00:00:29.919> to<00:00:30.070> your<00:00:30.189> tour<00:00:30.399> so<00:00:30.759> here's<00:00:30.970> my

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
bit of gain to your tour so here's my

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:44.669 
bit of gain to your tour so here's my
clean<00:00:31.360> sound<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:44.079> now<00:00:44.199> I'm<00:00:44.260> going<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.440> kick<00:00:44.559> in

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:44.679 
clean sound so now I'm going to kick in

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:46.619 
clean sound so now I'm going to kick in
the<00:00:44.769> pedal<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.219> I'm<00:00:45.489> gonna<00:00:45.640> keep<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.329> gain<00:00:46.480> to

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
the pedal and I'm gonna keep the gain to

00:00:46.629 --> 00:01:09.150 
the pedal and I'm gonna keep the gain to
a<00:00:46.660> minimum<00:00:47.050> and<00:00:47.199> leave<00:00:47.289> the<00:00:47.410> EQ<00:00:47.800> flat

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.230 

so<00:01:10.160> you<00:01:10.250> can<00:01:10.370> hear<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.610> adds<00:01:10.760> a<00:01:10.880> little<00:01:10.970> bit<00:01:11.180> of

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
so you can hear it adds a little bit of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.850 
so you can hear it adds a little bit of
warmth<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.750> little<00:01:12.050> bit<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.260> presence<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.740> the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
warmth a little bit of presence to the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.560 
warmth a little bit of presence to the
sonim<00:01:13.160> but<00:01:13.280> on<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.790> whole<00:01:13.940> that<00:01:14.120> keeps<00:01:14.360> it

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
sonim but on the whole that keeps it

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.820 
sonim but on the whole that keeps it
pretty<00:01:15.140> much<00:01:15.260> a<00:01:15.320> hundred<00:01:15.740> percent

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
pretty much a hundred percent

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.700 
pretty much a hundred percent
transparent<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.360> that's<00:01:17.600> great<00:01:18.229> because<00:01:18.590> you

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
transparent and that's great because you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.350 
transparent and that's great because you
can<00:01:18.800> use<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.010> as<00:01:19.220> a<00:01:19.250> boost<00:01:19.610> if<00:01:19.850> you<00:01:19.940> want<00:01:20.120> to<00:01:20.210> put

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
can use it as a boost if you want to put

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.940 
can use it as a boost if you want to put
it<00:01:20.450> in<00:01:20.510> front<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.720> your<00:01:20.870> OverDrive's<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:21.890> I'm

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
it in front of your OverDrive's so I'm

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.080 
it in front of your OverDrive's so I'm
going<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.100> turn<00:01:22.220> up<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.400> gain<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:22.700> little<00:01:22.820> bit

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
going to turn up the gain a little bit

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.280 
going to turn up the gain a little bit
and<00:01:23.210> let<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:23.420> are<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.690> overdrive<00:01:24.080> sound

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
and let you are the overdrive sound

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:49.670 
and let you are the overdrive sound
zones<00:01:24.590> like

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.710 

so<00:01:50.680> it's<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.920> really<00:01:51.310> really<00:01:51.640> really<00:01:52.360> sweet

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
so it's a really really really sweet

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.900 
so it's a really really really sweet
sounding<00:01:53.110> overdrive<00:01:53.560> this<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.700> third

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
sounding overdrive this is the third

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.910 
sounding overdrive this is the third
pedal<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.750> line<00:01:55.960> of<00:01:56.230> preamps<00:01:56.770> they've

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
pedal and the line of preamps they've

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.100 
pedal and the line of preamps they've
got<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.160> RC<00:01:57.520> booster<00:01:57.670> or<00:01:58.030> red<00:01:58.300> conductor<00:01:58.810> the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
got the RC booster or red conductor the

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.800 
got the RC booster or red conductor the
AC<00:01:59.260> booster<00:01:59.560> which<00:02:00.070> has<00:02:00.360> almost<00:02:01.360> clean<00:02:01.630> and

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
AC booster which has almost clean and

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.410 
AC booster which has almost clean and
the<00:02:02.350> V<00:02:02.470> V<00:02:02.650> which<00:02:02.920> has<00:02:03.100> Blues<00:02:03.580> breaker<00:02:03.940> so<00:02:04.270> it's

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
the V V which has Blues breaker so it's

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.600 
the V V which has Blues breaker so it's
got<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.690> highest<00:02:04.840> gain<00:02:05.200> over<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.770> three<00:02:05.980> I'm

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
got the highest gain over the three I'm

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.920 
got the highest gain over the three I'm
going<00:02:06.790> to<00:02:06.880> crank<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.180> gain<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.510> let<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.720> hear

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
going to crank the gain and let you hear

00:02:07.930 --> 00:03:17.690 
going to crank the gain and let you hear
what<00:02:08.050> this<00:02:08.170> pedal<00:02:08.440> can<00:02:08.590> do<00:02:08.820> with<00:02:09.820> more<00:02:10.030> gain

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.400 

really<00:03:18.700> really<00:03:19.000> nice<00:03:19.240> hanging<00:03:19.480> paddle<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.290> now

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
really really nice hanging paddle so now

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.450 
really really nice hanging paddle so now
I'm<00:03:20.500> going<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.680> turn<00:03:20.770> it<00:03:20.890> in<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.040> gain<00:03:21.190> boost

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
I'm going to turn it in the gain boost

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.650 
I'm going to turn it in the gain boost
the<00:03:21.640> volume<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.060> let<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.270> hear<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.540> as<00:03:22.630> a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
the volume and let you hear it as a

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:55.240 
the volume and let you hear it as a
boost<00:03:31.710> here's<00:03:32.710> the<00:03:32.830> clean<00:03:32.980> signal

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.830 

so<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.340> can<00:03:56.459> hear<00:03:56.640> it's<00:03:56.819> pushing<00:03:57.030> my<00:03:57.299> 30<00:03:57.599> watt

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
so you can hear it's pushing my 30 watt

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.640 
so you can hear it's pushing my 30 watt
amplifier<00:03:58.079> into<00:03:58.620> absolute<00:03:59.610> overdrive<00:04:00.269> heaven

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
amplifier into absolute overdrive heaven

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.809 
amplifier into absolute overdrive heaven
now<00:04:01.650> I'm<00:04:01.709> going<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:01.920> show<00:04:02.069> you<00:04:02.099> what<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.489> EQ

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
now I'm going to show you what the EQ

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.490 
now I'm going to show you what the EQ
can<00:04:03.000> do<00:04:03.150> it's<00:04:03.390> got<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.599> treble<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.110> bass

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
can do it's got a treble and bass

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.770 
can do it's got a treble and bass
control<00:04:04.860> which<00:04:05.129> is<00:04:05.159> really<00:04:05.730> really<00:04:06.180> useful<00:04:06.420> if

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
control which is really really useful if

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.300 
control which is really really useful if
you<00:04:06.870> change<00:04:07.110> amplifiers<00:04:07.650> quite<00:04:07.890> a<00:04:07.920> lot<00:04:08.129> if

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
you change amplifiers quite a lot if

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.949 
you change amplifiers quite a lot if
you're<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.459> session<00:04:08.849> musician<00:04:08.879> or<00:04:09.450> if<00:04:09.840> you're

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
you're a session musician or if you're

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.929 
you're a session musician or if you're
just<00:04:10.140> never<00:04:10.230> happy<00:04:10.680> with<00:04:10.769> your<00:04:10.890> tone<00:04:11.069> like

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
just never happy with your tone like

00:04:11.939 --> 00:05:07.980 
just never happy with your tone like
myself

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:20.370 

I<00:05:18.660> don't<00:05:19.660> know<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:19.780> thing<00:05:19.900> I<00:05:19.960> like<00:05:20.080> about<00:05:20.110> this

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
I don't know the thing I like about this

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.380 
I don't know the thing I like about this
pedal<00:05:20.740> is<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:21.040> EQ<00:05:21.400> has<00:05:21.550> a<00:05:21.580> little<00:05:21.910> two<00:05:22.030> tone<00:05:22.240> at

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
pedal is the EQ has a little two tone at
