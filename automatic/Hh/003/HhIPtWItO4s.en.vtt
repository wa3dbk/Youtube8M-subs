00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.740 
actually just went out riding but I
didn't<00:02:22.580> make<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.700> video<00:02:22.880> because<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.360> GoPro

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
didn't make a video because the GoPro

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.570 
didn't make a video because the GoPro
died<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.510> here's<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.930> motor<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:28.430> uh

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
died so here's the motor it's uh

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.220 
died so here's the motor it's uh
obviously<00:02:29.300> Suzuki<00:02:30.040> 440<00:02:31.040> liquid-cooled<00:02:32.230> these

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
obviously Suzuki 440 liquid-cooled these

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.600 
obviously Suzuki 440 liquid-cooled these
things<00:02:33.470> are<00:02:33.620> pretty<00:02:33.740> notorious<00:02:34.010> for<00:02:34.430> power

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
things are pretty notorious for power

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.160 
things are pretty notorious for power
valve<00:02:34.880> problems<00:02:35.270> but<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.690> previous<00:02:35.990> owner

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
valve problems but the previous owner

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.080 
valve problems but the previous owner
said<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:37.010> was<00:02:37.190> corrected<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.760> that's<00:02:37.880> why<00:02:38.030> the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
said it was corrected and that's why the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.570 
said it was corrected and that's why the
power<00:02:38.300> belts<00:02:38.600> are<00:02:38.720> marked<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:40.040> taken<00:02:40.340> apart

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
power belts are marked and taken apart

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.050 
power belts are marked and taken apart
obviously<00:02:41.090> he<00:02:41.510> could<00:02:41.630> tell<00:02:41.780> by<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.310> heads<00:02:43.310> on

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
obviously he could tell by the heads on

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.600 
obviously he could tell by the heads on
the<00:02:44.770> bolts<00:02:45.770> right<00:02:45.920> there<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:48.500> yeah<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.520> was
