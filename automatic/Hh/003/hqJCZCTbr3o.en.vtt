00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
of curly brackets in ID 332 which is for

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.469 
of curly brackets in ID 332 which is for
snowball<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.799> see<00:01:31.950> snowball<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.790> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
snowball so you can see snowball and I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420 
snowball so you can see snowball and I

can no longer pick that up and that's

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.170 
can no longer pick that up and that's
because<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.880> don't<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> count<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.100> so

because I don't have a count in there so

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.179 
because I don't have a count in there so
that's<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.390> stay<00:01:39.570> there<00:01:39.860> for<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> long

sure<00:02:28.340> if<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.610> would<00:02:28.880> just<00:02:29.060> happen<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.420> me<00:02:29.570> or

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
sure if that would just happen to me or

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:43.780 
sure if that would just happen to me or
what<00:02:30.020> but<00:02:30.640> yeah<00:02:31.840> made<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.870> really<00:02:33.200> annoying

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.099 

so<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.599> up<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.560> know<00:02:46.650> alright<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:48.109> now

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
so you up to you know alright so now

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.589 
so you up to you know alright so now
we've<00:02:49.260> got<00:02:49.439> summon<00:02:49.890> item<00:02:50.640> coordinates

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
we've got summon item coordinates

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.890 
we've got summon item coordinates
I<00:02:51.629> had<00:02:52.079> a<00:02:52.109> my<00:02:52.439> d3<00:02:52.890> 32<00:02:53.280> riding<00:02:53.760> ID<00:02:54.150> silverfish

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
I had a my d3 32 riding ID silverfish

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.300 
I had a my d3 32 riding ID silverfish
and<00:02:55.140> now<00:02:55.920> we've<00:02:56.129> got<00:02:56.310> active<00:02:56.790> effects<00:02:57.420> and

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
and now we've got active effects and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.140 
and now we've got active effects and
we've<00:02:59.310> got<00:02:59.489> invisibility<00:03:01.189> so<00:03:02.189> now<00:03:02.400> there's

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
we've got invisibility so now there's

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.379 
we've got invisibility so now there's
this<00:03:03.209> ball<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:04.409> just<00:03:04.590> moving<00:03:04.920> around<00:03:08.389> now

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
this ball it's just moving around now

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.089 
this ball it's just moving around now
now<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.019> can<00:03:13.169> see<00:03:13.379> every<00:03:13.739> time<00:03:13.769> that

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
now and you can see every time that

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.729 
now and you can see every time that
happens<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.849> kill<00:03:15.659> one<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.840> these<00:03:16.019> my<00:03:16.290> hits<00:03:16.560> go

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
happens I kill one of these my hits go

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.809 
happens I kill one of these my hits go
up<00:03:16.859> and<00:03:17.329> yeah<00:03:18.329> that's<00:03:18.540> why<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:20.489> that's<00:03:20.700> how

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
up and yeah that's why and that's how

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.009 
up and yeah that's why and that's how
you<00:03:20.879> get<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.060> hints<00:03:21.389> with<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.599> new<00:03:21.720> scoreboard

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
you get a hints with the new scoreboard

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.140 
you get a hints with the new scoreboard
system<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:23.519> that's<00:03:23.609> four<00:03:23.879> not<00:03:24.419> five<00:03:25.849> now<00:03:26.849> we've

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
system so that's four not five now we've

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.709 
system so that's four not five now we've
got<00:03:27.329> summoned<00:03:27.810> item<00:03:28.849> coordinates<00:03:29.849> item<00:03:30.480> ID

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:30.719 
got summoned item coordinates item ID

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.860 
got summoned item coordinates item ID
332<00:03:31.530> writing<00:03:31.950> ID<00:03:32.099> silverfish<00:03:32.730> active<00:03:33.599> effect

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
332 writing ID silverfish active effect

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.379 
332 writing ID silverfish active effect
what<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.769> need<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.010> do<00:03:35.099> for<00:03:35.280> invisibility<00:03:35.669> and

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
what you need to do for invisibility and

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.750 
what you need to do for invisibility and
now<00:03:36.540> we've<00:03:36.750> got<00:03:36.930> attributes<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.950> we've<00:03:38.609> got

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
now we've got attributes and we've got

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.209 
now we've got attributes and we've got
quite<00:03:38.939> a<00:03:39.030> few<00:03:39.120> attributes<00:03:39.419> actually<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:40.469> its

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:41.219 
quite a few attributes actually so its

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.550 
quite a few attributes actually so its
attributes<00:03:41.909> :<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:42.870> set<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.169> square<00:03:43.379> brackets

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
attributes : the set of square brackets

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.530 
attributes : the set of square brackets
the<00:03:43.950> name<00:03:43.980> generic<00:03:44.879> movement<00:03:45.419> speed<00:03:46.280> base<00:03:47.540> 0.0

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
the name generic movement speed base 0.0

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.920 
the name generic movement speed base 0.0
so<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.229> not<00:03:49.349> going<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.590> move<00:03:49.739> at<00:03:49.889> all<00:03:50.930> name

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
so it's not going to move at all name

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.929 
so it's not going to move at all name
generic<00:03:52.739> Maxwell's<00:03:53.459> bait<00:03:53.729> base<00:03:54.260> 0.1<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.500> it's

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
generic Maxwell's bait base 0.1 so it's

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.589 
generic Maxwell's bait base 0.1 so it's
0.1<00:03:56.939> of<00:03:57.180> its<00:03:57.720> usual<00:03:57.870> health<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.590> think<00:03:59.599> generic

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
0.1 of its usual health I think generic

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.110 
0.1 of its usual health I think generic
attack<00:04:01.439> damage<00:04:01.680> based<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.280> airplane<00:04:02.609> zero<00:04:02.879> so

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
attack damage based the airplane zero so

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.569 
attack damage based the airplane zero so
it<00:04:03.209> won't<00:04:03.419> attack<00:04:03.689> at<00:04:03.900> all<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.260> generic<00:04:05.250> don't

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
it won't attack at all and generic don't

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.740 
it won't attack at all and generic don't
knock<00:04:05.849> back<00:04:06.090> resistance<00:04:06.629> based<00:04:07.250> 0.0<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.750> it's

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
knock back resistance based 0.0 so it's

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.749 
knock back resistance based 0.0 so it's
not<00:04:09.930> got<00:04:10.169> no<00:04:10.530> resistance<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.220> knock<00:04:11.340> back<00:04:11.519> and

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:11.759 
not got no resistance to knock back and

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:14.990 
not got no resistance to knock back and
now<00:04:12.590> as<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.709> can<00:04:13.769> see<00:04:14.099> it<00:04:14.370> goes<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.549> lot<00:04:14.729> further

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
now as you can see it goes a lot further

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.110 
now as you can see it goes a lot further
and<00:04:15.540> it's<00:04:15.780> already<00:04:16.049> dead

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.080 

all<00:04:20.019> right<00:04:20.579> and<00:04:22.290> now<00:04:23.290> on<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:24.370> end<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.760> all<00:04:24.880> that

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
all right and now on the end of all that

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.390 
all right and now on the end of all that
we<00:04:25.720> have<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:25.990> motion<00:04:26.440> tax<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:27.100> motion<00:04:27.580> :<00:04:28.389> 0.0<00:04:29.400> 0.9

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
we have a motion tax a motion : 0.0 0.9

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:42.120 
we have a motion tax a motion : 0.0 0.9
and<00:04:30.820> minus<00:04:31.660> 1.8<00:04:32.410> for<00:04:33.340> this<00:04:40.350> yeah<00:04:41.350> as<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:42.100> can

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
and minus 1.8 for this yeah as you can

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:52.469 
and minus 1.8 for this yeah as you can
see<00:04:42.460> it's<00:04:43.000> being<00:04:43.180> thrown<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.930> then<00:04:50.350> last<00:04:51.479> as

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
see it's being thrown and then last as

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.520 
see it's being thrown and then last as
so<00:04:52.990> far

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
so far

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.480 
so far
these<00:04:54.070> are<00:04:54.580> unpickable<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:56.350> on<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:57.130> end<00:04:57.250> I've

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
these are unpickable so on the end I've

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.050 
these are unpickable so on the end I've
got<00:04:57.669> an<00:04:57.760> edge<00:04:57.970> tank<00:04:58.360> so<00:04:58.600> they'll<00:04:58.780> just<00:04:58.930> despawn

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
got an edge tank so they'll just despawn

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.159 
got an edge tank so they'll just despawn
after<00:05:01.060> around<00:05:01.389> 4<00:05:01.660> seconds<00:05:02.229> so<00:05:02.680> age<00:05:03.580> :<00:05:04.240> 5<00:05:04.540> 9<00:05:04.570> 20

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
after around 4 seconds so age : 5 9 20

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.420 
after around 4 seconds so age : 5 9 20
and<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.740> D<00:05:05.919> spawns<00:05:06.190> at<00:05:06.370> 6000<00:05:07.090> ticks<00:05:08.250> so<00:05:09.250> you

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
and the D spawns at 6000 ticks so you

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.800 
and the D spawns at 6000 ticks so you
can<00:05:09.580> see<00:05:10.590> they<00:05:11.590> spawned<00:05:12.660> alright<00:05:13.660> this<00:05:13.750> has

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
can see they spawned alright this has

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.420 
can see they spawned alright this has
