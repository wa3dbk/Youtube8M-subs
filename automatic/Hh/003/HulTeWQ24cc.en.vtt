00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.060
 so that's a short demonstration of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.719
 Remote control for the parking heater at 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.179
 audi a3 8v think this remote so 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.219
 she looks 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.369
 it will be the same in other audi models 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.779
 that actually give to activate the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.420
 Remote control presses the bottom 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.490
 left button the companies in contact with the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.420
 vehicle on and shows me in the case 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.349
 that a programming exists 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.910
 I have this programming in 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.289
 vehicle made that is the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.510
 I program in the vehicle 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.610
 I do that with the remote control 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.500
 I am identical that means I can 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.050
 an existing programming too 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.520
 change here or from here one 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.469
 and then see them in the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.239
 activate vehicle in mma in the case 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.340
 is the departure time for thursday 10 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.100
 30 does not program the possibility 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.420
 on question marks so this 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.270
 to delete programming 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.350
 if I decide for example 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.699
 not to leave tomorrow 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.900
 So now press ok and according to 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.010
 the programming is deleted the same way 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.580
 well, I can also programming 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.740
 make 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.600
 I press the button again 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.380
 compound is added to the vehicle 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 The selections are to be activated immediately in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.390
 the fall 30 minutes I can go to 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.939
 wish change up to an hour and 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.170
 ten minutes 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.700
 if I press ok now the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.509
 parking heater then according to immediately 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 jump 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.259
 the second option i have is if 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.869
 I again this lower left button 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.909
 press the time programming 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.509
 make 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.790
 that is, for example, 10 o'clock 30 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:52.409
 well we want to drive earlier so do 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.530
 we seven o'clock ok the weekday in the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.840
 Thursday thursday that the morning 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 automatically selected the next day 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.149
 Of course I can say that too 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.240
 rather the day after tomorrow and so on 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.539
 we have to be at 7 o'clock tomorrow with ok 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.900
 I confirm all the data 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.239
 are transferred to the vehicle 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.180
 It is 7am confirmed the same to me 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.790
 Stammplatz and programmed the vehicle 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.040
 stands in the case 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.939
 about 800 meters away so the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.900
 reach is more than adequate 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.060
 if I but then 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.379
 change programming 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.659
 I press again on the lower left 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:39.099
 button counts more which ones 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.150
 programming is present and ok 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.239
 I am programming again 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.239
 Clear 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.150
 so far a very short introduction to the 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.150
 features of the remote control thank you very much
