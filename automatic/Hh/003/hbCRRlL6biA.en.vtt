00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960 

I<00:00:00.089> discovered<00:00:00.870> a<00:00:01.140> fun<00:00:01.949> thing<00:00:02.190> on<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.429> m3

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:06.970 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.710 

f30

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:09.720 
f30

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.980 
f30
and<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.100> power<00:00:11.850> meteor

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.910 

I<00:00:17.050> guess

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.300 

yes<00:00:21.490> power<00:00:21.910> and<00:00:23.310> torque<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.630> if<00:00:25.779> I<00:00:26.189> got<00:00:27.189> an

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
yes power and torque so if I got an

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.439 
yes power and torque so if I got an
automatic

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.170 

they<00:00:35.079> take<00:00:35.350> leases

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.920 

question<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:38.960> will<00:00:39.320> it<00:00:39.350> go<00:00:39.590> over<00:00:39.980> for<00:00:40.219> 30

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
question is will it go over for 30

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.180 
question is will it go over for 30
because<00:00:41.930> this<00:00:42.170> should<00:00:42.320> have<00:00:42.440> for<00:00:42.680> 30<00:00:42.920> or

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
because this should have for 30 or

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.550 
because this should have for 30 or
sparse<00:00:43.430> right

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.029 

yes<00:00:51.220> it<00:00:51.520> like<00:00:52.180> around<00:00:52.330> 450<00:00:53.320> or

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.930
