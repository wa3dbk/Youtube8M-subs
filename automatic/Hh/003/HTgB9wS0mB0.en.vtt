00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.539
 yes hello together i 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.359
 I explain you briefly and concisely how that 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:28.630
 so does the work here have the 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:33.370
 fish we have flounder and pores 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:39.199
 In a nutshell I use 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:42.650
 table salt about a pool of eight 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:47.059
 percent that would be with me now I suppose 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:52.870
 three liters of water on 260 grams of salt like 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.870
 it is said to be done in the water 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:05.620
 so we did not mix set club 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.620
 have more and everything beautifully resolved 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.780
 it's best to keep stirring for a while 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:20.320
 afterward they have poured over 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.320
 The fish is all well covered 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:33.070
 look like that today and that stays that way 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:38.320
 the twelve hours rest 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:41.570
 and that's when we'll be back later 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.280
 Now we are back to the place of 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.420
 particular presentation 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.170
 This was the joke dry 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.079
 let's call the flow the leg i put 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.439
 with me because mostly second more 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:59.329
 it happens so we have on the 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:08.840
 hook the fire is burning and then the can 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:11.390
 Gar process add doors like this 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.329
 Here I am and what is still observed 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.310
 I should be about an hour 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:22.329
 at 90 degrees and then there's I smoke 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.329
 I 'll be back later 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.190
 So we keep the temperature at about 90 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.190
 Degree 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.090
 our fish are now an hour 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:56.250
 had time 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:58.260
 Let's look after it should look good 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.209
 and where do we start with the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.049
 Actual process with smoking 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:12.750
 I do not use a rich mail 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:28.769
 users of normal cake pieces I 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:39.870
 now , so to speak , the fire is now 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:42.980
 That should be smothered and becomes one 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.980
 given hour of smoke 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.220
 As you can see fire extinguished the quad 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.220
 and the doors closed 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.930
 the first half hour so looks good 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.180
 yes we have one hour now 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.750
 noise for me are the fish gold 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.320
 money and only if we have the 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.530
 whole process and take it fresh 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.530
 the smoke 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.770
 but has also managed 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:02.330
 yes we are done it was just the 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:06.020
 Guidance how to do 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:09.570
 the dog has exhibitions as you can see 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:13.110
 and I say it's me 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:15.950

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.950
