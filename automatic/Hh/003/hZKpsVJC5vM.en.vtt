00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.340

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.830
 games I might have is something 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.520
 while link is just in one 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:23.760
 description short info today 18 o'clock 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:28.170
 probably the last detour to the wasteland 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.789
 fallout 3 testchance the last will be the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.210
 Last chance a woman for us too 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:40.860
 because tomorrow from 18 o'clock is then 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.890
 a playhouse with the stream and then 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.379
 is already the 19th 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:51.360
 then three starts again in the stream 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.190
 I usually picture every day like this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.840
 18 o'clock 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.399
 sometimes it will be at 19 o'clock between 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.640
 18 and 19 clock on facebook twitter 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.800
 give me that always known this 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.510
 youtube videos I'll stop two 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.090
 once a week or just one 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.439
 pending another game 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.390
 probably in the morning for this too 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.850
 especially the game of the announcement otherwise 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.369
 yes facebook and twitter was from 18 o'clock 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.460
 then with witcher 3 anyway daily then 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.009
 in the evening unless it comes from 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.680
 then there is the social media 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.110
 danced things okay yes some have 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.509
 as ep desired but the game so long 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.430
 lasts, i think i will 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.490
 over the time more fun you the stream 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.220
 as if on youtube then stop 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 some putts may interest 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.930
 is gone or she at such a long 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.869
 play especially as i think i am 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.720
 then stop the motivation 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.860
 or the fun then interactive 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.979
 the whole thing to do that I do that 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.560
 better suited 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:09.360
 mario is still on youtube 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.489
 very likely a new project 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.069
 I know that, I already say that 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.280
 longer need to 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.579
 I was finding people now and then 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.420
 it will also take place with the days 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.420
 crisis together 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.769
 otherwise I think about a new one 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:36.260
 minecraft season I know I have to 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:40.280
 First, raise the news for it 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.560
 are so depressing you know cafÃ© and 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.750
 Messages you the maxis format and 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.909
 it is also too depressing 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.709
 Maybe then something bullshit 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.829
 You know that I'm remodeling or you 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.400
 say what it 's about nonsense 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:03.260
 chatter 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:05.840
 yes so announced youtube is no 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.590
 panic new project also and laundry 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.939
 then from 19 o'clock in the stream also daily from 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.599
 6 pm or 7 pm I'm not like that 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:19.720
 quite reliably I admit that, but yes 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.239
 Otherwise, I usually turn everyday 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.629
 then you have to stop the social 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.859
 Media does the thing 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.509
 i do these youtube videos 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.549
 announcement videos once the 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.449
 week or halt it comes out to play 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.000
 If I am tomorrow after an announcement 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:38.209
 for this game 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.409
 yes that was it that one the information so 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.949
 we'll be there at the turn 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:45.099

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.099
