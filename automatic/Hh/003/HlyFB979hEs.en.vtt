of fat or silver skin which I'll show in
just<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.899> minute<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.350> I'm<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.799> use<00:01:52.979> this

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
just a minute so I'm going to use this

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.819 
just a minute so I'm going to use this
knife<00:01:54.030> almost<00:01:54.479> all<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> way<00:01:54.990> through<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
knife almost all the way through and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.440 
knife almost all the way through and
I'll<00:01:55.890> continue<00:01:56.100> cutting<00:01:56.549> away<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.030> lobe<00:01:57.299> of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
I'll continue cutting away that lobe of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.899 
I'll continue cutting away that lobe of
meat<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.530> set<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.740> aside

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
meat and just set it aside

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.380 
meat and just set it aside
so<00:02:01.810> now<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.469> have<00:02:02.680> two<00:02:03.009> more<00:02:03.610> managable<00:02:04.210> cuts

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
so now we have two more managable cuts

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.389 
so now we have two more managable cuts
of<00:02:04.570> meat<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:05.530> doesn't<00:02:05.860> look<00:02:05.979> like<00:02:06.009> this

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
of meat it doesn't look like this

particular<00:02:06.939> roast<00:02:07.119> has<00:02:07.329> any<00:02:07.539> more<00:02:07.719> fat<00:02:08.020> lines

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
particular roast has any more fat lines

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.320 
particular roast has any more fat lines
but<00:02:08.800> some<00:02:09.009> roast<00:02:09.220> will<00:02:09.399> have<00:02:09.580> three<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.119> you

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
but some roast will have three and you

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.720 
but some roast will have three and you
would<00:02:10.509> just<00:02:10.630> pull<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.929> into<00:02:11.140> thirds<00:02:11.349> so<00:02:11.730> let's

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
would just pull it into thirds so let's

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.030 
would just pull it into thirds so let's
proceed<00:02:12.910> now<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:13.660> can<00:02:13.900> cut<00:02:14.080> away<00:02:14.170> any<00:02:14.500> excess

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
proceed now I can cut away any excess

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.830 
proceed now I can cut away any excess

fat or silver skin and I should point

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.110 
fat or silver skin and I should point
out<00:02:16.989> what<00:02:17.230> silver<00:02:17.590> skin<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.849> kind<00:02:19.060> of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
out what silver skin is this kind of

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.089

filmy<00:02:19.510> tissue<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:20.110> coats<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.590> meat<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:21.010> may

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
filmy tissue that coats the meat and may

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.530 
filmy tissue that coats the meat and may
be<00:02:21.160> found<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.640> outside<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.239> meat<00:02:22.360> or

be found on the outside of the meat or

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.199 
be found on the outside of the meat or
even<00:02:23.080> inside<00:02:23.319> as<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.769> see<00:02:23.950> here<00:02:24.310> now<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.030> never

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
even inside as you see here now it never

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.390 
even inside as you see here now it never
breaks<00:02:25.569> down<00:02:25.840> during<00:02:26.410> cooking<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:26.890> fat<00:02:27.160> will

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
breaks down during cooking like fat will

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.890 
breaks down during cooking like fat will
and<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.700> actually<00:02:28.030> becomes<00:02:28.239> tougher<00:02:28.720> and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
and it actually becomes tougher and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.229 
and it actually becomes tougher and
tougher<00:02:28.959> as<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.560> cooking<00:02:29.769> goes<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:31.030> let<00:02:31.150> me

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
tougher as the cooking goes on so let me

tougher as the cooking goes on so let me
show<00:02:31.390> how<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.170> rid<00:02:32.349> of<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.530> just<00:02:32.709> take

the stew so let's just again get a
little<00:03:11.980> handle<00:03:12.400> there<00:03:12.640> on<00:03:12.819> it<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.359> cut<00:03:13.569> that

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
little handle there on it and cut that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.530 
little handle there on it and cut that
away<00:03:14.019> you<00:03:14.049> can<00:03:14.319> see<00:03:14.440> it's<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:14.680> really<00:03:15.540> hard

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
away you can see it's just really hard

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.420 
away you can see it's just really hard
it's<00:03:16.780> almost<00:03:17.049> as<00:03:17.170> tough<00:03:17.319> as<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.590> meat<00:03:17.769> so<00:03:18.250> get

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
it's almost as tough as the meat so get

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
it's almost as tough as the meat so get
rid<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.579> that<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:20.880> see<00:03:21.880> I've<00:03:22.000> found<00:03:22.269> another

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
rid of that and see I've found another

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.590 
rid of that and see I've found another
fat<00:03:22.870> line<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:23.500> now<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:24.040> can<00:03:24.730> go<00:03:24.850> ahead<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.299> rip

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
fat line so now I can go ahead and rip

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.199 
fat line so now I can go ahead and rip
this<00:03:25.989> meat<00:03:26.370> right<00:03:27.370> through<00:03:27.609> as<00:03:27.700> well

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.240 

the<00:03:30.840> more<00:03:31.049> you<00:03:31.170> open<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.500> meet<00:03:31.680> up<00:03:31.829> easier

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
the more you open the meet up easier

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.979 
the more you open the meet up easier
it's<00:03:32.370> going<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.640> be<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.879> get<00:03:32.969> rid<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:33.629> hard

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
it's going to be to get rid of this hard

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.420 
it's going to be to get rid of this hard
fat<00:03:34.319> that's<00:03:34.650> exactly<00:03:35.250> what<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.489> want<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.730> do

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.979

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
but if you press on the fat and it's

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.569 
but if you press on the fat and it's
soft<00:03:43.290> it's<00:03:43.620> okay<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:43.950> keep<00:03:44.129> it<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.340> there<00:03:44.459> it's

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
soft it's okay to keep it in there it's

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:45.800 
soft it's okay to keep it in there it's
going<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.849> melt<00:03:45.150> into<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.359> student<00:03:45.719> I

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
going to melt into the student I

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.720 
going to melt into the student I
actually<00:03:45.900> make<00:03:46.230> your<00:03:46.439> your<00:03:47.010> sauce<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.370> your

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:15.409 
large Dutch oven you don't want to trim
this<00:04:14.340> away<00:04:14.549> until<00:04:14.819> it<00:04:14.909> turns<00:04:15.090> into<00:04:15.239> a

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
this away until it turns into a

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:16.729 
this away until it turns into a
tenderloin<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:16.139> is<00:04:16.410> for<00:04:16.590> sure

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
tenderloin that is for sure

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.979 
tenderloin that is for sure
now<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.579> may<00:04:17.729> look<00:04:18.150> like<00:04:18.419> it<00:04:18.599> was<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> lot<00:04:18.959> of

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
now that may look like it was a lot of

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.300 
now that may look like it was a lot of
work<00:04:19.169> but<00:04:19.289> it<00:04:19.410> actually<00:04:19.739> wasn't<00:04:19.949> it's<00:04:20.190> going

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
work but it actually wasn't it's going

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.379 
work but it actually wasn't it's going
to<00:04:20.370> save<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.729> a<00:04:20.759> lot<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:20.940> money<00:04:21.090> to

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
prepackaged to me is more expensive than

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.690 
prepackaged to me is more expensive than
breaking<00:04:23.789> down<00:04:24.060> your<00:04:24.240> own<00:04:24.360> roast
