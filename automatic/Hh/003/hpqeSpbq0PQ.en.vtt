00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
kit it makes it a lot easier to work on

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.530 
kit it makes it a lot easier to work on
your<00:00:25.270> carbs<00:00:25.720> and<00:00:26.610> change<00:00:27.610> the<00:00:27.820> Jets<00:00:28.120> and<00:00:28.420> all

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
your carbs and change the Jets and all

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.380 
your carbs and change the Jets and all
different<00:00:29.080> kinds<00:00:29.290> of<00:00:29.530> things<00:00:29.590> and<00:00:29.950> it<00:00:30.070> just

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
different kinds of things and it just

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.240 
different kinds of things and it just
alleviates<00:00:31.390> a<00:00:31.539> bunch<00:00:31.750> of<00:00:31.870> room<00:00:32.110> that<00:00:33.100> those

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
alleviates a bunch of room that those

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.660 
alleviates a bunch of room that those
boxes<00:00:33.910> take<00:00:34.090> up<00:00:34.300> so<00:00:35.280> starting<00:00:36.280> out<00:00:36.399> one<00:00:36.519> of<00:00:36.579> the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
boxes take up so starting out one of the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.889 
boxes take up so starting out one of the
very<00:00:36.820> first<00:00:36.999> things<00:00:37.269> that<00:00:37.359> we<00:00:37.480> need<00:00:37.659> to<00:00:37.690> make

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
very first things that we need to make

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.069 
very first things that we need to make
sure<00:00:37.929> of<00:00:38.409> is<00:00:39.370> that<00:00:39.609> we<00:00:39.730> have<00:00:39.969> our<00:00:39.999> our<00:00:40.749> carb

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
sure of is that we have our our carb

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.209 
sure of is that we have our our carb
slides<00:00:41.609> need<00:00:42.609> to<00:00:42.730> bottom<00:00:43.120> completely<00:00:43.690> out<00:00:44.219> so

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
slides need to bottom completely out so

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.250 
slides need to bottom completely out so
if<00:00:45.609> your<00:00:45.850> carb<00:00:46.089> slides<00:00:46.390> aren't<00:00:46.659> bottoming<00:00:47.109> out

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
if your carb slides aren't bottoming out

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.169 
if your carb slides aren't bottoming out
you<00:00:47.589> should<00:00:47.890> actually<00:00:48.159> be<00:00:48.399> able<00:00:48.579> to<00:00:48.789> hear<00:00:49.059> them

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
you should actually be able to hear them

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.319 
you should actually be able to hear them
kind<00:00:49.449> of<00:00:49.569> click<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:51.039> they<00:00:51.159> bottom<00:00:51.489> out<00:00:51.609> and

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
kind of click when they bottom out and

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.160 
kind of click when they bottom out and
I'll<00:00:53.229> go<00:00:53.379> ahead<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.649> do<00:00:53.769> that<00:00:53.800> for<00:00:54.219> you<00:00:54.370> here

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
I'll go ahead and do that for you here

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.919 
I'll go ahead and do that for you here
so<00:00:56.170> when<00:00:56.289> you<00:00:56.379> move<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.800> throttle<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:58.629> drop

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
so when you move the throttle just drop

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.009 
so when you move the throttle just drop
it<00:00:59.109> let<00:00:59.469> go<00:00:59.530> and<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:01.059> should<00:01:01.089> be<00:01:01.449> able<00:01:01.539> to<00:01:01.719> hear

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
it let go and you should be able to hear

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:02.899 
it let go and you should be able to hear
them

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909

clack<00:01:03.909> down<00:01:04.210> in<00:01:04.390> there<00:01:04.680> that's<00:01:05.680> what<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:06.010> want

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
clack down in there that's what you want

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.280 
clack down in there that's what you want
to<00:01:06.520> begin<00:01:06.820> with<00:01:06.880> okay<00:01:07.299> so<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:07.900> don't<00:01:08.020> want

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
to begin with okay so you don't want

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.410 
to begin with okay so you don't want
them<00:01:08.410> to<00:01:08.560> be<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.760> don't<00:01:09.910> want<00:01:10.060> your<00:01:10.120> idle

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
them to be you don't want your idle

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.260 
them to be you don't want your idle
screws<00:01:10.720> screwed<00:01:11.470> in<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.890> where<00:01:12.070> they<00:01:12.270> hold

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
screws screwed in to where they hold

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.860 
screws screwed in to where they hold
them<00:01:13.420> up<00:01:13.540> or<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.410> cables<00:01:14.830> pull<00:01:15.100> back<00:01:15.340> too<00:01:15.550> far

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
them up or the cables pull back too far

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.870 
them up or the cables pull back too far
to<00:01:16.870> where<00:01:16.960> it<00:01:17.110> hold<00:01:17.320> them<00:01:17.440> up<00:01:17.590> so<00:01:17.950> make<00:01:18.850> sure

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
to where it hold them up so make sure

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.550 
to where it hold them up so make sure
that<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.240> start<00:01:19.480> off<00:01:19.660> at<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:19.990> point<00:01:20.050> first

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
that you start off at that point first

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.220 
that you start off at that point first
and<00:01:21.310> then<00:01:21.730> I'm<00:01:22.180> going<00:01:22.480> to<00:01:22.510> move<00:01:22.630> over<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:22.990> the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
and then I'm going to move over to the

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.080 
and then I'm going to move over to the
right<00:01:23.260> side<00:01:23.710> of<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:23.890> bike<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.820> I'm<00:01:24.940> going<00:01:25.060> to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
right side of the bike and I'm going to

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.820 
right side of the bike and I'm going to
show<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.420> little<00:01:25.570> windows<00:01:26.260> that<00:01:26.530> you<00:01:26.590> can

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
show you the little windows that you can

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.400 
show you the little windows that you can
look<00:01:26.980> for<00:01:27.160> your<00:01:27.310> pain<00:01:27.550> marks<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.150> I<00:01:29.110> kind<00:01:29.350> of

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
look for your pain marks and I kind of

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.390 
look for your pain marks and I kind of
do<00:01:29.560> this<00:01:29.740> two<00:01:29.950> different<00:01:30.100> ways<00:01:30.690> obviously<00:01:32.400> I'm

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
do this two different ways obviously I'm

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.480 
do this two different ways obviously I'm
doing<00:01:33.760> this<00:01:33.880> by<00:01:34.060> hand<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.980> there<00:01:35.980> are<00:01:36.130> carb

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
doing this by hand and there are carb

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.970 
doing this by hand and there are carb
sink<00:01:36.760> tools<00:01:37.030> out<00:01:37.300> there<00:01:37.470> they've<00:01:38.470> met<00:01:38.800> they

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
sink tools out there they've met they

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.040 
sink tools out there they've met they
measure<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.400> vacuum<00:01:39.790> pressure<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.300> you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
measure the vacuum pressure and you

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.700 
measure the vacuum pressure and you
would<00:01:41.310> seat<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.430> up<00:01:42.520> into<00:01:42.880> each<00:01:43.350> carb<00:01:44.350> opening

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
would seat it up into each carb opening

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.880 
would seat it up into each carb opening
and<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:46.630> measures<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:47.050> pressure<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.770> then

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
and it measures the pressure and then

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.170 
and it measures the pressure and then
you<00:01:47.950> just<00:01:48.280> adjust<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.820> get<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:49.060> right

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
you just adjust it to get the right

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.490 
you just adjust it to get the right
pressure

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.610 

that<00:01:52.070> little<00:01:52.340> window<00:01:52.490> right<00:01:52.880> back<00:01:53.090> there<00:01:53.620> and

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
that little window right back there and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.660 
that little window right back there and
there's<00:01:54.950> one<00:01:55.010> on<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.400> other<00:01:55.430> carb<00:01:55.850> also<00:01:56.270> and

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
there's one on the other carb also and

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.060 
there's one on the other carb also and
kind<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.790> see<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.150> back<00:01:59.390> there<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.740> what<00:02:00.950> you

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
kind of see it back there and what you

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.310 
kind of see it back there and what you
want<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.370> do<00:02:01.550> is<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.690> want<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.900> go<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.080> full

want to do is you want to go to full
throttle<00:02:04.870> and<00:02:05.870> you<00:02:05.990> see<00:02:06.230> that<00:02:06.380> little<00:02:06.590> ping

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
throttle and you see that little ping

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.600 
throttle and you see that little ping
mark<00:02:07.190> show<00:02:07.460> up<00:02:07.640> in<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.880> window<00:02:09.340> might<00:02:10.340> be<00:02:10.490> able

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
mark show up in the window might be able

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.100 
mark show up in the window might be able
to<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:10.940> on<00:02:11.000> camera<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.570> might<00:02:11.780> not<00:02:14.110> barely

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
to see it on camera you might not barely

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.740 
to see it on camera you might not barely
moving<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.580> but<00:02:16.580> at<00:02:16.850> full<00:02:17.150> throttle<00:02:17.480> that

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
moving it but at full throttle that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.920 
moving it but at full throttle that
thing<00:02:17.990> mark<00:02:18.230> should<00:02:18.440> be<00:02:18.620> centered<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:20.390> that's

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
thing mark should be centered and that's

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.960 
thing mark should be centered and that's
a<00:02:21.200> good<00:02:21.470> starting<00:02:21.860> point<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.400> then<00:02:22.640> we'll<00:02:22.790> go

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
a good starting point and then we'll go

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.190 
a good starting point and then we'll go
and<00:02:23.180> make<00:02:23.330> sure<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.990> lower<00:02:24.200> end<00:02:25.000> is

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
and make sure that the lower end is

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.260 
and make sure that the lower end is
synced<00:02:27.200> out<00:02:27.320> also<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.010> once<00:02:28.970> you've<00:02:29.090> got<00:02:29.240> both

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
synced out also so once you've got both

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.199 
synced out also so once you've got both
ping<00:02:29.690> marks<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.170> both<00:02:30.290> windows<00:02:30.940> Center<00:02:31.940> at

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
ping marks and both windows Center at

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.040 
ping marks and both windows Center at
full<00:02:32.510> throttle<00:02:32.780> then<00:02:33.740> you're<00:02:33.980> essentially

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
full throttle then you're essentially

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.090 
full throttle then you're essentially
synched<00:02:36.280> once<00:02:37.280> you've<00:02:37.430> gotten<00:02:37.700> your<00:02:39.100> ping

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
synched once you've gotten your ping

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.120 
synched once you've gotten your ping
marks<00:02:40.459> centered<00:02:40.850> up<00:02:40.970> in<00:02:41.120> your<00:02:41.240> windows<00:02:42.130> most

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
marks centered up in your windows most

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.850 
marks centered up in your windows most
likely<00:02:43.550> you're<00:02:43.730> going<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:43.940> be<00:02:44.030> fairly<00:02:44.860> close

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
likely you're going to be fairly close

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.130 
likely you're going to be fairly close
to<00:02:46.070> being<00:02:46.280> synced<00:02:46.760> but<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.690> other<00:02:47.780> part<00:02:48.110> that

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
to being synced but the other part that

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.330 
to being synced but the other part that
you<00:02:48.350> want<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.560> make<00:02:48.709> sure<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.160> pay

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
you want to make sure that you pay

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.280 
you want to make sure that you pay
attention<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.820> and<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:50.959> want<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.200> get

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
attention to and you want to get

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.650 
attention to and you want to get
straight<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:52.459> your<00:02:52.580> carb<00:02:52.880> slides<00:02:53.300> start

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
straight is that your carb slides start

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.960 
straight is that your carb slides start
to<00:02:53.780> move<00:02:53.959> at<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.290> same<00:02:54.470> time<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.730> when<00:02:55.880> you

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
to move at the same time and when you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.560 
to move at the same time and when you
barely<00:02:56.480> barely<00:02:56.690> touch<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.440> throttle<00:02:58.570> you'll

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
barely barely touch the throttle you'll

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.410 
barely barely touch the throttle you'll
see<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:01.010> have<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.250> kind<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.519> maybe<00:03:01.910> Center

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
see and you have to kind of maybe Center

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.560 
see and you have to kind of maybe Center
your<00:03:02.630> eyes<00:03:02.840> between<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.790> two<00:03:04.970> carbs<00:03:05.330> so<00:03:05.480> you

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
your eyes between the two carbs so you

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.539 
your eyes between the two carbs so you
can<00:03:05.750> kind<00:03:06.019> of<00:03:06.170> watch<00:03:06.739> both<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.220> them<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.430> your

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
can kind of watch both of them in your

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.350 
can kind of watch both of them in your
peripheral<00:03:07.970> vision<00:03:08.920> now<00:03:09.920> I've<00:03:10.760> pulled<00:03:11.150> one

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
peripheral vision now I've pulled one

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.960 
peripheral vision now I've pulled one
out<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.570> sync<00:03:11.959> so<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:13.850> can

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
out of sync so that you so that you can

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.789 
out of sync so that you so that you can
see<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.750> pulled<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.080> way<00:03:15.230> out<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.590> sync

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
see it and I pulled it way out of sync

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.250 
see it and I pulled it way out of sync
so<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.250> can<00:03:16.430> really<00:03:16.700> see<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.090> difference<00:03:17.260> so

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
so you can really see the difference so

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.410 
so you can really see the difference so
I'm<00:03:18.380> going<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.590> barely<00:03:18.860> touch<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:20.120> throttle

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
I'm going to barely touch the throttle

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.460 
I'm going to barely touch the throttle
you<00:03:21.190> see<00:03:22.190> how<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.400> right<00:03:22.640> car<00:03:22.940> moves<00:03:23.470> well

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
you see how the right car moves well

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.449 
you see how the right car moves well
before<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.489> left<00:03:25.700> one<00:03:27.220> if<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:28.310> have<00:03:28.430> a

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
before the left one if you have a

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.370 
before the left one if you have a
situation<00:03:28.700> like<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.239> you're<00:03:29.870> definitely

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
situation like that you're definitely

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.960 
situation like that you're definitely
out<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.799> sync<00:03:31.070> okay<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:33.430> what<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.549> want<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:34.760> do

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
out of sync okay so what you want to do

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.930 
out of sync okay so what you want to do
is<00:03:35.239> you<00:03:35.360> want<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.600> adjust<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:37.280> screw<00:03:37.610> on<00:03:37.760> top

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
is you want to adjust the screw on top

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.869 
is you want to adjust the screw on top
of<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.209> carb<00:03:38.420> cap

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
of the carb cap

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.420 
of the carb cap
and<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.959> on<00:03:41.230> your<00:03:41.469> if<00:03:41.859> you<00:03:41.980> have<00:03:42.010> towards

and you on your if you have towards

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.819 
and you on your if you have towards
boxes<00:03:42.819> you're<00:03:43.180> going<00:03:43.299> to<00:03:43.390> have<00:03:43.569> a<00:03:43.900> screw<00:03:44.650> up

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
boxes you're going to have a screw up

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.520 
boxes you're going to have a screw up
here<00:03:45.129> on<00:03:45.819> top<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.209> your<00:03:46.359> car<00:03:46.569> or<00:03:46.900> on<00:03:46.959> top<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.439> the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
here on top of your car or on top of the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.649 
here on top of your car or on top of the
towards<00:03:48.040> box<00:03:48.249> and<00:03:48.519> you're<00:03:49.180> also<00:03:49.329> going<00:03:49.599> to

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
towards box and you're also going to

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.739 
towards box and you're also going to
have<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.530> big<00:03:50.739> idle<00:03:51.730> adjusting<00:03:52.239> screw<00:03:52.569> back

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:52.749 
have the big idle adjusting screw back

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.289 
have the big idle adjusting screw back
here<00:03:53.079> both<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:53.950> those<00:03:54.099> can<00:03:54.459> move<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.999> slide

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
here both of those can move the slide

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.179 
here both of those can move the slide
and<00:03:55.659> so<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.019> want<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.379> play<00:03:56.530> around<00:03:56.680> with<00:03:56.980> them

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
and so you want to play around with them

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:03.209 
and so you want to play around with them
until<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.180> get<00:03:58.359> them<00:03:58.510> dead<00:03:58.689> on<00:04:02.010> so<00:04:03.010> I'm<00:04:03.099> going

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:03.219 
until you get them dead on so I'm going

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.569 
until you get them dead on so I'm going
to<00:04:03.280> go<00:04:03.400> ahead<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:04.030> screw<00:04:04.389> this<00:04:04.889> down<00:04:05.889> a<00:04:06.340> little

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
to go ahead and screw this down a little

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.020 
to go ahead and screw this down a little
ways<00:04:07.169> and<00:04:08.169> keep<00:04:08.650> testing<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.280> until<00:04:09.669> I've<00:04:09.819> got

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
ways and keep testing it until I've got

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.809 
ways and keep testing it until I've got
my<00:04:10.209> carbs<00:04:10.980> starting<00:04:11.980> out<00:04:12.099> at<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.340> same<00:04:12.549> time

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
my carbs starting out at the same time

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.339 
my carbs starting out at the same time
and<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.120> see<00:04:13.269> that<00:04:13.389> one's<00:04:13.629> still<00:04:13.870> moving<00:04:14.169> way

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
and you see that one's still moving way

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:25.370 
and you see that one's still moving way
before<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.889> left

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.890 

now<00:04:26.010> we're<00:04:26.280> almost<00:04:26.520> there

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.900

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
and I need to try to just look out of my

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.980 
and I need to try to just look out of my
peripheral<00:04:32.360> vision<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:35.090> looks<00:04:35.389> like<00:04:35.750> the

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
peripheral vision it looks like the

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.790 
peripheral vision it looks like the
right<00:04:36.260> is<00:04:36.770> still<00:04:37.100> moving<00:04:37.220> a<00:04:37.430> tiny<00:04:37.760> bit<00:04:38.800> before

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800
