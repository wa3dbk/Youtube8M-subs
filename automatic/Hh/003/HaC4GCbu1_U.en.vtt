kind<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.609> hard<00:00:26.789> today<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.269> lake<00:00:27.570> level<00:00:27.929> is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
kind of hard today the lake level is

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.499 
kind of hard today the lake level is
really<00:00:28.259> low<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.669> trailer<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.390> this

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
really low so the trailer is on this

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.069 
really low so the trailer is on this
level<00:00:30.949> normally<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.910> put<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.420> where

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
level normally I like to put in where

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.350 
level normally I like to put in where
the<00:00:34.340> houseboats<00:00:35.340> sitting<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:36.090> that's

the houseboats sitting because that's

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.270 
the houseboats sitting because that's
kind<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.840> steeper<00:00:37.230> incline<00:00:37.379> over<00:00:37.860> there<00:00:38.010> but

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
kind of a steeper incline over there but

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.810 
kind of a steeper incline over there but
he<00:00:39.239> had<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> pretty<00:00:39.719> much<00:00:39.870> locked<00:00:40.170> down<00:00:40.410> so

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
he had that pretty much locked down so

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.900 
he had that pretty much locked down so
I'm<00:00:41.820> using<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.360> ramp<00:00:43.020> right<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.910> once

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
I'm using this ramp right here and once

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.549 
I'm using this ramp right here and once
again<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> truck<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.629> sitting<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:46.079> more<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.469> an

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
again the truck is sitting on more of an

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
again the truck is sitting on more of an
incline<00:00:46.920> than<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> skis<00:00:48.600> are

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
incline than the then the skis are

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.410 
incline than the then the skis are
itself<00:00:49.140> which<00:00:49.770> you'll<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.070> later<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.420> shove

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
itself which you'll see later on shove

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.180 
itself which you'll see later on shove

pretending like I belong but here I try
to<00:02:59.220> back<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.700> off<00:02:59.790> once<00:03:00.090> again<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:01.500> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
to back it off once again the the the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.470 
to back it off once again the the the
bottom<00:03:02.459> intakes<00:03:02.819> pretty<00:03:03.090> much<00:03:03.209> out<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.420> the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
bottom intakes pretty much out of the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.789 
bottom intakes pretty much out of the
water<00:03:03.629> side<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:03.930> didn't<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.470> nudge<00:03:04.650> it

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
water side I didn't have to nudge it

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.059 
water side I didn't have to nudge it
back<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.950> few<00:03:05.069> times<00:03:05.340> until<00:03:05.549> I<00:03:05.730> was<00:03:05.970> able<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:07.069> get

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.670 
show you real quick like I said two
trailers<00:03:12.540> pretty<00:03:12.780> much<00:03:12.930> level<00:03:13.410> where<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
trailers pretty much level where the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.039 
trailers pretty much level where the
truck<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.130> sitting<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.640> even<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.480> steeper

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
truck is sitting is even a steeper

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.550 
truck is sitting is even a steeper
incline<00:03:16.880> which<00:03:17.880> where<00:03:18.870> I'd<00:03:18.989> normally<00:03:19.200> like<00:03:19.530> to

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
incline which where I'd normally like to

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.979 
incline which where I'd normally like to
park<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.459> as<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.090> see<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.329> bunks<00:03:21.629> are

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
park but as you can see the bunks are

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.030 
park but as you can see the bunks are
out<00:03:22.319> of<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.470> water<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.680> little<00:03:22.739> bit<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:22.980> would

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
out of the water a little bit I would

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.259 
out of the water a little bit I would
like<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.459> be<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.579> little<00:03:23.790> bit<00:03:23.879> further<00:03:24.060> into

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
like to be a little bit further into

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.180 
like to be a little bit further into
water<00:03:24.510> but<00:03:25.200> like<00:03:25.349> I<00:03:25.379> said<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.680> make<00:03:25.860> this<00:03:26.010> video

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
water but like I said to make this video

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.119 
water but like I said to make this video
I<00:03:26.370> wanted<00:03:26.670> everybody<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:27.000> see<00:03:27.590> how<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.709> works<00:03:28.890> I

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
I wanted everybody to see how it works I

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.250 
I wanted everybody to see how it works I
exaggerated<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.760> little<00:03:29.790> bit<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.269> that's<00:03:31.049> how

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
exaggerated a little bit and that's how

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.160 
exaggerated a little bit and that's how
my<00:03:31.410> liquid<00:03:31.709> rollers<00:03:31.980> work
