00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello everyone, Sasha with you today in what 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.390
 say here is such an underwater guard 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.519
 if not mistaken and is called that way 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.800
 Well, the guardian doesn’t know exactly underwater and I know 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.469
 what is he under water he was added 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.070
 if I'm not mistaken but we are such versions 181 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.529
 perhaps in 18 after that 18 in general 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.359
 so I never saw him on the game 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.359
 because I'm putting one on the version 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.830
 I did n’t play this way so much 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.019
 I was asked to make him and I him 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.250
 I did see quite a long time ago 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.500
 5 pixels when crafting 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.520
 century then thought it was some 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.710
 modifications what is it but when 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.890
 asked I figured out that this is still 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.649
 new husband and I did make it yes 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.950
 here is such a start it is his case pretty 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.850
 still long but still he is here he 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.430
 green 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.289
 such a shaft of slightly marble color with 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 orange feast peep ticks 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.440
 and here is such a tail to come out that he does not 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.469
 very big 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.530
 Here are my hands, you will see how he is in 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.719
 length including the tail and let's say 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.690
 just mind but three four five six seven 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.270
 eight and a half centimeters it's not 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.280
 read this take a picnic overs he 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 worth it consisted of many details 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.810
 see how she comes here it all 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.549
 glued separately that is not decided 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.070
 just a red cube and I think you can see that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.439
 copper red on a red cube pasted 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.420
 these green glasses platforms 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.610
 they are very hard to glue because 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.799
 they are pretty small, that is, how 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.380
 would they be so thin and small 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.180
 Further that detail of water to give the tail 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.430
 then here it Circuits pasad here 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.439
 this is not only the tail then the tail itself 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.020
 have you noticed that you have a tail 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.240
 one thing accidentally cut this field 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.049
 the words random cut him with a knife therefore 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.659
 cut out 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.369
 that asshole bitch cut by the tail was 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.659
 it is very inconvenient to insert into it 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.570
 here here it should stick 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.520
 keep on like this upright but here 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.500
 here that's when you cut it turns out 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.049
 too little space i mean how would she not 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.210
 it turns out for you to go there kitsch then not 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.829
 had to cut practically 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.020
 probably almost twice as much as 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.820
 here is the place to get it somehow there in 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.179
 stick and now you see that most likely 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.760
 then it was necessary to abigail and not yet needed 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.170
 it was stuck here here and the line 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.659
 there is how it was cut and glue 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.790
 them to this but I could not 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:20.099
 because well, I really didn’t get a tail 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.159
 could in the bag with his glue so 0 floor 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.150
 a little bit nothing i think is terrible 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:30.269
 this is not this thing here before Venka 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.040
 12 pieces I accidentally lost one at first 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.879
 but then I meet her after a long search 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.519
 I found the glory of God and here they are 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.099
 4 on each side that is here 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.349
 here come such dark dark spots 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.939
 he was just the children of things were fastened with 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.560
 each side and go dark spots think 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.019
 I can see that I am not a fortress 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.799
 in the middle of these dark spots and so 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.290
 that's holding 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.540
 I specifically made up for that look 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.189
 what he play and he his these things they 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.290
 as if sticking that is memory 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.719
 becomes and protrude so in 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.450
 sweep and force also included were 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:05.370
 these are the little things here but this 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.989
 I did not do I began to make big 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.780
 because it seemed to me that big 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.049
 more beautiful than small ones 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.239
 here you see here 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.680
 ethereal alternatives spikes if i 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.989
 I read correctly, but here they are 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.849
 here are small so if you want 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.639
 can do both with small ones so 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.859
 large sweep I do not remember how much 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.900
 she sheets goes most likely or on 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.310
 antenna or two sheets 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.019
 I seem to have printed out his genes 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.409
 such is it 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.780
 small size but very good so 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.000
 what if you liked this guardian 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.079
 you can do it yourself sweep in 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.729
 video description 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.479
 call it that paper is thin 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:50.250
 move your tail it's cool 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.590
 leave to have a little curved but 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.750
 it is not deformed by force because 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.329
 bends but ok that's the tail he 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.829
 stirs doing as always it out of simple 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.229
 office paper so everything is fine 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.479
 holding glue glue moment but these 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:05.879
 here things were supposed to be shorter 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:08.370
 you look exactly the same if you do not 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.349
 wrong here comes here here here 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.180
 such things do not go and as triangles 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.639
 but bend them almost no reality 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.889
 this size they visit what my finger 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.049
 what are these things here were exactly the same 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.120
 and this triangle here are triangles 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.580
 should be here here on the sides 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.710
 where is my glue, I still bent 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.570
 Here there is even a little bit that Moran 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.310
 perky and i totally bent them and 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.410
 just so on glue moment attack 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.270
 planted and because so arch 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.060
 so petty things if you will 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.460
 I sympathize with you, I also did not 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.229
 this is just found the main thing that 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.960
 not well kept he can stand like 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:46.050
 so here so here so here so here so 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.419
 so here so here so here well and so 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.440
 he can also stand like this 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.810
 see that not a little bit different 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.400
 pasted because flowers under different 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.320
 I didn’t measure angles 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.240
 at different angles a little stuck but 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.669
 so here it is worth becoming exactly at all 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.639
 four and I'm very happy yes I have 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.560
 like this, so I'll be all on it 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.510
 complete the video offer yours and 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.520
 the figures you would like to see 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.380
 Sasha had all the necessary links with you 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.630
 cars in the description under the video all 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.630
 thank you for your attention and all bye
