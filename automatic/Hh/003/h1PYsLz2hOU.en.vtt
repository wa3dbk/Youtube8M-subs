is a lot smaller than the last one
actually<00:01:52.909> it's<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.329> big<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
actually it's really not that big a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.530 
actually it's really not that big a
little<00:01:56.280> bit<00:01:56.460> bigger<00:01:56.610> than<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.000> use<00:01:57.149> cardboard

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
little bit bigger than we use cardboard

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.359 
little bit bigger than we use cardboard
but<00:01:58.130> whatever<00:02:00.829> now<00:02:01.829> I'm<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.130> talk<00:02:02.219> about

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
but whatever now I'm going to talk about

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.300 
but whatever now I'm going to talk about
the<00:02:02.549> system<00:02:02.880> itself<00:02:03.320> well<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.680> system<00:02:05.040> here

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the system itself well the system here

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.859 
the system itself well the system here
it's<00:02:05.610> pretty<00:02:05.850> cool<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.090> got<00:02:06.210> touch<00:02:06.509> button

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it's pretty cool it's got touch button

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.999 
it's pretty cool it's got touch button
so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.140> don't<00:02:07.290> really<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.770> press<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
so you don't really have to press a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.880 
so you don't really have to press a
button<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.819> tap

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
button it's just a tap

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.660 
button it's just a tap
um<00:02:10.039> it's<00:02:10.789> got<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.030> 250<00:02:11.930> gigabyte<00:02:12.110> hard<00:02:12.440> drive

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
um it's got a 250 gigabyte hard drive

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.390 
um it's got a 250 gigabyte hard drive
which<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.880> pretty<00:02:14.209> cool<00:02:14.480> seeing<00:02:14.870> as<00:02:15.370> before<00:02:16.370> I

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
which is pretty cool seeing as before I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.490 
which is pretty cool seeing as before I
had<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> 20<00:02:17.060> gig<00:02:17.209> hard<00:02:17.420> drive<00:02:17.480> that's<00:02:17.780> why<00:02:17.990> one

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
had a 20 gig hard drive that's why one

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.160 
had a 20 gig hard drive that's why one
of<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.620> reasons<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:19.010> decided<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.400> upgrade<00:02:19.520> I

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
of the reasons I decided to upgrade I

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.510 
of the reasons I decided to upgrade I
had<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> 20<00:02:21.530> gig<00:02:21.650> hard<00:02:21.860> drive<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.280> was<00:02:22.400> almost
