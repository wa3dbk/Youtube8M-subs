hello everyone Jessica bassy here in
today's<00:00:03.090> tutorial<00:00:03.270> I'm<00:00:03.780> going<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.049> be<00:00:04.200> going

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
today's tutorial I'm going to be going

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.920 
today's tutorial I'm going to be going
over<00:00:04.710> how<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.130> create<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.520> high<00:00:05.819> contrast<00:00:06.420> photo

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
over how to create a high contrast photo

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.440 
over how to create a high contrast photo
look<00:00:07.259> it's<00:00:08.099> really<00:00:08.519> easy<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.120> only<00:00:09.210> takes

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
look it's really easy and it only takes

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.120 
look it's really easy and it only takes
a<00:00:09.510> couple<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.809> layers<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.469> I'm<00:00:10.830> going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> show

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
a couple of layers so I'm going to show

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.009 
a couple of layers so I'm going to show
you<00:00:11.219> guys<00:00:11.309> how<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.519> do<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.870> actually

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
you guys how I do that and I actually

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.959 
you guys how I do that and I actually
use<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.469> effect<00:00:13.799> online<00:00:14.099> my<00:00:14.280> pictures<00:00:14.639> if<00:00:14.880> I

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
use this effect online my pictures if I

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.060 
use this effect online my pictures if I
want<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.210> keep<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.509> original<00:00:15.570> coloring<00:00:16.230> so

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
want to keep the original coloring so

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.700 
want to keep the original coloring so
it's<00:00:17.310> really<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.880> really<00:00:18.090> useful<00:00:18.710> so

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it's really this is really useful so

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.800 
it's really this is really useful so
first<00:00:20.550> thing<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.000> we're<00:00:21.119> going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> do<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.630> go

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
first thing that we're going to do is go

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.830 
first thing that we're going to do is go
to<00:00:21.869> layers<00:00:22.680> new<00:00:23.490> adjustment<00:00:23.970> layer<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.449> of

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
to layers new adjustment layer and of

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.450 
to layers new adjustment layer and of
course<00:00:24.980> curves<00:00:25.980> because<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> love<00:00:26.849> curves<00:00:27.210> I

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
course curves because I love curves I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.830 
course curves because I love curves I
use<00:00:29.460> curves<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:29.939> an<00:00:30.029> every<00:00:30.300> picture<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
use curves like an every picture and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.220 
use curves like an every picture and
every<00:00:31.320> tutorial<00:00:31.439> too<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
every tutorial too so I'm just going to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.110 
every tutorial too so I'm just going to
kind<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.559> eyeball<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.960> kind<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.079> create

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
kind of eyeball this kind of create

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
kind of eyeball this kind of create
something<00:00:39.120> around<00:00:39.840> here<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:42.379> there's<00:00:43.379> no<00:00:43.620> set

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
something around here and there's no set

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 
something around here and there's no set
points<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.820> curves<00:00:45.090> honestly<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.660> kind

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
points for curves honestly I just kind

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.619 
points for curves honestly I just kind
of<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.559> what<00:00:46.860> looks<00:00:47.070> good<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.489> go<00:00:48.270> from<00:00:48.450> there

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
of see what looks good and go from there

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.680 
of see what looks good and go from there
I<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.809> always<00:00:49.050> change<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.350> too<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.690> that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
I can always change that too so that

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.729 
I can always change that too so that
looks<00:00:52.020> kind<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.440> good<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.829> me<00:00:53.010> right<00:00:53.219> now<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
looks kind of good to me right now and

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.830 
looks kind of good to me right now and
then<00:00:55.739> I'm<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.219> go<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> layer<00:00:57.360> new

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
then I'm going to go to layer new

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.700 
then I'm going to go to layer new
adjustment<00:00:58.140> layer<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:59.480> hue/saturation

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
adjustment layer and then hue/saturation

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.750 
adjustment layer and then hue/saturation
so<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.550> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so for this one this is going to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.030 
so for this one this is going to
actually<00:01:03.090> give<00:01:03.539> us<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.690> contrast<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:04.830> by

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
actually give us the contrast now by

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.730 
actually give us the contrast now by
lowering<00:01:05.610> saturation<00:01:06.439> it's<00:01:07.439> going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> give

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
lowering saturation it's going to give

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.039 
lowering saturation it's going to give
you<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> black<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> white<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:09.390> what<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.900> do

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
you a black and white now what you do

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.100 
you a black and white now what you do
with<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.590> go<00:01:10.710> from<00:01:11.010> normal<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:12.360> soft

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
with that is you go from normal to soft

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.070 
with that is you go from normal to soft
light<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:14.180> already<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.390> see<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.810> kind<00:01:16.020> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
light and already you can see it kind of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.490 
light and already you can see it kind of
gives<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> nice<00:01:16.770> look<00:01:18.350> toggling<00:01:19.350> back

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
gives it like a nice look toggling back

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
gives it like a nice look toggling back
and<00:01:19.710> forth<00:01:19.890> someone<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> put

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
and forth someone I'm not going to put

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.120 
and forth someone I'm not going to put
two<00:01:21.450> 100<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:21.840> gonna<00:01:21.960> put<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.200> around<00:01:23.390> 85<00:01:25.130> so

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
two 100 I'm gonna put it around 85 so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.969 
two 100 I'm gonna put it around 85 so
again<00:01:26.310> we're<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.460> changing<00:01:26.759> saturation<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
again we're just changing saturation and

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.859 
again we're just changing saturation and
then<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.549> over<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.880> layer

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.480 

new<00:01:33.869> fill<00:01:33.900> layer<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:34.979> solid<00:01:35.490> color<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
new fill layer and then solid color and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.499 
new fill layer and then solid color and
then<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.970> color<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> use<00:01:40.020> is

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
then the color we are going to use is

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.600 
then the color we are going to use is
like<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.200> an<00:01:43.320> eggplant<00:01:43.500> color<00:01:44.070> which<00:01:44.460> is

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
like a like an eggplant color which is

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.340 
like a like an eggplant color which is
very<00:01:44.640> nice<00:01:46.220> like<00:01:47.220> eggplant<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:49.140> don't

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
very nice like eggplant I really don't

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.260 
very nice like eggplant I really don't
know<00:01:49.470> what<00:01:49.680> theme<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.520> when<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.060> wrote

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
know what theme this is I when I wrote

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.300 
know what theme this is I when I wrote
this<00:01:51.390> down<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.600> put<00:01:51.869> dead<00:01:52.079> purple<00:01:52.560> book<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
this down I put dead purple book that

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.889 
this down I put dead purple book that
kind<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.610> sounded<00:01:53.909> cynical<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.479> I'm<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.750> no

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
kind of sounded cynical so I'm like no

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.450 
kind of sounded cynical so I'm like no
I'm<00:01:54.990> not<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> say<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.710> purple<00:01:56.100> so

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
I'm not going to say it's that purple so

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.130 
I'm not going to say it's that purple so
just<00:01:56.880> fill<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:58.310> light<00:01:59.390> AG<00:02:00.390> purple<00:02:00.990> I

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
just fill it in with a light AG purple I

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.080 
just fill it in with a light AG purple I
guess<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.649> then<00:02:01.979> we<00:02:02.399> are<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.700> set<00:02:02.880> this

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
guess and then we are going to set this

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.340 
guess and then we are going to set this
from<00:02:03.329> norm<00:02:03.659> normal<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.979> exclusion<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:06.350> then

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
from norm normal to exclusion and then

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.279 
from norm normal to exclusion and then
we're<00:02:07.469> going<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.619> lower<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.129> exclusion<00:02:08.700> layer

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
we're going to lower the exclusion layer

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.160 
we're going to lower the exclusion layer
to<00:02:10.430> about

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
to about

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.340 
to about
they're<00:02:13.030> 40%<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.900> reason<00:02:15.140> why<00:02:15.230> I'm

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
they're 40% and the reason why I'm

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.770 
they're 40% and the reason why I'm
adding<00:02:15.470> exclusion<00:02:16.100> as<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.340> can<00:02:16.459> see<00:02:16.760> all<00:02:17.240> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
adding exclusion as you can see all the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.280 
adding exclusion as you can see all the
blacker<00:02:18.620> parts<00:02:19.190> around<00:02:19.760> here<00:02:20.120> they're<00:02:20.990> kind

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
blacker parts around here they're kind

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.690 
blacker parts around here they're kind
of<00:02:21.350> lost<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:21.890> what<00:02:22.040> I'm<00:02:22.130> doing<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.430> just<00:02:22.459> some

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
of lost so what I'm doing is just some

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.920 
of lost so what I'm doing is just some
kind<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:22.970> subtly<00:02:23.660> filling<00:02:24.140> in<00:02:24.319> those<00:02:25.010> areas

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
kind of subtly filling in those areas

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.000 
kind of subtly filling in those areas
and<00:02:26.930> then<00:02:27.080> last<00:02:27.410> but<00:02:27.500> not<00:02:27.620> least<00:02:27.800> we're<00:02:27.890> going

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
and then last but not least we're going

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.280 
and then last but not least we're going
to<00:02:28.069> go<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.190> layer<00:02:28.490> new<00:02:28.880> adjustment<00:02:29.360> layer<00:02:29.870> and

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
to go to layer new adjustment layer and

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.810 
to go to layer new adjustment layer and
then<00:02:30.440> back<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.040> curves<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:33.370> I'm<00:02:34.370> gonna<00:02:34.550> make

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
then back to curves and I'm gonna make

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.680 
then back to curves and I'm gonna make
like<00:02:35.720> an<00:02:35.870> ass<00:02:36.400> like<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.430> weird<00:02:37.790> ass<00:02:38.060> shape<00:02:38.450> with

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
like an ass like a weird ass shape with

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:47.740 
like an ass like a weird ass shape with
this<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.640> do<00:02:40.640> something<00:02:41.060> like<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:46.570> make<00:02:47.570> sure

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
this so do something like that make sure

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.020 
this so do something like that make sure
it's<00:02:47.900> not<00:02:48.050> too<00:02:48.440> much<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:49.640> not<00:02:49.700> too

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
it's not too much it's not too

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:58.750 
it's not too much it's not too
contrasted<00:02:56.290> I'm<00:02:57.290> going<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.560> lower<00:02:57.739> my<00:02:58.100> first

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
contrasted I'm going to lower my first

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.580 
contrasted I'm going to lower my first
curves<00:02:59.150> I'm<00:02:59.300> going<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.480> change<00:02:59.780> my<00:03:00.170> first

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
curves I'm going to change my first

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.680 
curves I'm going to change my first
curve<00:03:00.890> just<00:03:01.160> because<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.400> want<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.940> little

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
curve just because I want it a little

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.880 
curve just because I want it a little
more<00:03:02.959> subtle<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.650> don't<00:03:03.860> want<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.070> too<00:03:04.220> crazy

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.479 

like<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:09.920> toggle<00:03:10.220> back<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.610> forth<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:16.340> I'm

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
like a toggle back and forth so I'm

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.250 
like a toggle back and forth so I'm
going<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.670> set<00:03:16.910> this<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.390> top<00:03:17.630> curves<00:03:18.049> layer

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
going to set this the top curves layer

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.509 
going to set this the top curves layer
to<00:03:19.250> about<00:03:19.610> 70%<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:21.110> look<00:03:21.829> at<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.100> effect<00:03:22.370> we

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
to about 70% and look at the effect we

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.949 
to about 70% and look at the effect we
got<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:22.820> far<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.030> really<00:03:23.209> like<00:03:23.329> this<00:03:23.660> here<00:03:23.870> I'll

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
got so far I really like this here I'll

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.250 
got so far I really like this here I'll
show<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.140> guys<00:03:24.320> a<00:03:24.500> before-and-after<00:03:26.260> that's

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
show you guys a before-and-after that's

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.840 
show you guys a before-and-after that's
before<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.010> that's<00:03:28.100> after

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
before and that's after

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.170 
before and that's after
and<00:03:29.060> again<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:29.840> was<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:30.579> this<00:03:31.579> was<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.790> four

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
and again this was and this was a four

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.729 
and again this was and this was a four
layer<00:03:32.600> sub<00:03:33.079> process<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:33.680> very<00:03:33.860> easy<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.519> do<00:03:35.000> and

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
layer sub process is very easy to do and

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.380 
layer sub process is very easy to do and
if<00:03:36.739> you<00:03:36.860> wanted<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.250> more<00:03:37.519> higher<00:03:37.820> contrast

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
if you wanted a more higher contrast

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
if you wanted a more higher contrast
look<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.630> can<00:03:38.780> just<00:03:38.930> get<00:03:39.110> rid<00:03:39.230> of<00:03:39.320> the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
look you can just get rid of the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.740 
look you can just get rid of the
exclusion<00:03:39.980> layer<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:41.239> what<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.570> the

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
exclusion layer and that what is the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.530 
exclusion layer and that what is the
effect<00:03:42.110> that<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:42.350> would<00:03:42.440> get<00:03:42.760> so<00:03:43.760> if<00:03:43.880> I<00:03:43.970> simply

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
effect that you would get so if I simply

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.440 
effect that you would get so if I simply
lower<00:03:44.720> Exclusion<00:03:45.970> then<00:03:46.970> that's<00:03:47.150> what<00:03:47.329> you

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
lower Exclusion then that's what you

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.880 
lower Exclusion then that's what you
would<00:03:47.570> get<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:48.380> can<00:03:48.410> always<00:03:48.620> change

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
would get and you can always change

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.710 
would get and you can always change
exclusion<00:03:49.489> to<00:03:49.610> another<00:03:49.850> color<00:03:50.150> if<00:03:50.390> you'd<00:03:50.540> like

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
exclusion to another color if you'd like

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.830 
exclusion to another color if you'd like
you<00:03:51.019> can<00:03:51.170> make<00:03:51.350> it<00:03:51.590> yellow<00:03:52.160> it's<00:03:53.150> very<00:03:53.540> very

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
you can make it yellow it's very very

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.160 
you can make it yellow it's very very
subtle<00:03:54.049> if<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.970> go<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.209> darker<00:03:56.660> color<00:03:56.900> then

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
subtle if you go a darker color then

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.360 
subtle if you go a darker color then
you're<00:03:57.290> going<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.440> be<00:03:57.560> able<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.769> see<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.190> more

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
you're going to be able to see it more

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.009 
you're going to be able to see it more
if<00:03:58.519> you<00:03:58.640> go<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.790> lighter<00:03:59.090> color<00:03:59.450> then<00:03:59.720> it<00:03:59.750> kind

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
if you go a lighter color then it kind

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.259 
if you go a lighter color then it kind
of<00:04:00.049> washes<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.590> out<00:04:00.709> so<00:04:00.980> if<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.850> don't<00:04:02.060> want<00:04:02.209> to

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
of washes it out so if you don't want to

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.420 
of washes it out so if you don't want to
like<00:04:02.420> if<00:04:03.110> you<00:04:03.140> want<00:04:03.350> a<00:04:03.380> more<00:04:03.530> vintage<00:04:03.769> look<00:04:04.190> you

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
like if you want a more vintage look you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.210 
like if you want a more vintage look you
could<00:04:04.700> go<00:04:05.290> yellow<00:04:06.290> but<00:04:06.560> for<00:04:06.829> the<00:04:06.890> sake<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.070> this

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
could go yellow but for the sake of this

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.979 
could go yellow but for the sake of this
tutorial<00:04:07.280> I'm<00:04:07.880> again<00:04:08.450> I'm<00:04:08.480> going<00:04:08.750> with<00:04:08.900> the

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
tutorial I'm again I'm going with the

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.310 
tutorial I'm again I'm going with the
purple<00:04:09.549> so<00:04:10.549> that's<00:04:11.239> really<00:04:11.660> all<00:04:11.810> there<00:04:11.959> is<00:04:12.109> to

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
purple so that's really all there is to

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.310 
purple so that's really all there is to
it<00:04:12.530> how<00:04:13.070> easy<00:04:13.100> was<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.579> I<00:04:14.049> hope<00:04:15.049> you<00:04:15.200> guys
