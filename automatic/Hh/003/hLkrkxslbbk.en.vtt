00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 all right 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.510
 hello that as they are today I bring a 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.730
 video on how to pass files from the 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.000
 computer to the android phone or to 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.320
 backwards without having to use the usb cable 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.300
 so then it's good enough 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.950
 simple and you have to first go 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.240
 to the page that is called android 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.759
 dotcom that I leave in the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.110
 description then once you already 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.009
 you are on this page you have to 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.259
 minimize it from your android phone and 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.180
 download the app called android 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.890
 that the downloads from the Pleistocene 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.050
 tonces the searches and the downloads 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.699
 you install once you install it 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.989
 speak if you see a page where 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.699
 says you have to sign up not 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.679
 records nothing happens 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.480
 give him to omit or not to register as 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:50.269
 then you quit once and 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.010
 omit that we get a page like 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.460
 this one that comes here on screen that comes out 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.469
 yesterday droid and this one comes out and steve two 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.899
 let's click here where steve says 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.730
 2 what is the camera then we give it 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.110
 click and it shows us what the camera is 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.930
 of the phone 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.150
 and we have to take a picture of this 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.680
 code that we see here we have to try 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.380
 that it looks as good as possible so that 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.180
 what to support it in this case 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.850
 they are 8 megapixels so I do not think 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.790
 that there is no problem then if 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.130
 example you have what is a 3 camera 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.750
 megapixels or 2 megapixels I try that 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.710
 look your best to take 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.600
 well the photo and once you have the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.040
 already taken picture will appear a 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.350
 page already with the information of your 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.840
 phone here in this case Motorola 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.450
 droid 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.060
 x 2 x 3 I do not know which one has then good 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.039
 we have to go to what is this 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.170
 these tabs here we have to go 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.979
 for example to music to pass 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.110
 music or send music then we open 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.579
 this music tab and we get all 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.709
 the songs on the phone we have to 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.630
 for example to switch from the telephone to the 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.509
 computer we have to mark the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.030
 songs and then we have to give it 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.640
 download then we give you download and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.500
 Here is the song that we are 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.149
 passing the computer not then already 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.549
 later when they download the song 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.430
 as they go and seek it in your downloads 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.380
 neighbor then it's good to move to 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.819
 songs on the phone from the 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.640
 computer we have to go here to 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.520
 upload and a page like this appears 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.770
 We give you select files 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.450
 and it shows us the tab is for 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.790
 look for the songs we have to for 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.230
 example select them if we want 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.960
 many at the same time we have to 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.660
 crush the control button and select 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.300
 the songs that we want the button 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.250
 keyboard control then good there 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.440
 those songs are already happening and they open 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.120
 and the songs start to happen 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.130
 automatically to what it is and the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.760
 phone then once you have already 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.560
 that last thing they have to close this and 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.360
 then they give him disconnect in what is 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.240
 the phone shows them the tab and 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.610
 the ip code appears in what is the 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.190
 phone and then connection mode 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.200
 local and we give it off if it is that 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.090
 we're done not so good to pass 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.790
 songs to pass videos to pass 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.040
 images is the same and we can also 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.470
 pass files applied games that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.780
 let's have on the computer so it's 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.000
 pretty simple and well, it's not like that 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.260
 as they lose much time to 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.630
 better now I'm talking about more and 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.460
 that's why the 6 minutes are now but good 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.920
 this is totally fast and it is very 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.630
 simple so good at the end age 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.910
 disconnect and that box appears 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.820
 there so you already close everything and 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.250
 turn off the computer and go to sleep 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.560
 then it's good this would be all 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.060
 dismissal I hope you liked it and 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.460
