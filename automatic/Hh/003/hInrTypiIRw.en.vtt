chain spaces and it was started off by

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.789 
chain spaces and it was started off by
doing<00:03:26.930> three<00:03:28.750> single<00:03:29.750> crochets<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.530> always

doing three single crochets that always

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.259 
doing three single crochets that always
takes<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.129> place<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.609> one<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.879> our<00:03:31.939> double
