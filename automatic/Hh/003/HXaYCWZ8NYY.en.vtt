you're cooking meat in front of the fire

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.270 
you're cooking meat in front of the fire
then<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.170> fact<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.500> drips<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.159> be

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
then the fact that drips can be

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.370 
then the fact that drips can be
collected<00:01:08.610> into<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.960> kettle<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:10.649> a<00:01:10.710> cup<00:01:12.229> and

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.590 

then<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.710> refine<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.430> turn<00:01:18.420> it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
then you can refine that and turn it

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.380 
then you can refine that and turn it
into<00:01:18.780> talent<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.920> you're<00:01:20.609> doing<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.000> at<00:01:21.180> home

the tallow it even refining the fat into

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.700 
the tallow it even refining the fat into
tallow<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.659> even<00:01:30.899> more<00:01:31.079> important<00:01:31.680> because

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
actual fat that mean has to come out and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.090 
actual fat that mean has to come out and
you<00:01:39.450> want<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.719> get<00:01:39.869> any<00:01:40.049> salt<00:01:40.469> out<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.950> that

15<00:02:41.370> years<00:02:41.400> or<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:43.850> suggest<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> use<00:02:45.060> a

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
15 years or so I suggest you use a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.310 
15 years or so I suggest you use a
pottery<00:02:47.550> jar<00:02:47.880> like<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:48.570> or<00:02:49.020> glass<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:52.050> can

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
pottery jar like this or glass you can

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.550 
pottery jar like this or glass you can
use<00:02:52.590> metal<00:02:53.070> but<00:02:53.489> if<00:02:53.730> there<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.180> any<00:02:54.530> traces<00:02:55.530> of

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
use metal but if there is any traces of

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.820 
use metal but if there is any traces of
salt<00:02:56.040> or<00:02:56.580> moisture<00:02:57.300> left<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.560> tallow

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
salt or moisture left in the tallow

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.310 
salt or moisture left in the tallow
afterwards<00:02:59.670> it<00:03:00.660> will<00:03:01.019> rust<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.800> metal<00:03:03.080> in<00:03:04.080> the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
afterwards it will rust the metal in the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.870 
afterwards it will rust the metal in the
10<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.800> you'll<00:03:04.980> get<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.370> in<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.610> tallow

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
10 and you'll get that in the tallow

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.330 
10 and you'll get that in the tallow
it's<00:03:06.150> not<00:03:06.390> have<00:03:07.140> any<00:03:07.290> importance<00:03:07.890> really<00:03:08.250> if

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
it's not have any importance really if

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.620 
it's not have any importance really if
you're<00:03:08.459> going<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.700> be<00:03:08.790> just<00:03:08.820> using<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.420> for<00:03:09.570> you

has salt in it has meat on it and we
need<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.380> get<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.920> cleaned<00:04:29.280> up<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:29.940> we're

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
need to get that cleaned up so we're

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:41.140 
need to get that cleaned up so we're
going<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.050> put<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.440> into<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.340> cattle

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.620 

we'll<00:04:41.960> put<00:04:42.140> the<00:04:42.260> top<00:04:42.470> on<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:44.120> we<00:04:44.270> can<00:04:44.390> get<00:04:44.510> it

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
we'll put the top on so we can get it

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.280 
we'll put the top on so we can get it
boiling<00:04:44.840> again<00:04:46.420> and<00:04:47.420> when<00:04:47.600> it's<00:04:47.750> melted<00:04:47.930> we'll

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
boiling again and when it's melted we'll

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.720 
boiling again and when it's melted we'll
come<00:04:48.500> back<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:48.860> take<00:04:49.040> another<00:04:49.100> look<00:04:49.520> at<00:04:49.700> it

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
come back and take another look at it

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.480 
come back and take another look at it
here<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:53.600> can<00:04:53.660> see<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.080> melter<00:04:54.860> start<00:04:55.190> the

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
here you can see the melter start the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.290 
here you can see the melter start the
fattest<00:04:56.450> started<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:56.960> melt<00:04:57.200> I<00:04:58.120> don't<00:04:59.120> know<00:04:59.240> if

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
fattest started to melt I don't know if

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.250 
fattest started to melt I don't know if
you<00:04:59.450> can<00:04:59.710> see<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.890> difference<00:05:01.310> in<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:03.020> depth

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
you can see the difference in the depth

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.300 
you can see the difference in the depth
here<00:05:03.650> but<00:05:03.920> term<00:05:05.050> there's<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.140> lot<00:05:06.230> of<00:05:06.440> molten

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
here but term there's a lot of molten

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.090 
here but term there's a lot of molten
the<00:05:07.400> fat<00:05:08.050> floating<00:05:09.050> on<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.350> surface<00:05:09.650> of<00:05:09.980> the

the fat floating on the surface of the
water<00:05:13.930> and<00:05:15.310> probably<00:05:16.310> what<00:05:16.640> we're<00:05:16.820> seeing<00:05:17.060> in

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
water and probably what we're seeing in

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.720 
water and probably what we're seeing in
there<00:05:17.540> now<00:05:17.780> moving<00:05:18.200> around<00:05:18.650> is<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.190> is<00:05:19.670> the

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
there now moving around is the is the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:28.620 
there now moving around is the is the
waist<00:05:20.210> is<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:21.620> meat<00:05:25.840> fat<00:05:26.840> is<00:05:27.050> actually<00:05:27.500> melted

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
waist is the meat fat is actually melted

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.140 
waist is the meat fat is actually melted
let<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.750> boil<00:05:29.960> a<00:05:29.990> little<00:05:30.170> bit<00:05:30.440> longer<00:05:31.000> just<00:05:32.000> to

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
let it boil a little bit longer just to

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.250 
let it boil a little bit longer just to
make<00:05:32.360> sure<00:05:32.390> it's<00:05:32.810> all<00:05:32.990> out<00:05:33.230> of<00:05:33.260> it<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:35.260> and

pots off the fire now and we've taken
the<00:05:54.590> lid<00:05:54.770> off<00:05:54.800> so<00:05:55.370> it'll<00:05:55.580> cool<00:05:55.790> down<00:05:55.850> a<00:05:56.090> little

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
the lid off so it'll cool down a little

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.500 
the lid off so it'll cool down a little
bit<00:05:56.480> quicker<00:05:57.280> and<00:05:58.280> what's<00:05:58.640> being<00:05:58.820> cast<00:05:59.150> iron

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
bit quicker and what's being cast iron

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.010 
bit quicker and what's being cast iron
it<00:05:59.690> will<00:05:59.810> stay<00:06:00.050> hot<00:06:00.260> for<00:06:00.500> quite<00:06:00.710> a<00:06:00.740> while<00:06:02.020> too

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
it will stay hot for quite a while too

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.390 
it will stay hot for quite a while too
as<00:06:03.290> soon<00:06:03.560> as<00:06:03.590> that's<00:06:03.800> cool<00:06:04.160> down<00:06:04.490> well<00:06:04.940> um

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
as soon as that's cool down well um

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.390 
as soon as that's cool down well um
we'll<00:06:07.400> continue<00:06:07.580> with<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.150> process
