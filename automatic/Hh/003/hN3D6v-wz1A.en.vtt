00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.600
 giacomo frigerio golden ball 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.880
 or lariana 2013 2014 if the first 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.010
 midfielder to win this award 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.660
 a great satisfaction 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.300
 honestly I didn't expect it 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.879
 I wanted to hope for it after the season 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.360
 which we did because it comes first 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.850
 the team and for my season but 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.830
 I would also say for the whole career 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.019
 let's call the career love me football 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.840
 amateur from Como because anyway 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.480
 I have been playing football for 18 years and I have 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.890
 made almost all categories not 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.930
 professional 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.960
 here is this but your first one 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.250
 championship won seems ridiculous 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.489
 but it is so 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.820
 I went up as a class as I am 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.640
 demoted via play off play out but 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.090
 this is my first real victory of 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.780
 a championship and I'm very happy it is 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.150
 an incredible emotion 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.430
 and even at 35 I didn't think but 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.320
 actually just an emotion 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.060
 an extraordinary dedication for this 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.439
 award a dedication for this award 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.150
 surely my parents that me 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.590
 always follow since I started 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.660
 play barilla and mine too 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.340
 sister with my niece all the 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.110
 leadership of the real anzano my companions 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.030
 of team however I repeat above all the 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.220
 my parents who are my first 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.470
 fans my first critics there 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.720
 you told that for 12 years since when 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.060
 at the age of 12 they never gave up 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.150
 even now I absolutely Saturday 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 evening although I repeat it 35 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.380
 years in sending messages where he tells me 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.810
 I recommend he goes to bed early because 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.310
 tomorrow we have to play so it means 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.620
 that he also cares so much 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.909
 what are its features in 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:05.030
 field surely the race the grit on 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.770
 made to never give up and I also have a 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.319
 good insertion in my opinion I do not see 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.620
 often the door because the feet anyway 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.450
 they are those that are and indeed if ever 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.370
 should have a child first thing that 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.569
 I will surely make him train with 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.319
 both feet things that i 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.849
 I absolutely don't have it though 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.340
 other characteristics 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.739
 the professional player you admire 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.069
 I admired most definitely gattuso 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.140
 what also reflects me how 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.530
 both as fundamental characteristics 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.989
 is silent and currently I think if it is 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.540
 find one thinks arturo vidal is a 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.480
 player who told us also loves 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.629
 take care of the details both from the point of view 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.000
 physical preparation is in the field 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.230
 as he found himself starting out in 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.879
 second category 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.030
 I must say that the beginning had some 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:58.180
 I don't know why 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.280
 exactly maybe because you play less 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.319
 ball I don't want those who play for 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.980
 years for years in second in third 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.840
 category 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.810
 maybe there is less space there is more 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.180
 aggression and I definitely found 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.889
 at the beginning very big difficulties 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.840
 then later with the help of the bar mystery 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.579
 with my teammates 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.139
 we found a unique common thread 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.370
 which then brought us within two 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.540
 years to achieve the goal that 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.169
 however from that of the jump of 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.049
 category 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.609
 you would have won even in group g 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.250
 where you struggled last year 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.370
 surely a little more this not you 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.019
 I can honestly say I think we have 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.819
 met rovellasca an excellent team 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.150
 I congratulate rovellasca 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.859
 for the changeover category and in my opinion 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.540
 we probably did not demerit ourselves 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.720
 we would be played with them and with the others 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.729
 two serener teams 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.379
 directly the first place which is the 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:50.139
 teammate with whom he is more attached 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.079
 in career I think with mauro clerici 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.329
 we are practically on the lipomo hour 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.939
 every day I am very attached to him and 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.280
 his family and can also be cited 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.590
 lucky to say also lodovico channels with 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.109
 which I played was then lipomo 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.180
 will have and also the athletic grass 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.549
 without forgetting de maria and ferraraccio 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.470
 also their very big friends e 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.930
 your season's big players 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.879
 the best is absolutely from 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.139
 forget giving birth still to forget 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.539
 it was definitely the last year 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.310
 of athletic grass not for how much 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.469
 concerns me personally but for how much 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.630
 it's about everything that happened a 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:27.039
 company level 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.110
 unfortunately we are demoted through 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.490
 playout rose fa is gone and we are not 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.400
 been followed in the last three months 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.110
 so it was really hard 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.150
 the best year removing this I would say 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.639
 the year I was promoted by 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.070
 promotion of excellence with them a 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.289
 lipomo that among other historical precedents 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.430
 promotion in excellence of his 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.789
 history 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.529
 you have had some coaches all very much 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.240
 prepared tell us what that is 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.919
 but he sent you more has you 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.389
 given a little more 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:03.550
 as I mentioned before I remember three 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.839
 coaches a palm tree I have 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.960
 had this year also a 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:09.940
 lipomo mister cirillo but I think that 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.949
 that taught me the most was aldo 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.260
 monza lightning verano I played little 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.630
 sincerely but I took a lot a 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.639
 technical level at tactical level and has 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.529
 28 years I used to juggle for 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.839
 half an hour in the evening always trying to 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:24.400
 make me improve in any aspect 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.770
 I found myself really well 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.349
 I admire fines named by mo 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.849
 cirillo and we told you a little while ago that 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.889
 won the award as a coach 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.020
 of the year there is also a common thread 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.029
 which certainly does not unite you 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.449
 first of all congratulations to the coach with 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:42.849
 one deserves it and two of us have started 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.580
 together with him as a player now 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.680
 say pension so then it was the 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.089
 third tip managed to do more think 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.490
 of ten wants to take us to safety 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:53.110
 then the first year of them then I had it 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.589
 as a coach both then and 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.990
 the athletic grass and for me he is the coach 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:06:00.190
 because anyway we hear each other often 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.860
 we have had fantastic years 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.380
 even tough and for me I'm the captain 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.430
 in fact we call ourselves what you want to do 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.570
 when grown up it says 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.729
 I state that I hope to play again for 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.560
 a few years until I have fun I am fine 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.710
 physically I will definitely not stay in 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.160
 field 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.930
 so to winter when I understand that to 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.100
 time to give up I'll give up 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.200
 I would still like to be a coach 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.770
 there is my life my Sunday without 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.940
 football I just can't imagine it 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.390
 first I will do the course for 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.010
 coach and then I hope to find 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.720
 something to remain in the world anyway 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.100
 of football a last question a 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.340
 point blank that we also did a 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.020
 mister cirillo this interview will be released in 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.320
 world championships concluded 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:48.260
 who will win the world championships in Brazil I have to 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.890
 change I did not think one of Argentina and 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.960
 Germany 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.330
 but in my opinion Italy out now in 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.670
 fund maybe I say as a fan I hope to 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.440
 don't pull on a cap thanks a lot 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.420
 congratulations still created to all and 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.840
 especially the preparation of the sports area 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.840
 thank you so much
