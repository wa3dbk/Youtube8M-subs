00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
inside the phone very carefully we've

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.660 
inside the phone very carefully we've

connector<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.660> all<00:02:31.930> digital<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.830> it's

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
connector it's all digital so it's

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.760 
connector it's all digital so it's
designed<00:02:33.460> for<00:02:33.610> today's<00:02:34.000> uses<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.750> we<00:02:35.440> made<00:02:35.650> it

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
designed for today's uses and we made it

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.360 
designed for today's uses and we made it
reversible<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.910> fits<00:02:37.150> either<00:02:37.390> way<00:02:38.190> we<00:02:39.190> also
