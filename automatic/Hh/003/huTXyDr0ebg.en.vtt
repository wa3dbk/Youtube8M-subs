00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.830
 the youth protection chamber at the start here 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.110
 a nice exercise substitute a 21 before 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.869
 But everything in the biceps focus is up here 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.520
 the forearm speak to a brute 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.960
 This weapon speaks brachial 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.340
 areas below 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.930
 Here we get the exercise I 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.140
 would like to show really cool pump prime 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.140
 with the 21 replacement we make three times 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.630
 seven repetition 2 part repetition 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.400
 so to speak twice in half aero im 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.989
 and once more the whole tribute m 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.329
 we do it with a pole 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.829
 And to really focus more on the 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.730
 I have something to bring here 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.070
 briggs on it 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.899
 but you can also do that alternatively 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.460
 such a pipe insulation from the 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.350
 Baumarkt would have to do these things 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.340
 Buy why I want a 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.510
 make promotional video 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.730
 one can of course always a 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.500
 make a bit and I put indiscriminately 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.649
 I show you the whole time 21 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.760
 Repeat 7 starts from the bottom to 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.780
 half of the m7 piece then once by the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.780
 half up 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.129
 yes again half a m and then the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.259
 last seven repetition again 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.600
 a complete he stretched something else 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.219
 arms up there you can then if the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.289
 power a bit off course 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.999
 also a little bit in one 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.770
 rule is a very good isolations 

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:18.049
 Exercise should focus on exercises 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.429
 run, and you really do not need 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.529
 a lot of weight because you will notice 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.240
 routan is burning right and have 

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:26.439
 her a really hot point point he 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.439
 just down here in the area 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:36.789
 naturally stretched out arms and pull 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.789
 again high to half 

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:41.139
 13 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.950
 45 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
 67 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:18.740
 1377 whole 13 45 67 the simple one 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.970
 we will make her repeat 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.040
 must also be very important in the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.000
 Exercise is really nice to grab that tight 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.770
 means by this handle 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.750
 through these grips you have in 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.340
 Ordinary voltage'll forearm 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.230
 stop and repeat 21 times 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.230
 the first sentence slows down the right way 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.370
 I urge you to just recommend it 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.640
 321 laws to make me less 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.220
 concentrated attention also on the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.660
 execution as good as not out of the red 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.180
 cross next to him even at the last set 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.070
 not that's why the court is very 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.860
 very low then you do not have here 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.630
 the possibility and forearm very much 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.459
 build strong and you will 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.200
 remember a little hint maybe 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.290
 right after the exercise a bit here 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.410
 the forearm so that we a bit 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.360
 the muscle tone comes out eighth otherwise 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.590
 it can quickly cramp I hope 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.590
 I could help you
