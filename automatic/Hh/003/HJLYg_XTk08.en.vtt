as<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.480> solar<00:00:54.719> panels<00:00:55.230> okay<00:00:56.219> when<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.149> move

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
as the solar panels okay when we move

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.049 
as the solar panels okay when we move
over<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.690> hand<00:00:57.989> side<00:00:58.460> we<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.489> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
over to the right hand side we have and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.389 
over to the right hand side we have and
I<00:01:00.120> didn't<00:01:00.329> grommet<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.050> yet<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.190> is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
I didn't grommet this in yet and this is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.509 
I didn't grommet this in yet and this is
again<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.000> one-zero<00:01:03.329> box<00:01:03.989> right<00:01:04.769> but

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
again this is one-zero box right but

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.859 
again this is one-zero box right but
you'll<00:01:06.180> see<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.549> battery<00:01:08.549> tender

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
you'll see that this is a battery tender

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.649 
you'll see that this is a battery tender
okay<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.369> don't<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.210> go<00:01:12.330> out<00:01:12.479> and

okay and if you don't want to go out and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.240 
okay and if you don't want to go out and
charge<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:14.159> box<00:01:14.400> or<00:01:15.619> do<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.130> know

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
charge the box or do you just you know

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.670 
charge the box or do you just you know
want<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.000> plug<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.630> charge<00:01:18.680> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
want to plug it in and charge that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.210 
want to plug it in and charge that
battery<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.930> 125<00:01:22.830> amp

this is the one daughter box really if

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.630 
this is the one daughter box really if
you<00:02:43.590> look<00:02:43.680> around<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.220> box<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.610> has

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
you look around on this box it has

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.699 
you look around on this box it has
everything<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.300> doesn't<00:02:45.540> this<00:02:45.989> wasn't<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.590> was

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
everything it doesn't this wasn't it was

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.199 
everything it doesn't this wasn't it was
this<00:02:46.920> was<00:02:47.130> just<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.430> see<00:02:47.580> if<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.760> could<00:02:47.940> do<00:02:48.060> it

you know I'm saying I threw everything

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.250 
you know I'm saying I threw everything
on<00:02:50.160> here<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.580> did<00:02:50.760> not<00:02:50.940> need<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.600> generally

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
on here it did not need this generally

on here it did not need this generally
most<00:02:52.500> people<00:02:52.920> in<00:02:53.160> an<00:02:53.520> emergency<00:02:53.940> condition

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
will not need to open this box at all it

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.710 
will not need to open this box at all it
is<00:03:13.680> 100%<00:03:14.330> rock-solid<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:16.850> connecting<00:03:17.850> boxes

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
is 100% rock-solid the connecting boxes

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.140 
is 100% rock-solid the connecting boxes
these<00:03:18.840> are<00:03:19.019> two<00:03:19.200> separate<00:03:19.860> boxes<00:03:20.070> they<00:03:20.790> lock

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
these are two separate boxes they lock

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.620 
these are two separate boxes they lock
into<00:03:22.080> place<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.940> after<00:03:23.940> they've<00:03:24.090> locked<00:03:24.330> into

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
into place and after they've locked into

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:33.830 
into place and after they've locked into
place<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.950> further<00:03:26.519> have<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:29.269> rod<00:03:32.690> that<00:03:33.690> you

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
place you further have a rod that you

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.759 
place you further have a rod that you
run<00:03:34.019> into<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.320> box

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
run into the box

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.900 
run into the box
here<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:36.769> put<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.799> padlock<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:41.700> Box

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
here and put a padlock on and the Box

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.750 
here and put a padlock on and the Box
cannot<00:03:42.299> be<00:03:42.480> entered<00:03:42.980> okay<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.430> locks

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
cannot be entered okay so that locks

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.440 
cannot be entered okay so that locks
this<00:03:44.970> box<00:03:45.269> down<00:03:46.730> mm-hmm

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
this box down mm-hmm

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.220 
this box down mm-hmm
so<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> complete<00:03:50.390> modular<00:03:51.390> kit<00:03:51.660> it's

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
so this is a complete modular kit it's

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.830 
so this is a complete modular kit it's
probably<00:03:52.860> more<00:03:53.040> power<00:03:53.340> than<00:03:54.060> most<00:03:54.329> people

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
probably more power than most people

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.680 
probably more power than most people
will<00:03:55.019> need<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.709> an<00:03:56.010> emergency<00:03:56.400> capacity<00:03:57.000> but

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
will need in an emergency capacity but

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.130 
will need in an emergency capacity but
certainly<00:03:58.620> nice<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:58.890> have<00:03:59.570> 125<00:04:00.570> amp<00:04:00.900> hour

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
certainly nice to have 125 amp hour

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.340 
certainly nice to have 125 amp hour
battery<00:04:01.290> in<00:04:01.829> there<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.549> is<00:04:02.790> not<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.959> be<00:04:03.989> opened

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350

battery in there it is not to be opened
you<00:04:04.709> don't<00:04:04.920> need<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.670> will<00:04:06.000> simply

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
you don't need to it will simply

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.720 
you don't need to it will simply
continue<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.500> work<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:08.250> need<00:04:08.400> an<00:04:08.489> emergency

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
continue to work you need an emergency

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.030 
continue to work you need an emergency
