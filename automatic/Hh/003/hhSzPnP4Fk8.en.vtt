00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.720 
back to American Ninja Warrior today
we're<00:00:03.570> going<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.750> be<00:00:03.870> going<00:00:04.259> into<00:00:04.770> stage<00:00:05.279> two

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
we're going to be going into stage two

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.579 
we're going to be going into stage two
so<00:00:06.330> there's<00:00:06.569> not<00:00:06.720> much<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:07.049> say<00:00:07.200> about<00:00:07.230> if<00:00:07.500> you

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
so there's not much to say about if you

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.589 
so there's not much to say about if you
haven't<00:00:07.830> seen<00:00:07.950> Episode<00:00:08.370> one<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:09.120> then

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
haven't seen Episode one of this then

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.940 
haven't seen Episode one of this then
you<00:00:09.780> bet<00:00:10.080> definitely<00:00:10.559> might<00:00:10.710> want<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.860> go

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
you bet definitely might want to go

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.680 
you bet definitely might want to go
check<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.190> out<00:00:11.250> because<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.519> did<00:00:11.790> defeat<00:00:12.179> stage

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
check it out because I did defeat stage

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.470 
check it out because I did defeat stage
one<00:00:13.110> without<00:00:13.620> one<00:00:14.070> single<00:00:14.429> fail<00:00:14.820> hopefully<00:00:15.360> we

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
one without one single fail hopefully we

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.420 
one without one single fail hopefully we
can<00:00:15.630> do<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:16.080> stage<00:00:16.350> two<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.070> after

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
can do that with stage two and after

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.130 
can do that with stage two and after
that<00:00:17.550> our<00:00:18.000> next<00:00:18.300> two<00:00:18.390> episodes<00:00:18.510> are<00:00:18.840> going<00:00:19.020> to

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
that our next two episodes are going to

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.990 
that our next two episodes are going to
be<00:00:19.230> stage<00:00:19.439> three<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:19.920> four<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> think

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
be stage three and four and I think

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.370 
be stage three and four and I think
there<00:00:21.150> might<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.359> another<00:00:21.480> stage<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.230> don't

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
there might be another stage I don't

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.779 
there might be another stage I don't
know<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:22.949> says<00:00:23.100> stage<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.609> two

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
know but it just says stage one two

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.009 
know but it just says stage one two
three<00:00:24.060> four<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.330> don't<00:00:24.510> know<00:00:24.720> there<00:00:24.869> might<00:00:24.900> be

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
three four I don't know there might be

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.630 
three four I don't know there might be
like<00:00:25.260> another<00:00:25.560> map<00:00:25.890> or<00:00:26.130> something<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.550> this

see but as of right now in this episode

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.370 
see but as of right now in this episode
we<00:00:32.820> are<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.360> taking<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.750> stage<00:00:34.079> two

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
we are going to be taking on stage two

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.470 
we are going to be taking on stage two
so<00:00:35.010> let's<00:00:35.190> go<00:00:35.250> ahead<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.760> into<00:00:35.910> stage<00:00:36.180> two

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
so let's go ahead and get into stage two

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.020 
so let's go ahead and get into stage two
I<00:00:36.510> believe<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> stage<00:00:37.559> 2<00:00:37.890> yes<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.730> I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
I believe this is a stage 2 yes it is I

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.450 
I believe this is a stage 2 yes it is I
don't<00:00:39.360> know<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.110> time<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.950> same<00:00:41.219> or

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
don't know if the time is the same or

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
don't know if the time is the same or
different<00:00:41.610> or<00:00:41.910> shorter<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.510> stage<00:00:42.780> 2<00:00:43.050> does

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
different or shorter but stage 2 does

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.529 
different or shorter but stage 2 does
actually<00:00:43.440> look<00:00:43.620> somewhat<00:00:44.430> kind<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.760> short<00:00:45.059> so

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
actually look somewhat kind of short so

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.260 
actually look somewhat kind of short so
let's<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.930> how<00:00:46.230> much<00:00:46.590> time<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.700> stage

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
let's see how much time we have on stage

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.500 
let's see how much time we have on stage
2<00:00:48.629> what<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.829> say<00:00:50.180> okay<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.329> just

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
2 what is it going to say okay it just

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
2 what is it going to say okay it just
says<00:00:51.629> I'm<00:00:51.780> attempting<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.559> clear<00:00:52.770> stage<00:00:53.039> -

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
says I'm attempting to clear stage -

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.100 
says I'm attempting to clear stage -
good<00:00:53.610> luck<00:00:53.789> Oh<00:00:54.030> doesn't<00:00:54.660> give<00:00:54.750> me<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> timeline

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
good luck Oh doesn't give me a timeline

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.080 
good luck Oh doesn't give me a timeline
I<00:00:55.350> guess<00:00:55.530> there's<00:00:55.710> no<00:00:55.770> time<00:00:55.980> limit<00:00:56.129> maybe<00:00:56.520> that

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I guess there's no time limit maybe that

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.130 
I guess there's no time limit maybe that
would<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.270> pretty<00:00:57.420> cool<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.840> guess

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
would be pretty cool I guess

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.799 
would be pretty cool I guess
Oh<00:00:58.440> oh<00:00:59.399> my<00:00:59.760> gosh<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.210> was<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.600> harder

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
Oh oh my gosh that was actually harder

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.270 
Oh oh my gosh that was actually harder
than<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.989> thought<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> would<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.440> okay

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
than I thought it would be okay

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.070 
than I thought it would be okay
this<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.359> one<00:01:03.629> thing<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
this is like that one thing we have to

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.450 
this is like that one thing we have to
jump<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.470> back<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.769> forth<00:01:04.830> okay<00:01:05.040> maybe<00:01:05.309> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
jump like back and forth okay maybe it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.770 
jump like back and forth okay maybe it's
not<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.670> hard<00:01:05.790> maybe<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.090> was<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.299> messing

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
not that hard maybe I was just messing

not that hard maybe I was just messing
up<00:01:06.869> okay<00:01:07.200> I'm<00:01:07.409> messing<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.799> I'm<00:01:08.189> messing<00:01:08.490> up

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549

real bad and the sun's going down okay
yeah<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.360> got<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.810> got

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
yeah we can do this we got this we got

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.330 
yeah we can do this we got this we got
this<00:01:12.960> note<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.409> don't<00:01:13.590> got<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.860> actually

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
this note we don't got this actually

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.149 
this note we don't got this actually
harder<00:01:14.549> than<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.760> thought<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> would<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.299> oh

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
harder than I thought it would be oh

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.600 
harder than I thought it would be oh
there<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.280> go

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
there we go

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.390 
there we go
I<00:01:17.640> think<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.479> need<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.750> more<00:01:18.930> careful

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
I think I just need to be more careful

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.969 
I think I just need to be more careful
there<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.640> go<00:01:20.850> okay<00:01:21.330> okay<00:01:22.290> hopefully<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.770> won't

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
there we go okay okay hopefully I won't
