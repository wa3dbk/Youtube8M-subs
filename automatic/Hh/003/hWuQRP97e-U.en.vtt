00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.380
 ap 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.830
 and he likes 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.820
 17 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.059
 the first proposed situation was a 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.699
 diagnostic situation in which the teacher 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.550
 Mara asked the children to solve 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.440
 some operations a restructuring 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.469
 edition of multiplication mine of 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.510
 division and also edited numbers 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.780
 teacher mara sent this production 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.989
 of the students and I was looking for two 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.270
 axes and did a quantitative analysis 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.180
 and a qualitative analysis of production 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.950
 of the students the quantitative was a 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.470
 excel sheet and I was putting 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:20.890
 right and who erred the saying of numbers 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.929
 or operations in the qualitative analysis to 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.390
 People can see the nature of mistakes. 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:28.000
 what kind of mistake does the child make if 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.860
 for example, it understands the meaning of 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.800
 numbers or what each digit represents 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.179
 the proposal I made was not in a 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.659
 first moment was not to calculate 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:40.119
 it was to think about a calculus look 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.390
 as some children calculated then 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:48.220
 the teacher of these children proposed 55 - 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.289
 17 and paula solved this way valÃ©ria 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.670
 solved this another way 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.670
 So how is it, paula solved it? 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.870
 she's a fashion champion 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.570
 stayed 10 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.399
 it is easier to make 55 minus 10 than if 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.679
 56 will have 17 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.420
 is very common in the operations of these 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.910
 children to treat organisms in a way that 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.890
 separate this type of error is an error that 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.420
 has to do with the way she went 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.420
 taught to calculate 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:34.780
 he thinks it is not military 500 if thirst 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.420
 the company becomes easier then 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.610
 how it seemed to me that they were very 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.400
 far from the procedures that were 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.500
 presenting I proposed that they themselves 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.810
 make a calculation at the time I 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.280
 I ask them to calculate all will have 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.670
 that enter in some way into the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.590
 put the procedure into play 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.570
 analyzed at the time of the 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.030
 resolution of talc had some children 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.310
 that for example they were so 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.680
 conditioned to work with the rhythm 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.800
 that they tried to solve 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.560
 by the conventional algorithm 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.570
 Wrong mistake in calculation and confuse 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.610
 a number right but not 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.500
 they related one thing to the other 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.269
 so in this case the inter ven if I 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.239
 I'm one thousand two hundred forty-seven 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.390
 paid 608 is it possible for me to stay 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.090
 with 1441 reais 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.519
 not many of these children use a 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.500
 algorithm but they do not know how to use it 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.660
 with disabilities then they commit 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.880
 some mistakes so I was helping to 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.650
 these children to find the self of the 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.810
 algorithm at the same time as I was going to 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.750
 proposing this other way of calculating 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.280
 which was a procedure based on the 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.290
 decomposition of numbers into a 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.120
 mental calculation procedure as it is 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.440
 which is decomposed 28 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:54.250
 I was equal to 14 plus 14 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.980
 Are you in any other way? 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.590
 just as this group still needs 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.110
 learn to justify mathematically in 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.110
 end of the class I tried to draw up a 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.900
 single conclusion a tip that help the 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.600
 children to check results then 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.630
 possible outcome was the result of a 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.670
 subtraction can never be greater than 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.430
 the starting number at that time is 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.989
 interesting to look at as the terms of 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.989
 subtraction makes sense 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.240
 I even tired 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.460
 they had already learned the terms of 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.490
 subtraction but they never used 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.020
 because they are not accustomed to talking 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.150
 mathematically help them explain and 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.250
 formulate more mathematically with 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.890
 mathematical arguments is an intervention 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.110
 important of the teacher draws attention to 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.050
 people pick up a 4th grade class and 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.790
 still need to discuss whether he drew the 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.580
 multiplication division addition 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.210
 however if we receive a class 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.920
 of students who still have questions 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.920
 relative to natural numbers 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.560
 we need to take a step back and 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.140
 listen to these children look what 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.110
 do they know what knowledge they 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.630
 they need to be able to follow in this 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.630
 autonomous path of thinking 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.730
 mathematician, then it's no use taking the 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.170
 curricular contents of numbers 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:24.570
 and propose to this group that 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.550
 still have many doubts about the 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.680
 multiplication with integers 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.710
 so the ideal is to observe the 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.770
 what resources they have and what they 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.890
 how they advanced then it is no use 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.590
 nothing to pass content where all the 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:43.770
 my students learn the knowledge 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.530
 which will be fundamental to 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.070
 they advance in this path that I 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.070
 do math
