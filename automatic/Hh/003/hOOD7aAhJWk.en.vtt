anything but it's it kind of went the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.339 
anything but it's it kind of went the
funny<00:00:28.890> way<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.539> weren't<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.260> were

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
funny way so we we weren't like we were

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.440 
funny way so we we weren't like we were
just<00:00:31.560> having<00:00:31.710> fun<00:00:31.859> pretty<00:00:32.250> much<00:00:32.430> there<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
just having fun pretty much there so the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.200 
just having fun pretty much there so the
decision<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> throw<00:00:34.040> so<00:00:35.040> as<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.489> blitzcrank<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
decision to throw so as on blitzcrank it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.910 
decision to throw so as on blitzcrank it
wasn't<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:36.630> let's<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.559> little<00:00:37.649> bit<00:00:37.800> more

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
wasn't like let's have a little bit more

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.350 
wasn't like let's have a little bit more
fun<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.309> was<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.910> would<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.090> done<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
fun that was you would have done that

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.810 
fun that was you would have done that
again<00:00:39.660> Staind<00:00:39.840> team<00:00:40.070> not<00:00:41.070> against<00:00:41.340> any<00:00:41.520> team<00:00:41.579> I

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
again Staind team not against any team I

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.490 
again Staind team not against any team I
think<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.840> serious<00:00:43.140> match

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
think if it was a really serious match

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.959 
think if it was a really serious match
we<00:00:43.710> wouldn't<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.100> done<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.399> mostly<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.760> don't

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
we wouldn't have done it mostly I don't

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.010 
we wouldn't have done it mostly I don't
think<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.239> bad<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.690> didn't<00:00:45.870> really

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
think it's bad but we didn't really

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.440 
think it's bad but we didn't really
practice<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.649> much<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.270> felt

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
practice it that much so you just felt

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.549 
practice it that much so you just felt
like<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.840> something<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.469> could

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
like it was something that you could

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.110 
like it was something that you could
pull<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:49.860> specifically<00:00:50.399> against<00:00:50.670> mineski

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
pull out specifically against mineski

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.119 
pull out specifically against mineski

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
paying too much attention like we were

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.590 
paying too much attention like we were
talking<00:00:59.520> about<00:00:59.609> something<00:00:59.910> else<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:00.510> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
talking about something else and then I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.819 
talking about something else and then I
noticed<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:01.020> wait<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.620> four

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
confused but then I was like it doesn't

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.980 
confused but then I was like it doesn't
really<00:01:05.850> matter<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.119> them<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:06.780> win<00:01:06.960> or

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
up against uh it's a bit hard to say

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.469 
up against uh it's a bit hard to say
like<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:59.040> probably<00:01:59.460> nachum<00:01:59.850> warden

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
like I think probably nachum warden

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
nine and gamma bears are probably the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.289 
nine and gamma bears are probably the
two<00:02:04.770> easiest<00:02:05.009> ones<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.549> I'm<00:02:05.759> not<00:02:05.909> sure<00:02:05.939> at<00:02:06.180> all

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
two easiest ones but I'm not sure at all

two easiest ones but I'm not sure at all
it<00:02:06.509> might<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:07.020> completely<00:02:07.500> reverse<00:02:07.950> even<00:02:08.369> but

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580

going<00:03:02.730> back<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.000> screaming<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.510> sort<00:03:03.959> of

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
going back and screaming and sort of

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.270 
going back and screaming and sort of
saying<00:03:04.260> well<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.709> we'll<00:03:04.829> figure<00:03:05.099> it<00:03:05.190> out

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
saying well you know we'll figure it out

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.400 
saying well you know we'll figure it out
whenever<00:03:05.489> we<00:03:05.640> get<00:03:05.849> in<00:03:05.970> game<00:03:06.120> well<00:03:07.049> we<00:03:07.230> will

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
whenever we get in game well we will

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.990 
whenever we get in game well we will
research<00:03:07.769> for<00:03:08.040> sure<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.549> will<00:03:08.700> talk<00:03:08.819> about

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
research for sure and we will talk about

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.229 
research for sure and we will talk about
it<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.980> we<00:03:10.980> will<00:03:11.099> practice<00:03:11.310> speaks<00:03:11.849> according

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
it and we will practice speaks according

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.020 
it and we will practice speaks according
that<00:03:12.420> probably<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.230> but<00:03:14.010> yeah<00:03:14.190> it's<00:03:14.730> really

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
that probably and but yeah it's really

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.580 
that probably and but yeah it's really
hard<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.390> figure<00:03:15.420> out<00:03:15.750> these<00:03:15.959> teams<00:03:16.230> because

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
hard to figure out these teams because

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.259 
hard to figure out these teams because
obviously<00:03:17.010> we<00:03:17.400> haven't<00:03:17.549> played<00:03:17.790> them<00:03:17.940> as<00:03:18.060> much

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
obviously we haven't played them as much

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.670 
obviously we haven't played them as much
week<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.750> we<00:03:18.870> haven't<00:03:19.079> seen<00:03:19.230> anything<00:03:19.440> from

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
week and we haven't seen anything from

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.379 
week and we haven't seen anything from
them<00:03:19.859> because<00:03:20.069> they<00:03:20.430> are<00:03:20.519> not<00:03:20.549> they<00:03:21.209> didn't

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
them because they are not they didn't

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.460 
them because they are not they didn't
play<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.690> group<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.049> it's<00:03:22.169> going<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.349> be<00:03:22.440> a

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
play in the group so it's going to be a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.599 
play in the group so it's going to be a
bit<00:03:22.650> tough<00:03:22.799> like<00:03:23.040> it's<00:03:23.190> going<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.400> be<00:03:23.459> easier

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
bit tough like it's going to be easier

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.659 
bit tough like it's going to be easier
from<00:03:23.880> them<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.480> research<00:03:24.780> us<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.799> might<00:03:26.250> be

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
from them to research us but it might be

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.190 
from them to research us but it might be
our<00:03:26.760> advantage<00:03:27.239> as<00:03:27.389> well<00:03:27.419> that<00:03:27.750> we<00:03:27.870> are<00:03:27.959> kind

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
our advantage as well that we are kind

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.930 
our advantage as well that we are kind
of<00:03:28.290> warm<00:03:28.500> now<00:03:28.709> from<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.190> groups<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.669> we<00:03:29.819> are

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
of warm now from the groups and we are

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.400 
of warm now from the groups and we are
ready<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.299> play<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.569> they<00:03:30.900> are<00:03:30.989> just<00:03:31.169> coming

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
ready to play and they are just coming

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.159 
ready to play and they are just coming
and<00:03:31.680> it's<00:03:31.859> gonna<00:03:32.069> be<00:03:32.510> there<00:03:33.510> like<00:03:33.720> first

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
and it's gonna be there like first

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.199 
and it's gonna be there like first
offline<00:03:34.470> event<00:03:34.739> in<00:03:34.859> a<00:03:34.919> while<00:03:35.099> so<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:35.849> it<00:03:35.940> almost

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
offline event in a while so is it almost

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.539 
offline event in a while so is it almost
like<00:03:36.359> a<00:03:36.419> trade-off<00:03:36.720> for<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:38.340> don't

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
like a trade-off for you you you don't

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.190 
like a trade-off for you you you don't
get<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:39.030> have<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.359> knowledge<00:03:39.510> on<00:03:39.840> their<00:03:39.989> team

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
get to have the knowledge on their team

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.509 
get to have the knowledge on their team
but<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.530> feel<00:03:40.709> like<00:03:40.739> you'll<00:03:41.010> come<00:03:41.190> in<00:03:41.310> with<00:03:41.489> a

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
but you feel like you'll come in with a

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.339 
but you feel like you'll come in with a
little<00:03:41.790> bit<00:03:41.910> more<00:03:42.030> experience<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:43.109> little

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
bit more strength coming from the group

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.530 
bit more strength coming from the group

think that there are any teams in the
group<00:04:07.319> stage<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.680> are<00:04:07.769> doing<00:04:07.980> really<00:04:08.129> well

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
group stage that are doing really well

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.280 
group stage that are doing really well
beyond<00:04:09.090> what<00:04:09.359> you<00:04:09.480> had<00:04:09.629> expected<00:04:09.900> from<00:04:10.139> them

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
beyond what you had expected from them

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.629 
beyond what you had expected from them
or<00:04:10.440> any<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.829> are<00:04:10.949> sort<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.250> failing<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.579> meet

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
or any that are sort of failing to meet

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.270 
or any that are sort of failing to meet
your<00:04:11.790> expectations<00:04:12.329> oh<00:04:12.510> well<00:04:13.379> we<00:04:13.949> didn't<00:04:14.160> know

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
your expectations oh well we didn't know

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.310 
your expectations oh well we didn't know
much<00:04:14.489> about<00:04:14.669> OMG<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.510> skate<00:04:15.930> here<00:04:16.109> so

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
much about OMG and skate here so

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.659 
much about OMG and skate here so
obviously<00:04:16.739> they<00:04:16.919> are<00:04:17.010> going<00:04:17.190> through<00:04:17.280> from

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
obviously they are going through from

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.420 
obviously they are going through from
the<00:04:17.699> other<00:04:17.820> group<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:18.829> it<00:04:19.829> wasn't<00:04:20.160> really<00:04:20.340> a

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
the other group so it wasn't really a

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.270 
the other group so it wasn't really a
surprise<00:04:20.810> but<00:04:21.810> mostly<00:04:22.380> I'm<00:04:22.590> surprised<00:04:23.070> about

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
surprise but mostly I'm surprised about

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.430 
surprise but mostly I'm surprised about
us<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.669> think<00:04:23.700> like<00:04:24.120> we<00:04:24.390> went<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:24.780> really<00:04:25.140> like

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
us I think like we went it really like

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.810 
us I think like we went it really like
flying<00:04:25.919> so<00:04:26.340> I<00:04:26.370> didn't

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
flying so I didn't

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
perspective on why it seems to be that

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.610 
perspective on why it seems to be that
you<00:05:11.670> guys<00:05:11.820> do<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:12.420> well<00:05:12.630> against<00:05:12.930> gambit

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620

you guys do so well against gambit
repeatedly<00:05:14.310> I<00:05:16.280> really<00:05:17.280> have<00:05:17.400> no<00:05:17.580> answer<00:05:18.030> for

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
repeatedly I really have no answer for

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.460 
repeatedly I really have no answer for
that<00:05:18.240> i'm<00:05:18.540> not<00:05:18.780> sure<00:05:18.900> i<00:05:18.930> think<00:05:19.080> we<00:05:19.350> are<00:05:19.440> just

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
that i'm not sure i think we are just

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.280 
that i'm not sure i think we are just
maybe<00:05:20.010> a<00:05:20.340> bit<00:05:20.580> better<00:05:20.730> and<00:05:21.120> we<00:05:21.540> plan<00:05:22.020> out<00:05:22.140> the

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
maybe a bit better and we plan out the

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.260 
maybe a bit better and we plan out the
picks<00:05:22.470> and<00:05:22.590> bans<00:05:22.680> more<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.370> we<00:05:23.640> all<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.120> time

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
picks and bans more and we all the time

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.120 
picks and bans more and we all the time
with<00:05:24.420> yourself<00:05:24.810> out<00:05:25.110> we<00:05:25.410> commend<00:05:25.800> them<00:05:25.950> and

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
with yourself out we commend them and

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.470 
with yourself out we commend them and
then<00:05:26.310> normally<00:05:26.670> we<00:05:26.760> all<00:05:26.880> play<00:05:27.060> them<00:05:27.210> as<00:05:27.330> well

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
then normally we all play them as well

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.120 
then normally we all play them as well
so<00:05:28.050> do<00:05:28.140> you<00:05:28.200> think<00:05:28.260> it<00:05:28.470> comes<00:05:28.710> down<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:29.040> the

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
so do you think it comes down to the

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.650 
so do you think it comes down to the
picks<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.400> bans<00:05:29.490> more<00:05:29.940> or<00:05:30.180> do<00:05:30.240> you<00:05:30.330> think<00:05:30.510> it's

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
picks and bans more or do you think it's

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.570 
picks and bans more or do you think it's
like<00:05:30.870> just<00:05:31.290> maybe<00:05:31.440> a<00:05:31.530> play<00:05:31.770> style<00:05:32.070> class<00:05:32.340> or

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
like just maybe a play style class or

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.890 
like just maybe a play style class or
maybe<00:05:32.790> your<00:05:32.940> play<00:05:33.090> style<00:05:33.330> is<00:05:33.510> sort<00:05:33.720> of<00:05:33.750> like

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
maybe your play style is sort of like
