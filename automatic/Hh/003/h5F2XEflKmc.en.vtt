and<00:00:00.089> we<00:00:00.630> can<00:00:00.780> see<00:00:00.989> that<00:00:01.260> in<00:00:01.709> the<00:00:02.010> atomic

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
and we can see that in the atomic

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.789 
and we can see that in the atomic
structures<00:00:03.240> as<00:00:03.419> well<00:00:05.629> this<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.839> ball<00:00:07.589> and

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
structures as well this is a ball and

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.120 
structures as well this is a ball and
spoke<00:00:08.099> model<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.420> same<00:00:09.990> atomic<00:00:10.440> structure

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
spoke model of the same atomic structure

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.440 
spoke model of the same atomic structure
of<00:00:11.370> clay<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.420> we've<00:00:12.570> just<00:00:13.099> constructed

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
of clay that we've just constructed

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.420

these<00:00:15.450> are<00:00:16.490> oxygen<00:00:17.490> silica<00:00:18.330> tetrahedra<00:00:19.430> these

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
these are oxygen silica tetrahedra these

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.120 
these are oxygen silica tetrahedra these
are<00:00:20.910> water<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.550> aluminum<00:00:23.550> atoms<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.130> here

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
are water and aluminum atoms and here

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.700 
are water and aluminum atoms and here
are<00:00:26.340> oxygen<00:00:26.789> silicon<00:00:27.119> tetrahedron<00:00:27.710> these

rather<00:00:29.310> distracting<00:00:30.029> connecting<00:00:30.539> rods<00:00:30.750> are

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
rather distracting connecting rods are

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.330 
rather distracting connecting rods are
simply<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.349> hold<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.769> model<00:00:32.219> together

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
simply to hold the model together

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.510 
simply to hold the model together
they're<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:33.030> atomic<00:00:33.360> bonds<00:00:33.989> such<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:34.800> these

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
they're not atomic bonds such as these

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.060 
they're not atomic bonds such as these
links<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.930> what<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.440> then<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.890> have

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
links are so what we have then we have

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.520 
links are so what we have then we have

compared with one another the essential

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.150 
compared with one another the essential
difference<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.490> potassium<00:01:59.240> atoms

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
difference is that the potassium atoms

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.219 
difference is that the potassium atoms
that<00:02:01.160> are<00:02:01.220> present<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.880> mica<00:02:02.090> are<00:02:02.390> missing

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
that are present in the mica are missing

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.450 
that are present in the mica are missing
in<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.800> clay<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:05.300> is<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.840> good<00:02:06.170> hint<00:02:06.460> but

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
in the clay and that is a good hint but

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.990 
in the clay and that is a good hint but
we<00:02:07.610> can<00:02:07.790> very<00:02:08.030> easily<00:02:08.119> make<00:02:08.750> clay<00:02:09.369> from<00:02:10.369> Micah

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
we can very easily make clay from Micah

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.699 
we can very easily make clay from Micah
because<00:02:11.720> we've<00:02:11.870> already<00:02:12.050> seen<00:02:12.500> that

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
because we've already seen that

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.480 
because we've already seen that
potassium<00:02:13.100> atoms<00:02:13.700> are<00:02:13.940> very<00:02:14.120> soluble<00:02:14.660> in

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
potassium atoms are very soluble in

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.150 
potassium atoms are very soluble in
potash<00:02:16.490> or<00:02:17.030> potassium<00:02:17.480> feldspar<00:02:18.320> if<00:02:18.950> we<00:02:19.010> can

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
potash or potassium feldspar if we can

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.010 
potash or potassium feldspar if we can
lose<00:02:19.340> them<00:02:19.489> in<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.640> feldspar<00:02:20.090> we<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:20.810> lose

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
lose them in the feldspar we can lose

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.500 
lose them in the feldspar we can lose
them<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.410> mica<00:02:21.590> too<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.120> fact<00:02:23.300> we've

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
them in the mica too so in fact we've

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.370 
them in the mica too so in fact we've
got<00:02:23.690> two<00:02:24.080> sources<00:02:24.560> in<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.100> granite<00:02:25.459> for<00:02:25.970> clay

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
got two sources in the granite for clay

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.510 
got two sources in the granite for clay
dominantly<00:02:27.380> feldspar<00:02:27.980> because<00:02:28.310> it's<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
dominantly feldspar because it's the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.350 
dominantly feldspar because it's the
most<00:02:28.700> important<00:02:29.270> mineral<00:02:29.570> but<00:02:30.050> also<00:02:30.290> mica<00:02:31.360> an

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
most important mineral but also mica an

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.630 
most important mineral but also mica an

the clay was the solution of the
