00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.010
So you want to update your exterior, but don’t
have the budget for a full makeover? Here

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.930
are some easy and affordable ideas to boost
your home’s curb appeal.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.860
Start by hiding the unsightly things around
your house…like the hose. Hanging it up

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.020
is a simple way to make it more accessible
and attractive.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.850
Fixed features, like an air conditioning unit,
don’t have to stick out like a sore thumb.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.470
Hide them by building a basic screen with
a few pieces of lumber; it’s easy to tailor

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.000
the height, the width and the look.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.030
For an even faster fix use premade panels
of fencing to create a screen you can just

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.129
set in place. If you ever change your mind,
this project is even removable…which is

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.139
great for renters!

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:48.920
Now let’s move on to the front of your home.
Showcase your windows - with shutters! They’re

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.089
surprisingly easy and affordable to build
- these are just basic boards joined together

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.850
and hung on the house.
Whether you build them from scratch or buy

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.739
them premade, shutters provide a real ‘finished’
feel,.. with styles to suit any home.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.650
Want another way to wake up your windows?
Add some extra trim to really complete their

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.610
look. Trim out a pair, or more…. to provide
more ‘presence’.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.660
Trim isn’t just for windows either…you
can also add trim to your door. Bulk it up

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.900
or add embellishments to really make it pop.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.900
Next is a surprisingly dramatic improvement….stone
veneer. Easily added to columns, posts, foundations

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.000
or stairs… stone veener isn’t just for
the pros anymore. Specially designed panels

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.060
are easy to mount with screws or adhesive,
bringing the high-end look of stone to any

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.480
DIYer.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.200
Almost any home looks more welcoming with
window boxes filled with flowers. You can

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.550
keep them simple or make them more decorative,
and you can build your own or buy them premade.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.230
2nd pickup

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.830
While you’re into improving, don’t forget
to give a little love to your garage…think

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.530
of your basic door as a blank canvas. Try
painting a pattern, adding some hardware,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.149
or using a kit to create the look of carriage
windows. They’re all easy ideas that are

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.569
much less expensive than a whole new door.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.010
Any of these ideas is going to make a big
difference when it comes to improving your

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.849
home’s exterior…so try one or try them
all, and take your home from a basic before,

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.459
to an awesome after.
