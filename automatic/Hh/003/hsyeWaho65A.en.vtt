00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
not gonna figure out how to do this so

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.990 
not gonna figure out how to do this so
you<00:03:01.480> as<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.959> parent<00:03:02.410> are<00:03:02.770> going<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.640> have<00:03:03.790> to

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
you as a parent are going to have to

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.570 
you as a parent are going to have to
because<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.690> does<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.950> does<00:03:06.100> take<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.310> little

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
because it it does it does take a little

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.979 
because it it does it does take a little
bit<00:03:06.730> sick<00:03:07.090> will<00:03:07.450> wiggle<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.170> out<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.470> there<00:03:08.620> and

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
bit sick will wiggle it out of there and

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.740 
bit sick will wiggle it out of there and
just<00:03:10.989> shove<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.440> in<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.800> it<00:03:11.890> locks<00:03:12.600> okay<00:03:13.630> I
