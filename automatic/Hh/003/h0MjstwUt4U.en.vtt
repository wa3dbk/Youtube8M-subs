replaced with a porcelain fused to metal

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.790 
replaced with a porcelain fused to metal
bridge<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.900> that<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.199> pretty<00:00:37.530> much<00:00:37.739> what

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
bridge and that is pretty much what

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
bridge and that is pretty much what
conventional<00:00:38.550> bridges<00:00:38.879> look<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.449> looked

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
conventional bridges look like it looked

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.600 
conventional bridges look like it looked
kind<00:00:39.900> of<00:00:39.960> opaque<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.739> real<00:00:41.010> vital<00:00:41.340> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
kind of opaque not real vital and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.880 
kind of opaque not real vital and
appearance<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.840> has<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.079> metal<00:00:43.380> underneath

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
appearance it has the metal underneath

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.889 
appearance it has the metal underneath
it<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.340> supporting<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.600> right<00:00:45.750> hand

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
it to supporting on the right hand

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.700 
it to supporting on the right hand
screen<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.380> have<00:00:46.410> replaced<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
screen we have replaced that with a

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
screen we have replaced that with a
bridge<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.739> does<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.430> metal<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.970> it<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.600> it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
bridge that does have metal in it but it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.380 
bridge that does have metal in it but it
has<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> gold<00:00:52.500> under<00:00:53.340> undertone<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.180> which

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
has a gold under undertone to it which

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.030 
has a gold under undertone to it which
looks<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.930> natural<00:00:55.350> tooth<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
looks like a natural tooth and then the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.330 
looks like a natural tooth and then the
rest<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> teeth<00:00:56.730> around<00:00:56.880> that<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.360> been

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
rest of the teeth around that have been

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.500 
rest of the teeth around that have been
restored<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.489> porcelain<00:00:59.760> veneers<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.300> think

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
restored with porcelain veneers I think

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.729 
restored with porcelain veneers I think
in<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> next<00:01:00.750> picture<00:01:01.110> you'll<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
in the next picture you'll see the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.860 
in the next picture you'll see the
bridge<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.250> see<00:01:02.460> even<00:01:03.210> though<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> does<00:01:03.629> have

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
bridge you see even though it does have

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.719 
bridge you see even though it does have
metal<00:01:04.229> underneath<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.800> not<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.190> silver

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
metal underneath it's not that silver

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.219 
metal underneath it's not that silver
medal<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.360> were<00:01:06.479> used<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:06.780> seeing<00:01:06.840> in

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
medal that we were used to seeing in

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.570 
medal that we were used to seeing in
that<00:01:07.320> dark<00:01:07.649> line<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.220> might<00:01:08.399> see

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that dark line that you might see

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.810 
that dark line that you might see
someone<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.539> is<00:01:09.690> a<00:01:09.720> beautiful<00:01:10.020> gold<00:01:10.820> is

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
someone this is a beautiful gold is

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.030 
someone this is a beautiful gold is
called<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.210> cap<00:01:12.450> tech<00:01:12.750> bridge<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.799> very

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
called a cap tech bridge and it's very

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.830 
called a cap tech bridge and it's very
thin<00:01:14.400> gold<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:14.940> it's<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.210> strong<00:01:15.450> because

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
thin gold but it's very strong because

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.330 
thin gold but it's very strong because
it<00:01:15.990> has<00:01:16.110> an<00:01:16.229> inner<00:01:16.409> core<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.190> is

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it has an inner core in it that is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580 
it has an inner core in it that is
palladium<00:01:17.880> which<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.240> rigid<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> doesn't

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
palladium which is rigid but it doesn't

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.930 
palladium which is rigid but it doesn't
have<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:19.950> thick<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> old<00:01:20.549> medals

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
have to be as thick as the old medals

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.000 
have to be as thick as the old medals
and<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.170> plenty<00:01:22.440> of<00:01:22.560> room<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.770> put

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
and so we have plenty of room to put

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.380 
and so we have plenty of room to put
this<00:01:23.130> beautiful<00:01:23.640> aesthetic<00:01:24.030> porcelain

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
this beautiful aesthetic porcelain

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.880 
this beautiful aesthetic porcelain
around<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:24.930> back<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> before<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
around it go back to the before and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.219 
around it go back to the before and
after<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.760> what<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.360> saw<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.720> middle<00:01:28.049> where

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
after so what we saw in the middle where

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.280 
after so what we saw in the middle where
is<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> front<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.700> her<00:01:30.290> two

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
is that in the front that is her two

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.679 
is that in the front that is her two
front<00:01:31.500> teeth<00:01:31.770> plus<00:01:32.760> the<00:01:32.970> tooth<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> side

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
front teeth plus the tooth on the side

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.410 
front teeth plus the tooth on the side
and<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.979> can't<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.760> tell<00:01:36.060> which<00:01:36.210> ones

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and you can't really tell which ones

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.330 
and you can't really tell which ones
they<00:01:36.540> are<00:01:36.570> because<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:37.680> look<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
they are because they they look like the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.679 
they are because they they look like the
rest<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> teeth<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.180> porcelain<00:01:39.450> on

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
rest of the teeth that have porcelain on

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.270 
rest of the teeth that have porcelain on
them<00:01:39.810> too<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.350> don't<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.619> her<00:01:40.710> gums<00:01:41.040> in

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
them too and you don't see her gums in

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.090 
them too and you don't see her gums in

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the after yeah well we actually did a
