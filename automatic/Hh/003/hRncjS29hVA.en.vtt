00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:49.030
 That's like Mr. Cloth, but Mr. Cloth is a very famous guitarist 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:54.850

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:54.980
 But if you say that the voice of Nogomi is a cloth bag's guitar 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.980
 It seems to be generally accepted favorably by as many fans that it can be understood
