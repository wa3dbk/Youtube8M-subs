welcome<00:00:00.840> back<00:00:00.960> to<00:00:01.079> Dylan<00:00:01.350> pickups<00:00:01.650> blog<00:00:02.060> today

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
welcome back to Dylan pickups blog today

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.970 
welcome back to Dylan pickups blog today
we're<00:00:03.179> going<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.360> talk<00:00:03.570> about<00:00:03.750> coil<00:00:04.410> splitting

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
we're going to talk about coil splitting

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.059 
we're going to talk about coil splitting
and<00:00:05.160> coil<00:00:06.150> tapping<00:00:06.690> what's<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.620> difference

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
and coil tapping what's the difference

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.940 
and coil tapping what's the difference
and<00:00:08.280> how<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.880> can<00:00:09.150> use<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.380> stay<00:00:10.380> tuned

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.320 

so<00:00:13.880> today<00:00:15.309> we're<00:00:16.309> going<00:00:16.400> to<00:00:16.520> talk<00:00:16.700> about<00:00:16.880> coil

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
so today we're going to talk about coil

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.840 
so today we're going to talk about coil
splitting<00:00:17.810> coil<00:00:18.560> tapping<00:00:19.040> what's<00:00:19.700> the

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
splitting coil tapping what's the

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.050 
splitting coil tapping what's the
difference<00:00:20.270> and<00:00:20.480> how<00:00:21.470> you<00:00:21.529> can<00:00:21.740> use<00:00:21.890> them

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
difference and how you can use them

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.250 
difference and how you can use them
usually<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.630> term<00:00:23.840> coil<00:00:24.320> tapping<00:00:24.860> is<00:00:25.010> used

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
usually the term coil tapping is used

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.560 
usually the term coil tapping is used
interchangeably<00:00:27.340> but<00:00:28.340> let's<00:00:28.910> discuss

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
interchangeably but let's discuss

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.750 
interchangeably but let's discuss
briefly<00:00:30.170> what<00:00:30.650> each<00:00:30.830> of<00:00:31.010> them<00:00:31.130> does<00:00:31.310> let's

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
briefly what each of them does let's

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.360 
briefly what each of them does let's
first<00:00:32.029> talk<00:00:32.270> about<00:00:32.330> coil<00:00:32.989> splitting<00:00:33.890> because

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
first talk about coil splitting because

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.229 
first talk about coil splitting because
that<00:00:35.090> actually<00:00:35.809> is<00:00:35.989> what<00:00:36.620> you're<00:00:36.949> most<00:00:37.850> of<00:00:38.150> the

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
that actually is what you're most of the

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.299 
that actually is what you're most of the
time<00:00:38.449> referring<00:00:38.989> to<00:00:39.170> when<00:00:39.800> you<00:00:39.920> hear<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.190> term

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
time referring to when you hear the term

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.420 
time referring to when you hear the term
coil<00:00:40.699> tap<00:00:40.970> so<00:00:41.930> let's<00:00:42.590> talk<00:00:42.769> about<00:00:42.949> this<00:00:43.190> real

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
coil tap so let's talk about this real

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.280 
coil tap so let's talk about this real
briefly<00:00:43.699> I'm<00:00:43.940> going<00:00:44.090> to<00:00:44.150> use<00:00:44.269> a<00:00:44.300> guitar<00:00:45.050> with<00:00:45.229> a

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
briefly I'm going to use a guitar with a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.390 
briefly I'm going to use a guitar with a
humbucker<00:00:45.589> in<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:45.949> and<00:00:46.070> some<00:00:46.550> single<00:00:46.850> coils

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
humbucker in it and some single coils

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.360 
humbucker in it and some single coils
obviously<00:00:49.659> this<00:00:50.659> single<00:00:51.080> coil<00:00:51.290> here<00:00:51.650> with<00:00:52.129> one

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
obviously this single coil here with one

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.320 
obviously this single coil here with one
single<00:00:52.640> coil<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:54.080> single<00:00:54.379> coil<00:00:54.530> pickup<00:00:54.860> right

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
single coil the single coil pickup right

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.219 
single coil the single coil pickup right
this<00:00:56.330> is<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:56.930> humbucker<00:00:57.320> with<00:00:58.309> two<00:00:58.629> now<00:00:59.629> when<00:01:00.080> we

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
this is a humbucker with two now when we

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.619 
this is a humbucker with two now when we
usually<00:01:00.589> hear<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.860> term<00:01:01.040> coil<00:01:01.339> tapping<00:01:01.940> most

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
usually hear the term coil tapping most

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.149 
usually hear the term coil tapping most
of<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.870> time<00:01:03.049> what<00:01:03.229> people<00:01:03.260> are<00:01:03.559> referring<00:01:03.949> to

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
of the time what people are referring to

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.510 
of the time what people are referring to
is<00:01:04.369> actually<00:01:04.750> coil<00:01:05.750> splitting<00:01:06.740> because<00:01:07.130> what

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
is actually coil splitting because what

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.510 
is actually coil splitting because what
we're<00:01:07.700> doing<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:08.510> we're<00:01:09.380> taking<00:01:09.520> this

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
we're doing is we're taking this

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.510 
we're doing is we're taking this
humbucker<00:01:11.030> which<00:01:11.750> is<00:01:11.930> two<00:01:12.650> single<00:01:13.070> coils<00:01:13.369> put

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
humbucker which is two single coils put

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.050 
humbucker which is two single coils put
together<00:01:13.640> right<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.070> we<00:01:16.070> are<00:01:16.340> shutting<00:01:16.760> one

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
together right and we are shutting one

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.090 
together right and we are shutting one
of<00:01:17.180> them<00:01:17.299> off<00:01:17.509> splitting<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:18.590> humbucker<00:01:18.890> in

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
of them off splitting the humbucker in

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.190 
of them off splitting the humbucker in
half<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.609> only<00:01:19.820> using<00:01:20.299> half<00:01:20.509> of<00:01:20.750> the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
half and only using half of the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.450 
half and only using half of the
humbucker<00:01:21.619> but<00:01:21.829> we're<00:01:21.950> still<00:01:22.189> using<00:01:22.310> the

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
humbucker but we're still using the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.420 
humbucker but we're still using the
whole<00:01:22.640> coil<00:01:22.939> just<00:01:23.600> half<00:01:23.840> of<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.109> humbucker<00:01:24.439> if

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
whole coil just half of the humbucker if

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.690 
whole coil just half of the humbucker if
that<00:01:25.640> makes<00:01:25.880> sense<00:01:27.070> so<00:01:28.479> when<00:01:29.479> we<00:01:29.600> coil<00:01:29.929> split

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
that makes sense so when we coil split

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.249 
that makes sense so when we coil split
we're<00:01:31.700> basically<00:01:32.119> taking<00:01:32.479> this<00:01:32.810> humbucker

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
we're basically taking this humbucker

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.109 
we're basically taking this humbucker
and<00:01:33.530> we're<00:01:33.619> making<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.039> into<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.429> single<00:01:34.789> coil

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
and we're making it into a single coil

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.560 
and we're making it into a single coil
like<00:01:35.570> this<00:01:35.810> one<00:01:36.020> on<00:01:36.640> this<00:01:37.640> particular<00:01:37.850> guitar

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
like this one on this particular guitar

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.480 
like this one on this particular guitar
and<00:01:38.840> we're<00:01:39.289> usually<00:01:39.409> doing<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:39.920> with<00:01:40.100> some

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
and we're usually doing that with some

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.969 
and we're usually doing that with some
sort<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.820> push<00:01:41.090> button<00:01:41.539> or<00:01:41.749> push-pull<00:01:42.679> or

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
sort of push button or push-pull or

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.999 
sort of push button or push-pull or
maybe<00:01:43.490> some<00:01:43.759> sort<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.149> switch<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:45.890> know

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
maybe some sort of switch you know

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.950 
maybe some sort of switch you know
setting<00:01:46.490> in<00:01:46.640> our<00:01:46.969> switch<00:01:47.270> out<00:01:47.420> our<00:01:47.539> switching

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
setting in our switch out our switching

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.859 
setting in our switch out our switching
in<00:01:48.079> this<00:01:48.439> particular<00:01:48.979> guitar<00:01:49.299> in<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.689> bridge

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
in this particular guitar in the bridge

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.569 
in this particular guitar in the bridge
position<00:01:50.899> you<00:01:51.530> just<00:01:51.560> push<00:01:51.890> this<00:01:52.039> button<00:01:52.100> it

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
position you just push this button it

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.580 
position you just push this button it
becomes<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.999> single<00:01:53.179> coil<00:01:53.539> and<00:01:53.719> you<00:01:53.780> push<00:01:54.439> this

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
becomes a single coil and you push this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.080 
becomes a single coil and you push this
button<00:01:54.649> back<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.399> becomes<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.789> humbucker

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
button back and it becomes a humbucker

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.700 
button back and it becomes a humbucker
so<00:01:56.859> that's<00:01:57.859> basically<00:01:58.310> how<00:01:58.399> it<00:01:58.520> works

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
so that's basically how it works

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.529 
so that's basically how it works
not<00:02:00.710> every<00:02:01.280> pickup<00:02:01.759> you<00:02:01.969> know<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.149> can<00:02:02.359> you

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
not every pickup you know you can you

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.309 
not every pickup you know you can you
can<00:02:02.569> do<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:02.990> with<00:02:03.200> most<00:02:04.869> humbuckers<00:02:05.869> as<00:02:06.020> long

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
can do this with most humbuckers as long

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.850 
can do this with most humbuckers as long
as<00:02:06.469> they<00:02:06.619> have<00:02:06.740> four<00:02:07.100> wires<00:02:07.460> on<00:02:07.789> them<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.860> in

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
as they have four wires on them and in

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.850 
as they have four wires on them and in
the<00:02:10.280> blog<00:02:10.640> post<00:02:10.670> itself<00:02:11.450> I'll<00:02:11.840> show<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.470> diagram

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
the blog post itself I'll show a diagram

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.180 
the blog post itself I'll show a diagram
of<00:02:13.460> how<00:02:13.520> that<00:02:14.270> actually<00:02:14.890> how<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:15.950> would

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
of how that actually how you would

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.090 
of how that actually how you would
actually<00:02:16.340> hook<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:16.880> up<00:02:16.940> okay<00:02:17.800> color<00:02:18.800> codes

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
actually hook this up okay color codes

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.160 
actually hook this up okay color codes
for<00:02:19.370> every<00:02:19.550> humbucker<00:02:20.150> brand<00:02:20.480> are<00:02:20.750> different

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
for every humbucker brand are different

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.649 
for every humbucker brand are different
but<00:02:21.739> I'll<00:02:22.010> give<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.459> an<00:02:22.580> example<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.269> one<00:02:23.480> in

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
but I'll give you an example of one in

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.050 
but I'll give you an example of one in
the<00:02:24.349> written<00:02:24.560> part<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.069> blog<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.909> that

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
the written part of this blog so that

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.680 
the written part of this blog so that
you<00:02:26.209> can<00:02:26.360> see

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
you can see

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.170 
you can see
that<00:02:26.810> now<00:02:27.520> let's<00:02:28.520> talk<00:02:28.820> briefly<00:02:29.720> about<00:02:30.290> coil

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
that now let's talk briefly about coil

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.870 
that now let's talk briefly about coil
tapping<00:02:32.180> okay<00:02:32.990> Koel<00:02:33.680> tapping<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.460> little

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
tapping okay Koel tapping is a little

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.480 
tapping okay Koel tapping is a little
bit<00:02:35.000> different<00:02:36.580> if<00:02:37.580> we<00:02:38.480> look<00:02:38.780> at<00:02:39.020> a<00:02:39.490> single

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
bit different if we look at a single

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.090 
bit different if we look at a single
coil<00:02:40.670> pickup<00:02:42.100> obviously<00:02:43.100> we<00:02:43.250> have<00:02:44.710> all<00:02:45.710> these

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
coil pickup obviously we have all these

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.090 
coil pickup obviously we have all these
wines<00:02:46.400> making<00:02:47.030> up<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.660> entire<00:02:48.100> construction

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
wines making up the entire construction

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.280 
wines making up the entire construction
of<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.640> pickup<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.180> we<00:02:50.210> have<00:02:50.840> two<00:02:51.050> wires

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
of the pickup and we have two wires

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.750 
of the pickup and we have two wires
coming<00:02:51.650> out<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.070> back<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.430> hooks<00:02:52.580> up<00:02:52.730> to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
coming out of the back that hooks up to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.510 
coming out of the back that hooks up to
the<00:02:52.910> guitar<00:02:53.210> right<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:55.310> particular

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
the guitar right and this particular

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.570 
the guitar right and this particular
pickup<00:02:56.240> this<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.920> neck<00:02:57.920> pickup<00:02:58.220> for<00:02:58.520> a

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
pickup this is a neck pickup for a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.260 
pickup this is a neck pickup for a
Telecaster<00:02:59.240> and<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.930> has<00:03:00.200> been<00:03:00.500> wound<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:02.240> a

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
Telecaster and it has been wound to a

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.290 
Telecaster and it has been wound to a
particular<00:03:03.200> output<00:03:03.440> okay<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.550> believe<00:03:04.670> this

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
particular output okay I believe this

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.220 
particular output okay I believe this
particular<00:03:05.810> one<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.140> 6.2<00:03:06.710> K<00:03:07.100> okay<00:03:07.640> if<00:03:08.510> for<00:03:09.200> some

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
particular one is 6.2 K okay if for some

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.790 
particular one is 6.2 K okay if for some
reason<00:03:09.770> we<00:03:10.040> wanted<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.460> have<00:03:10.790> less<00:03:11.780> power<00:03:12.230> out

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
reason we wanted to have less power out

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.730 
reason we wanted to have less power out
of<00:03:12.860> this<00:03:13.670> pickup<00:03:14.000> bles<00:03:14.780> output<00:03:15.320> overall

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
of this pickup bles output overall

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.640 
of this pickup bles output overall
output<00:03:15.980> which<00:03:16.970> does<00:03:17.330> change<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.780> tone<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
output which does change the tone of the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.340 
output which does change the tone of the
pickup<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.180> we<00:03:20.180> only<00:03:20.330> wanted<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.810> use<00:03:21.020> let's

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
pickup and we only wanted to use let's

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.760 
pickup and we only wanted to use let's
say<00:03:21.580> two-thirds<00:03:22.580> of<00:03:22.850> its<00:03:23.030> power<00:03:23.500> then<00:03:24.500> what<00:03:24.740> I

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
say two-thirds of its power then what I

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.130 
say two-thirds of its power then what I
could<00:03:24.890> do<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.730> two-thirds<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.930> way

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
could do is two-thirds of the way

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.290 
could do is two-thirds of the way
through<00:03:27.500> winding<00:03:27.830> this<00:03:28.130> pickup<00:03:28.520> I<00:03:28.640> could<00:03:28.850> stop

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
through winding this pickup I could stop

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.080 
through winding this pickup I could stop
and<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:30.170> can<00:03:30.350> add<00:03:30.650> an<00:03:30.890> extra<00:03:31.310> wire<00:03:31.550> that<00:03:31.820> came

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
and I can add an extra wire that came

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.670 
and I can add an extra wire that came
out<00:03:32.270> and<00:03:32.830> then<00:03:33.830> I<00:03:33.950> could<00:03:34.190> continue<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.680> finish

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
out and then I could continue and finish

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.000 
out and then I could continue and finish
the<00:03:37.010> wind<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:38.300> that<00:03:38.330> we<00:03:38.720> could<00:03:38.959> either<00:03:39.200> wire

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
the wind so that we could either wire

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.820 
the wind so that we could either wire
into<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.550> guitar<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.810> full<00:03:42.170> power<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.560> the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
into the guitar the full power of the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.640 
into the guitar the full power of the
pickup<00:03:43.190> or<00:03:43.480> pick<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.630> other<00:03:44.840> wire<00:03:45.170> through<00:03:45.590> a

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
pickup or pick the other wire through a

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.370 
pickup or pick the other wire through a
switch<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.250> use<00:03:47.090> two-thirds<00:03:47.870> of<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.200> power

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
switch and use two-thirds of the power

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.780 
switch and use two-thirds of the power
of<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.770> pickup<00:03:49.130> this<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:50.620> what<00:03:51.620> coil<00:03:52.040> tapping

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
of the pickup this is what coil tapping

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.630 
of the pickup this is what coil tapping
actually<00:03:53.570> means<00:03:53.840> is<00:03:54.110> to<00:03:54.680> tap<00:03:54.920> down<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.459> power

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
actually means is to tap down the power

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.420 
actually means is to tap down the power
of<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.600> overall<00:03:56.900> power<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.530> pickup<00:03:57.860> you

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
of the overall power of the pickup you

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.790 
of the overall power of the pickup you
probably<00:03:59.000> would<00:03:59.330> not<00:03:59.540> do<00:03:59.930> that<00:03:59.959> with<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.470> neck

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
probably would not do that with a neck

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.440 
probably would not do that with a neck
pickup<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.280> a<00:04:01.370> Telecaster<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:01.940> just<00:04:02.180> have<00:04:02.300> one

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
pickup of a Telecaster I just have one

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.050 
pickup of a Telecaster I just have one
handy<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:02.959> show<00:04:03.170> you<00:04:03.230> many<00:04:04.100> times<00:04:04.400> people<00:04:04.700> do

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
handy to show you many times people do

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.710 
handy to show you many times people do
that<00:04:05.300> with<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:06.040> p90<00:04:07.040> or<00:04:07.400> they'll<00:04:08.209> do<00:04:08.360> that<00:04:08.480> with

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
that with a p90 or they'll do that with

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.430 
that with a p90 or they'll do that with
the<00:04:09.080> bridge<00:04:09.500> pickup<00:04:09.530> of<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.820> Telecaster<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:12.260> get

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
the bridge pickup of a Telecaster to get

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.680 
the bridge pickup of a Telecaster to get
high<00:04:12.920> output<00:04:13.370> down<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.820> lower<00:04:14.090> output<00:04:14.330> and

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
high output down to a lower output and

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.229 
high output down to a lower output and
balance<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.140> guitar<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.470> little<00:04:15.620> bit<00:04:15.860> and<00:04:16.239> um

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
balance the guitar a little bit and um

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.789 
balance the guitar a little bit and um
sometimes<00:04:17.780> I'll<00:04:18.109> do<00:04:18.230> it<00:04:18.350> actually<00:04:18.530> with

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
sometimes I'll do it actually with

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.289 
sometimes I'll do it actually with
humbuckers<00:04:19.250> as<00:04:19.400> well<00:04:19.580> which<00:04:19.820> is<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.000> little<00:04:20.239> bit

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
humbuckers as well which is a little bit

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.330 
humbuckers as well which is a little bit
more<00:04:20.450> complicated<00:04:20.780> because<00:04:21.140> you<00:04:21.230> have<00:04:21.340> more

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
more complicated because you have more

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.850 
more complicated because you have more
wires<00:04:22.550> going<00:04:22.940> on<00:04:23.060> but<00:04:23.810> that's<00:04:24.020> basically<00:04:24.410> it

comes out of the side and that has to be
into<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.420> pickup<00:04:41.810> when<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:42.620> build<00:04:42.860> it<00:04:43.010> you

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
into the pickup when you build it you

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.460 
into the pickup when you build it you
can't<00:04:43.460> do<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:44.120> afterwards<00:04:44.750> because<00:04:45.170> there's

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
can't do that afterwards because there's

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.070 
can't do that afterwards because there's
no<00:04:45.680> way<00:04:45.950> to<00:04:45.980> make<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.400> break<00:04:46.700> in<00:04:46.940> this<00:04:47.120> at<00:04:47.480> a

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
no way to make a break in this at a

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.620 
no way to make a break in this at a
particular<00:04:48.710> place<00:04:48.980> and<00:04:49.250> you<00:04:49.580> know<00:04:49.670> and<00:04:50.360> do<00:04:50.480> it

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
particular place and you know and do it

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.500 
particular place and you know and do it
so<00:04:51.670> briefly<00:04:52.900> again<00:04:53.950> coil<00:04:54.950> tapping<00:04:55.510> tapping

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
so briefly again coil tapping tapping

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.890 
so briefly again coil tapping tapping
down<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.960> power<00:04:57.140> of<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.530> overall<00:04:57.770> pickup

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
down the power of the overall pickup

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.780 
down the power of the overall pickup
coil<00:04:59.900> splitting<00:05:00.550> using<00:05:01.990> half<00:05:02.990> of<00:05:03.170> the<00:05:03.410> pickup

coil splitting using half of the pickup

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.700 
coil splitting using half of the pickup
like<00:05:04.790> a<00:05:04.820> single<00:05:05.090> coil<00:05:05.360> versus<00:05:06.140> a<00:05:06.170> whole<00:05:06.350> pickup

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
like a single coil versus a whole pickup

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.000 
like a single coil versus a whole pickup
which<00:05:07.100> is<00:05:07.250> a<00:05:07.280> humbucker<00:05:07.610> in<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.860> written<00:05:09.860> part
