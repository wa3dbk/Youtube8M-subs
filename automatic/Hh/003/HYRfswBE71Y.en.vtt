00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
this end really not something you're

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.430 
this end really not something you're
looking<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> gamer<00:00:53.760> even<00:00:54.480> remotely<00:00:54.750> they

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
looking at as a gamer even remotely they

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.110 
looking at as a gamer even remotely they
actually<00:00:56.039> custom<00:00:56.489> build<00:00:56.670> these<00:00:56.820> they

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
actually custom build these they

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
actually custom build these they
individually<00:00:57.510> build<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.379> ship<00:00:58.559> each<00:00:58.770> order

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
individually build and ship each order

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.029 
individually build and ship each order
so<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.539> mass<00:01:00.870> production<00:01:01.260> run<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
so it is not a mass production run and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.000 
so it is not a mass production run and
the<00:01:02.879> dep<00:01:03.090> box<00:01:03.120> i<00:01:03.570> believe<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.500> equipped<00:01:04.890> with

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the dep box i believe is equipped with

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.130 
the dep box i believe is equipped with
either<00:01:05.129> three<00:01:05.580> or<00:01:05.610> four<00:01:06.030> titan<00:01:06.450> axes<00:01:06.869> it's

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
either three or four titan axes it's

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.920 
either three or four titan axes it's
it's<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.530> lot<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.920> graphics<00:01:08.310> power<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.390> was

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it's a lot of graphics power so that was

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.429 
it's a lot of graphics power so that was
seen<00:01:10.260> at<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.060> corsair<00:01:12.060> headquarters<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:13.020> far

known<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.520> thought<00:01:17.700> we'd<00:01:17.880> show<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.390> video

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
known we just thought we'd show a video

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.039

very<00:01:42.329> detailed<00:01:42.899> physics<00:01:43.439> effects<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
very detailed physics effects so in the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
very detailed physics effects so in the
instance<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> shop<00:01:45.299> floors<00:01:45.600> demo<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.290> was

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
instance of the shop floors demo it was

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.340 
instance of the shop floors demo it was
a<00:01:46.799> water<00:01:47.250> effect<00:01:47.640> they've<00:01:47.880> also<00:01:48.090> shown<00:01:48.350> cereal

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
a water effect they've also shown cereal

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.990 
a water effect they've also shown cereal
bowls<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.890> milk<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.399> things<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.729> in

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
bowls and milk and things like that in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.910 
bowls and milk and things like that in
the<00:01:51.090> past<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:52.049> demonstrating<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.770> this

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the past it's demonstrating this so this

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100 
the past it's demonstrating this so this
was<00:01:53.100> operating<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.729> three<00:01:53.759> GTX<00:01:54.360> Titan<00:01:54.570> axes

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
was operating on three GTX Titan axes

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.440 
was operating on three GTX Titan axes
one<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.829> them<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:55.979> doing<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.430> simulation<00:01:57.180> and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
one of them was doing the simulation and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.480 
one of them was doing the simulation and
the<00:01:58.049> other<00:01:58.200> two<00:01:58.409> were<00:01:58.530> performing<00:01:58.979> additional

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the other two were performing additional

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.300 
the other two were performing additional
support<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.149> tasks<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.990> pretty<00:02:01.680> cool<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.219> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
support of tasks so pretty cool just to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.690 
support of tasks so pretty cool just to
see<00:02:02.460> things<00:02:02.640> working<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.479> an<00:02:04.200> SLI<00:02:04.740> capacity<00:02:05.520> of

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
see things working in an SLI capacity of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.969 
see things working in an SLI capacity of
course<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.299> nothing<00:02:07.170> major<00:02:07.409> here<00:02:07.740> just

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
course but nothing major here just

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.529 
course but nothing major here just
thought<00:02:08.129> I'd<00:02:08.280> show<00:02:08.849> there's<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.270> everyone

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
thought I'd show there's to everyone

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.140 
thought I'd show there's to everyone
because<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.379> brand<00:02:10.890> new<00:02:11.069> card<00:02:11.370> and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
because it is a brand new card and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.119 
because it is a brand new card and
a lot<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.480> them<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.689> neat<00:02:12.900> one<00:02:13.500> thing<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.769> notice

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
a lot of them is neat one thing I notice

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.000 
a lot of them is neat one thing I notice
in<00:02:14.400> looking<00:02:14.430> at<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.970> SLI<00:02:15.420> tight<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:15.989> axes<00:02:16.379> was

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
in looking at the SLI tight and axes was

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.910 
in looking at the SLI tight and axes was
the<00:02:17.310> limited<00:02:17.909> space<00:02:18.269> between<00:02:18.780> each<00:02:19.019> one<00:02:19.290> so

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the limited space between each one so

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.280 
the limited space between each one so
you<00:02:19.980> may<00:02:20.189> remember<00:02:20.549> in<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.299> article<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:21.989> news

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
you may remember in the article the news

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.100 
you may remember in the article the news
article<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.890> mentioned<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.480> backplate

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
article I mentioned that the backplate

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.080 
article I mentioned that the backplate
was<00:02:25.290> ditched<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.069> Titan<00:02:26.370> X<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.909> was

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
was ditched on the Titan X and this was

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.360 
was ditched on the Titan X and this was
done<00:02:27.329> specifically<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.260> airflow<00:02:28.680> purposes

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
done specifically for airflow purposes

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.199 
done specifically for airflow purposes
in<00:02:29.640> sli<00:02:30.569> configurations<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.739> 980<00:02:32.579> had<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.879> back

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
in sli configurations the 980 had a back

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.569 
in sli configurations the 980 had a back
plate<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.629> removable<00:02:34.079> piece<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:35.400> allow

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
plate with a removable piece to allow

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.899 
plate with a removable piece to allow
greater<00:02:35.849> airflow<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.989> sli<00:02:37.829> configs<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:38.700> in

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
greater airflow in sli configs but in

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.190 
greater airflow in sli configs but in
this<00:02:39.090> instance<00:02:39.150> they<00:02:39.629> just<00:02:39.810> dropped<00:02:40.049> to

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
this instance they just dropped to

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.839 
this instance they just dropped to
completely<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.709> can<00:02:40.829> see<00:02:41.040> why<00:02:41.220> here<00:02:41.549> because

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
completely you can see why here because

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.030 
completely you can see why here because
if<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.090> had<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.239> back<00:02:42.480> plate<00:02:42.659> on<00:02:42.870> there<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.260> just

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
if you had a back plate on there it just

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.039 
if you had a back plate on there it just
it<00:02:44.519> would<00:02:44.609> be<00:02:44.730> suffocating<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.480> first<00:02:45.750> or

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
it would be suffocating the first or

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.229 
it would be suffocating the first or
second<00:02:46.590> card<00:02:46.799> if<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.069> had<00:02:47.159> three<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.940> those

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
second card if you had three so those

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.879 
second card if you had three so those
are<00:02:48.359> just<00:02:48.420> some<00:02:48.659> high-performance<00:02:49.349> pcs<00:02:49.709> I

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
are just some high-performance pcs I

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.289 
are just some high-performance pcs I
thought<00:02:50.099> I'd<00:02:50.220> show<00:02:50.430> off<00:02:50.609> pretty<00:02:50.849> cool<00:02:51.060> stuff

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
thought I'd show off pretty cool stuff

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.210 
thought I'd show off pretty cool stuff
we'll<00:02:51.629> have<00:02:51.780> more<00:02:52.019> on<00:02:52.079> tight<00:02:52.530> necks<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:53.040> other

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
we'll have more on tight necks and other

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.920 
we'll have more on tight necks and other
high-end<00:02:53.430> graphics<00:02:53.760> chips<00:02:54.389> in<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.720> near

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
high-end graphics chips in the near

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.830 
high-end graphics chips in the near
future<00:02:54.959> as<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:56.310> probably<00:02:56.849> next<00:02:57.090> week<00:02:57.329> so<00:02:57.629> do

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
future as in probably next week so do

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.780 
future as in probably next week so do
stay<00:02:58.079> tuned<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.889> I<00:02:59.400> will<00:02:59.459> see<00:02:59.760> you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
stay tuned for that and I will see you

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.329 
stay tuned for that and I will see you
all<00:02:59.849> next<00:03:00.000> time
