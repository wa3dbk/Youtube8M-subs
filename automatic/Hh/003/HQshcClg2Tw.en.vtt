to upload a park ever again and wouldn't
even<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:29.100> worth<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.670> it'd<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.060> even<00:01:30.390> if

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
even be worth it because it'd be even if

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.090 
even be worth it because it'd be even if
I<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:30.869> able<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.110> come<00:01:31.409> back<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> would

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
I was able to come back to it it would

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.859 
I was able to come back to it it would
take<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.460> two<00:01:32.700> hours<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> me

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
take like two hours to do that and to me

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.289 
take like two hours to do that and to me
that's<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.200> completely<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:35.159> worth<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:36.000> time

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299

can't<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> link<00:01:49.170> where<00:01:49.380> it'd<00:01:49.470> be

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
can't you know have a link where it'd be

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.620 
can't you know have a link where it'd be
like<00:01:49.710> oh<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.250> search<00:01:50.460> my<00:01:50.670> team<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.180> go

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
like oh you can search my team and go

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.389 
like oh you can search my team and go
find<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.110> which<00:01:52.229> I'm<00:01:52.409> sure<00:01:52.619> even<00:01:52.890> when<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> did

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
find it which I'm sure even when I did

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.249 
find it which I'm sure even when I did
that<00:01:53.579> at<00:01:53.820> least<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> last<00:01:54.630> few<00:01:54.869> months<00:01:55.020> people

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that at least the last few months people

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.959 
that at least the last few months people
haven't<00:01:55.680> even<00:01:55.770> been<00:01:56.009> able<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.310> tell<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.729> part

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
haven't even been able to tell the part

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.740 
haven't even been able to tell the part
because<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> servers<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.750> been<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.229> bad<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
because the servers have been so bad and

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.270 
because the servers have been so bad and
again<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.930> don't<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.290> any<00:02:01.500> control<00:02:01.920> over<00:02:01.950> that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
again I don't have any control over that

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.749 
again I don't have any control over that
whatsoever<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:05.070> know<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.280> really<00:02:05.310> sucks

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
whatsoever and you know it really sucks

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.330 
whatsoever and you know it really sucks
because<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.390> feel<00:02:06.600> guilty<00:02:07.250> showcasing<00:02:08.250> these

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
because I feel guilty showcasing these

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.949 
because I feel guilty showcasing these
parks<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:08.879> at<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.000> same<00:02:09.090> time<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.509> feel<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.810> I

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
parks but at the same time I feel like I

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.900 
parks but at the same time I feel like I
have<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> right<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.430> because<00:02:11.610> I'm

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
have the right to do that because I'm

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.800 
have the right to do that because I'm
the<00:02:12.090> person<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.420> built

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the person that built

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.780 
the person that built
park<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.860> voice<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.280> do<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.610> and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
park and I have the voice to do that and

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.520 
park and I have the voice to do that and
I<00:02:14.819> feel<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:15.300> appropriate<00:02:15.500> but<00:02:16.500> I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
I feel like it's appropriate but I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.830 
I feel like it's appropriate but I
wouldn't<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.790> know<00:02:17.910> miss<00:02:18.300> title<00:02:18.690> of

guess that's you know it is what it is
I've<00:03:39.090> tried<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.660> guess<00:03:40.230> there's<00:03:40.530> no<00:03:40.739> way<00:03:40.859> I

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
I've tried I guess there's no way I

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.599 
I've tried I guess there's no way I
could<00:03:41.130> spoonful<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.420> g-guys<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.319> I

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
could spoonful this the g-guys so I

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.979 
could spoonful this the g-guys so I
don't<00:03:44.609> know<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.910> guess<00:03:45.359> I'm<00:03:45.510> ranting<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:45.930> about

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
don't know I guess I'm ranting on about

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.170 
don't know I guess I'm ranting on about
you<00:03:46.709> know<00:03:46.739> sharing<00:03:47.160> parks<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:47.760> stuff<00:03:47.970> like

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
you know sharing parks and stuff like

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.729 
you know sharing parks and stuff like
that<00:03:48.420> but<00:03:48.780> it's<00:03:48.989> it's<00:03:49.260> it's<00:03:49.530> really

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
that but it's it's it's really

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.129 
that but it's it's it's really
frustrating<00:03:50.130> though<00:03:50.609> honestly<00:03:51.150> about<00:03:51.930> how

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
frustrating though honestly about how

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.470 
frustrating though honestly about how
difficult<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.100> share<00:03:53.459> like<00:03:53.670> even<00:03:54.389> if

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
difficult it is to share like even if

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.059 
difficult it is to share like even if
the<00:03:54.630> server's<00:03:55.049> like<00:03:55.319> we<00:03:55.530> could<00:03:55.709> just<00:03:55.739> do

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
the server's like we could just do

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.440 
the server's like we could just do
online<00:03:56.280> teams<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:56.850> stuff<00:03:56.970> like<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.269> like

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
online teams and stuff like that like

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.030 
online teams and stuff like that like
that'd<00:03:57.600> be<00:03:57.750> awesome<00:03:57.870> too<00:03:58.290> but<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.590> guess<00:03:58.709> as

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
that'd be awesome too but I guess as

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.190 
that'd be awesome too but I guess as
long<00:03:59.370> as<00:03:59.670> there's<00:03:59.850> online<00:04:00.150> games<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:00.959> stuff

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
long as there's online games and stuff

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.690 
long as there's online games and stuff
like<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.769> know<00:04:01.799> it's<00:04:02.100> fine<00:04:02.310> with<00:04:02.489> me

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
like that you know it's fine with me

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.610 
like that you know it's fine with me
because<00:04:03.359> once<00:04:03.569> there's<00:04:03.750> no<00:04:03.959> online<00:04:04.139> I<00:04:04.410> think

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
because once there's no online I think

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.199 
because once there's no online I think
that's<00:04:05.010> when<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.310> community<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:05.790> guess<00:04:05.940> is

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
that's when the community I guess is

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.920 
that's when the community I guess is
gonna<00:04:06.450> be<00:04:06.600> done<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:09.030> kind<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.269> sucks<00:04:09.690> I

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
gonna be done so that kind of sucks I

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.110 
gonna be done so that kind of sucks I
guess<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.260> don't<00:04:10.650> know<00:04:10.769> being<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.760> Debbie<00:04:12.000> Downer

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.660 
guess I don't know being a Debbie Downer
I<00:04:12.450> guess<00:04:12.690> right<00:04:12.959> now<00:04:13.069> but<00:04:14.069> yeah<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.340> guess

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.979 
I guess right now but yeah I guess
that's<00:04:14.910> pretty<00:04:15.150> much<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.750> guess<00:04:15.959> I

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
that's pretty much it I guess I

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.690 
that's pretty much it I guess I
obviously<00:04:16.799> rambled

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700
