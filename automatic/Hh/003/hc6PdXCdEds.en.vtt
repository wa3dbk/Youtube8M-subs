Ironman<00:00:18.750> quadcopter<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.800> then<00:00:20.520> we're

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
Ironman quadcopter and then we're

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.170 
Ironman quadcopter and then we're
currently<00:00:20.939> building<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:22.730> I'm<00:00:23.730> gonna<00:00:23.880> flash

currently building and I'm gonna flash

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.939 
currently building and I'm gonna flash
it<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.480> some<00:00:24.689> inkay<00:00:24.960> firmware<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.740> I'm

and multi rotor flying since it is well

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.540 
and multi rotor flying since it is well
improved<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:38.450> refresh<00:00:39.450> rate<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:41.250> motors

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
improved the refresh rate so the motors

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.510 
improved the refresh rate so the motors
will<00:00:41.730> quickly<00:00:42.420> correct<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.440> sorry<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> usage

and<00:02:28.459> sort<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.550> look<00:02:29.700> like<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.840> then

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
and sort of look like that and then

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.880 
and sort of look like that and then
you're<00:02:31.620> gonna<00:02:31.739> take<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.040> scissor<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.640> cut<00:02:33.890> your

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
you're gonna take a scissor and cut your

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.009 
you're gonna take a scissor and cut your
bag<00:02:35.519> open<00:02:35.970> because<00:02:36.239> you're<00:02:36.390> gonna<00:02:36.480> need<00:02:36.570> your

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
bag open because you're gonna need your

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.910 
bag open because you're gonna need your
it<00:02:37.380> just<00:02:37.650> see<00:02:37.890> out<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:39.290> now<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.350> we<00:02:40.620> have<00:02:40.769> that

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
it just see out so now that we have that

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.870 
it just see out so now that we have that
out<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.430> before<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.030> bags<00:02:42.720> inside<00:02:43.140> okay<00:02:43.920> so

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
out just before the bags inside okay so

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.540 
out just before the bags inside okay so
we<00:02:45.269> could<00:02:45.390> not<00:02:45.569> get<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:45.900> out<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.550> what

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
we could not get this out and what

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.210 
we could not get this out and what
you're<00:02:47.670> gonna<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.450> you're<00:02:49.050> gonna<00:02:49.140> just<00:02:49.769> cut

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
you're gonna do is you're gonna just cut

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.759 
you're gonna do is you're gonna just cut
this<00:02:50.790> heat<00:02:51.180> shrink<00:02:51.540> off<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:54.260> usually<00:02:55.260> just

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
this heat shrink off and I usually just

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.100 
this heat shrink off and I usually just
cut<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.220> on<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.459> top<00:02:56.730> here<00:02:56.760> because<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.870> makes

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
cut it on the top here because it makes

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:12.039 
cut it on the top here because it makes
it<00:02:58.290> easier<00:02:58.620> for<00:02:58.650> mounting<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.640> doors<00:03:03.829> remove

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.030 

and<00:03:13.730> turn<00:03:14.730> these<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.329> upside<00:03:15.660> down<00:03:16.010> now

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
and turn these the upside down now

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.490 
and turn these the upside down now
you're<00:03:17.400> gonna<00:03:17.519> plug<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:18.180> into<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.720> just<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.110> USB

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
you're gonna plug this into a just a USB

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.280 
you're gonna plug this into a just a USB
port<00:03:21.079> and<00:03:23.150> what<00:03:24.150> you're<00:03:24.269> gonna<00:03:24.360> do<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.870> there's

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
port and what you're gonna do is there's

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.449 
port and what you're gonna do is there's
just<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.799> small<00:03:26.150> red<00:03:27.150> dot<00:03:27.480> here<00:03:27.859> on<00:03:28.859> the

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
just a small red dot here on the

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.039 
just a small red dot here on the
multicopper<00:03:30.410> sort<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.590> flash<00:03:31.829> tool<00:03:32.160> and

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
multicopper sort of the flash tool and

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.220 
multicopper sort of the flash tool and
otherwise<00:03:34.049> it's<00:03:34.350> just<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.650> small<00:03:35.420> tap<00:03:36.420> inside

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
otherwise it's just a small tap inside

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.990 
otherwise it's just a small tap inside
the<00:03:37.739> heat<00:03:37.920> shrink<00:03:38.070> where<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.489> can<00:03:38.640> see<00:03:38.790> which

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
the heat shrink where you can see which

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.449 
the heat shrink where you can see which
corner<00:03:39.540> should<00:03:39.900> align<00:03:40.140> with<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:41.250> this

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
corner should align with this of this

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.849 
corner should align with this of this
dot<00:03:41.790> right<00:03:42.450> on<00:03:42.660> here<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.470> add<00:03:43.590> milk

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.410 
dot right on here and the add milk
processor<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.549> don't<00:03:44.820> know<00:03:44.940> if<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.120> can<00:03:45.239> see

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
processor I don't know if you can see

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.840 
processor I don't know if you can see
that<00:03:45.660> with<00:03:45.870> just<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.410> round<00:03:47.130> dot<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.670> the

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
that with just a round dot on the

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.849 
that with just a round dot on the
Admiral<00:03:48.180> process<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.720> these<00:03:48.870> two<00:03:49.109> dots<00:03:49.530> should

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
Admiral process of these two dots should

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.090 
Admiral process of these two dots should
line<00:03:50.100> up<00:03:50.130> so<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:51.269> just<00:03:52.170> line<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.470> up<00:03:52.680> for<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.070> so

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
line up so I just line it up for you so

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.000 
line up so I just line it up for you so
now<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.489> top<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:54.030> in<00:03:54.269> this<00:03:54.480> corner<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
now the top is in this corner so the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.360 
now the top is in this corner so the
same<00:03:56.280> should<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:57.359> red<00:03:58.049> dot<00:03:58.320> be<00:03:58.530> one<00:03:58.769> we<00:03:59.100> flash

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
same should this red dot be one we flash

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.640 
same should this red dot be one we flash
it<00:03:59.609> so<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.239> should<00:04:00.510> press<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.079> down<00:04:01.260> like<00:04:01.620> that

it so you should press it down like that

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.430 
it so you should press it down like that
and<00:04:02.100> hold<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.430> down<00:04:02.459> when<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:02.910> flash<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.440> so

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
and hold it down when you flash it so

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.640 
and hold it down when you flash it so
when<00:04:04.590> you've<00:04:04.709> opened<00:04:04.980> up

flashing<00:06:56.050> of<00:06:56.169> firmware<00:06:56.620> was<00:06:56.710> successful<00:06:57.400> so

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
flashing of firmware was successful so

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.090 
flashing of firmware was successful so
now<00:06:58.210> we've<00:06:58.389> flashed<00:06:58.690> the<00:06:58.990> ESC<00:06:59.620> s<00:06:59.680> and<00:06:59.979> you
