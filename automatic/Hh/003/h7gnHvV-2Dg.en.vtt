00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.490
 is private 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:43.690
 So I wanted something special today 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.820
 Show because this is the am10 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.159
 This is very important for me today 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.699
 especially a very special day because 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:57.949
 this is our first alpha media and 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:01.760
 the design so soon knew is 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:08.479
 mutated direction moderately therefore 50 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.880
 So store and has been left right 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.159
 even distributed you through her 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.659
 court what I had always diversity 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:26.030
 So 50 memories shot with text passages 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:29.030
 English text text about conversations with 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.530
 a texture and the famitsu has become 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.970
 our client is selected and that there is 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.400
 also comes that also the very cool 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:41.480
 Car on the road we have come 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.830
 now field devices one-sided 2030 us 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.770
 have a king declared if the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.570
 second theory I can explain 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.120
 Two-piece dar so that's now one 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.600
 two cases described that means so 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:02:00.830
 star is separate inside and outside is 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:04.840
 also separately together and star 2 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:11.120
 played by therefore also very easily me 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:14.030
 I'm a bit ' cause I find that 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.950
 all past from the admira to 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.330
 chosen heart of our points and indeed 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.330
 wanted the have the means and golf 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.210
 The star on a stone can be seen 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.610
 not even right now 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.900
 how should be but in sight or in 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.820
 otherwise it will look absolutely on 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.860
 The fan is looking cool too 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.010
 the cards will also be awarded 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.720
 Now I'll go back to these very briefly 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.690
 second story and that sink 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.640
 handed to the 2nd 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.520
 You have the bed but I like that 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:59.080
 basin out with compulsion and the place becomes 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:04.390
 here screwed says namely 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:09.700
 sometimes ok i do not just do that 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:14.950
 just see something nice with this 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:19.420
 making series like this is like shinkels 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:24.640
 is twelve times 19 by a cold front in the 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.910
 program that back to the design 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.500
 is made that the star 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.720
 really up to 1000 who goes 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.970
 still in bed but quickly that is 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.550
 whole out and so though for people in 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.130
 2009 10 is a lot like the panoramic view 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.210
 bigger I look there is another 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.070
 and they are quite brutal 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.280
 for the fifa returns to merkel there 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.460
 There are five more or five more designs 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.830
 more work must come from work 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.690
 some number 1 a racist is that 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.220
 next complete is the radical meaning 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.040
 we already have patients on it 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.520
 most likely will come and that was 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.520
 very important 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.280
 ship fund 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:30.050
 that says is tÃ¼v head and me 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:31.970
 said glass is about a 1940's witch 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:42.320
 the whole thing is still important then 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:47.780
 also someday if you want the one 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:51.710
 let them in or personal questions the 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.440
 Most manufacturers as they are called 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.480
 if america put that is synonymous one 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.420
 Special feature wear yes but it works and 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.320
 if you have something waso and what 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.700
 meets as I said it was ratios 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.250
 will be produced next time 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:12.470
 to be simple but that often happens 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.780
 pretty cool car on it and the topic 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.340
 car on it is valuable to do about it 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.140
 because then they were already full 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.260
 out and no one knows the car 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.390
 if she was careful if the 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.550
 I took a good mood , too 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.550
 the video said in saalfeld 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.300
 just better go back all of these 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:39.230
 look and watch and behind the 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.270
 Tires of the customers delivered we are we 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.460
 just took 19 21 because of the customer 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.160
 Just wanted to continue the series 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.990
 So the width of the rim is so 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.500
 the same as the series paragraph but 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.660
 the idea is ten in front and in the back 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.760
 millimeter more aggressive that is called the 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.380
 rim becomes ten millimeters farther out 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.520
 stand although the serial production 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.540
 would continue for as much more 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.960
 rather, there is really nothing to it 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:09.440
 say for now we are waiting for that 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:13.270
 car we do not do that again 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.270
 Forgot to subscribe to the people 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.600
 I should have continued 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.530
 and we are in bed to him yes
