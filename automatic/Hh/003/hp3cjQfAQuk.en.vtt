00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.690
 hello youtube friends the truth is not 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:08.140
 I'm used to being this kind of 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.820
 tutorials and none of this like that 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:16.000
 but there I found an applied 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.570
 what happened to me and helped me a lot 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.619
 unlock my sprint cell phone since 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.990
 is a galaxy not 3 spring and so 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.320
 regular is very difficult to be able to 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.720
 unlock it for third mexico like 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.940
 you can see here I have in the cordoba the 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.940
 bar that says 3rd 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.910
 we can go to settings 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.940
 about the device and here is the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.130
 gsm n900 phone model 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.630
 This application 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.060
 I found her 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.420
 I passed the rather who like me 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.890
 they gave the link to me of the download and I 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.309
 I'm just taking this link 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.490
 borrowed from a friend to make the video 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.590
 and be able to give them to you to unlock 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.690
 his cell phone for telcel iusacell and 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.060
 movistar to that I do not know if it works in 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.300
 other parts of the world study only 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.400
 is doing it here in mexico and then 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.240
 it has worked well 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.360
 I have done great with the application 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.910
 the application is called a locker 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.200
 then this would be pressed nothing 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.979
 more where it says a log 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.920
 and inserting the sim card turns on and 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.590
 it turns off the cell you're a reboot and 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.560
 ready cell would set us free 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.049
 would give the signal the only problem that 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.830
 has the application is that in many 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.940
 cell phones 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:00.190
 does not give them what the data are 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.650
 4g and 3g data 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.260
 unfortunately he did not give them to me yet 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.240
 I'm looking for how to activate them 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.670
 the truth is I 'm not doing 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.810
 tutorials or anything like this 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.730
 but he has measured our 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.370
 application and I hope you serve them 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.370
 check here to check the balance 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.080
 as you can see 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.090
 It has already given us what it has been that it is 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.450
 the balance unfortunately I have nothing 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.450
 right now 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.040
 all right 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.690
 by leaving the link in the description of 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:46.370
 video and I hope you serve them 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.370
 He has done this paste 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.800
 And until next time
