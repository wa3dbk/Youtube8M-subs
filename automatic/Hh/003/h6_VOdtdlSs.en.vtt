00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello elisabeth this time with a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.429
 small bg gameplay and not with 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.860
 Swallow but with the shaman 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.590
 yes people i have to be honest with you now 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.920
 confess that shaman is giving me a lot right now 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.980
 much more fun than the rascal i do 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.529
 have only 5 35 but I have already 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.600
 so rough kriz out it should be so 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.900
 nasty and I think so if so 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:37.880
 the club is going on I'm more 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:37.880
 sorry people that is not there at all 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:49.770
 he makes discussion poked berlin locks 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.300
 of course this starts zack and there 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.360
 Michael Kraus is against today 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.399
 figured player now needs here 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:03.619
 and then people look at each other 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:05.280
 just look at each day 140 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:10.880
 whether that is 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.850
 70 km out it is so crass 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.080
 and these are press buttons four he must 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.830
 150 kg 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:25.650
 I have no court over keys gg 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:27.659
 people should be supposed to play dauss if so 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.290
 There are a couple of buttons on the four buttons 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.060
 problems though and i can do my mom 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.509
 not really perfect play 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.670
 you do not even have to claim here 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:46.670
 do not play at all no player is one 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.670
 week but it has so blatant so shows 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.390
 and that a few def cds one dies 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.020
 Although relatively fast in the opener and so 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.170
 I also know myself if one 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:13.040
 who likes to play against 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:14.260
 I know so many kills myself a few 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.650
 Press keys 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:23.060
 zack and 70 jobst concrete which is thus 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.330
 even purple he does not get baked 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.480
 2 he just does not have enough da vinci 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.800
 Trap that was naturally stupid and dumb 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.050
 Now I get the one from there 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:40.880
 shadow but not now comes her skirt 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:43.450
 rock let me live in peace in peace 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.450
 in peace 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.689
 spontaneously in there or a must in here 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.909
 he does look a bit like one be 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.810
 death im so but otherwise so 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:03.299
 easy to play and the problem is 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.540
 stop the land coming to the enemy 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.690
 not easy 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.209
 orange street view studios 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.540
 but if it's our turn, that's it 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.040
 relatively easy then but some 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.040
 so really corrosive 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.450
 my god i really wanted him 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:33.180
 witches did not work yes stone 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:35.659
 me more young had to be a coach alone 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:46.859
 already because of trainers schami op sooo zack 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:51.859
 so 110 km today that makes you look forward to 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.859
 we do what we care about 45 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:04:01.949
 lines zac monsees there switzerland 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.900
 you had to go to the captain 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:08.010
 but if he runs away and be moderate 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.799
 Homesick for me that is also quite a lot of people like that 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:16.859
 roche macro again and thinks 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:19.440
 i have a rope on the hsg in loren 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:24.440
 the shit matter 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.789
 so that comes anyway is healed and 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.410
 He still can not say that 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.690
 is normal people this is the boss of 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.150
 I want a shaman exhausted 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.639
 I am the first in the hurt that is laughable 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.020
 I have the train a maximum of one week 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.550
 not only do I have them at 90 on weekdays 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.770
 you have a maximum of one week with the 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:50.030
 board of trade coughing high puffed 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.030
 and yes, now I'm playing today 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.729
 whole team does it so funny 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:20.720
 there come the klitschkos the hard ones 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:26.510
 kripo merkel shows it is so funny 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.710
 you can not choose it now because here 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.720
 I just have to touch a few 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.790
 Push that was too hectic all cups 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.020
 in the sword by hammering and time 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.670
 are currently considered approved 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.620
 the feeling somehow does not tell that way 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:46.880
 really such a shaman when you see him 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.050
 probably wants to play in the pvp game 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.220
 you probably also pretty good 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:57.620
 can be logical but in comparison 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:06:00.020
 run for rogue and held 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.140
 ice so they are not so prg 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.100
 Two wheels you should but here it is already 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.660

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:26.360

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.850
 except that sometimes a surgery too 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.380
 I wanted to ask now if you are in 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.720
