kind of coming of age II it sounds like
a<00:02:53.829> young<00:02:54.310> girl<00:02:54.519> who's<00:02:54.700> in<00:02:54.849> Sudan<00:02:55.150> Bob<00:02:55.329> way<00:02:55.510> and

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
a young girl who's in Sudan Bob way and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.440 
a young girl who's in Sudan Bob way and
then<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.440> jump<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.889> her<00:02:57.010> life<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.299> future

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
then you jump to her life in the future

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.849 
then you jump to her life in the future
who's<00:02:58.720> in<00:02:58.840> when<00:02:59.109> she's<00:02:59.290> gone<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.709> United

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
who's in when she's gone to the United

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.789 
who's in when she's gone to the United
States<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.370> think<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:01.480> these<00:03:02.319> all<00:03:02.530> sound<00:03:02.769> really

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
States I think so these all sound really

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.259 
States I think so these all sound really
interesting<00:03:03.310> they've<00:03:03.459> all<00:03:03.579> got<00:03:03.730> fairly

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
interesting they've all got fairly

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.559 
interesting they've all got fairly
similar<00:03:04.750> themes<00:03:05.049> of<00:03:05.409> kind<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.799> people<00:03:06.760> moving

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
similar themes of kind of people moving

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.660 
similar themes of kind of people moving
to<00:03:07.870> or<00:03:08.349> from<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.889> United<00:03:09.010> States<00:03:09.250> and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
to or from the United States and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.740 
to or from the United States and
different<00:03:09.939> cultures<00:03:10.389> and<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.569> kind<00:03:10.720> of

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
different cultures and the kind of

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.720 
different cultures and the kind of
cultures<00:03:11.139> to<00:03:11.260> shock<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:11.950> immigrant

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
cultures to shock and the immigrant

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.890 
cultures to shock and the immigrant
experience<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:13.329> all<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.540> kind<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.780> stuff

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
experience and all that kind of stuff

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.119 
experience and all that kind of stuff
and<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.290> think<00:03:14.349> that's<00:03:14.620> probably<00:03:14.769> because

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
and I think that's probably because

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.670 
and I think that's probably because
although<00:03:15.609> the<00:03:16.299> authors<00:03:16.810> have<00:03:17.109> been<00:03:17.139> born<00:03:17.440> in

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
although the authors have been born in

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.619 
although the authors have been born in
countries<00:03:18.099> all<00:03:18.190> over<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.370> world<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:19.480> all

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
countries all over the world it's all

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.869 
countries all over the world it's all
been<00:03:19.750> written<00:03:19.870> in<00:03:20.199> English<00:03:20.609> most<00:03:21.609> of<00:03:21.760> them

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
been written in English most of them

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.580 
been written in English most of them
have<00:03:22.000> been<00:03:22.060> written<00:03:22.209> English<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.109> haven't

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
have been written English so I haven't

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.900 
have been written English so I haven't
really<00:03:23.799> got<00:03:23.919> very<00:03:23.949> much<00:03:24.129> translated<00:03:24.790> fiction

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
really got very much translated fiction

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.000 
really got very much translated fiction
here<00:03:25.299> so<00:03:25.599> probably<00:03:25.840> translated<00:03:26.470> fiction<00:03:26.620> is

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
here so probably translated fiction is

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.039 
here so probably translated fiction is
at<00:03:27.129> the<00:03:27.250> next<00:03:27.639> area<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.359> want<00:03:28.599> to<00:03:28.629> explore<00:03:29.019> a

at the next area I want to explore a

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.050 
at the next area I want to explore a

little more and I also got a lot

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.640 
little more and I also got a lot

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
for some reason I just veered towards

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.939 
for some reason I just veered towards
that<00:03:46.239> one<00:03:46.419> rather<00:03:47.049> than<00:03:47.199> the<00:03:47.260> cut<00:03:47.409> runner<00:03:47.590> but

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949
