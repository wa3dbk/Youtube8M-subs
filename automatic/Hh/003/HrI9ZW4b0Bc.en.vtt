00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.090
 Children from 2 is located in one 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.540
 exciting phase 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.310
 They almost suck their surroundings like 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.260
 A sponge 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.390
 but it is important to do it correctly 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.570
 demand and there we have the series mine 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.850
 first games she develops overwhelmed 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.980
 but the children are not challenged 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.260
 the children also not and so know the 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.720
 Parents actually with the series 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.000
 what can you expect your children and 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.579
 can actually be targeted for 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.200
 your own child the best for you 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.200
 pull out development 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.200
 The first step is to work with you 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 the child in the world game 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.410
 immerse 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.110
 look to let discover the child 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.270
 that there is power with the material there 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.970
 there are triangles or circles to discover 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.289
 are colors and shapes you can see 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.479
 and compare 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.000
 there you can see the illustrations 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.429
 looking with the child, what 's up? 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.200
 is different what does my child know 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:19.369
 what does not know yet where can not 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.649
 what to tell about it 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.119
 These are the first steps you can take 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.119
 actually makes the game 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.220
 in the second step come first simple 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.659
 regulate to free play 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.100
 The children will be easy 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.020
 Guided not to do anything 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.840
 but to do very specific things 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.970
 easy things the child understands and 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.009
 must implement that they are the first 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.580
 steps it takes to settle 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.580
 to apply 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.539
 often we adults are not clear 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.940
 what children actually all at one 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.470
 learn a rule game because we do it 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.470
 no longer consciously perceive 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.360
 but if you imagine me 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.720
 I have to wait until I get back to the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.459
 am or that I have to endure 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.010
 when a figure threw me out 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.989
 there are things that a child first 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.600
 has to learn and especially this 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.970
 playful environment makes it a lot 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.450
 much easier than often that 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.840
 Everyday stress such things too 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.840
 internalize 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.910
 There are many in the meantime 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.579
 different games from the series my 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.950
 first games and each one is like that 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.380
 a little sweetheart for us we have 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.140
 always taken a particular topic that 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.540
 We especially emphasize in a game 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.470
 sound sound forest is all about noise 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:54.000
 and first listening comprehension at night 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.140
 stall treated ritual of falling asleep 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.150
 Teddy's colors and shapes 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.500
 this is about the distinctions of 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.500
 just colors and shapes 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.760
 With our games can be sure 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.590
 be playful to promote your child 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.629
 Just have fun and time 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.629
 to make sense together
