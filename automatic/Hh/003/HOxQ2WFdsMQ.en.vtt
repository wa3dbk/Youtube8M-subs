00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.370
 social differences of the genius 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.440
 fighting and fighting genius 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.900
 para-commandos lies in training 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.090
 basic to walk the ladies and asca fun 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.349
 we have more that is to say that we have 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.240
 commando techniques and 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.550
 parachute techniques in addition to that and 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.669
 of work is the same as the general 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.669
 a 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.640
 join our unit it is necessary 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.989
 to have followed the training of 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.570
 para-commandos running the ladies and 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.430
 askar fun and in particular succeed the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.140
 pioneering sapper courses where one 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.080
 learns all the basic principles of 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.809
 genius that's so demanding I 'm going to say 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.730
 as training must be well in his 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.850
 head before the group spirit and be 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.830
 physical during the lessons we 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.960
 learn to handle explosives 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.340
 estimated the safety distances the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.340
 quantities etc 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.180
 we are mostly deployed in africa 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.470
 to repatriate civilians 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.070
 this is the main mission of the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.960
 light brigade as jenny 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.180
 para-commandos we always ensure a 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 support we deal with explosives 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.280
 mine clearance and supports amphibian 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.159
 mua for the moment we do especially 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.780
 demining as a preparation for 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.460
 Afghanistan and Lebanon it's about 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.539
 harassing actions of the enemy 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.369
 which we must be able to react to 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.539
 search for explosive devices like 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.549
 in the film minesweepers 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.630
 but a little less American style when 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.539
 same question of man to keep 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.880
 our level knowledge we leave 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.179
 very frequently in exercise both in 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.860
 belgium abroad 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:08.360
 we left on average a 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.870
 week by month to walk launched 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.340
 assaults in mountainous territory and they 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.340
 neutralize and explosive 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:25.659
 the first function attributed to 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.569
 the arrival in the unit is usually 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:31.599
 that of pioneering sappers that's all 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.370
 just the base but after the 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.019
 development opportunities are very 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.640
 extensive 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.700
 it is very varied as a job with us 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.319
 what we have in addition but it is that I 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.859
 let's say we can travel already it's 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.349
 already not bad 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.349
 we do not only belgium 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.080
 I tell anyone who really wants 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.349
 engage in defense and come to us 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.080
 of priority on Thursday is to be well 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.349
 in his head he know where is going the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.430
 training is hard enough hard there will be some 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.500
 good times there will be bad 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.640
 moments but the main thing is the mind 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.640
 group and cohesion
