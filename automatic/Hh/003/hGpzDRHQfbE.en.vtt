four<00:01:07.229> gigabyte<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.979> think<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:09.360> 810<00:01:10.200> hours<00:01:10.439> or

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
four gigabyte I think it's 810 hours or

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.070 
four gigabyte I think it's 810 hours or
more<00:01:10.979> really<00:01:11.820> good<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.299> compressed<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
more really good really compressed it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.469 
more really good really compressed it
may<00:01:13.200> even<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.470> longer<00:01:13.920> than<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.189> how<00:01:15.000> long<00:01:15.270> it

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
may even be longer than that how long it

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.450 
may even be longer than that how long it
holds<00:01:15.750> hundreds<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.320> pages<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.799> writing<00:01:17.100> even

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
holds hundreds of pages of writing even

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.649 
holds hundreds of pages of writing even
so<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> think<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.180> even<00:01:18.330> go<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
so I think you can even go to a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.240 
so I think you can even go to a
conference<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> week<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.710> okay<00:01:20.040> and
