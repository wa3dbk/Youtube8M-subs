00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.279
 I have a friend who is a beekeeper who does not live 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.980
 distant from me is a beautiful morning me 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.060
 he calls and tells me I 'm in the apiary but not 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.239
 there is flight 10 am 25 degrees 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.189
 impossible and I run into the square that 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.950
 I had closer to home actually in a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:39.450
 ceravolo what had happened were gone 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:43.320
 lots of ap we were able to escape to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.670
 same evening bring these bees into one 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.460
 secure location in a reserve 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.800
 natural flowering was in progress 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.269
 apple tree and the contextual flowering of the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.179
 dandelion we had to make 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.219
 this shift to avoid created 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.499
 they continued to import this 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.030
 toxic substance inside them 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.769
 real we have started with 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.390
 this adventure with the organic after the 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.489
 last year's episodes that francesco 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.610
 will be told out of conviction not 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.070
 I am more ideological but we are asked for one 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.920
 different product I started going up 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.590
 internet call the national institute 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.020
 of culture go on the internet to see 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.869
 and I discovered this terrible word 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.259
 neonicotinoid which is a type of 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.299
 pesticide that came and also comes 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.380
 currently used even if fit 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.479
 different on corn and I didn't think that 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.369
 and that the neighbor's grass could ruin 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.860
 my garden happy thing that it is instead 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.360
 happened by going to the apiary for 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.520
 carry out the routine work 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.130
 marking from reggina in that case the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.130
 18 to open I was with a 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.979
 training in progress ap dead on the bottom 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.770
 of the dead bees on the running board bees 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.500
 dying deaths before the coffers are 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.429
 More active ingredients have been found 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.610
 neonicotinoids in particular here is 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.610
 been found limited to cover associated 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.740
 cement xan short aniline try to 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.780
 it two years to understand that in that 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.759
 period sowed corn and when 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.009
 they planted the beehives that corn 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.560
 we had bees near the corn 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.799
 when corn came 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 sown the corn seed was covered 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.190
 of a powder 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.989
 and this powder while the farmer 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.970
 he sowed and scattered over the whole 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.370
 territory surrounding our bees 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.329
 water nectar was collected 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.730
 small flowers at the edges of the fields in the meadows 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.590
 near the corn fields and crushed 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.870
 they are organisms must neither more nor less 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.569
 all other organisms recovered 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.850
 these matrices from the campaign etc and the 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.920
 bring the hive in that case the bees 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.170
 they lost orientation as obviously 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.299
 explained science to me 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.160
 have been in contact with these pesticides e 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.959
 I didn't fit anymore , I evaluated you 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.079
 in the years of poisoning in cases 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.239
 worst in a few days had one 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.519
 disappearance of bees that in number yes 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.989
 could obviously quantify a lot a 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.940
 spans between 18 and 25 thousand t party 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.819
 of this pollen poisoned the bees though 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.380
 they took it home pollen is 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.940
 essential to feed their shuttles 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.060
 the little ones 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.600
 then giving the little ones to eat of 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.250
 poisoned food was born of little creatures 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.830
 deformed width that were thrown away 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.320
 out in front of the hive bees than not 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.080
 they were born and the hive to a balance 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.630
 which is very important to maintain and therefore 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.140
 but when we had that kind of 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.390
 poisoning died nor died so many 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.730
 how they die because of custom 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:43.340
 they worked but they were not born 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.350
 last year or of wild bombs that 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.680
 it was tomorrow that I didn't see bumblebees like that 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.700
 many of them work for free and to me them 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.740
 go kill killed the la 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.810
 crazy efficiency of this one of this 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.530
 animal efficiency of the animal 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.330
 single in itself and of the super organism of 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.590
 super hive organism we have 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.480
 then installed a station here 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.290
 monitoring with a module of three beehives 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.590
 see that they have three blue boxes in front 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.350
 these blue boxes are traps 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.570
 under basket of net and we can read 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.450
 the fall of the dead bees dying with 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.870
 any symptoms from poisoning or in 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.480
 course or I have just occurred in fact the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.790
 sows in that surrounding territory 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.620
 then it was done in 3 4 days then 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.630
 my had that damage that 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.370
 I could say perennial for having flown alone 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.900
 in four days on that territory to the 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.940
 beyond the scope of which we could 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.890
 very well do without 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.810
 with this going from flower to flower 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:46.820
 allies against pollination 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:49.100
 in the orchard or in the small fruits 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.240
 children must enter to play those 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.490
 dogs 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.280
 not really a place that is inhospitable e 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.260
 which also ugly to see 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.660
 I ask the minister for agriculture there 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.730
 European commission to protect api 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.310
 to agriculture prohibiting the use of 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.040
 insecticides harmful to weapons such as 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.770
 beekeeper but as a person I ask the 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.900
 Italian government and Europe to block 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.030
 the use of these pesticides they make 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.780
 die bees and compromise the future 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.780
 of our agriculture
