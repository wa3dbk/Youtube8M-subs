calm<00:00:00.450> I'm<00:00:01.199> going<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.709> talk<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.129> today

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
calm I'm going to talk to you today

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.289 
calm I'm going to talk to you today
about<00:00:02.730> how<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.149> choose<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.929> right<00:00:04.319> pair<00:00:05.040> of

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
about how to choose the right pair of

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.570 
about how to choose the right pair of
ray-ban<00:00:06.299> Wayfarers<00:00:06.960> for<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.500> based<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.160> size

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
ray-ban Wayfarers for you based on size

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.259 
ray-ban Wayfarers for you based on size
so<00:00:09.540> Ray<00:00:10.019> Ban<00:00:10.230> has<00:00:10.559> two<00:00:11.040> different<00:00:11.400> Wayfarers

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
so Ray Ban has two different Wayfarers

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.650 
so Ray Ban has two different Wayfarers
the<00:00:12.540> classic<00:00:13.259> RV<00:00:13.740> 21:40<00:00:14.730> which<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:15.630> I

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
the classic RV 21:40 which is what I

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.720 
the classic RV 21:40 which is what I
have<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:15.900> my<00:00:16.020> face<00:00:16.289> right<00:00:16.500> now<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.520> one

have on my face right now and this one
comes<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.119> two<00:00:18.359> different<00:00:18.390> sizes<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:19.170> comes<00:00:19.380> in

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
comes in two different sizes it comes in

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740 
comes in two different sizes it comes in
a<00:00:19.710> 50<00:00:20.100> millimeter<00:00:20.310> which<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.449> pair<00:00:21.720> right

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
a 50 millimeter which is this pair right

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.470 
a 50 millimeter which is this pair right
here<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.890> 54<00:00:23.400> millimeter<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.269> these

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
here in a 54 millimeter and what these

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.200 
here in a 54 millimeter and what these
numbers<00:00:24.869> mean<00:00:25.289> they<00:00:25.920> more<00:00:26.400> or<00:00:26.490> less<00:00:26.519> coincide

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
numbers mean they more or less coincide

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.450 
numbers mean they more or less coincide
with<00:00:27.240> whether<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.619> small<00:00:28.980> face<00:00:29.220> like

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
with whether you have a small face like

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.810 
with whether you have a small face like
mine<00:00:29.699> or<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.449> larger<00:00:31.080> face<00:00:31.320> or<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.710> wider<00:00:32.489> face

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
mine or a larger face or a wider face

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.690 
mine or a larger face or a wider face
and<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.660> would<00:00:33.840> go<00:00:34.050> with<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> 54<00:00:35.100> millimeter<00:00:35.520> if

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and you would go with a 54 millimeter if

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.389 
and you would go with a 54 millimeter if
you<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> large<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:36.660> wide<00:00:36.899> face<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:37.649> for

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you have a large or wide face or for

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.459 
you have a large or wide face or for
example<00:00:38.489> men<00:00:38.940> typically<00:00:39.480> go<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> 54

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
example men typically go with a 54

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.220 
example men typically go with a 54
millimeter<00:00:40.860> whereas<00:00:41.730> women<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> 50

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
millimeter whereas women it go with a 50

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.740 
millimeter whereas women it go with a 50
millimeter<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:44.550> face

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
millimeter like what I have on my face

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.569 
millimeter like what I have on my face
so<00:00:45.750> I'll<00:00:46.020> come<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.620> little<00:00:47.010> bit<00:00:47.100> closer<00:00:47.309> so

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
so I'll come in a little bit closer so

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.760 
so I'll come in a little bit closer so
you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.820> see<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> black<00:00:49.350> plastic

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
you can see this is a black plastic

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.760 
you can see this is a black plastic
frame<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:51.600> distinction<00:00:51.989> between<00:00:52.230> this

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
frame and the distinction between this

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.959 
frame and the distinction between this
pair<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.370> RB<00:00:53.699> 21<00:00:54.270> 40<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.710> new<00:00:56.280> Wayfarer

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
pair the RB 21 40 and the new Wayfarer

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.369 
pair the RB 21 40 and the new Wayfarer
that<00:00:57.180> I'll<00:00:57.270> show<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.870> second<00:00:58.260> is

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that I'll show you in just a second is

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.220 
that I'll show you in just a second is
that<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.399> profile<00:00:59.910> you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that on the profile you can see that the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.090 
that on the profile you can see that the
lenses<00:01:02.039> actually<00:01:02.690> tilt<00:01:03.690> forward<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.860> they

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
lenses actually tilt forward so they

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.450 
lenses actually tilt forward so they
slant<00:01:05.580> forward<00:01:06.270> from<00:01:06.840> my<00:01:07.020> nose<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.710> they

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
slant forward from my nose and they

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.899 
slant forward from my nose and they
protrude<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.240> little<00:01:09.450> bit<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:11.250> I'll<00:01:11.610> show

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
protrude just a little bit so I'll show

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.359 
protrude just a little bit so I'll show
you<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> other<00:01:12.540> side<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> again<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.189> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you on the other side so again this is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
you on the other side so again this is
the<00:01:17.610> classic<00:01:18.299> original<00:01:18.540> ray-ban<00:01:19.229> Wayfarer

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the classic original ray-ban Wayfarer

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.100 
the classic original ray-ban Wayfarer
the<00:01:19.830> 21<00:01:20.610> 40<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:22.229> next<00:01:22.770> pair<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.630> army

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the 21 40 and the next pair is the army

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.160 
the 21 40 and the next pair is the army
21<00:01:25.770> 32<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.060> their<00:01:27.330> new<00:01:27.659> Wayfarer

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
21 32 which is their new Wayfarer

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.289 
21 32 which is their new Wayfarer
more-or-less<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.460> exactly<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.090> same

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
more-or-less it's exactly the same

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.380 
more-or-less it's exactly the same
design<00:01:30.450> wise<00:01:30.869> from<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.409> front<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:33.030> you'll

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
design wise from the front but you'll

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.830 
design wise from the front but you'll
see<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.900> turn<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.950> profile<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:36.360> this

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
see when I turn on the profile that this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.490 
see when I turn on the profile that this
sunglass<00:01:37.909> sits<00:01:38.909> flush<00:01:39.390> against<00:01:39.780> my<00:01:39.990> face<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
sunglass sits flush against my face it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.770 
sunglass sits flush against my face it
sits<00:01:40.770> straight<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.579> my<00:01:41.790> nose<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.329> doesn't<00:01:42.630> tilt

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
sits straight on my nose it doesn't tilt

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.170 
sits straight on my nose it doesn't tilt
forward<00:01:43.310> but<00:01:44.310> everything<00:01:44.670> else<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.909> more<00:01:45.090> or

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
forward but everything else is more or

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.760 
forward but everything else is more or
less<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> same<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:46.110> arms<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> say

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
less the same the arms of the say

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.399 
less the same the arms of the say
there's<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> Ray<00:01:47.369> Ban<00:01:47.549> logo<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:48.360> from<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.270 
front the lenses here are in the same
shape<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.549> style<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.270> RB<00:01:54.570> 21<00:01:54.960> 40s<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.100> this

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
shape and style as the RB 21 40s so this

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.630 
shape and style as the RB 21 40s so this
is<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.700> RV<00:01:57.000> 21<00:01:57.780> 32<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.799> also<00:01:59.070> comes<00:01:59.490> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
is the RV 21 32 and this also comes in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.209 
is the RV 21 32 and this also comes in
two<00:01:59.759> different<00:01:59.790> sizes<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.960> comes<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.649> 54

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
two different sizes this comes in a 54

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.649 
two different sizes this comes in a 54
millimeter<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.180> 55<00:02:03.600> millimeter

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
millimeter and a 55 millimeter

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.600 
millimeter and a 55 millimeter
and<00:02:04.750> again<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.560> coincides<00:02:06.040> with<00:02:06.250> whether

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
and again that coincides with whether

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.749 
and again that coincides with whether
you<00:02:06.789> have<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.270> smaller<00:02:07.810> more<00:02:08.500> petite<00:02:08.920> face<00:02:09.369> or

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
you have a smaller more petite face or

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.880 
you have a smaller more petite face or
if<00:02:10.060> you're<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.239> woman<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.660> would<00:02:11.050> typically<00:02:11.650> go

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
if you're a woman you would typically go

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.390 
if you're a woman you would typically go
with<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.190> 52<00:02:12.670> millimeter<00:02:13.090> or<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:14.050> 55<00:02:14.830> millimeter

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
with a 52 millimeter or a 55 millimeter

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.490 
with a 52 millimeter or a 55 millimeter
which<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.239> size<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.810> generally<00:02:17.260> meant

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
which is the size that generally meant

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.370 
which is the size that generally meant
go<00:02:17.680> with<00:02:17.890> or<00:02:18.160> those<00:02:18.519> that<00:02:18.790> have<00:02:19.050> larger<00:02:20.050> wider

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
go with or those that have larger wider

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.020 
go with or those that have larger wider
faces<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.670> we<00:02:21.849> have<00:02:22.030> both<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.420> these<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:23.140> RB

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
faces so we have both of these the RB

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.009 
faces so we have both of these the RB
2132<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:26.380> RV<00:02:27.000> 21:40<00:02:28.000> we<00:02:28.569> have<00:02:28.720> both<00:02:28.989> of

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
2132 and the RV 21:40 we have both of

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.680 
2132 and the RV 21:40 we have both of
these<00:02:29.380> in<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.950> lot<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.790> different<00:02:31.090> colors<00:02:31.420> and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
these in a lot of different colors and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.960 
these in a lot of different colors and
different<00:02:32.489> patterns<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.700> different

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
different patterns and different

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.500 
different patterns and different

is just below the YouTube video so if

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.150 
is just below the YouTube video so if

you head there you can see both styles

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.699 
you head there you can see both styles
