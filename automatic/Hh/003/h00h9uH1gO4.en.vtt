00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.620
 How do you feel 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:10.269
 Well that's why I'm exporting for the first time this time and I'm so happy after all 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.160
 It will also be a female representative 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:17.220
 Well yes I want to do my best to have a good race 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.390
 I will do my best so please support me 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.950
 I felt that I felt the day and the terms on the second day 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.390
 Love adjustment has also been transmitted to the other party, yes 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.640
 It is a train 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.360
 I think that led to the result 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.520
 Thank you for your support 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.380
 Did it 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.130
 m Inc. It was good back for the time being engine was relieved 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.770
 How is it 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:50.829
 Well that's the first day of the first day and the engine 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:53.829
 It did not go as it thinks so much, but it is in the street to brain death to Ito Shoji craftsman 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.659
 I'm working hard to fine tune the tower a little more 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.920
 I think that was a little development in thought that I do can top up indicates the high voice 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:05.620
 Looking back at the engine eyes 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:10.650
 I think the engine is much better from the first day 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:13.250
 It is because it was not possible to develop the pace 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.530
 Would you like to give everyone a Thai kick 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.910
 I want to make a hole I want to make a hole I will run my best so I can run my own 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.570
 Thank you so 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.870
 It was cheese 3 day United States 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.010
 As the Danda engine has become weak 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.510
 tomorrow 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.800
 I want to finish easy to get on even near the first day 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.800
 What race will you show 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.350
 I have a little confidence in the master and I start 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.680
 Paste it and make an escape festival early 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.490
 I would like to relate to the year so please support me 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:53.290
 Please look back on the 3 days. 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:58.500
 I think that the engine has improved since I received various advice from Mr. 8 and so on 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.900
 To whom the house I do not want to lose either still synchronizing tax but I do not want to lose the number of colors 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.080
 Especially Hilo is only around 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.290
 Tomorrow I start I'm so good, as firmly expire in the frame 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.530
 Support thank you so I'll try very hard at our best at any time 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:17.260
 Please look back on the first fight for three days, but it turned upwards 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:25.090
 Yes I'm sorry that I could not connect it to that result 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:28.450
 However, after riding in the championship battle, I will try to run for the first place with all my strength. It will be six rounds with all my strength tomorrow 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.340
 I will aim for a deity , so thank you all 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.600
 How is the engine condition looking back for 3 days 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.600
 The engine is good but for a moment 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.650
 The tire runs away from the front 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.930
 Large tomorrow 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.140
 We will change the front desk, but seven people probably think that we do not want to lose Shinichiro 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.370
 think 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.370
 I do not want to lose myself, but please do my best tomorrow
