investigating<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:22.020> all<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.500> decided<00:00:23.160> that

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
investigating of all we decided that

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.200 
investigating of all we decided that
they<00:00:23.910> all<00:00:24.090> had<00:00:24.359> very<00:00:25.140> strong<00:00:26.099> side<00:00:26.789> effects

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
they all had very strong side effects

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.720 
they all had very strong side effects
that<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:28.140> would<00:00:28.380> like<00:00:28.619> not<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.640> have<00:00:29.990> so

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
anyway that's really one of the reasons

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.770 
anyway that's really one of the reasons
the<00:00:34.829> primary<00:00:35.219> reasons<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.850> decided<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780

do<00:03:42.489> something<00:03:42.940> about<00:03:43.060> this<00:03:43.480> because<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:44.670> think

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
do something about this because I think

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.819
