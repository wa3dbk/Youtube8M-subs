00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.550 

okay<00:00:03.879> now<00:00:04.180> it's<00:00:04.359> time<00:00:04.569> to<00:00:04.870> connect<00:00:05.290> the<00:00:05.350> wires

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.560 
okay now it's time to connect the wires

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.200 
okay now it's time to connect the wires
they<00:00:06.040> will<00:00:06.220> start<00:00:06.519> threading<00:00:06.819> the<00:00:07.029> wires

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
they will start threading the wires

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.280 
they will start threading the wires
through<00:00:07.569> so<00:00:07.720> we've<00:00:07.870> got<00:00:08.019> the<00:00:08.109> miracle

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
through so we've got the miracle

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.800 
through so we've got the miracle
arrested<00:00:08.980> on<00:00:09.099> the<00:00:09.190> bonnet<00:00:09.400> and<00:00:09.880> it's<00:00:10.540> probably

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:10.810 
arrested on the bonnet and it's probably

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.830 
arrested on the bonnet and it's probably
best<00:00:10.930> to<00:00:11.080> start<00:00:11.350> with<00:00:11.440> one<00:00:11.769> wire<00:00:12.070> and<00:00:12.840> thread

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
best to start with one wire and thread

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.960 
best to start with one wire and thread
it<00:00:13.960> through<00:00:14.400> thread<00:00:15.400> it<00:00:15.519> through<00:00:15.670> into<00:00:15.880> the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:15.970 
it through thread it through into the

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.000 
it through thread it through into the
holes<00:00:16.119> if<00:00:16.299> we<00:00:16.420> look<00:00:16.570> down<00:00:16.599> into<00:00:17.109> the<00:00:17.289> hole<00:00:17.470> we

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
holes if we look down into the hole we

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.680 
holes if we look down into the hole we
can<00:00:18.160> see<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.519> sunlight<00:00:18.789> down<00:00:19.270> through<00:00:19.570> the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
can see the sunlight down through the

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.890 
can see the sunlight down through the
hinge<00:00:19.900> and<00:00:20.199> we<00:00:20.770> can<00:00:20.949> pass<00:00:21.280> the<00:00:21.670> warrior<00:00:22.090> down

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
hinge and we can pass the warrior down

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.960 
hinge and we can pass the warrior down
in<00:00:23.340> okay<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.539> pass<00:00:26.470> it<00:00:26.680> down<00:00:26.800> slowly<00:00:27.279> we

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
in okay and pass it down slowly we

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.390 
in okay and pass it down slowly we
should<00:00:28.180> see<00:00:28.420> it<00:00:28.510> coming<00:00:28.810> out<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:28.960> bottom<00:00:29.400> okay

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
should see it coming out the bottom okay

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.549 
should see it coming out the bottom okay
so<00:00:31.000> that's<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.390> first<00:00:31.630> wire<00:00:31.930> through<00:00:32.320> and

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
so that's the first wire through and

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.620 
so that's the first wire through and
then<00:00:33.340> what<00:00:33.550> we'll<00:00:33.760> do<00:00:33.940> is<00:00:34.059> we'll<00:00:34.180> take<00:00:34.420> these

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
then what we'll do is we'll take these

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.920 
then what we'll do is we'll take these
other<00:00:34.930> two<00:00:35.230> wires<00:00:35.500> onto<00:00:36.280> that<00:00:36.640> wire<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.329> pull

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
other two wires onto that wire and pull

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.510 
other two wires onto that wire and pull
it<00:00:38.079> through<00:00:38.110> okay<00:00:38.470> so<00:00:38.710> we<00:00:38.890> just<00:00:38.920> tape<00:00:39.309> those

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
it through okay so we just tape those

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.940 
it through okay so we just tape those
together<00:00:39.760> quickly<00:00:40.329> and<00:00:40.780> we<00:00:41.530> pull<00:00:41.800> that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
together quickly and we pull that

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.500 
together quickly and we pull that
through<00:00:42.280> now<00:00:42.460> we<00:00:42.520> can<00:00:42.790> feed<00:00:43.120> all<00:00:43.300> those

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
through now we can feed all those

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.340 
through now we can feed all those
through<00:00:43.989> okay<00:00:44.950> now<00:00:45.130> we<00:00:45.190> can<00:00:45.370> still<00:00:45.610> leave<00:00:45.820> that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
through okay now we can still leave that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.049 
through okay now we can still leave that
we<00:00:47.350> can<00:00:47.500> still<00:00:47.770> leave<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.399> mirror<00:00:48.640> cover<00:00:48.850> on

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
we can still leave the mirror cover on

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.940 
we can still leave the mirror cover on
the<00:00:49.210> bonnet<00:00:49.420> until<00:00:49.809> we've<00:00:49.899> got<00:00:50.079> all<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.469> the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
the bonnet until we've got all the the

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.100 
the bonnet until we've got all the the
wiring<00:00:51.430> checked<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.969> sorted<00:00:52.420> okay<00:00:52.690> so<00:00:52.750> we<00:00:52.960> can

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
wiring checked and sorted okay so we can

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.910 
wiring checked and sorted okay so we can
leave<00:00:53.290> her<00:00:53.469> there

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
leave her there

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.950 
leave her there
we've<00:00:54.250> got<00:00:54.430> enough<00:00:54.670> length<00:00:54.940> there<00:00:55.210> and<00:00:55.780> we've

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
we've got enough length there and we've

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.860 
we've got enough length there and we've
got<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.200> do<00:00:56.350> now<00:00:56.590> is<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.250> bit<00:00:57.760> of<00:00:57.910> wire<00:00:58.840> that

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
got to do now is a bit of wire that

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
got to do now is a bit of wire that
we've<00:00:59.230> got<00:00:59.500> here<00:00:59.940> okay<00:01:00.940> we<00:01:01.510> can<00:01:01.690> then<00:01:02.430> tape

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
we've got here okay we can then tape

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.620 
we've got here okay we can then tape
that<00:01:06.509> single<00:01:07.509> wire<00:01:07.749> through<00:01:08.229> there<00:01:08.490> okay<00:01:09.630> run

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
that single wire through there okay run

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.269 
that single wire through there okay run
on<00:01:10.779> a<00:01:10.810> little<00:01:11.079> bit<00:01:11.200> extra<00:01:11.529> with<00:01:11.649> the<00:01:11.679> tape<00:01:12.009> just

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:12.279 
on a little bit extra with the tape just

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:15.470 
on a little bit extra with the tape just
got<00:01:12.429> more<00:01:12.639> grip<00:01:12.939> onto<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.389> rod

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
got more grip onto the rod

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.670 
got more grip onto the rod
okay<00:01:16.050> right<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.250> I'll<00:01:17.730> make<00:01:17.880> sure<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.240> ends

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
okay right so I'll make sure the ends

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.140 
okay right so I'll make sure the ends
nice<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.950> smooth<00:01:20.190> there's<00:01:20.460> nothing<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.940> catch

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
nice and smooth there's nothing to catch

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.990 
nice and smooth there's nothing to catch
or<00:01:21.630> snack<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> comes<00:01:22.530> through<00:01:22.880> okay<00:01:23.880> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
or snack as it comes through okay and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.300 
or snack as it comes through okay and
then<00:01:24.290> if<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.410> go<00:01:25.590> round<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.980> the<00:01:26.040> other<00:01:26.130> side

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
then if I go round to the other side

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.720 
then if I go round to the other side
here<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.060> watch<00:01:27.240> from<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> end<00:01:28.670> should<00:01:29.670> be

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
here you watch from the end should be

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.450 
here you watch from the end should be
able<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.120> cool<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:31.010> complete<00:01:32.010> it<00:01:32.190> from<00:01:32.370> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
able to cool this complete it from the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.100 
able to cool this complete it from the
one<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.730> whoops<00:01:32.910> got<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> mirror<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.900> door

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
one in whoops got the mirror the door

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.480 
one in whoops got the mirror the door
open<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.370> we<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.700> feed<00:01:36.660> it<00:01:36.690> as<00:01:36.990> well<00:01:37.200> as<00:01:37.490> it's

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
open so we can feed it as well as it's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.170 
open so we can feed it as well as it's
cool<00:01:38.820> okay<00:01:39.770> okay<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:40.830> that's<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> first<00:01:41.580> one

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
cool okay okay so that's the first one

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.320 
cool okay okay so that's the first one
through<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:44.570> okay<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.600> then<00:01:45.900> gently

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
through and then okay and then gently

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.800 
through and then okay and then gently
pull<00:01:49.280> okay<00:01:50.510> there<00:01:51.510> we<00:01:51.630> go

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
pull okay there we go

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.070 
pull okay there we go
I'm<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.560> sure<00:01:52.800> three<00:01:53.340> okay<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.850> now<00:01:54.780> we're<00:01:54.990> at

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
I'm not sure three okay so now we're at

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.750 
I'm not sure three okay so now we're at
a<00:01:55.110> stage<00:01:55.380> where<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.710> stick<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> mirror<00:01:56.490> on

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
a stage where we can stick the mirror on

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.650 
a stage where we can stick the mirror on
to<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.770> mirror<00:01:58.770> cover<00:01:58.980> onto<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.400> mirror<00:01:59.670> so

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
to the mirror cover onto the mirror so

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.020 
to the mirror cover onto the mirror so
the<00:02:00.690> first<00:02:00.990> thing<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.350> need<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.580> get<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the first thing we need to do is get the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.950 
the first thing we need to do is get the
length<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.480> the<00:02:04.370> wires<00:02:05.370> correct<00:02:05.820> okay<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:06.870> we

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
length of the wires correct okay and we

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960 
length of the wires correct okay and we
can<00:02:07.080> do<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> trial<00:02:07.560> fit<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.520> check<00:02:08.760> but

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
can do a trial fit just to check but

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.210 
can do a trial fit just to check but
everything<00:02:09.450> fits<00:02:10.290> and<00:02:10.590> goes<00:02:11.460> on<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.330> okay

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
everything fits and goes on like so okay

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.130 
everything fits and goes on like so okay
when<00:02:14.220> you're<00:02:14.340> happy<00:02:14.520> with<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.790> fit<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.810> next

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
when you're happy with the fit the next

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.290 
when you're happy with the fit the next
thing<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:16.440> need<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.620> do<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.760> use<00:02:18.120> one<00:02:18.270> of

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
thing you need to do is to use one of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.440 
thing you need to do is to use one of
these<00:02:18.510> solving<00:02:19.470> white<00:02:19.650> provided<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.760> in

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
black which is the earth okay so we'll

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.580 
black which is the earth okay so we'll
cut<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.440> then<00:04:30.650> we'll<00:04:30.830> use<00:04:31.250> one<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.150> these

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
cut that and then we'll use one of these

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.320 
cut that and then we'll use one of these

that's<00:04:55.270> going<00:04:55.389> in<00:04:57.210> here<00:04:58.210> we<00:04:58.330> can<00:04:58.509> feed<00:04:58.780> that

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
that's going in here we can feed that

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.779 
that's going in here we can feed that
through<00:05:00.419> okay<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.860> then<00:05:02.979> just<00:05:03.190> push<00:05:03.400> him<00:05:03.610> back

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
through okay and then just push him back

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.330 
through okay and then just push him back
so<00:05:04.090> it's<00:05:04.210> just<00:05:04.300> below<00:05:04.660> flush<00:05:05.050> okay<00:05:06.009> and<00:05:06.220> then

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
so it's just below flush okay and then

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.650 
so it's just below flush okay and then
really<00:05:06.699> the<00:05:06.789> best<00:05:06.940> thing<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.150> do<00:05:07.330> is<00:05:07.449> get<00:05:07.599> a

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
really the best thing to do is get a

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.420 
really the best thing to do is get a
pair<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.020> pliers<00:05:09.009> okay<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:11.400> compress<00:05:12.400> that

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
pair of pliers okay and compress that

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.820 
pair of pliers okay and compress that
down<00:05:16.500> okay

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
down okay

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.540 
down okay
and<00:05:18.460> then<00:05:18.610> push<00:05:18.880> over<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:19.389> clip<00:05:20.220> hold<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.370> in

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
and then push over the clip hold that in

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.830 
and then push over the clip hold that in
play<00:05:21.789> okay<00:05:22.919> like<00:05:23.919> so<00:05:24.190> okay<00:05:24.759> so<00:05:25.000> we'll<00:05:25.660> do<00:05:25.810> that

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
play okay like so okay so we'll do that

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.469 
play okay like so okay so we'll do that
and<00:05:26.320> then<00:05:26.380> we'll<00:05:26.770> cut<00:05:27.009> we'll<00:05:27.220> do<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.669> green

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
and then we'll cut we'll do the green

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.020 
and then we'll cut we'll do the green
wire<00:05:28.750> onto<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.949> green<00:05:30.190> wire<00:05:30.370> for<00:05:30.699> the<00:05:30.789> side

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
wire onto the green wire for the side

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.290 
wire onto the green wire for the side
repeater<00:05:31.449> and<00:05:31.930> then<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.889> white<00:05:33.160> wire<00:05:33.520> needs

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
repeater and then the white wire needs

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.290 
repeater and then the white wire needs
to<00:05:34.570> connect<00:05:35.139> okay<00:05:36.070> on<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.520> door<00:05:36.789> at<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.090> top
