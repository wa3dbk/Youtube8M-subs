heel<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.660> going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.079> go<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.699> then<00:00:56.699> all

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
heel is going to have to go to then all

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
heel is going to have to go to then all
the<00:00:57.300> way<00:00:57.390> down<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:59.780> this<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.020> where<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.649> nut

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the way down here this is where the nut

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.880 
the way down here this is where the nut
is<00:01:01.920> that's<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.520> full<00:01:02.730> 24<00:01:03.329> frets<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.899> 25<00:01:04.470> inches

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
is that's a full 24 frets at 25 inches

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.950 
is that's a full 24 frets at 25 inches
is<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.339> that's<00:01:05.790> what<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.090> means<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.780> that's

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
is that that's what that means so that's

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.800 
is that that's what that means so that's
where<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> nut<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.890> measure<00:01:08.700> 7<00:01:09.270> inches<00:01:09.630> from

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
where the nut is I measure 7 inches from

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
where the nut is I measure 7 inches from
a<00:01:09.990> headstock<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.890> gives<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.189> an<00:01:11.280> inch<00:01:11.520> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
a headstock that gives you an inch of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.300 
a headstock that gives you an inch of
safety<00:01:12.290> now<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> reason<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.979> I'm<00:01:14.189> not

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
safety now the reason that I'm not

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.690 
safety now the reason that I'm not
measuring<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> scarf<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:17.009> when

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
measuring for a scarf is because when

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.399 
measuring for a scarf is because when
you<00:01:17.850> cut<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> scarf<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> one<00:01:18.960> inch<00:01:19.110> board

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
you cut a scarf out of a one inch board

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.240 
you cut a scarf out of a one inch board
it<00:01:19.710> comes<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.310> something<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:21.890> four<00:01:22.890> point

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
it comes to something like four point

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.800 
it comes to something like four point
four<00:01:23.580> four<00:01:23.640> inches<00:01:24.299> or<00:01:24.450> something<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
four four inches or something like that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.890 
four four inches or something like that
and<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.200> remember<00:01:25.590> correctly<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.970> what<00:01:27.750> this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and I remember correctly and what this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.039 
and I remember correctly and what this
does<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:29.299> sorry<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.479> comes<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.750> four

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
does is actually sorry it comes to four

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.020 
does is actually sorry it comes to four
point<00:01:31.350> four<00:01:31.500> four<00:01:31.560> inches<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> 13

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
point four four inches if you do a 13

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.300 
point four four inches if you do a 13
degree<00:01:33.390> angle<00:01:33.869> which<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:34.950> over

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
degree angle which is going to be over

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.249 
degree angle which is going to be over
about<00:01:35.430> four<00:01:35.939> inches<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.930> you're<00:01:37.079> actually

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
about four inches so you're actually

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.530 
about four inches so you're actually
gaining<00:01:37.740> some<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.820> measure<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> full

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
gaining some so if I measure the full

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.270 
gaining some so if I measure the full
length<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> headstock<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.710> don't<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.070> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
length of the headstock I don't have to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.639 
length of the headstock I don't have to
take<00:01:41.460> into<00:01:41.610> account<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> scarf<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:43.020> by

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
take into account the scarf because by

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.620 
take into account the scarf because by
scarfing<00:01:44.250> I'm<00:01:44.340> actually<00:01:44.520> adding<00:01:45.180> distance

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
scarfing I'm actually adding distance

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.490 
scarfing I'm actually adding distance
and<00:01:46.460> then<00:01:47.460> I've<00:01:47.640> also<00:01:47.790> done<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.689> second<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500

and then I've also done the second the
second<00:01:50.130> side<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.579> we<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.850> once<00:01:51.090> again<00:01:51.329> two

second side so we have once again two

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.800 
second side so we have once again two
inches<00:01:52.220> 16th<00:01:53.220> fret<00:01:54.829> not<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.450> seven<00:01:57.450> inches<00:01:57.659> of

inches 16th fret not and seven inches of
headstock<00:01:58.520> I've<00:01:59.520> also<00:01:59.790> got<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> centerline<00:02:00.509> and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
headstock I've also got a centerline and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.429 
headstock I've also got a centerline and
that<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.790> going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.780> where<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> rip<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
that is going to be where I rip the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.520 
that is going to be where I rip the
board<00:02:04.740> except<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:05.729> where<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> heels<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.600> so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
board except for where the heels are so

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.400

the back of that blade and these are set

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.819 
the back of that blade and these are set
right<00:03:51.660> behind<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.530> gullets<00:03:53.600> with<00:03:54.769> about<00:03:55.769> a

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
right behind the gullets with about a

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.690 
right behind the gullets with about a
papers<00:03:56.639> thickness<00:03:58.040> between<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.400> blade<00:03:59.670> and

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
papers thickness between the blade and

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.970 
papers thickness between the blade and
the<00:03:59.940> bands<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.510> then<00:04:01.290> you've<00:04:01.470> done<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.769> same

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
the bands and then you've done the same

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.229 
the bands and then you've done the same
thing<00:04:02.040> on<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:03.209> bottom<00:04:03.359> set<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.810> guys<00:04:05.239> it's

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
thing on the bottom set of guys it's

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:42.619 
thing on the bottom set of guys it's
very<00:04:06.540> important<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.109> set<00:04:07.410> these<00:04:07.560> up<00:04:07.620> correctly

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.969 

I'm<00:04:43.629> stopping<00:04:43.959> at<00:04:44.199> this<00:04:44.349> point<00:04:44.589> for<00:04:44.830> two

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
I'm stopping at this point for two

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.549 
I'm stopping at this point for two
reasons<00:04:45.189> the<00:04:45.729> first<00:04:46.059> reason<00:04:46.419> is<00:04:46.719> you<00:04:47.319> can't

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:47.559 
reasons the first reason is you can't

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:50.519 
reasons the first reason is you can't
see<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:47.949> but<00:04:48.449> the<00:04:49.449> neck<00:04:49.719> blank<00:04:49.959> is<00:04:50.080> too<00:04:50.289> long

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:50.529 
see it but the neck blank is too long

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:52.139 
see it but the neck blank is too long
and<00:04:50.830> it's<00:04:51.009> hitting<00:04:51.399> something<00:04:51.699> on<00:04:51.939> the<00:04:52.029> other

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:52.149 
and it's hitting something on the other

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:53.939 
and it's hitting something on the other
side<00:04:52.389> of<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.569> band<00:04:52.779> saw<00:04:53.019> I<00:04:53.259> don't<00:04:53.499> have<00:04:53.619> a<00:04:53.679> huge

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
side of the band saw I don't have a huge

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.889 
side of the band saw I don't have a huge
shop<00:04:54.309> so<00:04:54.969> it<00:04:55.029> makes<00:04:55.209> things<00:04:55.449> like<00:04:55.689> this

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:55.899 
shop so it makes things like this

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.889 
shop so it makes things like this
problem<00:04:56.709> also<00:04:57.519> if<00:04:57.669> I<00:04:57.789> were<00:04:57.999> to<00:04:58.119> have<00:04:58.269> continued

00:04:58.889 --> 00:04:58.899 
problem also if I were to have continued

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:02.459 
problem also if I were to have continued
and<00:04:59.110> swung<00:04:59.439> this<00:04:59.679> way<00:05:00.959> eventually<00:05:01.959> that<00:05:02.289> other

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
and swung this way eventually that other

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.389 
and swung this way eventually that other
end<00:05:02.739> of<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:02.919> neck<00:05:03.099> would<00:05:03.309> have<00:05:03.429> hit<00:05:03.699> the<00:05:05.399> stock

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:06.399 
end of the neck would have hit the stock

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:09.959 
end of the neck would have hit the stock
of<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.699> bandsaw<00:05:07.589> because<00:05:08.589> this<00:05:08.949> is<00:05:09.039> only<00:05:09.219> a<00:05:09.339> 17

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
of the bandsaw because this is only a 17

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.359 
of the bandsaw because this is only a 17
inch<00:05:09.999> band<00:05:10.899> saw<00:05:11.139> that<00:05:11.349> means<00:05:11.529> there's<00:05:11.679> 17<00:05:12.219> inch

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:12.369 
inch band saw that means there's 17 inch

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:14.839 
inch band saw that means there's 17 inch
clearance<00:05:12.639> between<00:05:12.909> the<00:05:13.059> blade<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:13.389> the

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
clearance between the blade and the

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.609 
clearance between the blade and the
stock<00:05:15.849> on<00:05:16.089> the<00:05:16.239> left<00:05:16.419> side<00:05:16.689> so<00:05:17.289> I'm<00:05:17.379> gonna<00:05:17.529> do

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:17.619 
stock on the left side so I'm gonna do

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:19.859 
stock on the left side so I'm gonna do
is<00:05:17.709> I'm<00:05:17.769> just<00:05:17.889> going<00:05:17.979> to<00:05:18.129> trim<00:05:18.249> saw<00:05:18.659> back<00:05:19.659> the

00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:19.869 
is I'm just going to trim saw back the

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.799 
is I'm just going to trim saw back the
blade<00:05:20.079> out<00:05:20.399> and<00:05:21.399> just<00:05:22.089> come<00:05:22.300> at<00:05:22.419> this<00:05:22.539> from<00:05:22.599> the

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:22.809 
blade out and just come at this from the

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:35.620 
blade out and just come at this from the
other<00:05:22.839> side

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.000 

you<00:05:36.630> can<00:05:36.780> now<00:05:36.900> probably<00:05:37.140> visualize<00:05:37.680> a<00:05:37.710> little

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
you can now probably visualize a little

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.890 
you can now probably visualize a little
better<00:05:38.160> what<00:05:38.340> we've<00:05:38.520> done<00:05:38.730> you<00:05:39.480> can<00:05:39.630> see<00:05:39.810> the

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
better what we've done you can see the

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.870 
better what we've done you can see the
cut<00:05:40.140> goes<00:05:40.710> along<00:05:41.040> like<00:05:41.280> so<00:05:41.520> and<00:05:42.420> we<00:05:43.080> have<00:05:43.880> our

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
cut goes along like so and we have our

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.280 
cut goes along like so and we have our
two<00:05:45.090> neck<00:05:45.270> blanks<00:05:45.660> they're<00:05:46.020> going<00:05:46.140> to<00:05:46.200> be

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
two neck blanks they're going to be

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.530 
two neck blanks they're going to be
scarfed<00:05:46.800> that's<00:05:47.100> why<00:05:47.310> this<00:05:47.370> is<00:05:48.000> allowed<00:05:48.300> to<00:05:48.360> be

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
scarfed that's why this is allowed to be

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.600 
scarfed that's why this is allowed to be
that<00:05:48.690> thin<00:05:48.930> but<00:05:49.500> we<00:05:49.680> have<00:05:49.830> a<00:05:49.860> one<00:05:50.100> piece<00:05:50.310> here

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
that thin but we have a one piece here

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.810 
that thin but we have a one piece here
which<00:05:50.670> is<00:05:50.940> going<00:05:51.030> to<00:05:51.120> be<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.300> nice<00:05:51.630> look<00:05:52.700> one<00:05:53.700> of

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
which is going to be a nice look one of

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.680 
which is going to be a nice look one of
my<00:05:53.970> pet<00:05:54.270> peeves<00:05:54.630> is<00:05:55.320> seeing<00:05:55.860> a<00:05:56.300> stacked<00:05:57.300> heel

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
my pet peeves is seeing a stacked heel
