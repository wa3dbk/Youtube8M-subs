00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
ammo and executioner and then you got

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109 
ammo and executioner and then you got
all<00:01:51.960> these<00:01:52.079> command<00:01:52.409> blocks<00:01:52.619> doing<00:01:53.119> whatever

all these command blocks doing whatever

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.240 
all these command blocks doing whatever
so<00:01:54.810> much<00:01:54.960> stuff<00:01:55.229> um

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.480 

got<00:01:59.120> some<00:02:00.940> complicated<00:02:01.940> stuff<00:02:02.930> over<00:02:03.200> here

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
got some complicated stuff over here

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.810 
got some complicated stuff over here
this<00:02:04.490> just<00:02:05.000> test<00:02:05.240> for<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:07.010> if<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.430> zombie<00:02:07.580> is

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
this just test for the if a zombie is

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.090 
this just test for the if a zombie is
killed<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.210> survivor<00:02:08.570> so<00:02:09.110> they'll<00:02:09.470> become

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
killed a survivor so they'll become

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.030 
killed a survivor so they'll become
survivor<00:02:10.670> then<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.300> they<00:02:11.540> get<00:02:11.690> teleported

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
survivor then so they get teleported

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.680 
survivor then so they get teleported
into<00:02:13.040> here<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.020> then<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.670> then<00:02:17.390> those<00:02:17.630> are

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
into here and then and then those are

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.010 
into here and then and then those are
command<00:02:18.020> blocks<00:02:18.230> reset<00:02:18.770> their<00:02:19.100> team<00:02:19.370> and

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
command blocks reset their team and

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.350 
command blocks reset their team and
reset<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.050> SCORM<00:02:21.470> water<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.130> if<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:22.940> survivor

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
reset the SCORM water and if a survivor

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.340 
reset the SCORM water and if a survivor
dies<00:02:23.650> then<00:02:24.650> obviously<00:02:25.810> this<00:02:26.810> will<00:02:26.990> laughing

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
dies then obviously this will laughing

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.740 
dies then obviously this will laughing
there's<00:02:28.450> they<00:02:29.450> get<00:02:30.290> turned<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.709> zombie<00:02:31.070> and

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
there's they get turned to zombie and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
location but so I'm going to program it

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.699 
location but so I'm going to program it
so<00:02:46.690> there's<00:02:47.690> five<00:02:47.989> different<00:02:48.020> location

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
so there's five different location

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.260 
so there's five different location
didn't<00:02:48.890> spawn<00:02:49.070> in<00:02:49.310> however<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.820> has<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.000> player

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
and one of the look in the other

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.530 
and one of the look in the other
location<00:02:52.010> they<00:02:52.580> want<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.850> spawn<00:02:53.060> in<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:53.450> won't

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
location they want to spawn in it won't

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.750 
location they want to spawn in it won't
spawn<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:53.959> there<00:02:54.140> says<00:02:55.070> prevents<00:02:55.550> people

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
spawn you there says prevents people

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.850 
spawn you there says prevents people
from<00:02:55.880> like<00:02:56.120> spawn<00:02:56.420> killing<00:02:56.690> which<00:02:57.470> is<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.709> very

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
from like spawn killing which is a very

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.180 
from like spawn killing which is a very
useful<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:59.140> I<00:03:00.140> think<00:03:00.620> there's<00:03:00.920> one<00:03:00.950> more

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
useful and I think there's one more

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.430 
useful and I think there's one more
thing<00:03:01.250> show<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.670> for<00:03:02.420> end<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.870> video<00:03:02.989> and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
thing show you for end the video and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.820 
thing show you for end the video and
this<00:03:03.709> is<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:05.150> syringe<00:03:05.570> in<00:03:06.440> there's<00:03:06.620> four

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
this is the syringe in there's four

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.340 
this is the syringe in there's four
possible<00:03:07.250> locations<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:09.230> is

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
possible locations and this is

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.710 
possible locations and this is
represented<00:03:09.799> by<00:03:09.830> four<00:03:10.130> beacons<00:03:11.019> so<00:03:13.720> this

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
represented by four beacons so this

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.270 
represented by four beacons so this
piston<00:03:15.080> under<00:03:15.230> here<00:03:15.380> is<00:03:15.470> currently<00:03:17.799> closed<00:03:18.799> so

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
piston under here is currently closed so

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.820 
piston under here is currently closed so
the<00:03:20.239> beacons<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.660> on<00:03:20.870> however<00:03:21.470> if<00:03:21.680> it's

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
the beacons and on however if it's

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.800 
the beacons and on however if it's
pushed<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.850> four<00:03:23.030> beacons<00:03:23.420> will<00:03:23.630> light

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
pushed and the four beacons will light

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.380 
pushed and the four beacons will light
up<00:03:24.190> hopefully

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.160
