00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.750
 The afsluitdijk 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.420
 provides protection against it 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.240
 washing water for the connection between 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.029
 Noord-Holland and Friesland 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.640
 make land reclamation possible 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:32.140
 creates new home work and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.910
 recreational areas ever form the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.200
 river delta a very mouth of the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.110
 southern sea 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.180
 a so-called estuary a free one 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.180
 transition between fresh and salt water 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.940
 now there is this flood defense of 32 km 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.960
 long with two places and lock where 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.070
 water and boats 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.070
 be able to pass the dike 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.510
 we are here at the map 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.920
 Dutch but on its side 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.390
 because then you see that very well 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 it all the water of the european 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.860
 rivers of the Meuse and the Rhine 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.690
 in our la clÃ© area 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.160
 both technology ends up 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.290
 large part gathers in it 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.270
 IJsselmeer area and you save the water 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.729
 through two large drain locks here in the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.829
 Afsluitdijk what that means is that 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.610
 when I fish that ca n't stand the 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.030
 flow in 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.470
 current is so great that fish is not the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.570
 went for a swim and a pan and tea 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.079
 lands can no longer reach and what 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.030
 happens 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.770
 fish die out and that is 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.780
 happened already in recent years 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.450
 the construction of the Afsluitdijk was for the 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.700
 Wadden Sea and for the Zuiderzee you 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.140
 actually an ecological disaster it it 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.049
 salt and brackish water from the 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.170
 Zuiderzee became the tide with sweet 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.700
 disappeared and also for the tracks per 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.469
 species became their route to a few 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.390
 growling in the southern sea from one to one 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.439
 closed the other day 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.759
 these four species hold their own 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.399
 reproductive area in the brackish 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.439
 waters of the Zuiderzee and with the 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.079
 construction of the Afsluitdijk are theirs 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.640
 populations collapsed 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.310
 also for the south sea fishing 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.049
 you put on anchovy herring smelt 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.869
 was the construction of the Afsluitdijk 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.580
 actually the beginning of the end 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.899
 because now remains a fraction of the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.840
 numbers from the past 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.700
 the will work to that lock 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.600
 being able to pass is on one hand 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.310
 count 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.980
 the eels are used by the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.959
 fishermen put over the dike manually and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.150
 the smelt has become one 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.830
 miniature variant that we did not have 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.959
 remember to find 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.060
 these fish are the food of one 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.280
 large variety of birds 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.180
 larger fish but also for the seal 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.060
 and the porpoise 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.830
 so ensures the low smelting position in it 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.300
 IJsselmeer directly for a layer 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.459
 breeding success 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.019
 of many bird species especially the 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.900
 Plugging is an important one 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.200
 food source for hungry birds that are in 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.819
 arrive from Africa in early spring 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.220
 but also larger predators such as the 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.970
 walleye or cod and eel 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.760
 benefit from the recovery of the track 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.760
 fish populations fortunately the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.569
 an excellent opportunity in the coming years 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.569
 do something about this 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.550
 from 2016, Rijkswaterstaat has a 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.989
 major maintenance scheduled for the 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.610
 Afsluitdijk 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.950
 the dike will be reinforced and 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.950
 weighted 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.720
 regional parties seize this 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.120
 renovation plans with proposals 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.370
 to come back to the ecological balance 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.099
 and at the same time the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.500
 quality of nature and recreation to 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.299
 to strengthen 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.160
 fish migration river is part of it 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.930
 program the new closure we 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.890
 cooperate in this with the province 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.870
 in north holland 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.730
 but also with the municipality of hollands kroon 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.200
 southwest friesland and harlingen 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.030
 together with knowledge institutions and the 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.130
 business but also with the parties 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.620
 as the Wadden Sea Association and blue heart 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.450
 together we give substance to that new one 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.970
 to hedge 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.010
 under the direction of the new Afsluitdijk 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.560
 you now continue to work on these parties 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.819
 make the promising plan concrete 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.819
 the fish migration river 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.540
 fish migration river means fish from 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.030
 from the Wadden Sea to the IJsselmeer 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.220
 and back so fish but no salt 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.900
 in the IJsselmeer 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.229
 the fish are in the wadden sea like 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.090
 servers waiting for the sluice gates 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.840
 they smell the fresh water and want to 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.280
 within 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.280
 but the current is too strong 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.639
 precisely this new system provided they have the 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.440
 possibility to go with the water 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.780
 to enter the fish migration river 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.280
 on 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.340
 they have the time to get involved 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.070
 adjust the water is broke a mix 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.300
 of fresh and salt water 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.460
 the fish can be there for a while 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.440
 stay and then swim to 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.460
 their reproductive areas 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.460
 beyond the IJsselmeer 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.479
 the fish migration river starts to flow 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.840
 if the app becomes like the low tide 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.100
 being on the Wadden Sea 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.770
 when the tide comes he comes again 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.770
 to a standstill and then it flows 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.389
 even the other way and that is whole 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.389
 particularly on the fish migration river 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.600
 this beautiful system what they close 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.520
 possible with nature remains something for 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.320
 fish and the ecosystem 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.720
 function optimally comes 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.340
 extensive information center at which 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.410
 so you can also just see how the fish 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.810
 of what the IJsselmeer is swimming 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.380
 just like the Oosterscheldekering one 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.660
 groundbreaking water innovation was going 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.580
 we in fact do the same here and with 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.199
 the transformation from Afsluitdijk to the 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.759
 new Afsluitdijk and for the 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.919
 hydraulic engineering sector is of course one 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.470
 great innovative opportunity 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.660
 at the same time as the dike reinforcement 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.410
 also the fish migration river 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.550
 instance 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.740
 that's good for a resilient 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.699
 ecosystem because fishermen benefited and 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.650
 the birds of 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.669
 and with that also the IJsselmeer fishing and 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.259
 that means another piece 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.360
 employment and we really think so 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.039
 have a project where the 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.930
 Dutch water sector I can be proud of 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.240
 to be 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.940
 there is no such thing as the 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.680
 fish migration river while there worldwide 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.830
 around 200 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.630
 comparable situations are now in 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.449
 to further develop 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.669
 the fish migration river acquires the 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.289
 hydraulic engineering sector in the netherlands unique 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.509
 knowledge 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.330
 this knowledge can be converted into the 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:23.060
 form of a new export product 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.830
 the fish migration river is therefore a project 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.830
 with an international appearance 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.060
 Oh
