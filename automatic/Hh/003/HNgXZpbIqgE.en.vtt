00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
is great for my own channel because my

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.570

other monitor didn't and I don't have an
HDTV<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.480> wasn't<00:02:37.750> able<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.080> record<00:02:38.290> an<00:02:38.650> HD

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
HDTV so I wasn't able to record an HD

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.100 
HDTV so I wasn't able to record an HD
and<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.190> only<00:02:39.310> reason<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.790> have<00:02:39.970> HD<00:02:40.420> content<00:02:40.720> is

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
and the only reason I have HD content is

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.110 
and the only reason I have HD content is
because<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.590> chu<00:02:41.830> boy<00:02:41.950> migrant<00:02:42.520> who's<00:02:42.700> also<00:02:43.000> in
