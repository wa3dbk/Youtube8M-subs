but sometimes we just choose cars

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.689

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.510 

so<00:01:15.789> the<00:01:16.600> Audi<00:01:16.780> a7<00:01:17.409> let<00:01:17.710> me<00:01:17.829> let<00:01:18.219> me<00:01:18.249> start

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
so the Audi a7 let me let me start

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.139 
so the Audi a7 let me let me start
driving<00:01:18.969> the<00:01:18.999> Audi<00:01:19.210> a7<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:21.340> kind<00:01:21.609> of<00:01:21.729> snuck<00:01:21.969> up

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
driving the Audi a7 it kind of snuck up

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.319 
driving the Audi a7 it kind of snuck up
on<00:01:22.329> us<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:24.100> we've<00:01:24.909> been<00:01:25.060> hearing<00:01:25.210> about

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
on us because we've been hearing about

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:26.639 
on us because we've been hearing about
this<00:01:25.509> car<00:01:25.719> for<00:01:25.899> a<00:01:25.929> long<00:01:26.049> time<00:01:26.319> and

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
this car for a long time and

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.969 
this car for a long time and
mechanically<00:01:27.219> it<00:01:27.520> is<00:01:27.759> an<00:01:28.179> a6<00:01:28.709> so<00:01:29.709> you<00:01:29.799> go

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
mechanically it is an a6 so you go

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.440 
mechanically it is an a6 so you go
what's<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.310> big<00:01:30.459> deal<00:01:30.609> it's<00:01:30.819> an<00:01:30.909> a6<00:01:31.060> with<00:01:31.420> a

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
what's the big deal it's an a6 with a

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.969 
what's the big deal it's an a6 with a
hatchback<00:01:32.219> but<00:01:33.219> it<00:01:33.909> seems<00:01:34.270> just<00:01:34.659> so<00:01:35.619> much

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
hatchback but it seems just so much

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.580 
hatchback but it seems just so much
finer<00:01:36.340> than<00:01:36.579> that<00:01:36.640> somehow<00:01:37.509> I<00:01:37.750> think<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:38.469> is

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
finer than that somehow I think this is

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.980 
finer than that somehow I think this is
one<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:38.770> those<00:01:38.950> cars<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.750> calls<00:01:40.750> into

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
one of those cars that calls into

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.740 
one of those cars that calls into
question<00:01:41.310> more<00:01:42.310> expensive<00:01:42.909> cars<00:01:43.149> because

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
question more expensive cars because

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.870 
question more expensive cars because
this<00:01:43.959> one<00:01:44.140> isn't<00:01:44.319> cheap<00:01:44.649> but<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.609> does<00:01:45.729> make

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
this one isn't cheap but it does make

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.969 
this one isn't cheap but it does make
you<00:01:46.030> think<00:01:46.060> okay<00:01:46.659> if<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.170> were<00:01:47.319> to<00:01:47.439> spend<00:01:47.739> a

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
you think okay if I were to spend a

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.910 
you think okay if I were to spend a
hundred<00:01:48.189> fifty<00:01:48.610> thousand<00:01:49.119> what<00:01:49.450> am<00:01:49.599> I<00:01:49.689> getting

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
hundred fifty thousand what am I getting

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.039 
hundred fifty thousand what am I getting
that's<00:01:50.920> necessarily<00:01:51.610> better<00:01:52.030> than<00:01:52.149> this<00:01:52.450> even

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
that's necessarily better than this even

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.899 
that's necessarily better than this even
if<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.319> were<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.739> billionaire<00:01:54.310> if<00:01:54.549> you<00:01:54.729> had

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
if you were a billionaire if you had

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.249 
if you were a billionaire if you had

how<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.400> use<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.540> was<00:02:29.750> deeply<00:02:30.620> impressed

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
how to use it and I was deeply impressed

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.550 
how to use it and I was deeply impressed
by<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.459> fact<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.940> it's<00:02:32.270> really<00:02:33.020> powerful

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
by the fact that it's really powerful

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.059 
by the fact that it's really powerful
but<00:02:34.310> not<00:02:34.489> excessively<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.890> used<00:02:36.890> the

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
but not excessively so I used the

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.550 
but not excessively so I used the
navigation<00:02:37.670> system<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.420> other<00:02:38.570> day<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:39.500> was

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
navigation system the other day it was

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.130 
navigation system the other day it was
easy<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.100> program<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:41.060> was<00:02:41.270> not<00:02:41.480> obstructive

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
easy to program it was not obstructive

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.190 
easy to program it was not obstructive
as<00:02:42.260> many<00:02:42.530> are<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.670> very<00:02:44.330> quickly<00:02:44.600> gave<00:02:44.959> me

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
as many are and it very quickly gave me

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.140 
as many are and it very quickly gave me
the<00:02:45.590> instructions<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.489> needed<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:47.030> get

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
the instructions that I needed to get

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.280 
the instructions that I needed to get
where<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.450> wanted<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.900> go

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
where I wanted to go

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.850 
where I wanted to go
it's<00:02:48.530> consciously<00:02:49.489> simplified<00:02:50.860> consciously

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
it's consciously simplified consciously

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.640 
it's consciously simplified consciously
beautiful<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.660> just<00:02:53.690> works

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.460 

you<00:02:57.650> see<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.890> car<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.250> an<00:02:58.790> auto<00:02:59.060> show<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.870> that's

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
you see a car in an auto show and that's

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.200 
you see a car in an auto show and that's
one<00:03:00.770> thing<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:01.220> can<00:03:01.370> look<00:03:01.580> good<00:03:01.790> or<00:03:02.030> not<00:03:02.180> good

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
one thing it can look good or not good

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.510 
one thing it can look good or not good
but<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.350> true<00:03:03.560> test<00:03:03.830> of<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:04.040> car<00:03:04.190> is<00:03:04.280> when<00:03:04.430> you

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
but the true test of a car is when you

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.430 
but the true test of a car is when you
see<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.730> on<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.910> street<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:06.170> think<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
see it on the street and I think the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.750 
see it on the street and I think the
true<00:03:06.620> test<00:03:06.860> of<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.040> car<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.310> when<00:03:07.460> you<00:03:07.550> see<00:03:07.730> it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
true test of the car is when you see it

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.360 
true test of the car is when you see it
on<00:03:07.910> city<00:03:08.270> streets<00:03:08.690> in<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.290> traffic<00:03:09.740> mix<00:03:10.010> and

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
on city streets in the traffic mix and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.580 
on city streets in the traffic mix and
that's<00:03:10.910> where<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:11.210> car<00:03:11.480> just<00:03:11.870> looks<00:03:12.290> like<00:03:12.470> a

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
that's where this car just looks like a

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.330 
that's where this car just looks like a
million<00:03:12.860> bucks

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
million bucks

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.800

right now
the<00:03:19.280> car<00:03:19.460> is<00:03:19.550> incredibly<00:03:20.000> rewarding<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:21.170> drive

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850
