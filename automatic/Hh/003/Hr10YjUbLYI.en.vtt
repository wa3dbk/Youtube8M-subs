all right we got four cups of water and
a<00:00:08.730> Kmart<00:00:09.090> grease<00:00:09.420> pot<00:00:09.660> waiting<00:00:11.389> in<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.719> side

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
a Kmart grease pot waiting in the side

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.390 
a Kmart grease pot waiting in the side
area<00:00:14.639> there<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.150> we're<00:00:15.269> going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:16.400> we're

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
area there and we're going to we're

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.870 
area there and we're going to we're
going<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.580> see<00:00:17.760> how<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.060> does<00:00:18.300> with<00:00:19.670> one<00:00:20.670> load

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
going to see how it does with one load

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:30.749 
going to see how it does with one load
of<00:00:21.000> wood

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.610 

with<00:00:31.759> that<00:00:31.910> amount<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:35.020> pine<00:00:36.020> in<00:00:36.260> there<00:00:36.440> it

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
with that amount of pine in there it

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.670 
with that amount of pine in there it
should<00:00:36.649> get<00:00:37.070> me<00:00:37.340> a<00:00:37.610> boil<00:00:40.090> with<00:00:41.090> those<00:00:41.680> four

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
should get me a boil with those four

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:57.640 
should get me a boil with those four
cups<00:00:42.920> of<00:00:43.040> water

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.510 

I<00:00:57.740> won't<00:00:58.430> go<00:00:58.580> through<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:58.940> whole<00:01:00.280> length<00:01:01.280> of

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
I won't go through the whole length of

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.220 
I won't go through the whole length of
time<00:01:01.730> that<00:01:01.760> this<00:01:02.120> is<00:01:02.270> going<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.480> burn<00:01:02.720> to<00:01:03.080> get

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
time that this is going to burn to get

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.400 
time that this is going to burn to get
those<00:01:03.440> four<00:01:03.830> cups<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.280> boil<00:01:04.520> I<00:01:05.140> don't<00:01:06.140> think

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
those four cups to boil I don't think

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.750 
those four cups to boil I don't think
you<00:01:06.500> guys<00:01:07.930> like<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.140> watch<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.620> fire<00:01:09.860> for<00:01:10.610> such

you guys like to watch the fire for such
a<00:01:10.790> long<00:01:11.120> time<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.660> probably<00:01:12.020> go<00:01:12.140> 10<00:01:12.410> minutes

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
and if you can see that there's not that

as it progresses that initial flame is
going<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.700> die<00:01:39.880> down<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:45.600> look<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.689> little

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810

00:01:46.810 --> 00:02:03.899 
going to die down and look a little
better

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.380

with that amount of pine in there it

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.520 
with that amount of pine in there it
should<00:02:55.500> get<00:02:55.920> me<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.459> boil<00:02:58.970> with<00:02:59.970> those<00:03:00.530> four
