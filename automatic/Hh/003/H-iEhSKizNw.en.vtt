works<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.340> across<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> country<00:00:32.910> too<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.600> we

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
works all across the country too so we

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.139 
works all across the country too so we
figured<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.559> we<00:00:34.920> take<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.250> time<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> little

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
figured we we take the time do a little

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.299 
figured we we take the time do a little
video<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:37.020> think<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.040> perfect

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
video on what we think is the perfect

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.069 
video on what we think is the perfect
football<00:00:38.730> jig<00:00:39.120> rod<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> question<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:39.960> get

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
football jig rod the question we get

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
asked all the time and so basically what

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.779 
asked all the time and so basically what
it<00:00:42.809> comes<00:00:42.840> down<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.649> we're<00:00:44.370> throwing<00:00:44.670> a

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
it comes down to is we're throwing a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.150 
it comes down to is we're throwing a
football<00:00:44.940> jig<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.960> most<00:00:46.230> important<00:00:46.829> thing<00:00:47.010> in

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
football jig the most important thing in

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.490 
football jig the most important thing in
my<00:00:47.280> opinion<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.879> sensitivity<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.379> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
my opinion is sensitivity and this is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
my opinion is sensitivity and this is
for<00:00:49.680> two<00:00:49.829> different<00:00:50.010> reasons<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:51.000> first

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
for two different reasons the first

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.540 
for two different reasons the first
reason<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.140> whenever<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.949> are<00:00:53.219> fishing

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
reason is that whenever you are fishing

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.939 
reason is that whenever you are fishing
in<00:00:53.789> 20<00:00:54.210> maybe<00:00:54.420> even<00:00:54.690> 25<00:00:54.989> feet<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.500> water<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
in 20 maybe even 25 feet of water and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
in 20 maybe even 25 feet of water and
you<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> fish<00:00:56.699> pick<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.120> your<00:00:57.300> jig<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.870> need

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
you get a fish pick up your jig you need

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.510 
you get a fish pick up your jig you need
to<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.199> able<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.440> feel<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.100> need<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> feel

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
to be able to feel that you need to feel

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.099 
to be able to feel that you need to feel
whether<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.000> know<00:01:00.090> he<00:01:00.180> chomps<00:01:00.539> down<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
whether you know he chomps down on it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.360 
whether you know he chomps down on it
and<00:01:01.230> there's<00:01:01.410> playing<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:01.949> trailer<00:01:02.280> or

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
and there's playing with your trailer or

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.979 
and there's playing with your trailer or
whatever<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> going<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.570> need<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> rod

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
whatever is going on you need a rod

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.690 
whatever is going on you need a rod
that's<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> transmit<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.070> vibration

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
that's going to transmit that vibration

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.800 
that's going to transmit that vibration
and<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.939> you're<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.330> able<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.540> feel

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and that you're going to be able to feel

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.160 
and that you're going to be able to feel
that<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:08.189> second<00:01:08.640> reason<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that the second reason is because and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.750 
that the second reason is because and
what<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> think<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> most<00:01:11.010> important<00:01:11.610> one

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
what I think is the most important one

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.550 
what I think is the most important one
is<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.180> you're<00:01:12.570> gonna<00:01:12.659> need<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> know<00:01:13.110> what

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
is that you're gonna need to know what

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.320 
is that you're gonna need to know what

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
kind of bottom you're fishing you need

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.609 
kind of bottom you're fishing you need
to<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.479> able<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> tell<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:15.990> jig<00:01:16.380> comes

across<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.100> shell-bed<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.970> rock<00:01:18.240> pile<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
across the shell-bed or a rock pile or a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.539 
across the shell-bed or a rock pile or a

need to feel that's when you're gonna
get<00:01:23.400> your<00:01:23.460> bite<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.880> that's<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.119> you're

back<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:53.010> has<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.549> enough<00:02:53.760> tip<00:02:54.060> they<00:02:54.510> can

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
back this has just enough tip they can

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.420 
back this has just enough tip they can
kind<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.019> absorb<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.190> drag<00:02:56.370> it

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
right over the top of there just kind of

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.809 
right over the top of there just kind of
hop<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.380> up<00:02:58.500> off<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.680> top<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.579> know<00:02:59.700> as

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
hop it up off the top and you know as

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.190 
hop it up off the top and you know as
soon<00:02:59.940> as<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.209> thing<00:03:00.390> gets<00:03:00.630> popped<00:03:00.870> off<00:03:01.049> of

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
soon as that thing gets popped off of

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.960 
soon as that thing gets popped off of
the<00:03:01.290> stump<00:03:01.590> that's<00:03:01.829> when<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.160> backs<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.670> big

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
the stump that's when the backs a big

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.280 
the stump that's when the backs a big
bass<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.420> going<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.599> come<00:03:03.780> out<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:03.989> eat<00:03:04.110> it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
bass it's going to come out and eat it

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.110 
bass it's going to come out and eat it
so<00:03:04.440> that's<00:03:04.620> really<00:03:04.980> important<00:03:05.610> with<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.880> rod

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
so that's really important with this rod

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.620 
so that's really important with this rod
and<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.720> extra<00:03:07.290> length<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.739> extra<00:03:08.670> backbone

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
and that extra length and extra backbone
