so the the actual technique of taking
forages<00:00:11.430> dates<00:00:12.430> back<00:00:12.639> to<00:00:12.880> possibly<00:00:13.540> as<00:00:13.630> early

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:13.720 
forages dates back to possibly as early

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.990 
forages dates back to possibly as early
as<00:00:13.960> the<00:00:14.080> 10th<00:00:14.290> century<00:00:14.470> but<00:00:15.460> when<00:00:15.639> we<00:00:15.760> talk

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
as the 10th century but when we talk

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.330 
as the 10th century but when we talk
about<00:00:16.029> forage<00:00:16.570> paintings<00:00:16.960> what<00:00:17.680> we<00:00:18.160> often

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
about forage paintings what we often

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.240 
about forage paintings what we often
think<00:00:18.640> of<00:00:18.820> is<00:00:19.029> a<00:00:19.360> gilt-edged<00:00:20.259> or<00:00:20.740> a<00:00:20.800> gilded

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
think of is a gilt-edged or a gilded

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.029 
think of is a gilt-edged or a gilded
edge<00:00:21.490> like<00:00:21.820> that<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.320> forest<00:00:23.650> painting

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
edge like that with the forest painting

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.279 
edge like that with the forest painting
hidden<00:00:24.460> underneath<00:00:25.000> it<00:00:25.359> and<00:00:25.570> and<00:00:26.109> that

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
hidden underneath it and and that

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.529 
hidden underneath it and and that
practice<00:00:26.529> dates<00:00:27.039> back<00:00:27.310> to<00:00:27.580> the<00:00:27.699> mid<00:00:27.910> 17th

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
practice dates back to the mid 17th

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.590 
practice dates back to the mid 17th
century<00:00:28.630> how<00:00:29.170> you<00:00:29.230> would<00:00:29.560> do<00:00:29.770> that<00:00:30.010> is<00:00:30.600> you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
century how you would do that is you

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.330 
century how you would do that is you
would<00:00:32.100> have<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.370> forage<00:00:33.790> stand<00:00:34.600> out<00:00:35.340> just

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
would have the forage stand out just

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.790 
would have the forage stand out just
like<00:00:36.460> Colleen<00:00:36.850> is<00:00:36.970> doing<00:00:37.239> here<00:00:37.559> hold<00:00:38.559> it<00:00:38.710> in

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
like Colleen is doing here hold it in

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.189 
like Colleen is doing here hold it in
place<00:00:38.949> and<00:00:39.430> then<00:00:39.670> you<00:00:39.820> can<00:00:40.059> paint<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.900> edge<00:00:41.050> of

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
place and then you can paint the edge of

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:42.840 
place and then you can paint the edge of
the<00:00:41.320> of<00:00:41.589> the<00:00:41.890> book<00:00:42.100> just<00:00:42.280> as<00:00:42.489> you<00:00:42.640> would<00:00:42.820> a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
the of the book just as you would a

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.259 
the of the book just as you would a
canvas<00:00:43.690> it's<00:00:44.559> usually<00:00:44.710> clamped<00:00:45.460> it<00:00:46.120> was

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
canvas it's usually clamped it was

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.829 
canvas it's usually clamped it was
usually<00:00:46.570> be<00:00:46.720> clamped<00:00:47.260> right<00:00:48.129> there<00:00:48.400> um<00:00:48.839> and

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
usually be clamped right there um and

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.090 
usually be clamped right there um and
then<00:00:50.080> once<00:00:50.260> you're<00:00:50.379> done<00:00:50.470> with<00:00:50.559> your<00:00:50.620> painting

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
then once you're done with your painting

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.579 
then once you're done with your painting
you<00:00:51.280> would<00:00:51.430> guild<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.879> edge<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:53.470> normally

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
you would guild the edge as you normally

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.600 
you would guild the edge as you normally
would<00:00:53.860> with<00:00:54.489> awesome<00:00:54.940> gold<00:00:55.150> leaf<00:00:55.530> that's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
would with awesome gold leaf that's

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.009 
would with awesome gold leaf that's
excuse<00:00:57.610> heavy<00:00:58.030> birds<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.540> it<00:00:58.600> disappears

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
excuse heavy birds and it disappears

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.229 
excuse heavy birds and it disappears

the content of the book and sometimes
it's<00:01:27.189> completely<00:01:27.670> unrelated<00:01:28.530> I've<00:01:29.530> heard<00:01:29.799> but

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it's completely unrelated I've heard but

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.940 
it's completely unrelated I've heard but
sometimes<00:01:31.450> they<00:01:31.810> put<00:01:32.109> on<00:01:32.200> a<00:01:32.229> forage<00:01:32.590> painting

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.679 
sometimes they put on a forage painting
on<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.100> really<00:01:33.340> dull<00:01:33.579> book<00:01:33.880> because<00:01:34.359> it<00:01:34.539> was<00:01:34.570> a

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
on a really dull book because it was a

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.859 
on a really dull book because it was a
way<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.869> move<00:01:35.530> extra<00:01:36.159> merchandise<00:01:36.749> people<00:01:37.749> buy

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
way to move extra merchandise people buy

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.080 
way to move extra merchandise people buy
for<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:38.140> painting<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.710> not<00:01:38.950> little<00:01:39.579> content

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
for the painting and not little content

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.999 
for the painting and not little content
I<00:01:40.329> mean<00:01:40.929> I<00:01:40.990> think<00:01:41.049> it's<00:01:41.289> safe<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.619> say<00:01:41.649> these

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
I mean I think it's safe to say these

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.239 
I mean I think it's safe to say these
were<00:01:42.960> probably<00:01:43.960> done<00:01:44.200> in<00:01:44.499> in<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.579> UK<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:48.130> know

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
were probably done in in the UK you know

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:52.859 
were probably done in in the UK you know
they're<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:49.439> mean<00:01:50.439> these<00:01:50.679> are<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:52.149> is<00:01:52.329> a<00:01:52.359> late

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
they're I mean these are this is a late

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.800 
they're I mean these are this is a late
19th<00:01:52.899> century<00:01:53.380> binding<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:57.189> too<00:01:57.549> is<00:01:57.810> maybe

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
19th century binding this too is maybe

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.629 
19th century binding this too is maybe
slightly<00:02:00.749> 19th<00:02:01.749> century<00:02:02.189> possibly<00:02:03.189> even
