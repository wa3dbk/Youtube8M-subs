could<00:05:25.270> do<00:05:25.360> at<00:05:25.480> LeBron<00:05:25.720> so<00:05:26.200> I<00:05:26.440> think<00:05:26.950> it'll<00:05:27.220> be<00:05:27.340> a

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
could do at LeBron so I think it'll be a

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.390 
could do at LeBron so I think it'll be a
good<00:05:27.550> matchup<00:05:27.760> if<00:05:28.030> we<00:05:28.120> play<00:05:28.300> there<00:05:28.480> I<00:05:29.400> feel

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
good matchup if we play there I feel

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.860 
good matchup if we play there I feel
we're<00:05:30.639> the<00:05:30.700> best<00:05:30.850> back<00:05:31.180> row<00:05:31.330> in<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:31.510> country

we're the best back row in the country

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.590 
we're the best back row in the country
because<00:05:32.100> and<00:05:33.100> my<00:05:33.310> eyes<00:05:33.520> can't<00:05:34.030> nobody<00:05:34.330> go<00:05:34.540> on

last<00:05:37.630> year<00:05:37.810> last<00:05:38.290> year<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.530> think<00:05:38.590> we<00:05:38.889> proved

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
last year last year I think we proved

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.310 
last year last year I think we proved
that<00:05:39.310> this<00:05:40.030> year<00:05:40.270> we<00:05:40.479> get<00:05:40.570> we<00:05:40.720> got<00:05:40.870> better<00:05:41.139> and

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
that this year we get we got better and

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.840 
that this year we get we got better and
stronger<00:05:41.560> so<00:05:41.919> we<00:05:42.010> definitely<00:05:42.160> proved<00:05:42.639> it<00:05:42.729> this

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
stronger so we definitely proved it this

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.320 
stronger so we definitely proved it this
year

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
year

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.409
