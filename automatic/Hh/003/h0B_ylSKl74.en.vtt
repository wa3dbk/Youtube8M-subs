00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.490
 ferryman that is way out of the back of both 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.049
 the odds are right after 45 seconds after that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.330
 puts his hands to the face 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.640
 a great opportunity to get here soon 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.910
 Well maybe scoring chance 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.189
 yes displaced ball because so hard 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.550
 It does not have one's role 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.439
 van derek w and yes if you then leg right 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.619
 then it comes out incredibly well 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.619
 from 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 choose which pot here indicate logos with 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 to printers 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.699
 Oisterwijk is wrong 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.010
 leg olive went what does he do yes let him 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.129
 walk and therefore gives a not to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.670
 miss a gigantic gift in the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.260
 13th minute and the promise team of 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.260
 twente takes a 2 0 lead here 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.460
 just short circuit with gijs luirink the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.460
 captain the routine 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.640
 looked back on turkey what a time 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.830
 what a space and the chance of 3 0 the chance 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.380
 on 3 0 of those 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.220
 this is prevented by black hat 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.090
 suze can still finish it no because she 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.090
 evers got in the way 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.479
 the mistake 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.780
 bleacher marengo's mistake 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.860
 veerman now or turn or so is 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.450
 the 2 1 yes and fire man with his seventh 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.090
 competitive score 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.430
 finally someone from the present 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.979
 selection that the club top scorer is in 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.320
 one so far had those animals 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.530
 glorious title share with so Robert 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.530
 walls 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.180
 no matter where from tipper lock up to 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.030
 akoe and brans 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.140
 what will he do brands keeps scoring 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.320
 it's 2 2 right in the long corner 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.570
 so he finds the hole and is it hit 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.370
 well drive now to stand 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.570
 for the king want 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.250
 trailing that very annoying 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.250
 backlog road tested 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.920
 oisterwijk is apart from luirink well anyway 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:44.190
 a toll there 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.190
 no that is prevented by black hat 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.480
 rolls chic 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.090
 is fast on the first meters 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.550
 otherwise a kiss 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.819
 printers on the right that has 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.300
 considering that you see him are over 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.019
 look shoulder and in between and touch 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.540
 432 as the second half 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.010
 two and a half minutes old 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.190
 yes this may be an attack 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.560
 from the well-known booklet mention the 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.870
 opening found on one of the sides 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.540
 the right side in this case 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.400
 and the chuse has the corner and actually 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.290
 for figuring out 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.220
 it's a fire that can handle anything 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.010
 to do 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:38.610
 he doesn't do it now that there seems to be music 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.410
 not entirely satisfied with his performance 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.630
 here comes the young German merrin 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.840
 Shooting 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.840
 with you 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.560
 we home button space here once black 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.250
 does well considering if so how long would that 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.250
 on the field 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.390
 from ringo and toe was here man comes there 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.920
 just not enough 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.780
 so often volendam is not 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:22.270
 dangerous in this second half 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:24.190
 so far well ferryman on the way to 3 3 would 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.620
 you say 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.070
 yes that end and stern the sentence and 4 want 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.990
 makes it particularly offs 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.360
 previously the teammates stevens 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.950
 are four men and really cold-blooded 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.139
 finished 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:44.290
 we have a good minute left 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:46.000
 evers and brands well here it comes 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.310
 no, he isn't one yet 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.770
 great opportunity to get here with the full booty 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.450
 run away 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.060
 divided a game with six goals 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.190
 great as we both teams and volendam 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.680
 therefore fails 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.960
 role in the track so to speak of 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.960
 the leaders roda and nec
