World<00:00:29.730> errs<00:00:30.150> b1<00:00:31.080> which<00:00:31.320> i<00:00:31.439> think<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> lot

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
World errs b1 which i think is a lot

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.770 
World errs b1 which i think is a lot
better<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.430> I'm<00:00:32.579> not<00:00:32.610> saying<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.180> they're

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
better and I'm not saying that they're

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.889 
better and I'm not saying that they're
both<00:00:33.930> good<00:00:34.230> maps<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.450> can<00:00:36.450> definitely<00:00:36.540> say

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
both good maps but I can definitely say

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.020 
both good maps but I can definitely say
that<00:00:37.070> version<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> lot<00:00:38.730> better<00:00:38.969> than

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
that version one is a lot better than

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.170 
that version one is a lot better than
the<00:00:39.210> second<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.800> but<00:00:40.800> unless<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.550> I'm

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
