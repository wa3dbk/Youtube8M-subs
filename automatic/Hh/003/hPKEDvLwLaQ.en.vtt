00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
pounds of scrap which I'm gonna take to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.250 
pounds of scrap which I'm gonna take to
the<00:02:16.280> scrapyard<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:17.090> can<00:02:17.239> get<00:02:17.390> $11<00:02:18.910> 400<00:02:19.989> of<00:02:20.989> old

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
the scrapyard I can get $11 400 of old

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.860 
the scrapyard I can get $11 400 of old
scrap<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:22.010> this<00:02:22.310> 250<00:02:23.090> pounds<00:02:23.599> so<00:02:23.720> I'm

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
scrap like this 250 pounds so I'm

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.100 
scrap like this 250 pounds so I'm
guessing<00:02:24.440> 20<00:02:24.950> -<00:02:25.130> I'm<00:02:25.430> guessing<00:02:26.410> almost<00:02:27.410> $30

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
guessing 20 - I'm guessing almost $30

what<00:02:52.310> all<00:02:52.489> would<00:02:52.730> have<00:02:52.940> here<00:02:55.299> let's<00:02:56.299> see<00:02:56.599> what

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
what all would have here let's see what

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:04.420 
what all would have here let's see what
we<00:02:57.049> got

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.010 

all<00:03:05.090> right

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020
