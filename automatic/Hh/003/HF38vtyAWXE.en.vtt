 associated with this emergency diet 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.729
 In this diet we reduce 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.189
 amount of carbohydrate mainly 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.119
 simple carbohydrates those that

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:16.260

 Are there any amounts of protein? 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.989

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.980
 detoxifiers that are juices that go 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.769

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.280
 possibility of wrong, this result is 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.340
 very large then fulfilling 100% of this 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.459
 food plan making every day the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.859
 physical activity you can have a great 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:17.450
 result and this I assure you because it is 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:20.880
 I have several clients in the office 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:25.200
 and I already checked this with some 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.329
 of them and 2% and 3% did not. 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.139
 had this result and those who did 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.190
 100 percent and this has a great 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.760
 result 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:41.099
 I have a client that she took some 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.510
 six months to to trust and prada and 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.819
 make the decision 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:51.230
 she went to the office there 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:54.750
 I counted the right food plan 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.120
 arrived on the scale had not resulted 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.889
 I used to go there then so let's go 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.700
 I want to write you everything that begins this 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:06.359
 week and then we came to the conclusion 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.120
 which left 20% of her food plan 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.370
 even though she thought she was 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.289
 following correctly then many times 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:20.729
 you think you're following 100% and 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:24.880
 by an error of the times of reading or 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:28.030
 for an error , it's from vm 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:32.020
 the haiti had I put on the diet so 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:36.160
 You eat this or that and she did not see 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:40.450
 or so by the time I go now has 1 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:43.060
 or r take it from the beginning has an e 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:47.140
 after six months she discovered 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.530
 which was one or the other and from the moment 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:54.340
 what she really decided is that she 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.280
 really wanted to lose weight if a 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.160

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.300

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.150
