00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.710 
with a light indicator for when it is
charging<00:02:58.860> or<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.670> are<00:03:00.000> using<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:01.170> charge

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
charging or you are using it to charge

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.290 
charging or you are using it to charge
and<00:03:03.720> like<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.410> said<00:03:04.470> they<00:03:04.890> are<00:03:04.920> about<00:03:05.340> half<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
and like I said they are about half the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.160 
and like I said they are about half the
size<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.780> each<00:03:06.900> other

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.000 

the<00:03:10.170> reason<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.710> chose<00:03:11.010> power<00:03:11.520> bank<00:03:13.010> besides

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
the reason I chose power bank besides

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.060 
the reason I chose power bank besides
the<00:03:14.400> fact<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.820> they<00:03:15.270> were<00:03:15.330> both<00:03:15.870> very

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
the fact that they were both very

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.540 
the fact that they were both very
budget-friendly

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
budget-friendly

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.110 
budget-friendly
I<00:03:17.790> really<00:03:18.660> like<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.110> fact<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.560> they<00:03:20.120> 100%

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
I really like the fact that they 100%

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.840 
I really like the fact that they 100%

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
are new and that's gotta count for

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.730 
are new and that's gotta count for
something

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
something

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.190 
something
it<00:03:49.740> is<00:03:50.040> gonna<00:03:50.370> be<00:03:50.460> thicker<00:03:50.940> than<00:03:51.240> a<00:03:51.450> lot<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:52.050> the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
it is gonna be thicker than a lot of the

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.730 
it is gonna be thicker than a lot of the
more<00:03:52.410> expensive<00:03:52.970> but<00:03:53.970> for<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:55.050> same<00:03:55.320> amount

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
more expensive but for the same amount

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.640 
more expensive but for the same amount
of<00:03:55.890> million<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.490> hours<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:57.120> will<00:03:57.810> take<00:03:58.410> a

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
of million of hours I will take a

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.480 
of million of hours I will take a
thickness

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.180
