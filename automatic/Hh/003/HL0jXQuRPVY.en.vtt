00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 the way to creating a super 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.400
 intelligence is what we need 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.760
 most basic secrets of the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.929
 decrypt the universe 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.429
 Intelligent machines will be back soon 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.910
 enable our most difficult 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.080
 to overcome challenges 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.390
 new methods for early cancer detection 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.680
 to develop a better future for 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.039
 to shape us with simple words 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.189
 save lives 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.109
 Once linked, the analytical would be 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.330
 power greater than the bundled 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.820
 intelligence of all people since the beginning 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.820
 the time professor 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.800
 This terror organization is called 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.300
 Law 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.880
 you have our labs all over the country 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.860
 attacked 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.250
 they destroy everything the research 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.690
 to transcend concern we go 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.460
 assuming that there are only five left 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.440
 has to live for weeks if I'm not 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.699
 there you have to go on I leave 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.290
 you do not go we can be 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.000
 wants awareness we can upload 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.470
 So do not save us if we have something 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.190
 Forgets how do we know about this 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.770
 it's like a guest 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.360
 been freed 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.970
 i have to hurt myself i need me 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.130
 energy gets me online this is not 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.190
 It will take off until we know what it means 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.190
 that is everywhere 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.450
 her friend she does not know the danger 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.190
 if you connect it to the internet 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.660
 would copy itself and then 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.150
 leaves it no longer turn off the 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.200
 is not he is dead 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.650
 whatever that is the motto out there 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.780
 a march on evolution that is 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.160
 evolution that is abominably almost in 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.420
 all the world happens here i can give them 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.729
 fast 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.979
 going on to listen, I understand your 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.770
 not that i am the future that is not 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.770
 our future you are only doing 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.060
 you have changed you have stopped 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.060
 to love me 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.930
 to back up 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:20.190
 if we do not stop him that 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.190
 to be the end of humanity
