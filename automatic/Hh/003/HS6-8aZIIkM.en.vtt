00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Cuckoo Tomo I hope you are well 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.190
 and welcome to my channel so started 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.069
 for all with a new video for 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.960
 you do a review on a brand in 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.759
 who see me 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.590
 products to test them more 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.360
 especially a box so it's up to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.220
 smooth boxing I think it's going 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.960
 like that i'm really not sure but 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.939
 I think the source box and that's 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.109
 that of march 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.840
 so I think we can wait to 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.779
 find on their site normally and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.300
 his 16 euros a month and the three months 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.859
 his 49 euros something like that so 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:45.510
 frankly it's worth it and I you 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:47.520
 immediately presented the products in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.350
 first time you receive it in a 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.640
 little pouch so this little 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.770
 pink pouch make me call them the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 longchamp and therefore the products we 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.600
 select the site are products 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.300
 american typical american so the most 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.690
 especially w7 I do not know if you 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.900
 know 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.930
 they're going to be heading towards the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.210
 w7 brand products i do not know 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.240
 how is that good but it's w7 and 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.090
 they will favor full size so 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 me in this box there are four 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.840
 products that I will present to you all 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.890
 right now I tell you in my opinion so we 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.540
 will start right away with the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.580
 first product so I think you 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.470
 recognize a little the mark this is the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.259
 ball is in the city so natural nude 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.540
 it is the pallet thus contains this makeup 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.860
 eyelids so here it's metallic 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.689
 there is no mirror that's good 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.220
 really not disturbing and there was a 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.579
 little brush that were just provided 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.829
 here double ended but I'm not 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.090
 the more I do not know how to succeed and so you 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.380
 have the first color called 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.590
 or widi wam 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.530
 the second called troy la 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.130
 third is called brews the fourth 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.510
 which is called dahouche ocz the fifth 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.820
 it's called autumn and 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.900
 her name is andrÃ© so frankly 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.900
 I really like this palette if you 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.149
 want to bring it on a trip it's really 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.370
 a very small highlight marking makeup 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.020
 the evening and the day it returns very 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.450
 very well so if you want a make up 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.030
 with this little palette there frankly 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.220
 said me in the comments so 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.080
 a natural day make up and a make up 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.220
 a little more busy evening the mans 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.440
 in comment you put a small 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.630
 thumbs up if you want 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.710
 here we go now to the second 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.540
 product which is so a bluff and a 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.250
 sculptor so that's supposed to be a 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.750
 browser and I can not find at all 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.850
 it's a browser it's called technical 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.120
 cult chaix so here it is and at 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.520
 the interior and so provide the bluff and 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.350
 the sculptor so I do not think that's 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.120
 be a sculptor frankly he has a 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.600
 mauve color no that I would rather put 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.610
 in blush mix both because I 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.370
 do not think it's digging here it's 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.560
 pink and when you save right here you 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.630
 have a brush with a mirror so that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.890
 it's top but really top so the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.989
 speaks frankly I do not use good 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.330
 it's a weird form I do not know 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.209
 not but the mirror is super nice 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.070
 to have my mirror and also brought 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.989
 in travel it's really a very 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.540
 very good deal before last product 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.600
 still from the brand w7 it's a 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.560
 embroidery this time a true real 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:28.050
 it's the all in one cream popa smells 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.630
 compact new-bell so that papilloud 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.310
 beige so like these have me science 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.420
 is a powder but I use a 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.160
 stormy risk browser of the world 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.070
 hours provides them with no or little as 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.110
 a magnifying glass is weird so it takes the 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.120
 matter mesalles absorb so that one 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.970
 is not on your skin so that I 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.430
 throws a lot but they do not buy that 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.459
 for for the little ride the little 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.580
 puff and for the content so very 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.590
 very good curves then you if you 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.790
 have this skin color you the 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.650
 take powder but I learn it 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.209
 o'brother and I did not choose 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.440
 on the site it was boxing that is done 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.840
 like that so 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.940
 the powder is really very very good 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.389
 she keeps all day that's what 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.410
 is really great I put it this morning 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.840
 I do not know if you can see when 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.199
 even 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:19.410
 it's to be at embroidery st and she and 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:22.720
 she is super good 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.370
 the packaging is also beautiful sweater 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.550
 of armed always produces the mark of 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.169
 w7 it's a lipstick or a colossus 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.520
 not launch a glass a morning gloss fes 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.150
 received a lipstick but in tubes 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.050
 red in color so I do not like 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.520
 not because it's a bad product 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.680
 because I do not like red I 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.510
 find it finally I find it does not do 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.200
 at all beautiful on me I hate red 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.100
 on me but be frozen just test 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.710
 like that to try 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.229
 he is really very very bad he does not 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.250
 do not stick and on the contrary holding but it 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.990
 hold four days this thing that I 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.360
 struggled to remove it when I try their 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.860
 better with water proof 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.000
 I had red everywhere but 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.460
 really it's impossible 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.650
 need not just ten times over for 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.760
 remove it so it's a good point as 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.410
 a bad point 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.630
 a good point in the sense that it pulls from 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.229
 the day so if you want a very 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.900
 very long 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.150
 take it if you just want one 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.229
 little color for after face and finally 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.820
 if you do not like and so on 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.220
 do not take this because frankly 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.200
 it's even too good 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.760
 so that's what it gives my game is 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.979
 badly applied because I have no mirror 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.870
 but frankly he is really very 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.820
 very beautiful so here are the girls I hope 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.990
