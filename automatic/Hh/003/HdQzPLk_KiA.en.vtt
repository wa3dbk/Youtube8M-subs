00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
that's throwing up all pretty much the

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.250 
that's throwing up all pretty much the
roll<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:14.350> quick<00:03:14.590> print<00:03:15.070> your<00:03:15.220> hands<00:03:15.990> hot<00:03:16.990> soapy

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
formed a barbecue woodwork look we're

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.770 
formed a barbecue woodwork look we're
going<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.160> fry<00:03:24.370> them<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.180> little<00:03:25.390> bit<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.660> oil

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
going to fry them so a little bit of oil

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.920

in<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.530> pan<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.940> then<00:03:28.240> we<00:03:28.300> just<00:03:28.420> pop<00:03:28.570> a<00:03:28.630> balls

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
in the pan and then we just pop a balls

into<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.590> pan<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:32.080> then<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.800> get<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:32.950> nice

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
into the pan and then you get a nice

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.670 
into the pan and then you get a nice
sizzle<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.940> if<00:03:34.780> you<00:03:34.870> can<00:03:35.050> pack<00:03:35.260> them<00:03:35.500> enough

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
sizzle and if you can pack them enough

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.440 
sizzle and if you can pack them enough
they<00:03:35.710> should<00:03:35.830> all<00:03:36.040> hold<00:03:36.220> their<00:03:36.430> shape<00:03:36.460> so

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
they should all hold their shape so

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.610 
they should all hold their shape so
while<00:03:37.600> these<00:03:37.750> cook<00:03:37.960> through<00:03:38.200> for<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.440> few
