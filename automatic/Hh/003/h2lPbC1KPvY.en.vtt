I<00:01:02.640> found<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.149> at<00:01:03.359> walmart<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.049> about<00:01:04.320> three

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
I found this at walmart is about three

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.300 
I found this at walmart is about three
dollars<00:01:05.990> stay<00:01:06.990> close<00:01:07.409> i<00:01:07.439> guess<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.159> way

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
dollars stay close i guess it's the way

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.130 
dollars stay close i guess it's the way
you<00:01:08.369> call<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:09.030> liquid<00:01:09.510> starts<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.020> it's

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
you call it as liquid starts and it's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
you call it as liquid starts and it's
supposed<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.560> equal<00:01:10.979> parts<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.670> liquid

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
supposed to be equal parts of liquid

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.660 
supposed to be equal parts of liquid
starch<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.689> Elmer's<00:01:13.140> glue<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.310> we're<00:01:14.549> going

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
starch and Elmer's glue so we're going

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.260 
starch and Elmer's glue so we're going
to<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.790> start<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:17.090> equal<00:01:18.090> amounts<00:01:18.840> here

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
to just start with equal amounts here

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.870 
to just start with equal amounts here
that<00:01:21.270> probably<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.900> enough<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.409> notice<00:01:22.880> it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
that probably is enough to notice it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.160 
that probably is enough to notice it
says<00:01:24.119> once<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.900> made<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.680> can

you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.350> store<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.009> ziploc<00:01:32.369> bag<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.640> it

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
you can store it in a ziploc bag and it

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.289 
you can store it in a ziploc bag and it
will<00:01:33.030> last<00:01:33.270> for<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> long<00:01:34.170> long<00:01:34.380> time<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> give
