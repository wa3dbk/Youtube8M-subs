00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.450 

let's<00:00:07.140> see<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.410> snap<00:00:07.649> swivel<00:00:08.069> right<00:00:08.160> here

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
let's see the snap swivel right here

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.190 
let's see the snap swivel right here
it's<00:00:08.849> good<00:00:09.150> because<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.690> used<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.019> put<00:00:10.170> a

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
it's good because you used to put a

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.200 
it's good because you used to put a
little<00:00:10.320> split<00:00:10.620> shots<00:00:10.889> tie<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.519> directly<00:00:11.759> to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
little split shots tie it directly to

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.209 
little split shots tie it directly to
the<00:00:12.300> leader<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.840> put<00:00:13.290> split<00:00:13.530> shots<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.070> but

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
the leader and put split shots on it but

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.129 
the leader and put split shots on it but
to<00:00:14.309> put<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> bait<00:00:14.910> runs<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.420> circles<00:00:15.660> all<00:00:16.109> day

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
to put the bait runs in circles all day

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.870 
to put the bait runs in circles all day
long<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.830> after<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> while<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.369> bunches<00:00:17.730> up

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
long and after a while you bunches up

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.570 
long and after a while you bunches up
the<00:00:18.029> line<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.830> your<00:00:19.830> flag<00:00:20.070> doesn't<00:00:20.340> go<00:00:20.490> off

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
the line and your flag doesn't go off

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740 
the line and your flag doesn't go off
you<00:00:20.760> check<00:00:20.939> your<00:00:21.060> tip<00:00:21.270> up<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.600> get<00:00:21.689> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
you check your tip up and you get a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.150 
you check your tip up and you get a
great<00:00:21.900> big<00:00:22.080> ball<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.350> line<00:00:22.650> which<00:00:22.859> take<00:00:23.039> you

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
great big ball of line which take you

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.150 
great big ball of line which take you
hours<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.640> get<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.029> untangle<00:00:25.019> whereas<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
hours to get to untangle whereas the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.890 
hours to get to untangle whereas the
snap<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:26.880> snap<00:00:27.119> different<00:00:27.449> leaders<00:00:27.720> on

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
snap you can snap different leaders on

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.450 
snap you can snap different leaders on
if<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.170> want<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> lighter<00:00:28.650> ones<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.160> heavier

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
if you want the lighter ones or heavier

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.209 
if you want the lighter ones or heavier
ones<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> swivel<00:00:31.650> itself<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
ones but this but the swivel itself is a

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.069 
ones but this but the swivel itself is a
weight<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.640> that's<00:00:33.090> heavy<00:00:33.450> enough<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.899> bring

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
weight and that's heavy enough to bring

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.590 
weight and that's heavy enough to bring
that<00:00:34.290> spin<00:00:34.590> Oh<00:00:34.710> down<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.190> he<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.550> kind<00:00:36.390> of

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that spin Oh down so he just kind of

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.360 
that spin Oh down so he just kind of
goes<00:00:36.960> around<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> circles<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.920> never<00:00:38.040> twists

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
goes around the circles and never twists

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.580 
goes around the circles and never twists
up<00:00:38.489> your<00:00:38.640> lineup<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.480> that's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.840> good

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
up your lineup here so that's a good

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
up your lineup here so that's a good
thing<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.989> flag<00:00:42.989> up<00:00:43.170> like<00:00:44.040> Pete<00:00:44.309> said

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
thing to have a flag up like Pete said

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.910 
thing to have a flag up like Pete said
around<00:00:44.879> three<00:00:45.149> o'clock<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:46.230> light<00:00:46.440> gets<00:00:46.620> down

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
around three o'clock the light gets down

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.790 
around three o'clock the light gets down
a<00:00:46.950> little<00:00:47.160> bit<00:00:47.340> which<00:00:47.489> amazes<00:00:48.000> me<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.800> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
a little bit which amazes me that the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.369 
a little bit which amazes me that the
fish<00:00:50.039> are<00:00:50.510> affected<00:00:51.510> by<00:00:51.629> light<00:00:51.809> penetration

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
fish are affected by light penetration

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.939 
fish are affected by light penetration
so<00:00:52.890> much<00:00:54.199> with<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.320> ice<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.039> must<00:00:56.280> be

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
so much with this ice but they must be

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:05.690 
so much with this ice but they must be
all<00:00:58.949> right<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:04.769> biggest<00:01:05.010> challenge<00:01:05.640> about

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
all right the biggest challenge about

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.810 
all right the biggest challenge about
ice<00:01:06.030> fishing<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.780> me<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.490> keeping<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> line

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
ice fishing for me was keeping the line

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.080 
ice fishing for me was keeping the line
from<00:01:09.119> tangling<00:01:09.979> your<00:01:10.979> hands<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.430> cold<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
from tangling your hands get cold and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.480 
from tangling your hands get cold and
the<00:01:12.360> line<00:01:12.540> freezes<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> ice<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the line freezes to the to the ice and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.640 
the line freezes to the to the ice and
you<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.659> little<00:01:15.900> kinks<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.380> little

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
you get these little kinks and little

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.370 
you get these little kinks and little
knots<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.810> one<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> things<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.350> I

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
knots and one of the things that I

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.990 
knots and one of the things that I
learned<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.610> pull<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
learned is you have to as you pull that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.399 
learned is you have to as you pull that
line<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.509> through<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> hole<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
line up through the hole you have to

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.830 
line up through the hole you have to
coil<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.009> lay<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.159> real<00:01:23.580> nice<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> on

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
coil it and lay it real nice on the on

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.240 
coil it and lay it real nice on the on
the<00:01:24.900> ice<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.470> doesn't<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.830> all<00:01:25.979> out<00:01:26.130> of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the ice so it doesn't get all out of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
the ice so it doesn't get all out of
whack<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.580> spent<00:01:26.909> probably<00:01:27.810> an<00:01:28.140> hour<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.530> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
whack I spent probably an hour and a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.580 
whack I spent probably an hour and a
half<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.659> picking<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> knots<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.380> my

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
half just picking the knots out of my

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.640 
half just picking the knots out of my
life<00:01:31.829> look<00:01:32.340> at<00:01:32.430> their<00:01:33.049> clear<00:01:34.049> one<00:01:34.259> nice<00:01:34.409> bass

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.000 

a<00:01:45.030> beautiful<00:01:45.900> large<00:01:46.080> mouth<00:01:46.380> bass<00:01:48.740> how<00:01:49.740> about

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
a beautiful large mouth bass how about

a beautiful large mouth bass how about
that<00:01:50.960> healthy<00:01:51.960> nice

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.429 

that's<00:01:57.899> pretty<00:02:00.530> back<00:02:01.530> through<00:02:01.799> all<00:02:02.340> right

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
that's pretty back through all right

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.130 
that's pretty back through all right
that's<00:02:04.439> more<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:06.539> bigger<00:02:06.750> fish<00:02:07.049> are

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
that's more like it the bigger fish are

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.460 
that's more like it the bigger fish are
starting<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.530> eat<00:02:08.660> fish<00:02:09.660> almost<00:02:09.899> didn't<00:02:10.349> fit

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
starting to eat fish almost didn't fit

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.490 
starting to eat fish almost didn't fit
through<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.800> hole<00:02:10.860> did<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:13.170> see<00:02:13.349> how

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
through that hole did it I can see how

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.509 
through that hole did it I can see how
that<00:02:14.069> would<00:02:14.099> not<00:02:14.430> fish<00:02:14.700> off<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:14.910> hook<00:02:16.519> not

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
that would not fish off the hook not
