 of 2011 from here October 2012 and 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.200
 Well I know it was not in December 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.320
 neither in 2012 and good has to be 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.390
 in October obviously if it was in October 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.179
 correct on October 7, 2011 to be 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.250
 Exactly we make a few geniuses next 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:12.440
 question says which of these youtubers 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.629
 popular has a yellow gold helmet 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.849

 they do not know these players good eyes 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.769
 youtubers side there are videos 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.709
 jacques wagner the goal is very good are 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.200
 game world gaming tv1 good that I 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.380
 remember it's jack frost mainer I do not know if 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.620
 they have seen it but well I think it is the 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.630
 correct or support according to the rules 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.349
 or does not matter this flash theme of friends 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.180
 ok next question says in what I 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.269
 will be thrown 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.469
 minecraft williams because tayson says 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.870
 in July in September in November or in 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.849
 august good as we know now is in 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.290
 August but before it was confirmed that 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.750
 It was for September then we are 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.790
 between august or september 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.859
 good august not see close out good I think 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.640
 that this map is not updated guys 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.340
 then it has to be September 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.290
 that's it was September says because he has 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.600
 it takes so long yes I know but it will be more 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.370
 soon from what we think 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.490
 next question question 5 says which 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.400
 of these guys I do not work where 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:27.909
 we prepare jiang night in liza nothing more 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.819
 jeff jeff is estimated we know that follows 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.340
 working from minecraft estimate to 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.769
 talking talking then I think it was 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.329
 nate like that because night may not be 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.050
 in minecraft but still very well 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:43.110
 so I think finite 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.840
 it was not even that pussy it was not inei it 's ok 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.640
 I got confused we all have mistakes and what 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.990
 we will leave like this but to be sure not 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.650
 I am then was steve steve manna 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.620
 let's see correct was steve because he had 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.900
 says his first name is Carlos Stevens 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.880
 then it's not a knot talking because 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.940
 we went from question number 6 guys 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.550
 says how much more hostile there is in 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:14.000
 minecraft pocket edition 45 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.640
 1 or 10 good 10 obviously there is not one 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.470
 which would take us to five because 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.840
 we have what are the zombie pig 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.050
 we keep the zombie skeletons the 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.810
 spiders and the clippers then they are five 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.010
 right or you knew the spiders are my 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.210
 pigment clippers and skeletons ok 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.580
 next question guys we are very 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.430
 good we only carry a bad question 7 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.650
 which of these modes were added to 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.950
 minecraft because tension first or god 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.540

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:50.450

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.930

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:57.380

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.500
