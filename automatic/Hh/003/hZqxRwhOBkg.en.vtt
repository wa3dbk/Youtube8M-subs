00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 very good kids how are you and 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.490
 I hope I'm great perfectly 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.309
 welcome to a new video on my channel 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.010
 we are in a new gameplay in black 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.450
 ops 2 playing in carrier there are for example 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.130
 half the example and a pretty thing 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.090
 curious you will check it when 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.090
 animalist as I always buy myself a 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.090
 play 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.429
 not on letter or not happy good triples 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.990
 pieces I rowling big letter or whatever 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.120
 upload video I have to do things 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.570
 such and such and good already tomorrow and finally 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.820
 I saw that you really liked the video of 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.100
 of the online game in the call of duty 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.930
 2 that in fact it was all weird because 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.239
 I get in the game just nothing more 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.070
 start I got 14 rolling and I stayed 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.140
 compiled with believing that of that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:59.220
 it was not online and I did not say anything in the video 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:01:01.680
 this is because it really is not me 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.629
 realized but they did not narrate to a 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.339
 game that never plays that games by 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.119
 first time you take the first weapon 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.640
 for the first time it was just so weird 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.440
 the only thing that stresses me a little bit 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.570
 not being able to run and that in the 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.670
 what its the call of duty 2 that tomorrow 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.250
 we will have the first episode and for good 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.890
 it stresses me a lot and I do not say 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.730
 much in the opposite pole the silence 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.510
 stresses a lot 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:34.830
 that and I say it a lot along good 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.470
 What else can you tell yourself that 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.660
 that's also my fault because sometimes 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.160
 my tweezers go away and I do not remember that 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.780
 you said a lot the road comments 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.390
 to trillo road to use that has happened 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.640
 on the roster and they are left half no no 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.320
 I have stopped using half simply 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.380
 is that I think it's not that nor remember 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.060
 not to say come if what I'm root 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.320
 He used a person who is not what he is or 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.620
 I agreed to mariah not forgotten 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.170
 all of that series so 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.270
 pay attention to my twitter that through 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.740
 from my twitter, I'll put my name and I 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.570
 I'll set the time for us to play matching 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.340
 said comedian please if I invite you and 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.260
 you come that at least you know that the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.350
 rake you have to leave the last 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.000
 to try to trill him with killing 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.100
 you can put what you want but what 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.780
 last leave it alive is important what 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.960
 I say by previous chapters but 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.790
 we are seeing and there is always 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.330
 people who hate them play where it is 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.670
 losing in times is worth something else that 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.320
 I wanted to comment is that also a 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.390
 much waste, apart from the rest he used 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.470
 you asked me to come back pro player 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.690
 there will also be more videos with pro player 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.440
 but 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.020
 I do not like I do not like the fact 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.150
 have to say that taxing with player 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.330
 directly I do not know there are times that I get 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.850
 the venado and I want to scream and I'm going to 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.370
 take out the vein pro beach eye pop chunk 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.680
 with another date and the fourth did not come out 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.650
 cago in your life but that there 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.650
 waiting to hit 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.440
 so if I want to record again as 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.120

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.739
