00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.810
 all had fallen but all were 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.810
 all my books 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.430
 hello to all and tsb and today we get 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.740
 found for a brand new safe glitch 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.720
 I was online in taxes 24 to do 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.470
 money is limited without limit of 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.150
 45 minutes 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.070
 so what will have to be done is all 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.070
 just have a garage that does not have 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.870
 of flat so attached to him so by 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.820
 example the popular street number two 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.320
 that you can then take what he 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.519
 will have to do is have hulls 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.410
 rebels in the garage but that the 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.550
 garage is not full it will take 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.050
 free a place in the garage 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.570
 you will also need a friend who 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.699
 place his car so like this so 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.010
 for ren passengers to be able to jump 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.750
 for your teeth so preferably one and 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.339
 the gif or the custom or a slope ophuls 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.290
 tom then what will have to do is 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.269
 take a vehicle from the road and you 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.769
 go block it against the garage so 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.210
 it will not take 2 4 4 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.390
 because it will not work so 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.280
 take a normal car so you the 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.500
 bring it back you're going to stick it against the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.909
 garage door so by maintaining the 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.190
 select key to open the menu 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.560
 interactions to avoid being 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.670
 teleported into the garage 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.170
 then when you finish you go 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.090
 call your rebel column where to go 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.260
 search your garage 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.670
 against the rebellious keren he will not have 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.050
 not be stuck to the garage door 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.640
 now what you're going to do is 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.470
 start shooting so in the car 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.330
 from the street as soon as it catches fire you 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.330
 go quickly back in the map goes 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.570
 flashing you will come out that in 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.770
 it will be an after- bud thanks to that 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.720
 then now you are going 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.520
 lead to a rebel and do the 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.870
 click as usual so you go 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.820
 shoot in the rebellious keirin until 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.010
 they catch on fire you are going to return 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.540
 in and quickly come out and 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.800
 I insist on it very quickly because if 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.970
 you are not fast enough you will be 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.250
 all the time teleport outside of 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.150
 the island and guy that will never work so 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.550
 basically I'll put it in the 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.720
 slowed down for you see that the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.760
 character begins to close the door 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.110
 you spammed triangle and did it 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.000
 before the fashion will flash you 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.500
 go quickly out of kurun robben and 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.140
 teleport yourself in the league 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.879
 you will have to keep triangle pressed in 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.069
 league i and move the camera in all 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.810
 the senses and you'll see that boom 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.130
 you are teleported to the garage 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.940
 so here again you too 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.950
 are not such is thought in the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.239
 garage but that the map will flash that 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.709
 you are ejected from the vehicle 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.090
 it's just that you do not have 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.250
 you did not leave fast enough 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.500
 carbon rebels so here's the one 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.700
 works and you can duplicate 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.050
 as many vehicles as you want and 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.120
 there is a post lease so I'm going to you 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.810
 to see right away we want to go 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.810
 sell the first 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.209
 here and you will see that I call 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.160
 the mechanic and we can also sell the 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.140
 second here I hope that I 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.209
 you will have liked I wanted to make a 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.770
 little dedication to stow mast for 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.420
 helping me do this glitch so 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.040
 here are big dedications will end in 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.239

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.980
 do not forget to leave a small 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.060
 like went to see my dog ​​and I 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.330
