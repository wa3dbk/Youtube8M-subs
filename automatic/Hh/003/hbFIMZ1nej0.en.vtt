it's<00:00:16.900> been<00:00:17.110> two<00:00:17.290> years<00:00:17.320> the<00:00:18.100> post<00:00:18.340> of<00:00:18.430> the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
it's been two years the post of the

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.550 
it's been two years the post of the
first<00:00:18.760> video<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.750> I've<00:00:20.140> had<00:00:20.260> a<00:00:20.290> lot<00:00:20.500> of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
first video and I've had a lot of

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.730 
first video and I've had a lot of
questions<00:00:21.070> to<00:00:21.190> cover<00:00:21.430> so<00:00:22.300> I<00:00:22.330> thought<00:00:22.720> that<00:00:22.779> why

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
questions to cover so I thought that why

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.339 
questions to cover so I thought that why
would<00:00:23.920> start<00:00:24.130> off<00:00:24.250> with<00:00:24.520> is<00:00:24.670> kind<00:00:25.029> of<00:00:25.119> a<00:00:25.349> rehash

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
would start off with is kind of a rehash

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.560 
would start off with is kind of a rehash
of<00:00:26.380> the<00:00:26.950> first<00:00:27.160> blast<00:00:27.460> instructional<00:00:28.270> video

answer some questions that have been
raised<00:00:30.490> by<00:00:30.670> that<00:00:30.880> video<00:00:31.029> then<00:00:31.779> go<00:00:31.960> over<00:00:31.990> some

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
raised by that video then go over some

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.049 
raised by that video then go over some
different<00:00:32.680> things<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:34.559> drumming<00:00:36.059> truths

blast left-handed meaning that I play
right-handed<00:00:44.769> and<00:00:45.250> I<00:00:45.280> plan<00:00:45.580> a<00:00:45.640> blast<00:00:45.970> with<00:00:46.180> the

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
right-handed and I plan a blast with the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.680 
right-handed and I plan a blast with the
left<00:00:46.600> hand<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:47.559> snare<00:00:47.890> is<00:00:48.250> always<00:00:49.210> being<00:00:49.420> hit

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690

by<00:00:49.930> my<00:00:50.559> left<00:00:50.770> hand<00:00:50.980> primarily<00:00:51.550> that's<00:00:52.149> how<00:00:52.420> I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
by my left hand primarily that's how I

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.479 
by my left hand primarily that's how I
learned<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.780> blast<00:00:53.050> almost<00:00:53.649> purely<00:00:53.920> by<00:00:54.129> trial

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
learned the blast almost purely by trial

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.600 
learned the blast almost purely by trial
and<00:00:54.610> error<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:55.120> I<00:00:55.899> began<00:00:56.399> drumming<00:00:57.399> in<00:00:57.520> the

drumming videos at all let alone metal
or<00:01:04.330> extreme<00:01:04.690> drumming<00:01:05.110> so<00:01:05.379> a<00:01:05.619> lot<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.160> us<00:01:06.340> had

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
or extreme drumming so a lot of us had

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.070 
or extreme drumming so a lot of us had
to<00:01:06.580> learn<00:01:06.670> by<00:01:06.880> trial<00:01:07.149> and<00:01:07.270> error<00:01:07.450> on<00:01:07.750> our<00:01:07.899> own

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
to learn by trial and error on our own

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.850 
to learn by trial and error on our own
and<00:01:08.550> that's<00:01:09.550> what<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:10.149> case<00:01:10.360> was<00:01:10.390> with<00:01:10.750> me<00:01:10.930> so

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
and that's what the case was with me so

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.740 
and that's what the case was with me so
what<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.130> had<00:01:12.399> to<00:01:12.520> learn<00:01:12.670> was<00:01:12.880> purely<00:01:13.210> by<00:01:13.420> ear

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
what I had to learn was purely by ear

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.730 
what I had to learn was purely by ear
and<00:01:13.990> trial<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.470> error<00:01:14.680> on<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:15.729> kit<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:17.020> saw<00:01:17.710> a

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
and trial and error on the kit I saw a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.120 
and trial and error on the kit I saw a
video<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.460> paula's<00:01:18.850> arco<00:01:19.119> explained<00:01:19.570> in

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
video of paula's arco explained in

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.429 
video of paula's arco explained in
callable<00:01:21.130> corpse<00:01:22.110> right-handed<00:01:23.110> he<00:01:23.229> looked

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
callable corpse right-handed he looked

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.140 
callable corpse right-handed he looked
like<00:01:23.470> he<00:01:23.650> was<00:01:23.799> doing<00:01:24.040> a<00:01:24.130> lot<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.369> extra<00:01:24.880> labor

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
like he was doing a lot of extra labor

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.359 
like he was doing a lot of extra labor
to<00:01:25.630> get<00:01:25.869> that<00:01:26.020> done<00:01:26.290> it<00:01:26.560> just<00:01:26.920> didn't<00:01:27.159> seem

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
to get that done it just didn't seem

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.010 
to get that done it just didn't seem
right<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.640> me<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.119> tried<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.659> and<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.840> just

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
right to me and I tried it and it just

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.830 
right to me and I tried it and it just
didn't<00:01:29.290> work<00:01:29.380> for<00:01:29.439> me

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.080 

so<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.870> decided<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.160> can't<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.910> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
so I decided that that's it can't be the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.270 
so I decided that that's it can't be the
way<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.570> should<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.720> done<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> went

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
way that it should be done so I went

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.250 
way that it should be done so I went
ahead<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.580> started<00:01:38.910> blasting<00:01:39.390> left-handed

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
ahead and started blasting left-handed

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.100 
ahead and started blasting left-handed
in<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.830> first<00:01:41.190> video<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.850> did<00:01:42.540> say<00:01:42.810> something

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
in the first video I did say something

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.230 
in the first video I did say something
to<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> effect<00:01:43.620> of<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.220> people<00:01:44.880> learn<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
to the effect of if people learn to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.600 
to the effect of if people learn to
blast<00:01:45.570> left<00:01:46.260> hand<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> right<00:01:47.070> way<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
blast left hand it the right way the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.090 
blast left hand it the right way the
proper<00:01:48.000> way<00:01:48.120> it's<00:01:48.630> been<00:01:48.810> misquoted

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
proper way it's been misquoted

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.500 
proper way it's been misquoted

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
they suddenly switched to right hands

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.330 
they suddenly switched to right hands
and<00:02:08.429> only<00:02:08.760> blast<00:02:09.080> right<00:02:10.080> handed<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:11.040> never

and only blast right handed that never

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.100

made<00:02:11.550> any<00:02:11.670> sense<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:12.030> me<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.270> don't<00:02:12.630> think<00:02:12.930> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
made any sense to me I don't think that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.810 
made any sense to me I don't think that
that<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.470> what<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.830> should<00:02:13.890> naturally<00:02:14.220> want

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
that is what you should naturally want

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.060 
that is what you should naturally want
to<00:02:14.910> gravitate<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:16.050> your<00:02:16.590> tradition<00:02:16.980> a

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
to gravitate to if your tradition a

traditional<00:02:17.700> right<00:02:17.880> handed<00:02:18.240> drummer<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.920> think

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
traditional right handed drummer I think

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.449 
traditional right handed drummer I think
that<00:02:20.190> you're<00:02:20.400> kind<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.760> losing<00:02:22.130> some<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
that you're kind of losing some of the

that you're kind of losing some of the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.420 
time to learn playing blast left hand
you<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.230> integrate<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.709> right<00:02:28.860> hand<00:02:29.130> as<00:02:29.250> well

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
you can integrate the right hand as well

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.590 
you can integrate the right hand as well
and<00:02:29.610> you've<00:02:29.700> got<00:02:29.880> twice<00:02:30.270> as<00:02:30.300> many

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
and you've got twice as many

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.850 
and you've got twice as many
possibilities<00:02:32.780> but<00:02:33.780> for<00:02:34.170> where<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.500> come<00:02:34.800> from

I<00:02:35.490> only<00:02:36.060> play<00:02:36.480> with<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> left<00:02:37.110> hand<00:02:37.580> because

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
I only play with the left hand because

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.330 
I only play with the left hand because
it's<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:38.790> my<00:02:39.090> personal<00:02:39.510> opinion<00:02:40.220> some<00:02:41.220> of

swing of the stick so I'm really using

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:23.830

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
now that we've addressed the grip one

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.810 
now that we've addressed the grip one
thing<00:05:28.260> i<00:05:28.350> want<00:05:28.560> to<00:05:28.590> mention<00:05:28.650> is<00:05:29.130> with<00:05:29.430> regard

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
thing i want to mention is with regard

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.550 
thing i want to mention is with regard
to<00:05:29.910> my<00:05:30.150> stick<00:05:30.480> being<00:05:30.810> a<00:05:30.870> little<00:05:31.080> longer<00:05:31.290> than

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
to my stick being a little longer than

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.580 
to my stick being a little longer than
your<00:05:31.710> average<00:05:32.360> 5v<00:05:33.360> that<00:05:33.900> does<00:05:34.110> make<00:05:34.260> a<00:05:34.320> big

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
your average 5v that does make a big

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.870 
your average 5v that does make a big
difference<00:05:34.620> in<00:05:35.130> what's<00:05:35.340> called<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.610> full

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
difference in what's called the full

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.760 
difference in what's called the full
from<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.120> balance<00:05:36.630> so<00:05:37.290> you<00:05:37.350> see<00:05:37.560> where<00:05:37.710> the

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
from the balance so you see where the

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.740 
from the balance so you see where the
stick<00:05:38.040> comes<00:05:38.340> down<00:05:38.550> from<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.850> bottom<00:05:39.060> that

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
stick comes down from the bottom that

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.770 
stick comes down from the bottom that
gives<00:05:39.960> me<00:05:40.050> more<00:05:40.230> balanced<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:41.210> also<00:05:42.210> tune<00:05:42.600> the

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
gives me more balanced I also tune the

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.660 
gives me more balanced I also tune the
snare<00:05:43.050> kind<00:05:43.350> of<00:05:43.500> high<00:05:43.680> not<00:05:44.130> as<00:05:44.250> tight<00:05:44.460> as<00:05:44.550> it

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
snare kind of high not as tight as it

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.670 
snare kind of high not as tight as it
can<00:05:44.700> go<00:05:45.000> but<00:05:45.270> I<00:05:45.510> probably<00:05:46.440> say<00:05:46.650> about

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
can go but I probably say about

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.860 
can go but I probably say about
two-thirds<00:05:47.280> of<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.520> way<00:05:47.670> so<00:05:48.420> it's<00:05:48.570> quite<00:05:48.810> a

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
two-thirds of the way so it's quite a

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.370 
two-thirds of the way so it's quite a
bit<00:05:49.200> tighter<00:05:49.770> then<00:05:50.900> i'll<00:05:51.900> give<00:05:52.080> you<00:05:52.170> have<00:05:52.260> with

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
bit tighter then i'll give you have with

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.010 
bit tighter then i'll give you have with
rocker<00:05:52.680> or<00:05:52.950> metal<00:05:53.400> drummer<00:05:53.640> and<00:05:53.900> part<00:05:54.900> of<00:05:54.930> that

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
rocker or metal drummer and part of that

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.330 
rocker or metal drummer and part of that
is<00:05:55.080> kind<00:05:55.320> of<00:05:55.380> like<00:05:55.440> the<00:05:55.620> tights<00:05:55.860> down<00:05:56.160> the

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
is kind of like the tights down the

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.160 
is kind of like the tights down the
other<00:05:56.460> half<00:05:56.640> it<00:05:56.820> is<00:05:57.060> because<00:05:57.510> i<00:05:57.540> do<00:05:57.720> get<00:05:58.020> a<00:05:58.050> lot

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
other half it is because i do get a lot

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.710 
other half it is because i do get a lot
of<00:05:58.230> bounce<00:05:58.470> back<00:05:58.770> from<00:05:59.070> the<00:05:59.370> head<00:05:59.720> hopefully

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
of bounce back from the head hopefully

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.780 
of bounce back from the head hopefully
this<00:06:00.990> clears<00:06:01.890> up<00:06:02.160> a<00:06:02.250> few<00:06:02.430> of<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.610> questions
