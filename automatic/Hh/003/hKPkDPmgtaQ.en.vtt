00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.139
 very good I liked it abroad and I 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.830
 I will teach how to open the bands as 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.700
 zte has told all the operators 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.150
 Clear 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:28.180
 that is something that is zte mode and 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.740
 Huawei Huawei that I say and it does not matter 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.410
 operator 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:38.530
 good in the first option I will teach you 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:41.680
 to open the bands alceda de ojos zte ya 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:46.860
 I have the modem connected and we will open the 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.860
 zte the little program this we open 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.080
 to tell you I've seen many videos 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.510
 tutorials on how to open videos and do not 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.660
 they have worked in this way thus assured 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.900
 without downloading anything good 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.380
 what they have to do is put the chip 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.930
 in the comte zeta 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.780
 this is a ceda del consell what 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.799
 have to do is put the chip 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.909
 get in the chip say in the zte consell 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.800
 get in the site and go here 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.530
 configurations 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.380
 once done in configurations are going to 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.550
 add a new network make a new 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.650
 good profile before proceeding I will tell you 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.750
 that all phones have legs 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.280
 open only to do must be done 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.600
 a small configuration 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.130
 let's start we add 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.100
 here in a new network depending on what 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.290
 operator will open it if I go to 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.440
 open it to the operator as you can see this 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.990
 it is a consell and if as it put a chip 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.640
 I say good, I have to open a 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.680
 operator I say what we have to do 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:08.520
 is to write tico code number we can 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.040
 alter and 99 numeral 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.470
 depending on a little message 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.660
 depending on the type of chip that they put 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.230
 will make the respective settings if 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.200
 I have a chip I say here where it says 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.930
 to penis put a penalty of say if they go to 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.330
 make a configuration for 20 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.330
 bands to a movistar here in just 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:35.180
 they put 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:38.180
 put a movistar penis if they go to good 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.460
 chivas is obvious if as you can see the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.470
 configuration of this by default is 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.500
 consell so he will connect to concer 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.020
 but now with this a good uncle chip 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.080
 and we will put the following apn that would be 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.060
 of web code 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.060
 and colon point 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.820
 day 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.480
 Colombia and depending on the country where 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.840
 are colombia mobile 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.840
 point with semicolons 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.790
 this is the configuration for you to 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:20.140
 open bands to you 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.659
 user leave it 0 and nail the sex a 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.530
 Once this is done, read 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.980
 i 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.480
 I'll tell you another little thing more here 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.890
 in has the bands open to 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.410
 clear and clear uncle admitted if I go to 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.340
 open the bands for movistar 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.730
 create a network a new network to add 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:48.380
 they put a movistar penis and the name 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.540
 puts in movistar network name in in the 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.940
 password that would be the number this 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.040
 that is here they put terry as of 9 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.010
 because all the trans and they give him 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.530
 set as default 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.340
 there are many disadvantages that can be 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:09.700
 present depending on your logic 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.700
 because if I connected a clear chip 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.920
 here 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.070
 obvious that I have to select clear and 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.350
 stable set as default 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.930
 and if I connected a chip 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.910
 I tell them, I chose, I say, and how stable 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.650
 as default to not have 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.840
 inconveniences remember that always 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.840
 they have to do that and one more thing 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.180
 is that if you install the modem 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.830
 and they will connect it in another side 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.830
 they have to do the configurations 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.320
 why 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.390
 they reopen the bands that's the 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.480
 only little problem of this because 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.120
 default these two that are here he does not 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.850
 he brings these I made them by defaul 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.500
 it is clear that I give it to see and how 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.900
 you can see this is the clear name at 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:02.040
 technical 99 numeral that would be the number 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:06.870
 to 000 and the apn would be bucks point to mx 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:09.750
 good as I already connect the tiggo model 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.580
 As you can see good 4g acquisitive 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.380
 I set as default now 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.840
 we proceed to connect to do the 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.840
 respective tests we connect 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:23.700
 let's wait a disconnected we will enter 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.920
 internet to verify 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.740
 As you can see, this Chinese has a balance and 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.990
 will automatically send me to the page 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.990
 to the tigo portal to recharge 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.050
 let's hope 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.230
 how my computer is a bit slow 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.950
 for fatigue as you can see now 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.950
 loaded the pod 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.610
 that's it 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.480
 has already opened the bands to this 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.370
 model 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.680
 I repeat if you 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.380
 are going to be the configurations for the 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.479
 respective operator have to put the 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.840
 correct assets in the description of the 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:14.410
 video I will leave the assets of each operator 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.570
 I will make it clear and I will leave one of you 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.790
 you can get internet more 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.969
 apn for movistar are very easy 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.909
 depending on the country where they are 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:28.059
 well now this modem already has 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:31.089
 two open bands with clear eyes 

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:34.809
 I repeat if I'm going to open the bands with 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:38.139
 movistar added a new network and I put 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:40.749
 the name of movistar asterisk 99 that 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.759
 would be the access number and the apn that 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:46.160
 it is a pity we have to movistar 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:48.610
 depending on the country where they are 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.610
 since I do not have the movistar I do not 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.610
 good
