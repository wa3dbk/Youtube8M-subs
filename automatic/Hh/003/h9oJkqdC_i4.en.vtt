00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
online on a mod pack a server for our

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.500 
online on a mod pack a server for our
magical<00:00:15.719> mod<00:00:16.289> pack<00:00:16.699> but<00:00:17.699> unfortunately<00:00:17.940> i

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
magical mod pack but unfortunately i

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.480 
magical mod pack but unfortunately i
have<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> very<00:00:19.199> bad<00:00:19.380> feeling<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.279> one

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
have a very bad feeling that this one

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.970 
have a very bad feeling that this one
will<00:00:20.640> kind<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.910> render<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.449> useless<00:00:21.980> not

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
will kind of render it useless not

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.859 
will kind of render it useless not
because<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.550> better<00:00:23.699> pack<00:00:24.090> but<00:00:24.630> just

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
because it's a better pack but just

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.540 
because it's a better pack but just
because<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.350> official<00:00:25.920> pack<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.430> has

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
because it's official pack and it has

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.550 
because it's official pack and it has
more<00:00:26.699> publicity<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.449> honestly<00:00:28.050> think<00:00:28.199> our<00:00:28.380> pack

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
more publicity I honestly think our pack

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.669 
more publicity I honestly think our pack
is<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> little<00:00:28.949> better<00:00:29.330> but<00:00:30.380> having<00:00:31.380> said<00:00:31.619> that

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
is a little better but having said that

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.740 
is a little better but having said that
there's<00:00:32.309> not<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.640> chance<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.480> compete

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
there's not a chance that it can compete

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.569 
there's not a chance that it can compete
with<00:00:33.809> an<00:00:33.989> official<00:00:34.350> back<00:00:34.500> with<00:00:34.770> being<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
with an official back with being on the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.790 
with an official back with being on the
third<00:00:35.880> page<00:00:36.090> i<00:00:36.329> believe<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.800> so

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
