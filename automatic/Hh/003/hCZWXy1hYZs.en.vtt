00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.310
 ask for more than you expect to get 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.310
 the advantages are that you could get it 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.099
 read with what to negotiate 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.299
 increases the estimated value of what it offers 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.249
 prevents negotiation is standing 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.189
 creates a climate where the other feels that he has won 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.880
 I reacted with a shudder to the proposals of the other party 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.789
 they may not expect to get what they are asking for but if you do not 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.789
 shows surprise is telling them it's a possibility 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.410
 often a concession follows 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.310
 if you do not shudder the other person will negotiate more aggressively 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.430
 Do not argue with people in the early stages of negotiation 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.680
 this creates confrontation 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.190
 use the formula feel sorry we discovered for it there has been a deal 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.470
 hostile 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.220
 always represent a reluctant seller or buyer 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.380
 avoid letting the other person know that you have the authority to decide 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.030
 your superior authority must be an entity without specifying not an individual 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.030
 do not allow the other person to force him with tricks admitted his 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.430
 authority 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.890
 I tried that the other person that you could admit your offer if this 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.340
 will cover all your needs 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.340
 do not confuse a stalemate with a stalemate 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.170
 the genuine dead spots are infrequent so maybe only 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.880
 it is a stalemate 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.100
 manage stagnation with the gambit set aside 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.980
 boost negotiation by solving first minor issues but not the 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.250
 limited to a single issue 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.740
 use the winning formula ana 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.299
 Lazcano at the right moment can get things at the end of a 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.690
 negotiation that eta could have obtained earlier 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.910
 this happens here because the mind of the other person take a turn after that 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.900
 has made a decision 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.710
 Maybe at the beginning of the negotiation, you have been thinking about the idea of 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.010
 buy it but once you have made the decision to buy it you can scratch 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.050
 a larger order of traditional products 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.130
 the way it is granted and can create a pattern of expectations 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.599
 in the mind of the other person 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.299
 there will be no concessions of the same amount because the other person will continue 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.949
 insisting 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.519
 there will not be a final concession because it can provoke utility 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.219
 It will never be a bargaining area entirely just because the other 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.819
 person asks for his last word or because he says he does not like to negotiate 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:35.459
 he believes that his concessions to let the other person get a better deal 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.719
 what was possible 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:41.299
 if the other person takes pride in their ability to negotiate their need for 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.649
 triumph can hamper reaching an agreement 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:49.089
 make the other person feel good about accepting a proposition by making a 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.819
 small last minute concession 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.389
 I always congratulated the other person when the negotiation has finished 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.439
 elements to press 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.439
 fix all the details from the beginning 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.050
 people become more flexible under the pressure of time 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:10.569
 if the negotiation lengthens, people become more flexible 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.460
 the power of information 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.149
 no subject admitted he does not know 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:18.029
 do not be afraid to ask the question 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:21.299
 formulate answer questions 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.299
 I did not ask only the person with whom you are going to negotiate 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.259
 Do not use the questions just to get information 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:33.499
 one develops the power of renunciation when the alternatives increase 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.269
 remember that the part that has more options is the one that has more power 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.029
 yes he has found the house of his dreams and is proposing to propose an offer 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:48.659
 You must find two other houses that you like as much as that 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.829
 those of effective negotiators know that learning to actively communicate that 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.189
 now she is willing to give up our position is the little 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.250
 powerful of all
