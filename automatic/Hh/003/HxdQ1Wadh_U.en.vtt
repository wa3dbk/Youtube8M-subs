00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.610 
tie rod and if you feel it it feels kind
of<00:03:00.470> squishy<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:02.180> when<00:03:02.989> you're<00:03:03.110> doing<00:03:03.260> this

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
of squishy so when you're doing this

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.140 
of squishy so when you're doing this
watch<00:03:04.130> your<00:03:05.890> that's<00:03:06.890> about<00:03:07.160> four<00:03:07.519> pumps<00:03:07.940> maybe

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
watch your that's about four pumps maybe

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.069 
watch your that's about four pumps maybe
six<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:10.430> another<00:03:10.940> test<00:03:11.269> I<00:03:11.450> guess<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.810> can<00:03:11.959> do

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
six and another test I guess you can do

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.800 
six and another test I guess you can do
is<00:03:12.200> actually<00:03:12.349> grab<00:03:12.650> your<00:03:12.859> tie<00:03:13.040> rod<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:14.299> if<00:03:14.660> it

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
is actually grab your tie rod and if it

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.990 
is actually grab your tie rod and if it
moves<00:03:15.079> like<00:03:16.069> that<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.950> know<00:03:19.100> it's<00:03:19.310> still<00:03:19.760> good

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
moves like that you know it's still good

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.690 
moves like that you know it's still good
I<00:03:20.299> have<00:03:21.170> placed<00:03:21.470> this<00:03:21.769> tie<00:03:22.010> rod<00:03:22.280> oh<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.489> don't

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
I have placed this tie rod oh I don't

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.000 
I have placed this tie rod oh I don't
know<00:03:22.970> maybe<00:03:23.440> two<00:03:24.440> years<00:03:24.709> ago<00:03:25.040> maybe<00:03:25.819> one

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
know maybe two years ago maybe one

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.470 
know maybe two years ago maybe one
because<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.130> got<00:03:28.310> in<00:03:28.400> my<00:03:28.519> truck<00:03:28.549> one<00:03:29.030> day<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.420> I

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
because I got in my truck one day and I

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.610 
because I got in my truck one day and I
turn<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.870> wheel<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.319> I<00:03:30.410> wouldn't<00:03:30.769> go<00:03:30.829> -<00:03:30.920> clunk

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.319 

but<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:36.769> know<00:03:36.859> in<00:03:37.010> 17<00:03:37.519> years<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.910> this<00:03:38.000> trucks

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
but you know in 17 years of this trucks

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.949 
but you know in 17 years of this trucks
life<00:03:38.600> that's<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.290> only<00:03:40.060> suspension<00:03:41.060> part

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
life that's the only suspension part

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.979 
life that's the only suspension part
that<00:03:42.200> this<00:03:42.380> trucks<00:03:42.680> needed<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.780> guess<00:03:44.780> what

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
that this trucks needed so I guess what

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.660 
that this trucks needed so I guess what
they<00:03:45.109> say<00:03:45.139> about<00:03:45.410> Chevrolet<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.069> true

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
they say about Chevrolet is true

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.890 
they say about Chevrolet is true
so<00:03:47.359> that<00:03:47.600> was<00:03:47.750> a<00:03:47.780> video<00:03:48.139> on<00:03:48.290> how<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.620> do

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
so that was a video on how you do

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.629 
so that was a video on how you do
greasing<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:51.109> chassis<00:03:51.769> on<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.700> 94<00:03:53.299> Chevy<00:03:53.569> truck

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
greasing a chassis on a 94 Chevy truck

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.650 
greasing a chassis on a 94 Chevy truck
you<00:03:55.639> want<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:55.910> make<00:03:56.030> sure<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:56.269> get<00:03:56.450> all<00:03:56.540> the

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
points of interest which is to say you

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.170 
points of interest which is to say you
want<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.209> make<00:03:59.389> sure<00:03:59.420> you<00:03:59.599> grease<00:03:59.780> everything

so example I missed the - out of the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.620 
so example I missed the - out of the
arms<00:04:03.950> because<00:04:04.819> I<00:04:04.880> didn't<00:04:05.090> realize<00:04:05.209> they<00:04:05.480> had<00:04:05.510> a

arms because I didn't realize they had a
grease<00:04:05.810> zerk<00:04:05.840> sign<00:04:06.230> because<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.799> the<00:04:07.130> tops<00:04:07.370> of

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
grease zerk sign because the the tops of

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.920 
grease zerk sign because the the tops of
each<00:04:07.669> I'd<00:04:07.910> along<00:04:08.180> which<00:04:08.359> is<00:04:08.480> covered<00:04:08.840> in

of the truck and then I got the two idle

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.589 
of the truck and then I got the two idle
arm<00:05:10.139> grease<00:05:10.470> zerks<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.610> I<00:05:11.970> don't<00:05:12.180> think<00:05:12.479> the

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
arm grease zerks and I don't think the

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.600 
arm grease zerks and I don't think the
steering<00:05:13.080> gear<00:05:13.289> has<00:05:13.620> any<00:05:13.800> grease<00:05:14.099> strokes<00:05:14.370> on

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
steering gear has any grease strokes on

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.710 
steering gear has any grease strokes on
it<00:05:14.760> because<00:05:14.940> there's<00:05:15.120> gonna<00:05:15.270> be<00:05:15.479> grease

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
it because there's gonna be grease

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.740 
it because there's gonna be grease
already<00:05:16.080> in<00:05:16.320> there<00:05:16.880> unless<00:05:17.880> you<00:05:18.180> take<00:05:18.389> the<00:05:18.510> top

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
already in there unless you take the top

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.689 
already in there unless you take the top
off<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.020> do<00:05:19.680> that<00:05:19.889> but<00:05:20.070> I'm<00:05:20.220> not<00:05:20.250> dropping

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
off and do that but I'm not dropping

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.420 
off and do that but I'm not dropping
that<00:05:20.910> box<00:05:21.210> off<00:05:21.509> I've<00:05:22.410> no<00:05:22.650> desire<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:23.009> do<00:05:23.220> that

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
that box off I've no desire to do that

and<00:05:23.639> steering<00:05:23.970> in<00:05:24.120> this<00:05:24.270> little<00:05:24.509> truck<00:05:24.630> works

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
and steering in this little truck works

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.710 
and steering in this little truck works
just<00:05:25.260> fine<00:05:25.500> uh<00:05:26.190> I<00:05:26.760> think<00:05:27.270> that's<00:05:27.479> all<00:05:27.630> the

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
just fine uh I think that's all the

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.060 
just fine uh I think that's all the
grease<00:05:27.900> trucks<00:05:28.169> on<00:05:28.349> the<00:05:28.470> truck<00:05:28.710> there<00:05:28.919> may<00:05:29.039> be

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
grease trucks on the truck there may be

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.939 
grease trucks on the truck there may be
a<00:05:29.430> couple<00:05:29.610> on<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.090> back<00:05:30.590> you<00:05:31.590> know<00:05:31.680> like<00:05:31.710> the

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
a couple on the back you know like the

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.790 
a couple on the back you know like the
transmission<00:05:32.250> linkage<00:05:32.940> or<00:05:33.380> maybe<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.590> big

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
transmission linkage or maybe the big

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.140 
transmission linkage or maybe the big

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
pedal linkage earned of the hood but I'm

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.760 
pedal linkage earned of the hood but I'm
not<00:05:36.270> gonna<00:05:36.419> worry<00:05:36.599> about<00:05:36.690> those<00:05:37.110> cuz<00:05:37.409> I<00:05:37.440> have
