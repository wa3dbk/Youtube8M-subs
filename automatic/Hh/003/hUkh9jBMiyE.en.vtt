behind it if I'm over the fret it will
sound<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:46.800> this

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410

got a clean sound but I just used up way

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.939 
got a clean sound but I just used up way
too<00:01:01.980> much<00:01:02.250> energy<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.199> biggest<00:01:04.770> thing

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
close to the fret with the same amount

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:24.980 
close to the fret with the same amount
of<00:01:24.390> pressure

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
of pressure

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.109 
of pressure
I<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.710> not<00:01:25.890> pushing<00:01:26.189> any<00:01:26.400> harder<00:01:26.759> right<00:01:26.939> now

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
I was not pushing any harder right now

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.880 
I was not pushing any harder right now
than<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> minute<00:01:27.810> ago<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.650> I'm<00:01:28.740> not

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
than I was a minute ago here I'm not

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.440 
than I was a minute ago here I'm not
using<00:01:29.189> enough<00:01:29.280> pressure<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.850> push<00:01:30.030> down<00:01:30.240> I

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
using enough pressure to push down I

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.420 
using enough pressure to push down I
could<00:01:30.600> push<00:01:30.780> harder<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.770> I'm<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.220> way

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
could push harder but I'm going to way

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.399 
could push harder but I'm going to way
more<00:01:32.640> work<00:01:32.790> than<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:34.110> I'm<00:01:34.229> back

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
more work than I have to so if I'm back

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.870 
more work than I have to so if I'm back
here<00:01:34.560> we're<00:01:34.680> gonna<00:01:34.799> push<00:01:35.009> really<00:01:35.220> hard<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.850> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
here we're gonna push really hard or I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.289 
here we're gonna push really hard or I
can<00:01:36.150> move<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.390> up<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.689> barely<00:01:37.439> push<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.520> when

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
can move it up and barely push so when

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.090 
can move it up and barely push so when
you<00:01:39.390> play<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> note<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.930> your<00:01:40.079> fingers

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
you play a note with your fingers

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.920 
you play a note with your fingers
of<00:01:43.060> course<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.330> always<00:01:43.480> play<00:01:43.630> notes<00:01:43.810> with

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
of course you always play notes with

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.810 
of course you always play notes with
your<00:01:44.050> fingers<00:01:44.350> except<00:01:45.310> for<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.460> open<00:01:45.670> ones

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
your fingers except for the open ones

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.700 
your fingers except for the open ones
most<00:01:46.810> people<00:01:47.020> don't<00:01:47.110> have<00:01:47.290> too<00:01:47.410> much<00:01:47.500> trouble

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
most people don't have too much trouble

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.920 
most people don't have too much trouble
hitting<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.100> open<00:01:48.190> strings<00:01:48.660> that's<00:01:49.660> a<00:01:49.780> right

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
hitting the open strings that's a right

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.240 
hitting the open strings that's a right
hand<00:01:50.110> problem<00:01:50.500> we'll<00:01:50.770> look<00:01:50.890> at<00:01:51.040> that<00:01:51.160> in

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
hand problem we'll look at that in

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.690 
hand problem we'll look at that in
another<00:01:51.310> tip<00:01:51.700> anyway<00:01:53.130> close<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.430> frets
