00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.330 

typically<00:00:29.690> you<00:00:29.900> want<00:00:30.080> a<00:00:30.290> brush<00:00:30.920> that's<00:00:30.950> going

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.070 
typically you want a brush that's going
to<00:00:31.400> fit<00:00:31.670> right<00:00:32.000> in<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:32.330> space<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:32.930> you<00:00:33.020> can

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
to fit right in the space so you can

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.660 
to fit right in the space so you can
move<00:00:33.380> back<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:33.590> forth<00:00:34.010> this<00:00:34.190> is<00:00:34.340> probably<00:00:34.550> a

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
move back and forth this is probably a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.010 
move back and forth this is probably a
little<00:00:34.760> small<00:00:35.120> I<00:00:35.150> could<00:00:35.390> probably<00:00:35.570> leave<00:00:35.809> it<00:00:35.960> a

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
little small I could probably leave it a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.869 
little small I could probably leave it a
little<00:00:36.110> bigger<00:00:36.350> fluffy<00:00:37.340> but<00:00:37.520> I<00:00:37.550> like<00:00:37.730> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.320 

and<00:00:51.240> because<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.780> an<00:00:51.900> angle<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.320> actually

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
and because it's on an angle is actually

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:02.370 
and because it's on an angle is actually
working<00:00:54.330> as<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.630> light<00:00:54.990> contour

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.540 

because<00:01:03.160> I<00:01:03.190> have<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.490> bigger<00:01:04.420> face<00:01:04.750> um<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:06.430> know

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
go past here because then that's going

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.470 
go past here because then that's going
to<00:01:12.010> widen<00:01:12.160> this<00:01:12.370> you<00:01:12.550> want<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.820> really<00:01:13.270> go<00:01:13.450> up

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.780 
to widen this you want to really go up
on<00:01:13.750> an<00:01:13.870> angle<00:01:13.990> here<00:01:14.530> which<00:01:14.980> is<00:01:15.100> like<00:01:15.250> lifting

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
on an angle here which is like lifting

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.970 
on an angle here which is like lifting
the<00:01:15.940> cheek<00:01:16.210> you<00:01:17.080> also<00:01:17.260> don't<00:01:17.500> want<00:01:17.620> to<00:01:17.800> come

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
the cheek you also don't want to come

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.120 
the cheek you also don't want to come
down<00:01:18.220> below<00:01:19.090> your<00:01:19.390> nose<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:20.770> this<00:01:20.890> right<00:01:21.070> here

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
down below your nose see this right here

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.560 
down below your nose see this right here
you<00:01:21.340> want<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.550> stay<00:01:21.730> right<00:01:21.880> here<00:01:22.150> because<00:01:22.300> then

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
you want to stay right here because then

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.510 
you want to stay right here because then
it<00:01:23.290> just<00:01:23.440> isn't<00:01:23.770> going<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:23.950> look<00:01:24.070> right<00:01:24.220> so

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
it just isn't going to look right so

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.450 
it just isn't going to look right so
some<00:01:25.090> people<00:01:25.480> actually<00:01:25.660> take<00:01:26.200> make<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.130> line

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
some people actually take make a line

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.120 
some people actually take make a line
from<00:01:27.880> here<00:01:28.479> down<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:29.470> that<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.740> can<00:01:29.770> do<00:01:30.010> as
