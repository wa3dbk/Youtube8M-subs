00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
heat gun which I normally use for

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.490

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.880 

I<00:00:49.600> just<00:00:50.600> applied<00:00:50.960> heat<00:00:51.230> for<00:00:51.500> about<00:00:51.680> two

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:15.330 
minutes
before<00:00:52.640> trying<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:53.060> remove<00:00:53.330> it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.760 

and<00:01:16.390> itself<00:01:17.390> was<00:01:17.630> just<00:01:17.869> some<00:01:18.020> minor<00:01:18.259> residue

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
and itself was just some minor residue

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.730 
and itself was just some minor residue
left

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.740 

you<00:01:25.340> can<00:01:25.490> remove<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.970> remaining<00:01:26.210> glue<00:01:26.540> by

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
you can remove the remaining glue by

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:39.530 
you can remove the remaining glue by
rubbing<00:01:27.049> it<00:01:27.140> with<00:01:27.170> your<00:01:27.439> finger

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.330 

you<00:01:40.080> can<00:01:40.260> still<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.800> outline<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.160> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
you can still see the outline of the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.190 
you can still see the outline of the
tape<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:41.820> I'm<00:01:42.210> cleaning<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.690> with<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.020> wet

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
tape and I'm cleaning it with the wet

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.900 
tape and I'm cleaning it with the wet
cloth<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:43.830> some<00:01:44.010> more<00:01:44.160> rubbing<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:44.760> the

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
cloth and some more rubbing with the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:58.750 
cloth and some more rubbing with the
finger

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.460 

so<00:01:59.760> it<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.940> proves<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.510> can<00:02:00.690> remove<00:02:01.020> 3m

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
so it is proves that you can remove 3m

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.020 
so it is proves that you can remove 3m
tape<00:02:01.650> from<00:02:01.830> your<00:02:01.950> black<00:02:02.190> mat<00:02:02.369> helmets<00:02:02.760> without

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
tape from your black mat helmets without

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.480 
tape from your black mat helmets without
doing<00:02:03.330> any<00:02:03.510> damage<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.369> with<00:02:05.369> this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
doing any damage to it and with this

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.920 
doing any damage to it and with this
knowledge<00:02:05.700> I'm<00:02:06.000> definitely<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.750> apply

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
knowledge I'm definitely going to apply
