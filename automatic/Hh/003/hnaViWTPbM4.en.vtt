00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
worry too much right now about splitting

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.979 
worry too much right now about splitting
or<00:00:37.410> twisting<00:00:38.100> stitches<00:00:38.579> you're<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.180> go

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
or twisting stitches you're going to go

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.040 
or twisting stitches you're going to go
back<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.219> minute<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.329> make<00:00:42.690> sure<00:00:42.719> that

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
back in a minute and make sure that

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.630 
back in a minute and make sure that
that's<00:00:43.170> fixed<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> drop<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.280> stitch

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that's fixed and if you drop a stitch

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.970 
that's fixed and if you drop a stitch
pick<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> loop<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:46.050> you'll<00:00:46.920> be

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
pick up the loop that you can you'll be

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.660 
pick up the loop that you can you'll be
picking<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.610> stitches<00:00:48.739> later<00:00:49.739> now<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> find

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
picking up stitches later now I find

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.319 
picking up stitches later now I find
that<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.660> easier<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.760> have<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.030> last

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that it's just easier to have that last

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.479 
that it's just easier to have that last
stitch<00:00:54.840> all<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.620> way<00:00:55.739> back<00:00:55.980> whether<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.370> try

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
stitch all the way back whether and try

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
stitch all the way back whether and try
to<00:00:56.550> figure<00:00:56.730> out<00:00:56.879> whether<00:00:57.180> which<00:00:57.539> role<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.989> came

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
to figure out whether which role it came

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.470 
to figure out whether which role it came
from<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:01.489> I'm<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.359> going

hmm turn it around and go through that

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.570 
hmm turn it around and go through that
process<00:01:40.570> so<00:01:41.560> one<00:01:41.650> more<00:01:41.800> time<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:42.190> get<00:01:42.310> over<00:01:42.340> the
