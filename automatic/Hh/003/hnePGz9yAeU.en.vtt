and lose you potentially the game now a
great<00:00:51.270> example<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:53.870> shake<00:00:54.870> of

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
great example of this is the shake of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.790 
great example of this is the shake of
this<00:00:55.199> game<00:00:56.449> in<00:00:57.449> chapin<00:00:58.170> select<00:00:58.530> there<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:58.770> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
this game in chapin select there was a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.130 
this game in chapin select there was a
lot<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.480> miscommunications<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
lot of miscommunications like that and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.500 
lot of miscommunications like that and
the<00:01:01.199> kha'zix<00:01:01.760> wanted<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> go<00:01:02.940> mid<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.390> then

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the kha'zix wanted to go mid but then

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.410 
the kha'zix wanted to go mid but then
cast<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.840> respect<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.320> i<00:01:04.350> picked<00:01:04.680> said<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.420> take

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
cast in respect so i picked said to take

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.109 
cast in respect so i picked said to take
them<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.659> because<00:01:06.750> he<00:01:06.930> couldn't<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.119> at

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
them in because he couldn't do it and at

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.020 
them in because he couldn't do it and at
that<00:01:09.180> point<00:01:09.450> he<00:01:09.689> decided<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.049> pick<00:01:10.260> kazakh

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
that point he decided to pick kazakh

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.460 
that point he decided to pick kazakh
which<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> poor<00:01:12.659> decision<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:13.260> i<00:01:13.290> was

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
which was a poor decision because i was

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.649 
which was a poor decision because i was
hoping<00:01:13.680> you'd<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:13.979> someone<00:01:14.310> tanky<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.540> they

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
hoping you'd go someone tanky and they

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.870 
hoping you'd go someone tanky and they
then<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.259> came<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> jungler<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.250> he

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
then it came to the jungler and he

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.200 
then it came to the jungler and he
decided<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> pick<00:01:18.420> shako<00:01:19.759> was<00:01:20.759> generally<00:01:21.180> i

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
team but when this happened i guess

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.969 
team but when this happened i guess
nobody<00:01:33.869> was<00:01:34.140> thinking<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.680> anything<00:01:34.950> like

to tank or performant have any form of
CC<00:04:08.650> up<00:04:08.769> in<00:04:08.920> its<00:04:09.069> boxes<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:09.670> that's<00:04:09.879> a<00:04:09.970> week<00:04:10.120> for

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
CC up in its boxes and that's a week for

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.960 
CC up in its boxes and that's a week for
MCC<00:04:10.840> like<00:04:11.049> it's<00:04:11.680> like<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.830> point<00:04:12.280> five<00:04:12.489> second

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
MCC like it's like a point five second

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.449 
MCC like it's like a point five second
fear<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:14.170> just<00:04:14.470> that<00:04:14.650> just<00:04:14.709> as<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.040> cut<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.340> as

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
fear that just that just as I cut it as

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.479 
fear that just that just as I cut it as
a<00:04:15.489> tank<00:04:15.819> so<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.709> think<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.919> main<00:04:18.070> point<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.340> this

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
a tank so I think the main point of this

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.200 
a tank so I think the main point of this
is<00:04:18.699> to<00:04:18.729> just<00:04:19.269> like<00:04:19.780> show<00:04:20.410> some<00:04:20.620> people

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
is to just like show some people

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.030 
is to just like show some people
sometimes<00:04:22.210> in<00:04:22.389> my<00:04:22.510> videos<00:04:22.840> you'll<00:04:23.740> see<00:04:23.919> me

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
sometimes in my videos you'll see me

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.530 
sometimes in my videos you'll see me
backing<00:04:24.250> off<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.790> that's<00:04:25.000> just<00:04:25.210> because<00:04:25.330> of

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
backing off and that's just because of

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.000 
backing off and that's just because of
like<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:26.139> pretext<00:04:26.740> of<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.949> game<00:04:28.650> III<00:04:29.650> know
