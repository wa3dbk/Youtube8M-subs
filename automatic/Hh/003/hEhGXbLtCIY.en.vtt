00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.620
 hello friends today we are with you 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.110
 We will discuss one sports supplement 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.910
 which is pretty regular you 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.650
 ask me especially in personal 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.439
 messages and very often i see it in 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.079
 comments under the video you ask 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.970
 me about l-carnitine what is it saw 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.800
 do i ever get it 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.300
 and generally work for this pieces therefore 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.880
 let's today we will understand what 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.160
 carnitine and the most important thing is that you 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.559
 must understand that this is not some kind of chemistry 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.820
 and this is not a fat burner is an amino acid 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.520
 whose main task is 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.230
 transportation of fatty acids where 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.829
 I don't want to split them 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.540
 complicate one word fats is great 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.880
 a source of energy I have this more than once 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.320
 spoke and generally I have a video 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.150
 detail about fats use for 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.340
 slimming where this topic is also mentioned 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.010
 and here I want to say that our 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.110
 the organism is very smart system i'm also in 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.059
 this constantly say and if you sow on 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.710
 some diets and stick to no 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.899
 very proper nutrition often 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.240
 the body loves to keep these fats and he 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.549
 does not like to spend them and he keeps them in 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.679
 most of our hateful places on the legs 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.340
 belly you what problem areas 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:20.889
 shem tova these fats and find and if you 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.619
 eat right and exercise 

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:25.600
 that is the possibility that taking 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.929
 additional amount of il carnitine 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.609
 you maybe a little faster or more 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:34.179
 somehow be able to actively engage 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:35.770
 sporting and losing weight seems to me that 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.409
 research on this topic was very 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.779
 many and some coach or what 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.979
 nutritionists general each person has 

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:44.679
 own opinion about 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.389
 supplements l-carnitine and of course does not want 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.709
 say that if he starts you take 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.719
 you won't start melting before your eyes 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:51.549
 This should be noted. 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.889
 not a magic pill that suddenly you 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.139
 will help to lose weight quickly but for example 

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:57.849
 medicine is used even carnitine 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:58.659
 some medical purposes within 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.090
 programs 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.549
 some world therefore in principle this 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.340
 harmless supplement is her big plus and 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.929
 with proper use you may 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.830
 increase your stamina by 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.959
 training sessions and 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.360
 immunity in general, which is also probably 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.500
 excellent best this supplement on you 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.510
 will start working if you regularly 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.790
 exercise and eat right 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.950
 so if you start reading the forums in 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.870
 On the Internet in general, these places where they write about 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.780
 tom that just don't work dark 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.010
 most likely these are the people who 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.900
 made famous bread because they think 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.900
 that if not to them otkuyu additive then 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.709
 the result will be much faster and 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.569
 shift your little 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.480
 responsible they are responsible for their 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.160
 result on and carnitine for example to 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.620
 Unfortunately, this is not the case and there will be no miracle 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.540
 if I think a little, then I see 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.370
 several pluses for example vali carnitine 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.379
 firstly he is harmless it is not 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.849
 fat burners which are sold for example 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.519
 sports nutrition stores which I 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.109
 wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.579
 do you exercise just to 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.680
 They look better because you want 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.650
 go on stage and get super lily 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.780
 because they don't let people sleep 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.470
 for example, and it happened to me in my life 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.930
 one day try one of the easiest 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.819
 fat burner one pill 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.829
 it was terrible in general i never again 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.650
 I will not do it for a long time 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.840
 I do not consider it necessary 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.739
 so here the river mitin is possible somehow 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.840
 you will be further motivated 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.120
 because you still spent the money 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.040
 on some sort of useful supplement 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.930
 for you and maybe it will be you 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.160
 motivate to attend more regularly 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.079
 for example gym or 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.200
 train at home if you do it 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:34.510
 you take it for sure 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.819
 the main plus as it seems to me when I 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.870
 lost weight I had about 25 extra pounds 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.700
 and I bought l-carnitine 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.260
 I can not say what I felt 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.019
 some kind of super effect from it 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.250
 sometimes it seems to me that it is a placebo but 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.330
 then I loved to go to 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.140
 training site 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.610
 they are pretty exhausting if anyone 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.080
 ever went to them he knows it 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.489
 bicycle training which 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.489
 imitates mountain riding and you are the most 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.650
 you expose yourself there complexity and you can 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.470
 generally very very strong self and 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.750
 then look all legs and buttocks all 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.489
 burned in general there was a period when i go there 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.290
 took carnitine and it seemed to me that 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.930
 I have more strength then I can go 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.449
 also run but i can't say 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.880
 I saw some super difference then 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.680
 there is here I would recommend 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.760
 consult a doctor and watch 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.550
 some of their own feelings 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.560
 probably so and as you can see 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.660
 I do not urge to buy my videos and 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.330
 acquire some supplements they consider 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.639
 and more precisely if you think it is 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.669
 please, but Iâ€™ll rather 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.840
 videos of this nature 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.610
 so it would be great if you 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.979
 shared comments did you try 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.960
 and carnitine maybe he helped you or 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.450
 is it worth taking it according to your 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.039
 I think it will be interesting to me 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.930
 experience sharing is cool and possible 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.310
 this video and comments under it will be 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.220
 helpful to so many people so 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.110
 let's help each other on this i 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.820
 finished put like write in
