00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
they will be attacked I've noticed that

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.020 
they will be attacked I've noticed that
the<00:03:22.170> Tesla<00:03:23.170> towers<00:03:23.560> love<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.310> attack<00:03:24.610> the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
the Tesla towers love to attack the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.390 
the Tesla towers love to attack the
healers<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.959> they<00:03:26.350> may<00:03:26.560> be<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.800> bigger<00:03:27.070> threat

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
healers and they may be a bigger threat

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.940 
healers and they may be a bigger threat
to<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.720> base<00:03:28.930> than<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:30.600> ground<00:03:31.600> unit<00:03:31.959> sometimes

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
to the base than a ground unit sometimes

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.390 
to the base than a ground unit sometimes
so<00:03:33.670> that<00:03:34.450> may<00:03:34.810> be<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:36.900> consideration<00:03:38.400> looks

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
so that may be in consideration looks

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.970 
so that may be in consideration looks
like<00:03:39.610> the
