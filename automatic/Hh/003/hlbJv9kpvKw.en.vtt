 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.620
 Good, I'll start a series for 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.450
 instruct you to play the accordion to 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.440
 harmonica harmonica I do not know how you want it 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.500
 calls 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.100
 Okay, I started taking the course now. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.080
 I could play if I played a little and I 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.330
 I thought it would be nice to do a series 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.670
 with internet people start playing 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.689
 also lacked very well as well 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.630
 complete 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.700
 one of the most complete that has and how I 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.730
 I searched for internet stuff I did not find 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.300
 To learn to play, I decided to do it. 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.670
 this series to show people how it is 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 which takes the first steps and then 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.980
 it would be good to keep up with the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.620
 teacher the team that I do not know how to play 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.149
 I know I started taking the course. 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.430

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.850

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.489
