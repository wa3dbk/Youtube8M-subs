00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.469 
Jr fired him Pacquiao fired him of
course<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.189> I<00:01:47.189> don't<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.759> he<00:01:47.909> has<00:01:48.030> really

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
course and I don't think he has really

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.840 
course and I don't think he has really
that<00:01:48.810> many<00:01:49.049> big<00:01:49.350> paydays<00:01:49.860> out<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.610> train

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
that many big paydays out there to train

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.480 
that many big paydays out there to train
a<00:01:50.880> fighter<00:01:51.299> when<00:01:52.020> he<00:01:52.140> trains<00:01:52.409> UFC<00:01:52.979> fighters<00:01:53.369> I

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
a fighter when he trains UFC fighters I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.749 
a fighter when he trains UFC fighters I
believe<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.290> he<00:01:55.290> used<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.500> Train<00:01:55.770> NBA<00:01:56.430> players

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
believe and he used to Train NBA players

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.380 
believe and he used to Train NBA players
and<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:58.200> don't<00:01:58.500> think<00:01:58.619> he's<00:01:59.250> not<00:02:00.060> really<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
and I don't think he's not really that

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.929 
and I don't think he's not really that
getting<00:02:00.780> getting<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.320> many<00:02:01.469> offers<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.399> i

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
getting getting that many offers and i

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.280 
getting getting that many offers and i
think<00:02:03.149> brandon<00:02:03.450> rios<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.840> was<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> biggest

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
think brandon rios it was the biggest

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.730 
think brandon rios it was the biggest
offer<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.070> he<00:02:06.030> needs<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.450> work<00:02:07.020> i<00:02:07.259> guess<00:02:07.469> he

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
offer and he needs to work i guess he

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.770 
offer and he needs to work i guess he
needs<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.099> money<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.879> i<00:02:08.910> guess<00:02:09.390> he<00:02:09.509> had<00:02:09.629> no

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
needs the money so i guess he had no

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.190 
needs the money so i guess he had no
