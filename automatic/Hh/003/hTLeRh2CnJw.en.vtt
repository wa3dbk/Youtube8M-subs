00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
going anywhere from two to three miles
sometimes<00:02:02.330> typical<00:02:03.740> group<00:02:04.740> walks<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.430> that's

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
sometimes typical group walks so that's

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.100 
sometimes typical group walks so that's
five<00:02:06.420> dogs<00:02:06.720> in<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.470> walk<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:08.420> $13<00:02:09.420> per<00:02:09.659> dog

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
five dogs in one walk it's $13 per dog

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.500 
five dogs in one walk it's $13 per dog
if<00:02:10.500> there<00:02:10.860> are<00:02:10.979> two<00:02:11.159> dogs<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.700> home<00:02:11.879> then

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
if there are two dogs in the home then

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.530 
if there are two dogs in the home then
it's<00:02:12.659> $15<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.519> basically<00:02:14.819> goes<00:02:15.209> up<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
it's $15 so it basically goes up a

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.479 
it's $15 so it basically goes up a
couple<00:02:15.720> bucks<00:02:15.989> every<00:02:16.440> for<00:02:17.159> each<00:02:17.280> additional

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
couple bucks every for each additional

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.640 
couple bucks every for each additional
pay

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
pay

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.130 
pay
so<00:02:18.819> that's<00:02:19.819> for<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> group<00:02:20.269> walk<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> solo<00:02:20.930> walk

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
so that's for a group walk a solo walk

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.979 
so that's for a group walk a solo walk
30<00:02:21.709> minutes<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:22.189> it's<00:02:22.280> $25<00:02:23.180> for<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.420> solo<00:02:23.780> walk

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
30 minutes and it's $25 for a solo walk

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.009 
30 minutes and it's $25 for a solo walk
however<00:02:24.739> it's<00:02:25.099> really<00:02:25.159> based<00:02:25.640> upon<00:02:26.120> how<00:02:26.510> often

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
however it's really based upon how often

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.350 
however it's really based upon how often
the<00:02:27.290> dogs<00:02:27.470> need<00:02:27.769> walk<00:02:28.010> max<00:02:28.400> gets<00:02:28.700> walked<00:02:28.909> every

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
the dogs need walk max gets walked every

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.960 
the dogs need walk max gets walked every
day<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:30.290> he<00:02:30.560> has<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.739> really<00:02:31.010> great<00:02:31.250> rate<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:31.879> it

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
day so he has a really great rate so it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.149 
day so he has a really great rate so it
really<00:02:32.150> just<00:02:32.239> depends<00:02:32.659> on<00:02:32.870> what<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.680> client's

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
really just depends on what the client's

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.819 
really just depends on what the client's
meeting<00:02:34.549> I'm<00:02:35.090> going<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.569> really<00:02:35.840> invest<00:02:36.200> my
