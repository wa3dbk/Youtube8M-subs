00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:47.290 
date on but the main fact is I
definitely<00:02:35.940> 100%<00:02:36.940> give<00:02:37.450> up<00:02:37.600> trash<00:02:37.959> these

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.970 

yeah<00:02:48.300> these<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:48.930> looks<00:02:49.140> like<00:02:49.319> somebody<00:02:49.680> open

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
yeah these this looks like somebody open

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
yeah these this looks like somebody open
up<00:02:50.099> in<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.310> morning<00:02:50.580> kids

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
up in the morning kids

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.300 
up in the morning kids
I'm<00:02:51.900> solving<00:02:52.230> things<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.739> know<00:02:52.860> everybody<00:02:53.159> kids

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
I'm solving things I know everybody kids

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.740 
I'm solving things I know everybody kids
have<00:02:53.489> like<00:02:53.640> toilet<00:02:53.940> paper<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:54.480> have<00:02:54.720> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
have like toilet paper in it have a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.690 
have like toilet paper in it have a
bunch<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.140> other<00:02:55.319> stuff<00:02:58.220> yeah<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.250> don't<00:02:59.489> know

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
bunch of other stuff yeah I don't know

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.320 
bunch of other stuff yeah I don't know
what<00:02:59.940> these<00:03:00.120> costs<00:03:00.930> back<00:03:01.110> in<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.440> day<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:02.010> up

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
what these costs back in the day but up

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.119 
what these costs back in the day but up
there<00:03:03.330> they're<00:03:03.599> gonna<00:03:03.720> go<00:03:03.989> out<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.530> trash

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
there they're gonna go out to the trash

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.949 
there they're gonna go out to the trash
I'm<00:03:05.340> I'm<00:03:05.790> gonna<00:03:05.940> I'm<00:03:06.239> gonna<00:03:06.299> take<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.690> kids

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna take the kids

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.800 
I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna take the kids
out<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.170> over<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.730> napkin<00:03:09.209> kids<00:03:09.450> and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
out of over the the napkin kids and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.869 
out of over the the napkin kids and
maybe<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.260> cause<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.890> economy<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.819> economy

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
maybe the cause the economy the economy

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:12.650 
maybe the cause the economy the economy
good

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
good

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.080 
good
I<00:03:12.980> don't<00:03:13.980> know<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.190> grape<00:03:14.400> jelly<00:03:14.640> probably

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
I don't know that grape jelly probably

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.869 
I don't know that grape jelly probably
10<00:03:15.269> years<00:03:15.450> old<00:03:15.659> I<00:03:16.430> guess<00:03:17.430> that's<00:03:17.640> probably

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
10 years old I guess that's probably

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.030 
10 years old I guess that's probably
every<00:03:18.150> cracker<00:03:18.980> yeah<00:03:19.980> crack<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:22.290> I'm<00:03:22.709> gonna<00:03:22.859> go

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
every cracker yeah crack so I'm gonna go

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.830 
every cracker yeah crack so I'm gonna go
it's<00:03:23.430> way<00:03:23.549> below<00:03:23.670> um<00:03:24.030> let<00:03:24.569> me<00:03:24.599> pull<00:03:24.810> this

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
it's way below um let me pull this

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.259 
it's way below um let me pull this
graphic<00:03:25.410> here<00:03:25.620> now<00:03:26.489> I'll<00:03:26.670> explain<00:03:26.760> how<00:03:27.030> to

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
graphic here now I'll explain how to

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.400 
graphic here now I'll explain how to
tell<00:03:27.540> if<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.900> memory<00:03:28.680> has<00:03:28.950> passed<00:03:29.220> date<00:03:29.549> or<00:03:29.730> not

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
tell if a memory has passed date or not

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.110 
tell if a memory has passed date or not
there<00:03:31.410> are<00:03:31.739> time<00:03:32.069> temperature<00:03:32.579> indicators

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
there are time temperature indicators

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.630 
there are time temperature indicators
and<00:03:33.480> I'll<00:03:33.690> I'll<00:03:34.650> be<00:03:34.739> back<00:03:35.069> with<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.340> in

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
and I'll I'll be back with that in

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.490 
and I'll I'll be back with that in
yesterday<00:03:38.000> okay<00:03:39.000> here's<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.420> picture<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:40.170> some

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
yesterday okay here's a picture of some

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.180 
yesterday okay here's a picture of some
time<00:03:41.459> temperature<00:03:42.060> indicators<00:03:43.099> over<00:03:44.099> the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
time temperature indicators over the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.020 
time temperature indicators over the
past<00:03:44.430> few<00:03:44.700> years<00:03:45.920> cases<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.010> aureus<00:03:47.459> have<00:03:47.849> been

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
past few years cases of aureus have been

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.479 
past few years cases of aureus have been
equipped<00:03:48.359> with<00:03:48.450> these<00:03:48.629> TTI's<00:03:49.290> or<00:03:49.680> time

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
equipped with these TTI's or time

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.789 
equipped with these TTI's or time
temperature<00:03:51.000> indicators<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.709> would

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
temperature indicators and that would

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.949 
temperature indicators and that would
let<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.099> consumer<00:03:53.519> know<00:03:53.700> if<00:03:54.299> it's<00:03:54.569> reaching

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
let it consumer know if it's reaching

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.349 
let it consumer know if it's reaching
its<00:03:55.109> shelf-life<00:03:55.530> or<00:03:56.130> or<00:03:56.730> beyond<00:03:59.180> basically<00:04:00.180> it

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
its shelf-life or or beyond basically it

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.589 
its shelf-life or or beyond basically it
starts<00:04:00.720> out<00:04:00.930> with<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:02.430> reference<00:04:03.030> ring<00:04:03.299> and

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
starts out with a a reference ring and

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.530 
starts out with a a reference ring and
refresh<00:04:03.959> with<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> bright<00:04:04.950> Center<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.579> then<00:04:06.389> it

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
refresh with a bright Center and then it

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.080 
refresh with a bright Center and then it
