we'll<00:02:04.290> dive<00:02:04.469> into<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.860> software<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.640> droid<00:02:06.149> 3

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360

which is I guess the newest version of
Android<00:02:11.430> that's<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.940> be<00:02:12.000> coming<00:02:12.180> to

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
about a thousand even though with all

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.550 
about a thousand even though with all
that<00:06:19.090> overclocking<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:19.960> stuff<00:06:20.110> I<00:06:20.200> try<00:06:20.350> to<00:06:20.380> do

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.900 
battery for especially since I love
using<00:07:47.050> the<00:07:47.289> camera<00:07:47.470> and<00:07:47.770> the<00:07:47.830> camera<00:07:47.860> kills<00:07:48.580> it

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.740 
using the camera and the camera kills it
I<00:07:49.680> definitely<00:07:50.680> the<00:07:50.860> dual<00:07:51.100> core<00:07:51.430> isn't<00:07:51.850> the

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:52.750 
I definitely the dual core isn't the

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.020 
I definitely the dual core isn't the
best<00:07:52.990> helper<00:07:53.560> with<00:07:53.830> this<00:07:54.039> actually<00:07:54.880> I<00:07:54.970> just

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.030 
best helper with this actually I just

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.200 
best helper with this actually I just
took<00:07:55.570> the<00:07:55.750> phone<00:07:55.930> off<00:07:56.200> the<00:07:56.260> charger<00:07:57.210> and

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.210 
took the phone off the charger and

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.210 
took the phone off the charger and
before<00:07:58.539> starting<00:07:58.900> this<00:07:58.990> review<00:07:59.380> and<00:07:59.680> I

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:00.220 
before starting this review and I

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.909 
before starting this review and I
already<00:08:01.120> lost<00:08:01.450> some<00:08:01.780> percentage<00:08:02.470> which<00:08:02.740> is

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 
already lost some percentage which is

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:05.070 
already lost some percentage which is
pretty<00:08:03.220> annoying<00:08:03.610> because<00:08:04.450> it's<00:08:04.690> really<00:08:04.990> only

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 
pretty annoying because it's really only
