00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.460 

it's<00:04:25.730> a<00:04:25.790> shame<00:04:26.000> that<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.210> it's<00:04:26.840> really<00:04:27.230> meant

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
it's a shame that that it's really meant

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.189 
it's a shame that that it's really meant
for<00:04:27.740> player<00:04:28.040> co-op<00:04:28.310> so<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.600> only<00:04:29.780> move<00:04:30.020> one

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
for player co-op so you only move one

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.170 
for player co-op so you only move one
character<00:04:30.680> at<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.919> time<00:04:30.949> I'll<00:04:31.280> have<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:31.910> switch

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
character at a time I'll have to switch

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.750 
character at a time I'll have to switch
out<00:04:32.440> which<00:04:33.440> isn't<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.770> really<00:04:33.919> big<00:04:34.160> deal<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.520> me

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
out which isn't a really big deal to me

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.250 
out which isn't a really big deal to me
but<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.060> could<00:04:35.240> see<00:04:35.419> how<00:04:35.540> some<00:04:35.780> people<00:04:35.810> might

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
but I could see how some people might

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:51.690 
but I could see how some people might
find<00:04:36.470> it<00:04:36.650> annoying
