 when one must behave well and in the world with lacie 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.789
 and this says it from 1400 years ago 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.170
 and he taught all the boys that before the care of the body the riches 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.669
 vanity and women care about virtue 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.560
 to see inside grow 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.840
 and to know what is the roche from which all beauties were born 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.000
 and he went around asking questions, he was a great man, even funny 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.280

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.510

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.100

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.900
 then he went around telling to see the research and its truth 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.270
 but I can't find anyone who told me how things were until I arrived at 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.270
 pigs 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.230
 the politicians unmasked them because they exposed them because 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.330
 the politicians noticed with his questions with the update that he didn't 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.400
 they knew nothing 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.050
 and then one of those politicians fearing to be put in difficulty 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.480
 he decided to kill him 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.380
 established a process 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.410
 anyway all to get me to vote against socrates 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.159

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.979

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.030
 and the death penalty can sometimes kill people as well as other people 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.750
 life and lyon. always wants 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.900
 and then what happened to this darkness with wolf to all the judges 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.030
 he had a vote for the death sentence of Socrates 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.270
 even one of the people for whom as big as boh all the clouds of 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.030
 heaven and all the oceans of the world 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.510
 and then so he made a speech 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.890
 he said I don't want to run away his friends wanted him to run away but not me 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.580
 he said he should never do an injustice even when you say it 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.150
 what text is an injustice rome commessa go for principle 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.300
 he under those fashion legislation then thrived you laundry and your daughter didn't 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.980
 he wanted him to break with the lynx 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.950
 even when you make time you will have to perform because those would be 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.210
 behaved by bologna 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.490
 and then I will not be afraid even of death because the hall behaved a lot 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.520
 well 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.450
 there was a person who loved life very much before he went to his 6'11 death 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.769
 these words 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.519
 well such judges must also have good hopes before the 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.389
 death 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.800
 and you have to think 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.059
 one thing 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.029
 particularly 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:26.059
 who has a good person 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:28.629
 nothing bad can happen 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:29.750
 in life 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.069
 in the world 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.779
 the things that concern him are not neglected by God 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.039
 and if you say 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.229
 that I cleaned you up 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:44.149
 because I have caused pains to come by dreaming by teaching your children 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:48.239
 to take care of virtue before riches and then ask for the virtue that 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.099
 all riches are born all good for all men in private in 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.089
 public 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.879
 do so outside with my children when they become adults 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.449
 unite and bring them the same pains that I got dark if yes 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.879
 they will take care of the riches of vanity 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.379
 before that of virtue 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.940
 they will think they are worth something while in reality they are not worth anything 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.169
 scolded 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.799
 if you do this 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.159
 you will have done me justice to me and my children 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.889
 but the time has now come to go I have to die and you to live 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.509
 but who of us goes towards what is better 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.040
 eures ass everyone 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.330
