for<00:01:23.250> all<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.430> us<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:25.250> don't<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.549> whether<00:01:26.700> you

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
for all of us I don't know whether you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.789 
for all of us I don't know whether you
know<00:01:27.090> you're<00:01:27.659> aware<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.110> fact<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.439> was<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
know you're aware the fact that was the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.090 
know you're aware the fact that was the
longest<00:01:29.630> cut<00:01:30.630> run<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.409> get<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.710> Wembley<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
longest cut run to get to Wembley I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.120 
longest cut run to get to Wembley I
think<00:01:32.340> there's<00:01:32.490> 11<00:01:32.759> games<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.659> Wembley

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
think there's 11 games to get to Wembley

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.380 
think there's 11 games to get to Wembley
as<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> longest<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.670> history<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.150> fact

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
as the longest in history and in fact

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.270 
as the longest in history and in fact
it'll<00:01:36.960> never<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.200> equaled<00:01:37.680> now<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:38.130> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
it'll never be equaled now because of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.280 
it'll never be equaled now because of
the<00:01:38.460> changes<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> game<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.960> know<00:01:40.079> not

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the changes in the game you know not

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.859 
the changes in the game you know not

through from the reserve side so I had

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.430 
through from the reserve side so I had
quite<00:02:08.550> an<00:02:08.700> input<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.119> respect<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:09.929> as

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
quite an input in that respect but as

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
the cup had started and I was up there

the cup had started and I was up there
and<00:02:40.370> Alec<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.610> went<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.060> middle<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
and Alec and I went to the middle of the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.950 
and Alec and I went to the middle of the
pitch<00:02:42.600> all<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.900> stock<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:44.210> Bob<00:02:45.210> Stoker<00:02:45.570> came

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
out and they'd been to Wembley I think

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.170

was<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.330> year<00:02:48.570> before<00:02:48.630> or<00:02:49.110> two<00:02:49.320> years<00:02:49.590> before

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
and all that was saying he was a lovely

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.920 
and all that was saying he was a lovely
man<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.690> spoke<00:02:55.050> very<00:02:55.320> nicely<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.910> he<00:02:57.090> said<00:02:57.360> to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
man and spoke very nicely and he said to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.590 
man and spoke very nicely and he said to
Bob<00:02:58.140> I've<00:02:58.860> got<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> feeling<00:02:59.490> Bob<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.970> we<00:03:00.420> could

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
Bob I've got a feeling Bob that we could

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.890 
Bob I've got a feeling Bob that we could
go<00:03:00.780> all<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.050> way<00:03:01.080> this<00:03:01.410> year<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.360> thought<00:03:03.600> I

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
go all the way this year and I thought I

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.500 
go all the way this year and I thought I
just<00:03:04.350> stopped<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:04.860> look<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.250> thought<00:03:05.520> he

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
just stopped to look and I thought he

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.510 
just stopped to look and I thought he
must<00:03:06.660> be<00:03:06.840> drunk<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.950> think<00:03:08.190> we've<00:03:08.370> got<00:03:08.490> a

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
must be drunk so I think we've got a

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.330 
must be drunk so I think we've got a
chance<00:03:08.610> they've<00:03:09.060> got<00:03:09.270> everybody<00:03:09.690> was<00:03:10.050> right

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
chance they've got everybody was right

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.670 
chance they've got everybody was right
but<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.400> boys<00:03:11.670> are<00:03:11.880> not<00:03:11.970> nervous

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
but the boys are not nervous

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.830 
but the boys are not nervous

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
really well that day I thought we'd

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.690 
really well that day I thought we'd
blown<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.650> because<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.190> don't<00:04:17.400> think<00:04:17.520> we<00:04:17.609> could

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
blown it because I don't think we could

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.940 
blown it because I don't think we could
have<00:04:17.790> played<00:04:17.940> any<00:04:18.120> bout<00:04:18.390> but<00:04:19.109> John<00:04:19.650> Mitchell

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
have played any bout but John Mitchell

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.830 
have played any bout but John Mitchell
