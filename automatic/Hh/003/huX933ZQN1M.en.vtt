00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.950
 That's Harald gets tonight 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.410
 Visits his visitors have in the aroma 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.070
 dissolve reason becomes more of a proven 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.270
 make bread what we need to know 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.859
 bread butter sausage cheese eggs and 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.270
 Delikatess Coop looks so nice 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.010
 fresh tomatoes 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.189
 First you need a stop 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.869
 Workplace best if wood leaves that 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.760
 easy to clean and when things do 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.700
 it's environmentally friendly too 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.170
 but now dispose of the bread to the bread 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.040
 gets in a sharp knife in 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.040
 Sliced 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.390
 and because you can see that so fast 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.390
 that again very slowly 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.320
 so that the plate with the bun too 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.739
 Harald has nice looks 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.860
 black favorite parts prepared there 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.590
 then comes the finished bread on it as 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.210
 Next with the bread while not beating 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:09.580
 Gently use the knife like the butter 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.580
 Apply a thin layer to the embassy 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.350
 then howls out of the cheese warehouse 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.570
 quickly two slices first 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.330
 French emmentaler and lays them down 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.210
 Where the bread 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.550
 Next comes the sausage Harald has 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.800
 from the sausage saleswoman a whole 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.860
 fine piece worried then carefully 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.830
 cut small slices 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.030
 I told you carefully since a 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.650
 little leprechaun 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.060
 but that does not matter harald has 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.640
 quickly connected the hand 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.290
 the guests will come soon with it 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:58.410
 does not even hurt now gets a 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:02:00.899
 small knife around the bun well now 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.240
 to be able to garnish must cook hard 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.070
 you have to become a fruit card 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.100
 stay in the hot water for seven minutes 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.709
 My hair is always too soft 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.959
 this time an experiment chord several 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.320
 Check eggs every minute 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:21.480
 can whether they are tough enough to 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.670
 once to do water and wait and wait 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.010
 waiting 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.700
 Now it's time for the first egg 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.530
 to take the pot important first 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.489
 it will deter you from the shell 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.390
 easier going but not so 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.060
 Shaking off harald means eggs 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.100
 Carefully put in cold water 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.840
 hard now meets a gentleman and 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.260
 check whether is hard that is 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.260
 still not there 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:05.600
 I do not think that too slow 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:06.350
 but still too soft that I already do 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.840
 very good 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.790
 Of course, at that time one egg cooked more 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.480
 I take that out so that the guests too 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:19.819
 A clean Elbe was careful 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.870
 Peel very carefully then measure 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.150
 wash 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.930
 and slice alone on yes 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.570
 Exactly and so that looks very much 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.100
 Delicious, is not it ? 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:37.360
 a bit still decorate one 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.490
 cucumber out that no cucumber bit too 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.430
 large 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:46.000
 a telescope and now guests can 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.020
 come 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.450
 gell harald you can all that 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.350
 of course, at home quite simply 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.810
 to cook 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.460
 that suits every occasion and tastes 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.460
 big and small
