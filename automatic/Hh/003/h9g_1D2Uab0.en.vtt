00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.270
 in this tutorial I will realize this 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.870
 animation that is composed of two 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:18.470
 movements of the girl pedaling and 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.720
 the movement on your bike for the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.259
 movement of the girl pedaling already 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.860
 I have each movement separated in 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:31.700
 images and the background so we'll go to 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:36.740
 flash to create the new file 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.220
 I will use html5 in the first layer to place 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.220
 the bottom 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.050
 then import the images that I have 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.590
 lists to the library 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.930
 it does not matter the library 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.930
 I add the images that I have ready 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.640
 I do not pass them to the library then 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.190
 place the background in the background layer 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.190
 I'll leave it a thousand 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.350
 340 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.900
 and I'm going to modify the document 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.970
 Amen 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.970
 x 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.970
 380 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.350
 380 for 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.350
 in a new layer draw the roads 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.610
 then draw a road 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.610
 where the animation will go 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.010
 ready to block these layers and what I'll do 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.990
 is to create a new layer 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.990
 for the animation of the bicycle 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.690
 and here 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.300
 Add 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.300
 the first movement of the girl 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.390
 it does not matter that the girl looks like this leaves 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.990
 for now we will leave it like this we will convert 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.380
 this in a symbol with the f key 8 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.740
 any name and we leave it 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.990
 click type of movie 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.990
 we enter the symbol with double click 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.390
 and layer 1 of the symbol would be the 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:43.620
 movement 1 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.630
 by movement we will leave you 5 seconds 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.630
 and we will add a new layer 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.330
 in the next frame from the 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.200
 ending movement one will begin 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.200
 movement 2 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.940
 we will insert in that frame a 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.750
 keyframe in which the 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.750
 next movement 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.790
 we should note that the position of the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.400
 picture matches this plus symbol 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.500
 that we see here because it is the position of 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.800
 previous movement 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.300
 We will leave you 5 seconds and create a 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.870
 new layer 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.170
 we repeat this with the following 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.170
 movement 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.230
 we leave it right in the most 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.230
 we leave you 5 seconds 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.730
 new layer a movement 3 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.999
 movement 4 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.970
 insert keyframe we drag the 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.490
 next movement in it 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.140
 position 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.140
 we leave 5 seconds 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.410
 we drag the movement 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.470
 the same 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.520
 5 seconds 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.380
 6 movement that would be the movement 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.650
 final we leave you the 5 seconds 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.860
 and we can reproduce the movement of the 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.319
 girl 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.840
 we close the symbol returning to the 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.670
 scene 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.230
 Y 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:04.689
 What we will do now is resize 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.779
 the girl 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:10.229
 to get a more suitable size more 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:10.229
 normal 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:17.030
 control t 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.390
 we can go looking at the advances 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.030
 and as we see the girl is pedaling in 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.060
 the same static place lacks its 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.190
 displacement movement but already 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.370
 we have the movement of the symbol as 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.370
 such 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.050
 what we will do is displacement of 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.230
 she by the road 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.440
 we will leave 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.160
 and go 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:47.289
 up to 60 frames move to the 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.830
 another corner and greece 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:53.529
 then I will give right click to our 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.409
 symbol and we will create an interpolation 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:59.540
 of the movement 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:02.870
 until frame 60 she will go 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:07.600
 to the other shore so in this 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.600
 frame will arrive here 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:16.560
 and in this next frame 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:19.560
 we will insert blank frame 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:23.569
 and from the previous frame we will copy the 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.050
 symbol we will stick it on this one 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:29.370
 in edition 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:33.220
 paste in the same place we will give 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.700
 modify transform flip 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:40.450
 horizontally 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:43.450
 from this frame to frame number 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.450
 120 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.190
 she will be returned 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.190
 where was he 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:58.580
 so in this frame she 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.580
 will move here 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:11.729
 in the first frame let's leave it from 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.660
 the start of the fund so you can make your 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:16.810
 full movement 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.830
 as we see after the number frame 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:23.320
 1 the road and the background are no longer visible 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:28.230
 so we will unlock them and what 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:30.569
 we will do is in frame 120 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:33.449
 insert a frame 

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:36.630
 now the road is seen as with 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:40.730
 the background will be in the background 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.730
 control inter to see the changes 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.800
 and as we see the girl performs her 

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:52.230
 displacement 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:57.200
 and we achieved our animation 

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:57.200
 and I hope it serves you thank you
