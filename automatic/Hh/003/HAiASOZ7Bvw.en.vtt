00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:57.360 
in or rather I blended the black into
itself<00:06:50.589> so<00:06:52.319> now<00:06:53.319> we<00:06:53.379> have<00:06:53.710> Umbreon<00:06:54.249> and<00:06:56.370> I'm

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
itself so now we have Umbreon and I'm

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.850 
itself so now we have Umbreon and I'm
just<00:06:57.580> making<00:06:58.029> a<00:06:58.089> little<00:06:58.629> bit<00:06:58.779> of<00:06:59.199> area<00:07:01.860> where

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
just making a little bit of area where

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:10.860 
just making a little bit of area where
Umbreon<00:07:03.729> is<00:07:06.360> crossing<00:07:09.089> so<00:07:10.089> there<00:07:10.539> you<00:07:10.659> go

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
Umbreon is crossing so there you go

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.839 
Umbreon is crossing so there you go
let's<00:07:11.409> zoom<00:07:12.069> in<00:07:12.309> on<00:07:12.339> it
