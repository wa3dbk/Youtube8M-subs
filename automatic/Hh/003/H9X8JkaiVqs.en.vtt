00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.560 
explode this three way med ball reach I
think<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> best<00:01:14.700> exercises<00:01:15.299> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
think is one of the best exercises you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.780 
think is one of the best exercises you
can<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.200> posterior<00:01:16.830> chain<00:01:17.130> which

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
can do for your posterior chain which

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.640 
can do for your posterior chain which
includes<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.450> glutes<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.930> hamstrings

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
includes your glutes your hamstrings

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.010 
includes your glutes your hamstrings
your<00:01:19.950> calves<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.700> even<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.119> back<00:01:21.299> extensors

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
your calves and even your back extensors

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.660 
your calves and even your back extensors

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.359 
ball so the movements will be exactly
the<00:01:40.290> same<00:01:40.350> you'll<00:01:40.650> hold<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> way<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.189> two

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the same you'll hold the way with two

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.760 
the same you'll hold the way with two
hands<00:01:41.790> you'll<00:01:42.420> reach<00:01:42.750> forward<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.409> I'm<00:01:43.500> trying

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
hands you'll reach forward so I'm trying

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.310 
hands you'll reach forward so I'm trying
to<00:01:43.860> reach<00:01:44.040> right<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> camera<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
to reach right to the camera with the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.620 
to reach right to the camera with the
ball<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.090> come<00:01:48.329> forward

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
ball and as I do that as I come forward

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.999 
ball and as I do that as I come forward
with<00:01:48.780> my<00:01:48.930> torso<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.979> leg<00:01:50.250> comes<00:01:50.640> out<00:01:51.680> behind<00:01:52.680> me

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
with my torso my leg comes out behind me

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.030 
with my torso my leg comes out behind me
so<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.579> all<00:01:53.850> moves<00:01:54.290> at<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.500> same<00:01:55.740> time

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
so it all moves at the same time

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.100 
so it all moves at the same time
reaching<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.610> far<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.990> that's

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
reaching as far as I can so that's

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.810 
reaching as far as I can so that's

come back in without side bending it all

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.449 
come back in without side bending it all
back<00:03:11.750> out<00:03:12.019> again<00:03:14.140> try<00:03:15.140> not<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.590> touch<00:03:15.769> down<00:03:15.830> in

back out again try not to touch down in

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.690 
back out again try not to touch down in
between<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.989> do<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.590> shift<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:19.250> little

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
between so you do have to shift a little

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.880 
between so you do have to shift a little
bit<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.150> your<00:03:20.450> weight<00:03:20.630> is<00:03:20.810> over<00:03:21.500> these<00:03:21.620> I

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
bit so that your weight is over these I

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.920 
bit so that your weight is over these I
can't<00:03:22.130> just<00:03:22.370> be<00:03:22.640> here<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:22.940> hold<00:03:23.329> myself<00:03:23.510> up

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
can't just be here and hold myself up

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.750 
can't just be here and hold myself up
it's<00:03:24.170> impossible<00:03:24.890> so<00:03:25.040> there<00:03:25.190> does<00:03:25.400> have<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.670> be

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
it's impossible so there does have to be

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.880 
it's impossible so there does have to be
a<00:03:25.880> little<00:03:26.030> shift<00:03:26.450> but<00:03:27.230> once<00:03:27.380> you've<00:03:27.530> made<00:03:27.680> that

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
a little shift but once you've made that

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.360 
a little shift but once you've made that
shift<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.340> want<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.670> stay<00:03:29.590> stable<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.799> that

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
shift you want to stay stable in that

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.920 
shift you want to stay stable in that
position<00:03:31.579> you<00:03:32.000> don't<00:03:32.090> want<00:03:32.269> to<00:03:32.329> be<00:03:32.390> opening<00:03:32.810> up

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.199 
position you don't want to be opening up
your<00:03:33.650> hips<00:03:33.890> it's<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.489> really<00:03:34.700> tricky<00:03:34.940> one<00:03:35.180> and

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
your hips it's a really tricky one and

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.560 
your hips it's a really tricky one and
be<00:03:35.390> patient<00:03:35.600> with<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:35.930> you'll<00:03:36.170> get<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.410> hang
