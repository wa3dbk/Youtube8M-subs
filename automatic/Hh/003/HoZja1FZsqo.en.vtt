00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.460
 Hi, I'm happy when I was flying in Hanoi. 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.850
 today we are going to do 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.850
 other 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.140
 these rooms 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.300
 35 are in trans are the knitting seams 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.090
 allow me to call 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.970
 behind the coats on the 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:34.600
 sagas behind the skirts and dresses for 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:38.800
 enter here a son and a point and and you 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:42.190
 there a seam in each letter that 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:49.540
 which is more imperceptible than 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:52.839
 pool is a continuous major point plan 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:58.510
 although the back side we got 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:01:00.070
 realize where we stand for 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.960
 get a seam 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.850
 Why does she have to be a daughter here? 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.190
 another is very important when we are 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.409
 running left behind I will not 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.729
 our of our thinks is that the wedding 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.240
 It is not very simple and we will try to do 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.100
 our tiredness 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.850
 Look here have two taxed samples 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.370
 and I want to sew them from the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.390
 lateral seam began this lateral seam of 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.180
 a coat 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.010
 so I left the side this 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:35.080
 finish can see here 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.000
 this is also normal for 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.680
 to do this would be to use the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.810
 same line completes the team 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.670
 in this case that our and with 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.800
 iraq yellow wire because that is 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.390
 the easier it is to perceive 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.310
 Where is he going to go? 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.380
 I have my needle to mine. 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.600
 leave here on the left and I'm going now 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.060
 take my sample from the side here 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:03.090
 right and I'm going to pick up this first one 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:06.899
 do not join 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.080
 now I'm going to focus on my two samples 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.720
 and you have to open here the stitching to the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.200
 end with cheer to make sure that 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.970
 I take it here unopar that here the little thing 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:24.150
 and on the inside of the note he two 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.250
 horizontal lines is not so 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.900
 and it's these lines that I'm going to win and 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.440
 I'm going to put my needle down for 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:36.269
 Up and now I'm going to open here. 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.640
 show the right side and I'll do 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.569
 exactly the same thing therefore I have 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.879
 here the knot 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:50.310
 I'll get the two of you, but I have mine. 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:57.900
 spoon from the bottom up exactly to the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:03:02.940
 side of the knot and now I'm going back to the side 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.500
 left the same thing to have a node and 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.680
 I'm going to introduce my needle here. 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:14.340
 which always take 2-1 horizontal 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:24.510
 holder for and now I'm going back there to have 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:28.920
 said the same node report and now when 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:33.359
 we see that the two samples are 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:39.389
 together and is practically imperceptible 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:40.700
 we go here again our point knot that 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.700
 around here 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.700
 tested 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.230
 we have to make sure that I have my 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.630
 father because the plus point the trend is 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.490
 regular 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.100
 then with the help of our rights 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.580
 We have side scrolling kits for 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.350
 make sure we catch and do not 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:12.050
 there caught this last queue 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:18.890
 points that we get only the youngest years 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:21.470
 going forward when we put together 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.440
 when we pull our line 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.180
 we can see who sewing is 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.060
 practically in perspective 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.590
 we see here a queue point that another 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.990
 stay united and in reverse 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:41.000
 we stayed here with these new nests 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.160
 the bottom of the seam with 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.870
 a technique for these practical postures 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.970
 has no prospects is nothing 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.950
 very important not to forget 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.560
 to leave the wedding the young and 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.260
 dedicate some time love and affection to 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.320
 our playgrounds and you 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.450
 seams are usually used with all 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.970

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.140
 have not yet done to us that we know 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.460
 some very special surprises to 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.980
 the subscribers

 I'll be back next week with one more. 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.440
 adventure that we criticized 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.440
 until then 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:27.580
