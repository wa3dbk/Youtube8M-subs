what<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.810> used<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.470> consider<00:03:25.830> my<00:03:26.070> protein

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
what I used to consider my protein

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.280 
what I used to consider my protein
treatment<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.180> would<00:03:27.269> only<00:03:27.510> use<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.959> once<00:03:28.170> a

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
treatment I would only use it once a

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.890 
treatment I would only use it once a
month<00:03:28.320> well<00:03:29.160> since<00:03:29.640> I've<00:03:29.790> had<00:03:29.940> my<00:03:30.000> setback<00:03:30.660> I

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
month well since I've had my setback I

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.020 
month well since I've had my setback I
am<00:03:31.019> now<00:03:31.200> using<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.799> as<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> deep<00:03:32.430> conditioner

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
am now using it as a deep conditioner

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.690 
am now using it as a deep conditioner
and<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.360> use<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.600> twice<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.440> month<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.950> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
and I use it twice a month and the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.729 
and I use it twice a month and the
reason<00:03:35.970> why<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.090> do<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.329> is<00:03:36.570> because<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.590> a

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
reason why I do that is because it is a

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.460 
reason why I do that is because it is a
very<00:03:38.220> strong<00:03:38.790> protein<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:39.989> feel<00:03:40.260> like

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
very strong protein and I feel like

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.030 
very strong protein and I feel like
right<00:03:40.709> now<00:03:40.739> my<00:03:41.250> hair<00:03:41.489> needs<00:03:42.590> protein<00:03:43.590> some

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
right now my hair needs protein some

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.990 
right now my hair needs protein some
hardcore<00:03:44.870> protein<00:03:45.870> okay<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.579> definitely

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
hardcore protein okay so this definitely

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.060 
hardcore protein okay so this definitely
strengthens<00:03:48.900> my<00:03:49.019> hair<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.620> gives<00:03:49.799> me<00:03:49.890> the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
strengthens my hair and it gives me the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
protein I need no offense to the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.740 
protein I need no offense to the
replenishing<00:03:53.070> conditioner<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.880> love<00:03:54.510> that
