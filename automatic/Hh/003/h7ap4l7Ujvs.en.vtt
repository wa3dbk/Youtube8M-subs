00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
I can't zoom away any further than this

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.839 
I can't zoom away any further than this
on<00:00:05.730> my<00:00:05.850> phone<00:00:06.089> but<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.020> piece<00:00:07.410> was<00:00:07.620> there

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
on my phone but that piece was there

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.250 
on my phone but that piece was there
it's<00:00:08.849> all<00:00:09.030> broken<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> metal<00:00:10.080> piece

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
it's all broken this is a metal piece

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.640 
it's all broken this is a metal piece
here<00:00:10.620> but<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.759> whole<00:00:11.969> piece<00:00:12.380> see<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.530> all

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
here but this whole piece see it all

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.080 
here but this whole piece see it all
comes<00:00:13.889> up<00:00:15.170> so<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.560> don't<00:00:17.279> know<00:00:17.460> how<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.609> get<00:00:17.730> it

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
comes up so I don't know how I get it

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.590 
comes up so I don't know how I get it
out<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.390> here<00:00:18.690> exactly<00:00:19.310> how<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.340> would<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.480> know

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
out of here exactly how I would you know

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.480 
out of here exactly how I would you know
yank<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.020> out<00:00:22.199> I'm<00:00:22.439> sure<00:00:22.710> they're<00:00:22.890> screws<00:00:23.220> or

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
yank it out I'm sure they're screws or

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.689 
yank it out I'm sure they're screws or
something<00:00:24.350> but<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.529> material<00:00:26.189> here<00:00:26.490> would

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
something but this material here would

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.179 
something but this material here would
obviously<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.619> it<00:00:28.619> would<00:00:28.740> slip<00:00:29.010> off

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
obviously have to be it would slip off

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.890 
obviously have to be it would slip off
of<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.550> guess<00:00:29.820> yeah<00:00:30.119> slip<00:00:30.420> out<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.750> way

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
of here I guess yeah slip out that way

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.170 
of here I guess yeah slip out that way
but<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.830> want<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> build<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.460> box<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.940> kind<00:00:33.120> of

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
but I want to build a box that kind of

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.900 
but I want to build a box that kind of
goes<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.500> right<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.829> here<00:00:34.910> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
goes you know to right about here you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.740 
goes you know to right about here you
know<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.090> needs<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> exact<00:00:36.719> same

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
know it needs to be the exact same

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.090 
know it needs to be the exact same
height<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.350> because<00:00:37.500> I'm<00:00:37.590> used<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.920> for

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
height just because I'm used to that for

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.069 
height just because I'm used to that for
six<00:00:38.340> seven<00:00:38.489> years<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.780> could<00:00:39.930> maybe

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
six seven years but and I could maybe

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.840 
six seven years but and I could maybe
get<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.320> generic<00:00:40.710> piece<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.370> around<00:00:41.670> this

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
get a generic piece to go around this

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.900 
get a generic piece to go around this
area<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.780> sits<00:00:43.110> around<00:00:43.200> that

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
area that just sits around that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090 
area that just sits around that
let's<00:00:45.690> see<00:00:45.809> these<00:00:45.960> cup<00:00:46.170> holders<00:00:46.200> suck<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.950> mean

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
let's see these cup holders suck I mean

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
let's see these cup holders suck I mean
they're<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.489> tiny<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.180> mean<00:00:48.809> they're<00:00:49.020> just

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
they're so tiny I mean they're just

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.279 
they're so tiny I mean they're just
they're<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.520> top<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.079> this<00:00:52.079> one

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
they're in and on top of that this one

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.310 
they're in and on top of that this one
goes<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.610> cups<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.600> an<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.140> like

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
goes here the cups have like an it like

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.959 
goes here the cups have like an it like
you<00:00:55.649> can't<00:00:55.829> even<00:00:55.949> put<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> glass<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
you can't even put a glass there it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.689 
you can't even put a glass there it
doesn't<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.300> hits<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.010> use<00:00:59.370> all<00:00:59.520> my

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
doesn't it hits this so I use all my

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.170 
doesn't it hits this so I use all my
area<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.829> all<00:01:01.829> right<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.910> that's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
area here so all right that's a that's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.350 
area here so all right that's a that's
ears<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.870> piece<00:01:04.110> taken<00:01:04.559> out<00:01:05.360> obviously

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
ears with that piece taken out obviously

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.719 
ears with that piece taken out obviously
all<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.510> would<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.049> covered<00:01:07.760> but<00:01:08.760> I

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
all that would have to be covered but I

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.039 
all that would have to be covered but I
didn't<00:01:11.729> break<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.390> can't<00:01:12.659> put<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.930> back

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
didn't break it so I can't put it back

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.230 
didn't break it so I can't put it back
on<00:01:13.200> probably<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> was<00:01:14.909> thinking<00:01:15.150> about

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
on probably but I was thinking about

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
on probably but I was thinking about
just<00:01:15.960> cutting<00:01:16.259> from<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.070> making<00:01:17.310> that

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
just cutting from here and making that

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.870 
just cutting from here and making that
wood<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.970> rest<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.420> would<00:01:18.689> probably<00:01:19.049> be

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
wood the rest of this would probably be

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.670 
wood the rest of this would probably be
harder<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.540> harder<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.900> find<00:01:22.229> something<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
harder to be harder to find something to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.359 
harder to be harder to find something to
match<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.490> there<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:24.920> mean<00:01:25.920> maybe<00:01:26.310> not

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
match that right there I mean maybe not

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.190 
match that right there I mean maybe not
wood<00:01:26.670> wise<00:01:26.880> would<00:01:27.090> probably<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.630> hard<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.960> find

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
wood wise would probably be hard to find

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.749 
wood wise would probably be hard to find
like<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.439> plastic<00:01:28.860> piece<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.100> go<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:30.560> so

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
like a plastic piece that go on there so

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.100 
like a plastic piece that go on there so
I'm<00:01:32.759> gonna<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.299> measurements<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
I'm gonna have the measurements for the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.880 
I'm gonna have the measurements for the
most<00:01:34.350> part<00:01:34.880> okay<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:37.049> cut<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.470> piece<00:01:37.680> off

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
most part okay I just cut this piece off

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.069 
most part okay I just cut this piece off
here<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.310> pretty<00:01:38.520> straight<00:01:38.990> they're<00:01:39.990> gonna

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
here it's pretty straight they're gonna

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.080 
here it's pretty straight they're gonna
go<00:01:40.320> right<00:01:40.530> back<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.490> front<00:01:41.670> part<00:01:42.000> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
go right back on to that front part I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.460 
go right back on to that front part I
think<00:01:42.299> it'd<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.420> too<00:01:42.600> hard<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.840> build<00:01:42.990> wood<00:01:43.290> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
think it'd be too hard to build wood to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.980 
think it'd be too hard to build wood to
cover<00:01:43.680> up<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.220> fronts<00:01:44.759> now<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.810> just

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
cover up all that fronts now I can just

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.319 
cover up all that fronts now I can just
mess<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> back<00:01:46.619> piece<00:01:46.950> put<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.119> there

where you attach it to a bolt and then

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.170 
where you attach it to a bolt and then
screw<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.140> other<00:02:43.260> thread<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.040> other<00:02:44.180> end

screw the other thread the other end

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.729 
screw the other thread the other end
into<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.629> that<00:02:45.750> way<00:02:45.840> they<00:02:45.989> come<00:02:46.200> up<00:02:46.349> over<00:02:46.590> here

and I can pull them down to one piece

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.780
