00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.860
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.410
 web video repair yourself in this 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.389
 case the video is dedicated to a 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.930
 desktop phone that we can 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.849
 have wireless home the same 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.000
 due to the daily use the buttons 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.950
 they pick up dirt or grease and even if we push 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.380
 the same 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.880
 they do not work 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.010
 we must press strongly mcnair strongly 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.350
 for the button to respond I'm going to 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.030
 proceed to disassemble the terminal to 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.239
 clean the keyboard and you will see how it 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.239
 make 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.920
 first of all 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.920
 we take out the battery compartment 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.630
 this as it has already been disassembled in other 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.640
 occasions 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.530
 the location of the screws is already 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.900
 located but below the sticker 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.640
 what can you find? 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.230
 locate where the screws are 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.460
 for disassembly 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.460
 let's make the two screws 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.360
 we proceed to go dismantling the terminal 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.670
 gradually opening it will go 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.409
 let's see going carefully 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.409
 separating the two halves 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.510
 we have the keyboard on one side and here 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.510
 the plate and how we can observe 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.359
 keyboard 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.939
 It has traces of moisture and remains of 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.649
 fat this simply occurs from 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.890
 when we approach the terminal to the 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.110
 we support him himself 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.250
 perspiring dirt or grease 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.440
 and passed to the bottom 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.800
 fouling the part of the circuit 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.800
 reverse 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.910
 It will not matter if you have to disassemble more 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.280
 parts of it this part will clean it 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.580
 with a rag and with alcohol and this one 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.710
 part 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.300
 I will proceed to clean it 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.600
 under the tap with soapy water and a 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.600
 brush 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.349
 for cleaning the keyboard 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.129
 we will simply use a bit of 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.129
 dishwasher 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.799
 we put the keyboard under the tap 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.290
 we put a little dishwasher in the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.920
 overcome 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.209
 and carefully 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.050
 let's see the part of the rubber 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.050
 part of the contacts 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.260
 putting a little more emphasis on the 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.829
 part that we have seen that was 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.829
 mountain 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.730
 with more grease or dirt 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.730
 cumulative 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:22.220
 we clarify we will see you 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.220
 the side of the buttons 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.040
 and always carefully in case the rubber 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.040
 I will be past in the campaign for the same 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.790
 since I find a spare of this 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:43.140
 type and it's practically impossible since 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.140
 they are apparatuses to use entity 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.100
 but order let's lengthen them a bit 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.030
 life we are 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:56.590
 we already have our keyboard clean 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.590
 they will no longer be fat remnants 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.780
 we clarify well 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.210
 we proceed to dry it with some 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.210
 napkins 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.389
 and now 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.139
 We will send you the part of the plate with 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.139
 a little alcohol 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.940
 once well reviewed and dry the part 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.169
 of the keyboard that is not even a single 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.039
 note 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.979
 we proceed to clean the part of the 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:39.189
 copper tracks or the contacts of the 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:42.270
 electronic board that we will use a 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:45.249
 little alcohol to burn or alcohol from 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.860
 isopropyl of the wounds also we 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:50.539
 can serve 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.539
 and all we have to do is 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.120
 give a pass to the part of the 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.120
 contacts 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.060
 we leave well at the same 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.580
 and we proceed to reassemble our 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.580
 terminal 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.980
 we assemble the same carefully 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.500
 we put the two screws 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:01.829
 and we put the rechargeable batteries 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.310
 a terminal restarts 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.500
 the layer 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:22.839
 and as we can see 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.839
 already react without problems 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.950
 any pulsed we give him 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.740
 mainly to the call button that 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.390
 we failed at the beginning as you have 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.600
 seen a simple repair we can 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.760
 perform it in less than five minutes 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.370
 and that leaves the keyboard of 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.990
 our wireless terminal I hope that 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.790
 I can be of help and that you follow 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.790
 by visiting the web for yourself
