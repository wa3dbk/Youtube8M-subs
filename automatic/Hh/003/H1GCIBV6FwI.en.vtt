00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.310
 let's see in this lesson how to use the existing conformation libraries 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.289
 in the design library 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.919
 the conforming libraries are located in the designer library in the 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.849
 it was very honorable 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.710
 we suggest completing this class with the knowledge of the designer library 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.469
 shown in the course is of today that are of the mentor 2008 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.320
 in this model we will apply the tools with training on the phase 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.630
 boring 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.890
 we select the handkerchiefs folder where we see the tools available 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.410
 the application process and simplified the library away from the 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.039
 final location share 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.039
 and release the mouse button and apply the library 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.530
 today we can see learning from the resulting geometry 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.920
 icons of each tool has two coreys in red we have the phases that 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.399
 immaterial remove 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.869
 and yellows that define the shape of the final geometry 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.190
 please note that library members are not available to 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.190
 modification within the modern one where we are 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.740
 if it needs to be modified and must be done by having a library 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 we will see this in another class 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.410
 let's vote stock library squeeze activate the monte father command 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.160
 we have a value of 90 for the angle of rotation and we need even the inter 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.810
 see that the voting is carried out in a simple way in relation to the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.760
 skateboard 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760
 confirm the rotation by clicking the klose button 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.670
 we need to define a positioning using the tool in 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.710
 insanity 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.010
 mattheis ratifying set 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.220
 clicked on the completed button and we have the library applied on 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.540
 party says the minutes 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 see which command application is very fast and simple 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.250
 the editing of the library fitec is not allowed, being possible only with 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.140
 the highlights edition 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.659
 We have expanded the library 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 please note that we can only modify the placement dimensions 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.099
 we confirmed the edition of skateboard and to have updated geometry 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.999
 The impossibility of rita de cÃ¡ssia uti after being created allows the 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.289
 tools that it was before unauthorized modifications were made 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:30.859
 let's plan and boring disabling fifa suppression reflects technical 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.369
 you see that the library has not damaged the operations applied with 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:39.369
 the libraries are not considered fiat discarded so they are not 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.129
 damaged 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.199
 doubling again the annoyance we noticed that the geometry of the library continues 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.199
 same way 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.359
 we have seen in this lesson how to apply conformation libraries to 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.659
 streamline our modeling process in parts as we saw earlier
