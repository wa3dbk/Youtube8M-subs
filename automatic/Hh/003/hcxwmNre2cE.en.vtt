the<00:01:48.000> game<00:01:48.270> has<00:01:48.509> changed<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:49.140> far<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the game has changed as far as the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.260 
the game has changed as far as the
Heisman<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.040> concerned<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.759> think<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
Heisman is concerned and I think that

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.170 
Heisman is concerned and I think that
it's<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.540> quarter<00:01:51.899> maximum<00:01:52.380> award<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:53.939> it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it's a quarter maximum award in it if it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.639 
it's a quarter maximum award in it if it
doesn't<00:01:54.509> go<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.780> quarterback<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.380> got<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
doesn't go to a quarterback it's got to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.130 
doesn't go to a quarterback it's got to
go<00:01:55.710> go<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.159> guy<00:01:56.340> who<00:01:56.759> carries<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.240> ball<00:01:57.509> 30

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140

think he's gonna end up getting about

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.540 
think he's gonna end up getting about
because<00:02:21.710> they're<00:02:21.800> going<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.010> throw<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.370> ball

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
because they're going to throw the ball

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.580 
because they're going to throw the ball
a<00:02:22.580> lot<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.630> think<00:02:23.840> he's<00:02:24.050> only<00:02:24.170> going<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.500> get
