we're<00:00:01.020> here<00:00:01.140> at<00:00:01.230> vex<00:00:01.439> so<00:00:01.620> today<00:00:01.829> talking<00:00:02.220> with

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
we're here at vex so today talking with

we're here at vex so today talking with
Tom's<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:02.850> anko<00:00:03.149> we're<00:00:03.419> gonna<00:00:03.510> learn<00:00:03.600> the

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
Tom's and anko we're gonna learn the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.749 
Tom's and anko we're gonna learn the
differences<00:00:04.230> between<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.740> new<00:00:04.770> probe<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.520> do

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
differences between the new probe you do

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.330 
differences between the new probe you do
sir<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.480> try<00:00:06.720> beam

sir and the try beam
thanks<00:00:08.340> Matt<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.820> lot<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.510> people<00:00:09.840> had

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
thanks Matt a lot of people had

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.780 
thanks Matt a lot of people had
questions<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.710> last<00:00:10.920> time<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.190> did<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.429> bit<00:00:11.670> on

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
questions the last time I did a bit on

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.209 
questions the last time I did a bit on
transducers<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.840> actually<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.769> was<00:00:13.950> quite

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
transducers and actually I was quite

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.220 
transducers and actually I was quite
shocked<00:00:14.670> because<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.240> lot<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.719> people<00:00:16.049> have<00:00:16.199> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
shocked because a lot of people have a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.920 
shocked because a lot of people have a
lot<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.560> questions<00:00:17.160> about<00:00:17.750> transducers<00:00:18.750> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
lot of questions about transducers and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.840 
lot of questions about transducers and
how<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.260> help<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.770> catch<00:00:20.039> more<00:00:20.279> fish

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
how it can help you catch more fish

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.210 
how it can help you catch more fish
I<00:00:20.960> am<00:00:21.960> constantly<00:00:23.000> shocked<00:00:24.000> by<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.779> lack<00:00:25.140> of

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
I am constantly shocked by the lack of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.890 
I am constantly shocked by the lack of
information<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.369> there<00:00:26.430> about<00:00:26.900> transducers

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
information out there about transducers

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.400 
information out there about transducers
because<00:00:28.260> literally<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> transducer<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.820> 50%<00:00:30.750> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
because literally a transducer is 50% of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.470 
because literally a transducer is 50% of
your<00:00:31.500> ice-fishing<00:00:32.009> system<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.820> without

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
your ice-fishing system and without

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.450 
your ice-fishing system and without
taking<00:00:33.899> care<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.110> your<00:00:34.230> transducers<00:00:34.890> properly

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
taking care of your transducers properly

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.700 
taking care of your transducers properly
and<00:00:35.670> knowing<00:00:36.300> what<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> transducer<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.320> do<00:00:37.469> for

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and knowing what a transducer can do for

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.410 
and knowing what a transducer can do for
you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:38.309> drastically<00:00:38.700> change<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
you can drastically change the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
you can drastically change the
performance<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.200> system<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:41.250> i'm<00:00:41.399> going

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
performance of your system so i'm going

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.979 
performance of your system so i'm going
to<00:00:41.640> show<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.000> little<00:00:42.210> bit<00:00:42.329> all<00:00:42.570> i<00:00:42.600> had<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> lot

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
to show you a little bit all i had a lot

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.720 
to show you a little bit all i had a lot
of<00:00:43.020> questions<00:00:43.530> about<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.309> differences

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
of questions about the differences

crystals<00:02:04.290> work<00:02:05.869> I've<00:02:06.869> got<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.170> small<00:02:07.680> surge<00:02:08.160> of

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
crystals work I've got a small surge of

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.300 
crystals work I've got a small surge of
electricity<00:02:08.789> coming<00:02:09.569> down<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.110> wire<00:02:10.379> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
electricity coming down this wire it

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
electricity coming down this wire it
hits<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.000> crystal<00:02:12.390> and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
hits the crystal and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.470 
hits the crystal and
turns<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.720> into<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.160> ping<00:02:15.160> for<00:02:16.090> lack<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.270> a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
turns it into a ping for lack of a

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.930 
turns it into a ping for lack of a
better<00:02:16.510> word<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.930> ping<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.490> sends<00:02:18.790> out

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
better word the ping is this sends out

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.850 
better word the ping is this sends out
the<00:02:19.150> sound<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.690> goes<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.410> will

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
the sound that goes that you will

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.850 
the sound that goes that you will
actually<00:02:21.040> be<00:02:21.250> hearing<00:02:21.640> back<00:02:21.850> but<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:23.020> sends<00:02:23.470> so

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
actually be hearing back but it sends so

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.730 
actually be hearing back but it sends so
electricity<00:02:24.550> goes<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.120> crystal<00:02:25.560> turns<00:02:26.560> it

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
electricity goes to the crystal turns it

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
electricity goes to the crystal turns it
into<00:02:26.860> sound<00:02:27.390> emits<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.630> ping<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.730> ping

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
into sound emits the ping the ping

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.810 
into sound emits the ping the ping
bounces<00:02:31.720> back<00:02:32.020> hits<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.160> crystal<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.760> that

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
bounces back hits the crystal and that

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.270 
bounces back hits the crystal and that
turns<00:02:34.480> back<00:02:34.810> into<00:02:34.840> electricity<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.950> that's

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
turns back into electricity and that's

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.670 
turns back into electricity and that's
what<00:02:36.550> your<00:02:36.670> unit<00:02:37.000> receives<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.410> bigger

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
what your unit receives so the bigger

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.610 
what your unit receives so the bigger
the<00:02:38.890> crystal<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.670> more<00:02:39.970> control<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:41.080> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
way I can show you an example this is

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.930 
way I can show you an example this is
cupping<00:03:07.180> your<00:03:07.209> ear<00:03:07.600> if<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.650> cut<00:03:08.950> my<00:03:08.980> ear<00:03:09.400> all<00:03:09.700> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
cupping your ear if I cut my ear all the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.390 
cupping your ear if I cut my ear all the
way<00:03:10.060> down<00:03:10.240> like<00:03:10.270> this<00:03:10.780> even<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.770> a<00:03:11.830> noisy<00:03:12.370> room

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
way down like this even in a noisy room

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.640 
way down like this even in a noisy room
with<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:12.850> big<00:03:13.090> party<00:03:13.480> going<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:14.110> can<00:03:14.410> hear

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
with a big party going on I can hear

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.070 
with a big party going on I can hear
someone<00:03:14.920> talking<00:03:15.450> directly<00:03:16.450> in<00:03:16.600> front<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.930> me

someone talking directly in front of me

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.740 
someone talking directly in front of me
okay<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:18.160> that's<00:03:18.670> important<00:03:19.269> because<00:03:19.330> that's

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
okay and that's important because that's

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.530 
okay and that's important because that's
what<00:03:19.959> crystals<00:03:20.560> allow<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:22.090> focus

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
what crystals allow you to do to focus

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.300 
what crystals allow you to do to focus
in<00:03:23.080> on<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.590> specific<00:03:24.040> sound<00:03:25.050> now<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.310> smaller

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
in on a specific sound now the smaller

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.490 
in on a specific sound now the smaller
the<00:03:27.519> crystals<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.390> less<00:03:28.630> control<00:03:29.110> you<00:03:29.290> have

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
the crystals the less control you have

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.699 
the crystals the less control you have
and<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.920> more<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.370> hear<00:03:30.640> around<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.989> 19

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
and the more you hear around you the 19

you<00:03:35.140> basically<00:03:35.320> hear<00:03:35.739> pretty<00:03:35.980> much

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
you basically hear pretty much

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.050 
you basically hear pretty much
everything<00:03:36.850> out<00:03:36.970> there<00:03:37.239> so<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:39.250> probe<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:39.820> do

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
everything out there so the probe you do

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.090 
everything out there so the probe you do
sir<00:03:40.300> is<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.630> large<00:03:41.019> crystal<00:03:41.500> which<00:03:41.739> gives<00:03:41.980> you

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
sir is a large crystal which gives you

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.000 
sir is a large crystal which gives you
the<00:03:42.250> maximum<00:03:42.489> amount<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.180> control<00:03:44.010> which

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
the maximum amount of control which

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.460 
the maximum amount of control which
basically<00:03:45.459> means<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.120> gain<00:03:46.420> switch<00:03:46.750> does<00:03:47.320> not

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
basically means the gain switch does not

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.680 
basically means the gain switch does not
control<00:03:47.860> power<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.550> your<00:03:48.700> unit<00:03:49.000> your<00:03:49.390> gauge

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
control power of your unit your gauge

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.140 
control power of your unit your gauge
switch<00:03:50.110> simply<00:03:50.680> controls<00:03:51.130> how<00:03:51.459> much<00:03:51.489> you're

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
switch simply controls how much you're

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.620 
switch simply controls how much you're
allowing<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.750> transducer<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.800> receive<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:55.480> if

you could go from narrow medium to why
in<00:04:45.719> my<00:04:46.439> opinion<00:04:46.770> that's<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:47.069> much<00:04:47.219> more

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
mechanical form is how the Tri beam

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.350 
mechanical form is how the Tri beam

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
works and it works extremely well so

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.149 
works and it works extremely well so
when<00:04:57.509> people<00:04:57.719> say<00:04:58.020> what<00:04:58.289> are<00:04:58.319> the<00:04:58.530> differences

the kind of guys that like to putts with
infinite<00:06:04.560> variability<00:06:05.250> use<00:06:05.909> the<00:06:06.150> probe<00:06:06.419> you

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
infinite variability use the probe you

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:07.939 
infinite variability use the probe you
because<00:06:06.810> that<00:06:06.839> with<00:06:07.169> the<00:06:07.319> game<00:06:07.560> you<00:06:07.770> can

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
because that with the game you can

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:09.589 
because that with the game you can
control<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:08.460> actual<00:06:08.879> shape<00:06:09.120> of<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:09.360> cone

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
control the actual shape of the cone

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.959 
control the actual shape of the cone
with<00:06:10.169> the<00:06:10.199> gain<00:06:10.469> switch<00:06:10.650> I<00:06:11.069> hope<00:06:11.610> that<00:06:11.789> clears

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
with the gain switch I hope that clears

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.490 
with the gain switch I hope that clears

about the Tri beam and the pro view on
