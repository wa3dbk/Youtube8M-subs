00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
again what is it that turns gambit

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.039 
again what is it that turns gambit
around<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> team<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:15.479> always<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
around as a team because it's always the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.320 
around as a team because it's always the
fables<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.590> if<00:01:16.770> gamut<00:01:17.220> lose<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:17.790> day<00:01:18.000> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
fables like if gamut lose on one day you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.910 
fables like if gamut lose on one day you
do<00:01:18.570> not<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> face<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.500> next<00:01:19.799> day

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
do not want to face in the next day

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.359 
do not want to face in the next day
because<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.460> will<00:01:20.640> come<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.030> strong<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> I

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
because they will come out strong so I

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.310 
because they will come out strong so I
don't<00:01:23.880> want<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.299> disrespectful<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:25.200> anyone

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
don't want to be disrespectful to anyone

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.100 
don't want to be disrespectful to anyone
but<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.570> millennium<00:01:27.990> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
but I think that millennium is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.069 
but I think that millennium is
underperforming<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.890> lot<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.869> like

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
underperforming a lot and it is like

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.990 
underperforming a lot and it is like
when<00:01:31.439> you're<00:01:31.619> playing<00:01:31.920> against<00:01:32.460> worst<00:01:32.670> team

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
when you're playing against worst team

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.880 
when you're playing against worst team
it's<00:01:33.210> easier<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.930> shine<00:01:34.229> than<00:01:34.530> playing

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
it's easier to shine than playing

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.980 
it's easier to shine than playing
against<00:01:35.220> stronger<00:01:35.520> team<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> hope

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
against stronger team so I hope

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.780 
against stronger team so I hope
millennium<00:01:37.590> will<00:01:37.829> step<00:01:38.400> up<00:01:38.549> their<00:01:38.759> game

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
millennium will step up their game

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.640 
millennium will step up their game
because<00:01:39.390> they're<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:39.900> good<00:01:40.079> players<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
because they're really good players and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.270 
because they're really good players and
I<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:40.950> them<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> lot<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.630> i<00:01:43.140> think<00:01:44.040> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
I know them a lot so I i think that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.230 
I know them a lot so I i think that
overall<00:01:45.710> we<00:01:46.710> played<00:01:46.920> really<00:01:47.100> good<00:01:47.250> today<00:01:47.520> did

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
overall we played really good today did

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.520 
overall we played really good today did
some<00:01:48.450> mistakes<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:50.270> think<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:52.259> we

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
some mistakes but I think that if we

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.620 
some mistakes but I think that if we
play<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.340> yesterday<00:01:53.820> maybe<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.479> would

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
play like this yesterday maybe it would

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.959 
play like this yesterday maybe it would
be<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.780> bit<00:01:54.960> better<00:01:55.399> now<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> beginning<00:01:56.939> of

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
be a bit better now in the beginning of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.490 
be a bit better now in the beginning of
the<00:01:57.090> season<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.420> couple<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.750> times<00:01:57.960> I'd<00:01:58.170> ask<00:01:58.380> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the season a couple of times I'd ask you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.929 
the season a couple of times I'd ask you
to<00:01:58.560> maybe<00:01:58.799> make<00:01:59.009> some<00:01:59.250> predictions<00:01:59.399> about<00:01:59.820> how

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
to maybe make some predictions about how

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.490 
to maybe make some predictions about how
the<00:02:00.090> season<00:02:00.600> would<00:02:00.719> go<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.170> couldn't<00:02:01.380> say

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the season would go and you couldn't say

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.780 
the season would go and you couldn't say
anything<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> beginning<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> just

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
anything in the beginning but you just

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.740 
anything in the beginning but you just
mentioned<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.240> millennium<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
mentioned that millennium is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.600 
mentioned that millennium is
underperforming<00:02:04.140> right<00:02:04.619> now<00:02:04.770> where<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
underperforming right now where do you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.010 
underperforming right now where do you
kind<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.240> guys<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.600> realistically

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
kind of think you guys can realistically

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.760 
kind of think you guys can realistically
end<00:02:07.350> up<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:08.629> think<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.780> we're<00:02:10.200> aiming<00:02:10.410> for<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
end up I think that we're aiming for the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.339 
end up I think that we're aiming for the
first<00:02:11.009> place<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.690> think<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.959> will<00:02:13.080> be<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
first place and I think it will be the

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.910 
first place and I think it will be the
best

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
best

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.500 
best
and<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.220> will<00:02:14.400> be<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.640> best<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:15.060> finish<00:02:15.209> even

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and it will be the best to finish even

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.440 
and it will be the best to finish even
the<00:02:16.260> schedule<00:02:16.650> stop<00:02:16.860> too<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:18.090> won't<00:02:18.300> be

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
the schedule stop too so you won't be

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.910 
the schedule stop too so you won't be
afraid<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.110> out<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.560> get<00:02:19.770> into

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
afraid to get it out or get into

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.250 
afraid to get it out or get into
relegation<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.120> think<00:02:21.420> dr.<00:02:21.599> would<00:02:21.930> be<00:02:22.080> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
relegation so I think dr. would be the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.650 
relegation so I think dr. would be the
best<00:02:22.410> before<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.220> playoffs<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:24.300> how's<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
best before the playoffs and how's the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.540 
best before the playoffs and how's the
preparation<00:02:25.290> gone<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:25.830> coming<00:02:26.280> into<00:02:26.459> this

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
preparation gone for coming into this

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.339 
preparation gone for coming into this
obviously<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.970> had<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.270> super<00:02:27.599> weak<00:02:27.780> intel

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
obviously you had the super weak intel

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.690 
obviously you had the super weak intel
extreme<00:02:28.470> masters<00:02:28.709> now<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.250> straight<00:02:29.610> into

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
extreme masters now you straight into

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.090 
extreme masters now you straight into
this<00:02:29.880> week<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.900> one-on-one<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.590> weekend

this week going one-on-one this weekend

anywhere so we were in gaming house I

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.620 
anywhere so we were in gaming house I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
week the playoffs and I think that too

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.070 
week the playoffs and I think that too
we<00:02:54.720> reap<00:02:55.319> like<00:02:55.980> preparing<00:02:56.370> pretty<00:02:56.670> much<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.209> I

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
we reap like preparing pretty much and I

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.590 
we reap like preparing pretty much and I
hope<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.709> our<00:02:59.340> preparation<00:03:00.180> will<00:03:00.360> get<00:03:00.480> even

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
hope that our preparation will get even

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.729 
hope that our preparation will get even
better<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.400> because<00:03:02.780> everyone<00:03:03.780> will<00:03:04.049> focus

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
better and because everyone will focus

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.800 
better and because everyone will focus
more<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.580> preparing<00:03:06.209> because<00:03:06.540> we<00:03:06.690> think

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
more on the preparing because we think

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.900 
more on the preparing because we think
that<00:03:06.900> layoffs<00:03:07.319> is<00:03:07.440> more<00:03:08.010> important<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.610> even

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
that layoffs is more important and even

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.259 
that layoffs is more important and even
more<00:03:09.450> important<00:03:09.840> than<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.799> am<00:03:11.010> but<00:03:11.850> not<00:03:11.910> like

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
more important than I am but not like

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.610 
more important than I am but not like
more<00:03:12.450> important<00:03:12.870> but<00:03:12.959> we<00:03:13.080> got<00:03:13.200> more<00:03:13.380> time

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
more important but we got more time

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.800 
more important but we got more time
because<00:03:14.100> before<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.790> am<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:15.239> got<00:03:15.360> around<00:03:15.569> five

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
because before I am we got around five

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.220 
because before I am we got around five
days<00:03:16.049> after<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.340> last<00:03:17.640> LCS<00:03:18.090> week<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.600> here<00:03:19.200> we

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
will have around 10 days I think yeah so

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.759 
will have around 10 days I think yeah so
I<00:03:23.510> really<00:03:24.510> tired<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.900> i'm<00:03:24.989> telling<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.440> all

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
I really tired that i'm telling so all

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.220 
I really tired that i'm telling so all
the<00:03:25.980> time<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.430> little<00:03:26.820> people<00:03:27.180> are<00:03:27.660> saying<00:03:28.049> it

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the time and little people are saying it

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.110
