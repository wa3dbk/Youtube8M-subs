 new winter things should be them 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.020

 I donâ€™t know how you know them 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.750

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.460
 Julia decided to help the refugees 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.560
 incognito and therefore no special 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.509
 documents did not fill it means that 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.940
 track where that clothes went now 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.500
 Difficult other Chita entrepreneurs 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.140
 documentation was taken care of 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.670
 we have an act of acceptance of things, but 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.860
 list of people who got 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.209
 these clothes are a charge 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.760
 temporary accommodation staff 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.650
 Miner considered unreasonable that the same 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.170
 concerns winter clothes then her among 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.360
 humanitarian cargo was not at all 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.980
 there were winter things new about what we 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.650
 talking new winter things 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.959
 these were summer jackets this is leather 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.200
 summer jackets were winter things to 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.299
 let's say they brought 100 female down jackets 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.160
 let 50 male 50 female such not 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.600
 there were people who you came to 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.880
 administrations have expressed their 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.890
 discontent did not hear the claim 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.750
 refugees and employees of the regional prosecutor's office 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.250
 on miner's staff I have a situation with 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.040
 distribution of things no one 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.500
 complained there are no such appeals 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.060
 there was one such trick 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.500
 attract was carried out with attraction 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.609
 migration service staff 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.579
 ministries of social protection 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.750
 Transbaikal region should be noted that 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.810
 when we went to the miner 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.280
 then we noted that citizens live 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.380
 quite such comfortable conditions they 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.420
 provided with everything you need and yet 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.130
 questions remain if existed 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.739
 single transparent distribution mechanism 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.340
 humanitarian aid possible rumors were 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.900
 less 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.579
 today at every point of the temporary 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.920
 accommodating refugees its algorithm 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.140
 action somewhere give birth to accounting books 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.420
 received things constitute an act and their 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.760
 transfer to the needy and somewhere cost 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.190
 without papers will pay and on the one hand it 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.900
 well with the other gives rise to the suspicion of 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.910
 miners decided to remove all the questions 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.349
 distribute humanitarian aid now 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.380
 there will be no center staff 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.050
 and the commission of the refugees themselves 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.040
