00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.510
 hello friends we are going to prepare today a 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.720
 cheese cake without baking 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.790
 look at what star with the cookie 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.770
 to use this cookie and butter 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.070
 liquid here you have it to do the 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.960
 base of the cake we mix well we have 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.100
 a piece of paper in the background of our mold 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.590
 to then unmold 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.350
 quietly and with that pasta that we have 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.070
 made of butter we cover 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.600
 very good very good 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.600
 and we put it in front 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.170
 good while the cold takes care of 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.239
 miranda mold is cream cheese 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.239
 mark of grace and sugar 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:58.130
 we heat the creme medium fire 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.130
 and we put the cream cheese 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.500
 we help a little and with spoon to 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.070
 that is dissolving is easy 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.890
 the sugar goes in ahead we follow 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.100
 moving while we are going to hydrate the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.230
 cola highlights gelatin and now we have 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.050
 hydrated that we add to the mixture 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.050
 earlier that we have already taken the fire 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.610
 You see how easy it is to integrate gelatin and 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.350
 let's go for a Chinese because 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.410
 It is a solid and this little thing and 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.080
 we do not remove it for the mixture that 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.820
 we want and a rich man who carries waters 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.860
 impressive and good for now 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.510
 we put on our mold and to 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.310
 make sure we do not get up the bottom 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.340
 cookie that we had for everything 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.650
 What we do is drop it on a 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.140
 language we make good use of all we put 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.950
 film paper and put it into the cold how much 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.950
 well 12 hours 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.140
 for the top we are going to hydrate 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.450
 gelatin we heat water and add a 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.060
 pelín sugar and gelatin have 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.000
 hydrated we add mixed well 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.250
 we shelled a little currant 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.410
 seeing how good we have already got the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.819
 cold cake is already firm and what 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.849
 we do is put the granites of 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.440
 currant on the cake as well as 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.709
 ye this in the geometry or anything 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.849
 that this the organism that is covered and 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.800
 point we add the liquid or gel right 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.959
 the idea is not to completely cover 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.250
 but it covers like this at half height of the 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.250
 rosette come the cold again 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.760
 here we have it we are going to remove the mold 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.100
 they are a very, very careful thing because 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.820
 We grabbed the sides we have made 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.830
 we are a little knife we ​​raise good 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.450
 good for them if we remove the prettiest 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.330
 little piece of paper we already have in 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.990
 silver david fix what profile what thing 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.370
 more curious 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.920
 seems to put a climb that 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.010
 Stake there on top is a very big 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.140
 very very nice, we follow a bit 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.660
 to see how it has been inside good 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.990
 has created very creamy apart with 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.760
 a lot of ease as you see we were going to 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.130
 place with great care if always in 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.030
 this type of cake is to take care of the 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.340
 edges a little bit of mandarin syrup 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.630

 strawberry we are in an esoteric drawing 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.990
 and I said and rush as it has been for 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.870
 inside in effect the cuts and the texture 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.820
