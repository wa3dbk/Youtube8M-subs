in the world of rally there is before
Quattro<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.799> after<00:00:05.250> one<00:00:05.460> now<00:00:06.180> simple<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:07.080> is

Quattro and after one now simple it is

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.580 
Quattro and after one now simple it is
the<00:00:07.379> mc-squared<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.550> motorsports<00:00:09.230> the<00:00:10.230> idea

the mc-squared of motorsports the idea

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.410 
the mc-squared of motorsports the idea
of<00:00:10.800> having<00:00:10.950> four-wheel<00:00:11.519> drive<00:00:11.820> hit<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.210> World

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
of having four-wheel drive hit the World

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.959 
of having four-wheel drive hit the World
Rally<00:00:12.599> circuit<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.200> 1981<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> suddenly

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
Rally circuit in 1981 and suddenly

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.670 
Rally circuit in 1981 and suddenly
everything<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.660> had<00:00:15.780> been<00:00:15.870> made<00:00:16.049> before<00:00:16.289> it

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
everything that had been made before it

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.290 
everything that had been made before it
became<00:00:17.190> obsolete<00:00:17.510> overnight<00:00:19.850> new<00:00:20.850> killer<00:00:21.029> pom

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
became obsolete overnight new killer pom

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.590 
became obsolete overnight new killer pom
it's<00:00:22.109> like<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.680> first<00:00:23.269> building<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.449> was

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
it's like the first building that was

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.410 
it's like the first building that was
built<00:00:24.869> 20<00:00:25.680> stories<00:00:26.220> high<00:00:26.250> when<00:00:26.789> no<00:00:27.000> one<00:00:27.150> else

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
built 20 stories high when no one else

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.179 
built 20 stories high when no one else
had<00:00:27.599> ever<00:00:27.720> figured<00:00:28.199> out<00:00:28.439> how<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.710> build<00:00:28.980> one

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
had ever figured out how to build one

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.310 
had ever figured out how to build one
that<00:00:29.400> was<00:00:29.519> more<00:00:29.730> than<00:00:29.910> two<00:00:30.090> stories<00:00:30.330> high

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
that was more than two stories high

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.799 
that was more than two stories high
and<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> concept<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.850> simple<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.780> take

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and the concept is so simple you take

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.660 
and the concept is so simple you take
this<00:00:34.170> kind<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.620> four-wheel<00:00:35.130> off-roading

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
this kind of four-wheel off-roading

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.299 
this kind of four-wheel off-roading
technology<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.960> put<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.980> saloon

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
technology and you put it in a saloon

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.060 
technology and you put it in a saloon
car<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:39.300> way<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.809> four<00:00:40.230> wheels<00:00:40.440> are<00:00:40.710> powered

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
car that way all four wheels are powered

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.590 
car that way all four wheels are powered
by<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> engine<00:00:41.489> which<00:00:41.850> gives<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.180> car<00:00:42.420> more

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
by the engine which gives the car more

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.930 
by the engine which gives the car more
traction<00:00:42.960> which<00:00:43.559> means<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.280> take<00:00:44.309> corners

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
traction which means it can take corners

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.060 
traction which means it can take corners
faster<00:00:45.390> which<00:00:45.750> means<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.559> get<00:00:46.710> around<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
faster which means it can get around the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.610 
faster which means it can get around the
track<00:00:47.280> faster<00:00:47.940> which<00:00:48.270> means<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.960> car<00:00:49.230> winds

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
track faster which means the car winds

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.180 
track faster which means the car winds
more<00:00:49.950> races<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.809> haven't<00:00:52.440> anyone's<00:00:52.920> done<00:00:53.100> it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
more races so I haven't anyone's done it

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.970 
more races so I haven't anyone's done it
before<00:00:53.539> simple<00:00:54.539> everyone<00:00:55.379> thought<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
before simple everyone thought the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.920 
before simple everyone thought the
four-wheel<00:00:56.430> system<00:00:56.940> would<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.420> heavy<00:00:57.690> that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
four-wheel system would be so heavy that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.750 
four-wheel system would be so heavy that
once<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.440> was<00:00:58.469> placed<00:00:58.800> inside<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.250> car

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
once it was placed inside a car

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.569 
once it was placed inside a car
it<00:00:59.879> wouldn't<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.359> competitive<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.320> fact<00:01:01.980> car

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
it wouldn't be competitive in fact car

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 
it wouldn't be competitive in fact car
manufacturers<00:01:03.329> around<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> world<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
manufacturers around the world but the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.370 
manufacturers around the world but the
idea<00:01:04.949> was<00:01:05.159> as<00:01:05.309> stupid<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.330> given<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.810> monkey<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
idea was as stupid as given a monkey a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.710 
idea was as stupid as given a monkey a
stick<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.890> dynamite<00:01:08.119> in<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> beginning

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
stick of dynamite in the beginning

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.810 
stick of dynamite in the beginning
everybody<00:01:10.200> was<00:01:10.439> laughing<00:01:10.830> about<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.520> because

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
everybody was laughing about it because

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.660 
everybody was laughing about it because
everybody<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.600> thinking<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.080> not<00:01:13.670> cannot

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
everybody was thinking that not cannot

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.719 
everybody was thinking that not cannot
be<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.140> much<00:01:16.470> too<00:01:16.710> complicated<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.670> too

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
be it is much too complicated and too

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.090 
be it is much too complicated and too
heavy<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.689> cannot<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.080> competitive

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
heavy so cannot be competitive

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.300 
heavy so cannot be competitive
they<00:01:20.810> went<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.049> four-wheel<00:01:22.530> drive<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.130> their

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
they went to four-wheel drive with their

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
and being one of them saying looks too

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.510 
and being one of them saying looks too
complicated<00:01:29.450> but<00:01:30.450> Aldi<00:01:30.990> did<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> anyway<00:01:31.740> first

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
complicated but Aldi did it anyway first

complicated but Aldi did it anyway first
they<00:01:32.880> cut<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> weight<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> four-wheel

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
they cut the weight of the four-wheel

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.109 
they cut the weight of the four-wheel
system<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.979> body<00:01:35.220> weight<00:01:35.430> was<00:01:35.579> reduced<00:01:35.700> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
system the body weight was reduced to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.179 
system the body weight was reduced to
the<00:01:36.270> minimum<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> make<00:01:37.740> sure<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the minimum then just to make sure the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.679 
the minimum then just to make sure the
extra<00:01:38.549> weight<00:01:38.640> wasn't<00:01:38.880> too<00:01:39.180> much<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.479> an<00:01:39.570> issue

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
extra weight wasn't too much of an issue
