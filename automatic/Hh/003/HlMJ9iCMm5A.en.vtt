probably<00:02:36.430> for<00:02:36.670> about<00:02:36.819> six<00:02:37.540> seven<00:02:37.900> years<00:02:38.159> so

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
probably for about six seven years so

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.839 
probably for about six seven years so
over<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.420> course<00:02:41.079> of<00:02:41.319> time<00:02:41.530> I've<00:02:41.859> learned<00:02:42.670> the

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
over the course of time I've learned the

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.270 
over the course of time I've learned the
ski<00:02:43.209> I've<00:02:43.569> been<00:02:43.719> able<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.079> learn<00:02:44.319> how<00:02:45.010> to

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
ski I've been able to learn how to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.429 
ski I've been able to learn how to
adjust<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.909> we<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.329> know<00:02:46.480> where<00:02:47.260> my

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
adjust this we you know where my

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.140 
adjust this we you know where my
bindings<00:02:47.890> are<00:02:48.099> I<00:02:48.129> can<00:02:48.459> figure<00:02:48.670> out<00:02:48.790> where<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
bindings are I can figure out where the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.569 
bindings are I can figure out where the
sweet<00:02:49.420> spot<00:02:49.719> is<00:02:49.750> on<00:02:50.079> any<00:02:50.319> ski<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.859> sends<00:02:51.430> me

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
sweet spot is on any ski that sends me

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.839 
sweet spot is on any ski that sends me
so<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.239> think<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:53.530> consistencies<00:02:54.430> come

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
so I think the consistencies come

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.720 
so I think the consistencies come
through<00:02:55.239> with<00:02:55.659> me<00:02:56.109> gaining<00:02:56.500> knowledge<00:02:56.799> of<00:02:57.340> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
through with me gaining knowledge of the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.039 
through with me gaining knowledge of the
good<00:02:58.389> product<00:02:59.879> yeah<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:00.909> new<00:03:01.090> ski<00:03:01.299> with<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.900> mean
