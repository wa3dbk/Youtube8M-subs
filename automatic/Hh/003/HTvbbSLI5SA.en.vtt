see<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.390> featuring<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.229> camera<00:01:59.210> which

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
see that it's featuring a camera which

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.690 
see that it's featuring a camera which
is<00:02:00.630> pretty<00:02:01.619> nice<00:02:01.890> actually

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
is pretty nice actually

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.880 
is pretty nice actually
I<00:02:02.850> don't<00:02:03.780> think<00:02:03.840> Apple<00:02:04.409> would<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.890> in

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
I don't think Apple would do it in

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.309 
I don't think Apple would do it in
this<00:02:06.040> kind<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.280> way<00:02:06.520> where<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:07.780> can<00:02:07.930> like<00:02:08.170> have

this kind of way where you can like have

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.680 
this kind of way where you can like have
a<00:02:08.350> habit<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:09.009> be<00:02:09.819> able<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.119> play<00:02:10.300> games<00:02:10.539> and

a habit and be able to play games and
stuff<00:02:10.840> like<00:02:11.020> that<00:02:11.200> on<00:02:11.350> your<00:02:11.470> phone<00:02:11.680> because

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
stuff like that on your phone because

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.030 
stuff like that on your phone because
their<00:02:12.790> Apple<00:02:13.690> usually<00:02:13.990> don't<00:02:14.170> do<00:02:14.410> things<00:02:14.709> that

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
their Apple usually don't do things that

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.880 
their Apple usually don't do things that
they<00:02:15.190> they<00:02:15.459> don't<00:02:15.819> see<00:02:16.120> any<00:02:16.870> point<00:02:17.260> with<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.620> so

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
they they don't see any point with it so

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.100 
they they don't see any point with it so
like<00:02:18.520> be<00:02:18.670> able<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:18.910> play<00:02:19.090> like<00:02:19.300> GTA<00:02:19.720> on<00:02:19.959> your

like be able to play like GTA on your

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.670 
like be able to play like GTA on your
phone<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.590> will<00:02:20.620> probably<00:02:20.950> be<00:02:21.360> yeah<00:02:22.360> it's<00:02:23.260> kind

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
phone it will probably be yeah it's kind

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.560 
phone it will probably be yeah it's kind
of<00:02:23.709> hard<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.980> do<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.220> with<00:02:24.340> one<00:02:24.550> hand<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.060> they

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
of hard to do it with one hand so they

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.620 
of hard to do it with one hand so they
probably<00:02:25.720> wouldn't<00:02:26.110> have<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.290> full<00:02:26.620> App<00:02:26.890> Store

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
probably wouldn't have a full App Store

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.510 
probably wouldn't have a full App Store
but<00:02:28.630> it's<00:02:29.110> still<00:02:29.380> pretty<00:02:29.560> cool<00:02:29.860> concept<00:02:30.100> I'm

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
but it's still pretty cool concept I'm

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.150 
but it's still pretty cool concept I'm
sure<00:02:30.700> how<00:02:30.850> big<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:31.540> display<00:02:32.380> would<00:02:32.620> be<00:02:32.800> here

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
sure how big this display would be here

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.870 
sure how big this display would be here
but<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.489> guess<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.180> would<00:02:34.300> be<00:02:34.480> something<00:02:34.810> like<00:02:35.880> 2

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
but I guess it would be something like 2

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.570 
but I guess it would be something like 2
inches<00:02:37.209> maybe<00:02:37.480> or<00:02:37.840> something<00:02:38.200> like<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.580> you

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
inches maybe or something like that you

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.100 
inches maybe or something like that you
can<00:02:39.700> also<00:02:39.820> see<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.060> kinda<00:02:40.450> has<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:40.930> a

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
can also see that kinda has like a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.860 
can also see that kinda has like a
bluish<00:02:41.400> LED<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.820> don't<00:02:43.120> really<00:02:43.239> like<00:02:43.360> it

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
bluish LED that I don't really like it

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.770 
bluish LED that I don't really like it
looks<00:02:44.019> a<00:02:44.110> little<00:02:44.200> bit<00:02:44.380> futuristic<00:02:45.690> where<00:02:46.690> you

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
looks a little bit futuristic where you

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.710 
looks a little bit futuristic where you
can<00:02:46.959> see<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.340> over<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.670> Apple<00:02:49.000> logo<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.660> the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
can see that over the Apple logo and the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.050 
can see that over the Apple logo and the
iWatch<00:02:50.080> text<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.709> around<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.220> display<00:02:52.000> you

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
iWatch text and around the display you

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.660 
iWatch text and around the display you
can<00:02:52.180> kind<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.540> see<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.660> bluish<00:02:53.110> color<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.709> don't

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
can kind of see a bluish color I don't

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.540 
can kind of see a bluish color I don't
like<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.540> because<00:02:56.170> it's<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.100> little<00:02:57.250> bit<00:02:57.430> too

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
like that because it's a little bit too

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.229 
like that because it's a little bit too
colorful<00:02:58.739> but<00:02:59.739> of<00:03:00.190> course<00:03:00.519> it's<00:03:00.760> pretty<00:03:00.970> cool

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
colorful but of course it's pretty cool

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.360 
colorful but of course it's pretty cool
this<00:03:01.989> is<00:03:02.170> one<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.380> my<00:03:02.470> favorite<00:03:02.950> views

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
this is one of my favorite views

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.250 
this is one of my favorite views
actually<00:03:03.910> on<00:03:04.000> this<00:03:04.120> concept<00:03:04.570> you<00:03:04.780> can<00:03:04.930> see<00:03:05.080> how

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
actually on this concept you can see how

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.840 
actually on this concept you can see how
thin<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.890> is

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
thin it is

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.880 
thin it is
the<00:03:07.420> thing<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.959> attach<00:03:08.260> around<00:03:08.739> your

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
the thing that you attach around your

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.830 
the thing that you attach around your
hand<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.760> kind<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.299> feels<00:03:10.510> like<00:03:10.600> it

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
hand it kind of feels like it

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.479 
hand it kind of feels like it
automatically<00:03:11.500> would<00:03:11.739> do<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:12.070> kind<00:03:12.400> of

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
automatically would do that kind of

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.870 
automatically would do that kind of
feels<00:03:12.850> like<00:03:13.030> some<00:03:13.570> kind<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.920> 2020<00:03:14.920> thing<00:03:15.579> that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
feels like some kind of 2020 thing that

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.990 
feels like some kind of 2020 thing that
we<00:03:16.000> might<00:03:16.209> see<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.540> future<00:03:16.630> like<00:03:17.350> totally

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
we might see in the future like totally

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.580 
we might see in the future like totally
way<00:03:19.000> off<00:03:19.239> in<00:03:19.510> if<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.780> should<00:03:20.019> not<00:03:20.140> do<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.410> like

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
way off in if you should not do it like

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.410 
way off in if you should not do it like
the<00:03:20.739> first<00:03:20.920> generation<00:03:21.070> I<00:03:21.579> watch<00:03:21.850> but<00:03:22.120> they're

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
the first generation I watch but they're

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.940 
the first generation I watch but they're
definitely<00:03:22.630> pretty<00:03:23.140> cool<00:03:23.200> here<00:03:23.650> with<00:03:23.829> that

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
definitely pretty cool here with that

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.580 
definitely pretty cool here with that
white<00:03:24.280> color<00:03:24.579> definitely<00:03:25.510> looks<00:03:25.660> very

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
white color definitely looks very

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.759 
white color definitely looks very
polished<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:28.000> then<00:03:28.510> yeah<00:03:29.019> it's<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.440> great

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
polished and then yeah it's a great

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.050 
polished and then yeah it's a great
concept<00:03:30.400> like<00:03:30.579> that<00:03:30.760> overall<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:32.380> then<00:03:33.060> let's

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
concept like that overall and then let's

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.789 
concept like that overall and then let's
just<00:03:34.180> hope<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.660> we<00:03:35.049> see<00:03:35.290> more<00:03:35.320> great

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
just hope that we see more great

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.229 
just hope that we see more great
concepts<00:03:36.250> like<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.579> coming<00:03:36.940> up<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
concepts like this coming up in the

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.880 
concepts like this coming up in the
future<00:03:37.329> this<00:03:37.870> is<00:03:38.019> basically<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.410> color<00:03:38.590> that

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890

I concept I this major concept from my

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.420 
I concept I this major concept from my
inspiration<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.690> also<00:03:44.260> did<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.829> video<00:03:45.010> ago

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
inspiration that I also did a video ago

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.430 
inspiration that I also did a video ago
which<00:03:46.360> was<00:03:46.510> just<00:03:46.810> awesome

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
which was just awesome

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.130 
which was just awesome
and<00:03:47.620> like<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.459> big<00:03:48.880> fat<00:03:49.269> iPhone<00:03:49.780> that<00:03:50.019> would

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
and like a big fat iPhone that would
