00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hey guys this is my review of the

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.200 
hey guys this is my review of the
cyclone<00:00:03.330> boys<00:00:03.570> 3<00:00:04.020> by<00:00:04.170> 3<00:00:04.200> 55<00:00:05.009> millimeter<00:00:05.520> I've

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
cyclone boys 3 by 3 55 millimeter I've

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.030 
cyclone boys 3 by 3 55 millimeter I've
looped<00:00:06.569> this<00:00:06.750> up<00:00:06.899> taking<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.290> screw<00:00:07.649> springs

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
looped this up taking the screw springs

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.860 
looped this up taking the screw springs
lube<00:00:08.309> all<00:00:08.490> those<00:00:08.670> things<00:00:08.970> up<00:00:09.120> blue<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.450> pieces

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
lube all those things up blue the pieces

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.390 
lube all those things up blue the pieces
and<00:00:10.080> one<00:00:10.500> thing<00:00:10.679> I'm<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.860> point<00:00:11.099> out<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.250> that

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
and one thing I'm to point out is that

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.970 
and one thing I'm to point out is that
these<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.660> cyclone<00:00:13.080> boy<00:00:13.259> series<00:00:13.679> they<00:00:13.830> don't

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
these the cyclone boy series they don't

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.460 
these the cyclone boy series they don't
have<00:00:14.280> any<00:00:14.610> washes<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.240> them<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.839> it's

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
have any washes in them so it's a it's

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.560 
have any washes in them so it's a it's
not<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.010> last<00:00:17.190> as<00:00:17.490> long<00:00:17.520> because<00:00:17.970> grains

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
not going to last as long because grains

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.929 
not going to last as long because grains
are<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.810> plastic<00:00:19.350> ivory<00:00:20.160> seen<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> plastic

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
are the plastic ivory seen the plastic

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.820 
are the plastic ivory seen the plastic
like<00:00:21.180> ripping<00:00:22.080> out<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.439> all<00:00:22.529> these<00:00:22.650> things

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
like ripping out and all these things

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.590 
like ripping out and all these things
it's<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:22.980> not<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> pretty<00:00:23.490> sight<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.539> I

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
it's just not a pretty sight so I

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.870 
it's just not a pretty sight so I
recommend<00:00:24.900> adding<00:00:25.590> some<00:00:26.130> washes<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:26.789> you

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
recommend adding some washes and if you

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.939 
recommend adding some washes and if you
have<00:00:26.970> any<00:00:27.029> extras<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:28.230> my<00:00:28.380> case<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.769> don't

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
have any extras I in my case I don't

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.179 
have any extras I in my case I don't
have<00:00:29.099> any<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.519> left<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.880> as<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.119> which<00:00:30.929> is

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
have any so I left it as it is which is

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.740 
have any so I left it as it is which is
it<00:00:32.189> still<00:00:32.430> performs<00:00:32.850> good<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.630> not

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
it still performs good but it's just not

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.209 
it still performs good but it's just not
gonna<00:00:33.870> last<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.320> long<00:00:34.350> because<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:35.040> gonna

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
gonna last as long because just gonna

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.430 
gonna last as long because just gonna
weaken<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> plastic<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:36.989> thin<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> out

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
weaken the plastic and just thin it out

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.500 
weaken the plastic and just thin it out
which<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.710> which<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.610> may<00:00:38.790> snap<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> near

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
which is which it may snap in the near

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.420 
which is which it may snap in the near
future<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.440> think<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.040> this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
future so what do I think of the of this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.790 
future so what do I think of the of this
puzzle<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:42.000> gotta<00:00:42.510> tell<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.140> puzzle<00:00:43.649> was

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
puzzle I gotta tell you this puzzle was

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.940 
puzzle I gotta tell you this puzzle was
just<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.520> amazing<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.960> don't<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.350> it's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
just so amazing I just don't know it's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.010 
just so amazing I just don't know it's
just<00:00:47.070> something<00:00:47.520> about<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.940> maybe<00:00:48.750> because<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
just something about it maybe because of

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.080 
just something about it maybe because of
the<00:00:49.140> plastic<00:00:49.710> or<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.039> PET<00:00:50.520> plastic<00:00:50.730> of

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the plastic or the the PET plastic of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.569 
the plastic or the the PET plastic of
the<00:00:51.210> cube<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:52.350> over<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.710> performance<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the cube but over the performance the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.369 
the cube but over the performance the
turning<00:00:54.059> waste<00:00:54.210> everything<00:00:54.840> about<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.350> is

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
turning waste everything about it is

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.500 
turning waste everything about it is
just<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.039> good<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.640> can't<00:00:57.000> explain<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.390> you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
just so good I just can't explain to you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.840 
just so good I just can't explain to you
guys<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.020> feels<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.340> smooth

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
guys how it feels like it's just smooth

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.910 
guys how it feels like it's just smooth
and<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.289> guys<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.469> hear<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:03.920> it's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and just you guys and hear this it's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
and just you guys and hear this it's
just<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.220> buttery<00:01:05.580> inside<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.600> perform

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
just so buttery inside and just perform

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.250 
just so buttery inside and just perform
so<00:01:07.590> nicely<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.970> could<00:01:09.150> easily<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.780> my<00:01:10.020> main

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
so nicely this could easily be my main

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.969 
so nicely this could easily be my main
it<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> black<00:01:11.220> colored<00:01:11.729> version<00:01:12.979> but

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
it was like a black colored version but

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.950 
it was like a black colored version but
yeah<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:15.030> performed<00:01:15.390> solo

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
yeah it's just I just performed solo

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.450 
yeah it's just I just performed solo
nice<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.619> can't<00:01:16.799> explain<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.310> guys

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
nice I just can't explain to you guys

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.800 
nice I just can't explain to you guys
how<00:01:17.610> nice<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.600> pick<00:01:18.780> one

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
how nice it is you just have to pick one

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.749 
how nice it is you just have to pick one
up<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.200> yourself<00:01:19.530> maybe<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.220> might<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:20.640> be

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
up for yourself maybe you might not be

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.130 
up for yourself maybe you might not be
into<00:01:21.000> smoother<00:01:21.390> cube<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> wouldn't

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
into smoother cube so I wouldn't

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.350 
into smoother cube so I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> fear<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.090> cube

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
recommend this but the fear of this cube

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.100 
recommend this but the fear of this cube
is<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.659> buttery<00:01:25.880> nice<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.360> doesn't<00:01:27.840> feel<00:01:27.990> out

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
is just buttery nice it doesn't feel out

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.480 
is just buttery nice it doesn't feel out
the<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.380> longer<00:01:28.650> has<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.040> kind<00:01:29.340> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the way longer has that kind of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.640 
the way longer has that kind of
smoothness<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.329> way<00:01:30.570> long<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.500> one

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
smoothness of the way long but this one

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.350 
smoothness of the way long but this one
is<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.040> bit<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.460> don't<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.270> just

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
is just a bit I don't know it's just

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.990 
is just a bit I don't know it's just
really<00:01:33.600> hard<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> explain<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> let<00:01:35.759> me<00:01:35.790> perform

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
really hard to explain so let me perform

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.490 
really hard to explain so let me perform
some<00:01:36.299> algorithm<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:36.960> yes<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
some algorithm so yes and see the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:55.130 
some algorithm so yes and see the
performance<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.130> cube

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.750 

this<00:01:56.140> Scoob<00:01:56.380> just<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:56.890> controllable<00:01:57.550> you<00:01:57.640> can

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
this Scoob just so controllable you can

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.610 
this Scoob just so controllable you can
control<00:01:58.180> it<00:01:58.330> lightly<00:01:58.540> everything<00:01:59.290> about<00:01:59.440> it

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
control it lightly everything about it

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.170 
control it lightly everything about it
it's<00:02:00.520> just<00:02:00.729> really<00:02:01.390> really<00:02:01.690> nice<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.790> as<00:02:04.030> for

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
it's just really really nice so as for

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.900 
it's just really really nice so as for
lock<00:02:04.390> up<00:02:04.570> some<00:02:04.720> pops<00:02:04.930> go<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:05.670> haven't<00:02:06.670> had<00:02:06.729> any

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
lock up some pops go I haven't had any

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.389 
lock up some pops go I haven't had any
lock<00:02:07.119> ups<00:02:07.330> or<00:02:07.510> pops<00:02:07.900> but<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:08.920> do<00:02:09.039> have<00:02:09.250> the

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
lock ups or pops but I do have the

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.919 
lock ups or pops but I do have the
tensions<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.850> bit<00:02:09.970> quite<00:02:10.149> tight<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.630> corner

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
tensions a bit quite tight so the corner

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.460 
tensions a bit quite tight so the corner
cutting<00:02:11.730> may<00:02:12.730> be<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.970> bit<00:02:13.209> hard<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.630> do<00:02:13.840> because

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
cutting may be a bit hard to do because

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.890 
cutting may be a bit hard to do because
i<00:02:15.010> had<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.580> temptation<00:02:16.270> this<00:02:16.390> quite<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.660> bit

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
i had the temptation this quite a bit

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.540 
i had the temptation this quite a bit
but<00:02:19.900> it's<00:02:20.110> not<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> problem<00:02:20.500> during<00:02:21.220> sales

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
but it's not a problem during sales

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.300 
but it's not a problem during sales
because<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.900> cube<00:02:23.140> allows<00:02:23.410> me<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.770> be<00:02:23.890> really

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
because this cube allows me to be really

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.340 
because this cube allows me to be really
controllable<00:02:25.000> with<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.330> like<00:02:25.510> just<00:02:25.930> through

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
controllable with it like just through

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.800 
controllable with it like just through
full<00:02:26.650> accurate<00:02:27.430> turns<00:02:28.000> follow<00:02:28.330> through<00:02:28.690> with

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
full accurate turns follow through with

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.810 
full accurate turns follow through with
your<00:02:28.870> turnings<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.440> all<00:02:29.590> these<00:02:29.709> things<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.790> I

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
your turnings and all these things so I

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.449 
your turnings and all these things so I
don't<00:02:31.209> have<00:02:31.300> any<00:02:31.480> problem<00:02:31.870> during<00:02:32.080> souls<00:02:32.459> so

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
don't have any problem during souls so

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.800 
don't have any problem during souls so
let<00:02:33.610> me<00:02:33.700> show<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:33.880> guys<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.209> mechanism<00:02:34.750> of

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
let me show you guys the mechanism of

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.050 
let me show you guys the mechanism of
the<00:02:34.959> scoop<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:36.220> taking<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.700> look<00:02:36.730> at<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
the scoop so taking a look at the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.850 
the scoop so taking a look at the
mechanism<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.810> can<00:02:38.050> see<00:02:38.200> there<00:02:38.440> this<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.770> the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
mechanism you can see there this is the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.740 
mechanism you can see there this is the
mechanism<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.640> core<00:02:40.239> looks<00:02:40.390> like<00:02:40.630> they

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
mechanism and the core looks like they

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.070 
mechanism and the core looks like they
Diane<00:02:41.260> core<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:42.489> newer<00:02:42.790> Diane<00:02:43.390> call<00:02:43.690> up<00:02:43.900> the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
Diane core the newer Diane call up the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.590 
Diane core the newer Diane call up the
that<00:02:44.470> colored<00:02:44.830> core<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:46.060> can<00:02:46.209> see<00:02:46.390> their

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
that colored core and you can see their

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.270 
that colored core and you can see their
pieces<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.470> all<00:02:47.590> these<00:02:47.769> things<00:02:47.830> really

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
pieces and all these things really

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.810 
pieces and all these things really
colorful<00:02:48.850> site<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.360> guys<00:02:49.480> can<00:02:49.630> see<00:02:50.820> obviously

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
colorful site you guys can see obviously

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.150 
colorful site you guys can see obviously
because<00:02:52.030> it's<00:02:52.180> Nicholas<00:02:52.630> cube<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.769> logo

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
because it's Nicholas cube and the logo

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.070 
because it's Nicholas cube and the logo
itself<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.700> embedded<00:02:55.209> onto<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.630> piece<00:02:55.840> so

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
itself is embedded onto the piece so

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.130 
itself is embedded onto the piece so
there's<00:02:56.290> no<00:02:56.440> sticker<00:02:56.830> or<00:02:56.890> anything<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.870> let<00:02:59.019> me

there's no sticker or anything so let me
show<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.560> guys<00:02:59.680> a<00:03:00.010> corner<00:03:00.430> piece<00:03:00.549> so<00:03:00.820> here<00:03:01.060> is

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
show you guys a corner piece so here is

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.460 
show you guys a corner piece so here is
a<00:03:01.269> corner<00:03:01.570> piece<00:03:03.450> yes<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.630> see<00:03:04.780> there<00:03:04.959> it's

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
a corner piece yes and see there it's

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.050 
a corner piece yes and see there it's
not<00:03:05.620> really<00:03:05.829> curved<00:03:06.190> it's<00:03:06.400> just<00:03:06.579> like<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> whole

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
not really curved it's just like a whole

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.120 
not really curved it's just like a whole
flat<00:03:07.480> surface<00:03:08.019> which<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.320> really<00:03:08.620> interesting

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
flat surface which is really interesting

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.530 
flat surface which is really interesting
where<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.400> like<00:03:09.579> standard<00:03:10.000> three<00:03:10.150> by<00:03:10.269> threes

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
where is like standard three by threes

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.690 
where is like standard three by threes
they<00:03:10.630> were<00:03:10.750> dippin<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.470> all<00:03:12.130> these<00:03:12.280> but<00:03:12.489> this

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
they were dippin and all these but this

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.580 
they were dippin and all these but this
is<00:03:12.880> just<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.750> guys<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.049> see<00:03:14.170> there<00:03:14.320> it's<00:03:14.440> just

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
is just you guys can see there it's just

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.300 
is just you guys can see there it's just
all<00:03:14.769> flat<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:17.530> can<00:03:17.709> see<00:03:17.890> there<00:03:18.100> it's

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
all flat and you can see there it's

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.680 
all flat and you can see there it's
rounded<00:03:18.760> here<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.120> bit<00:03:19.750> sharp<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.670> yeah<00:03:21.690> you

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
rounded here a bit sharp and yeah you

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.630 
rounded here a bit sharp and yeah you
guys<00:03:22.810> can<00:03:22.900> see<00:03:22.959> for<00:03:23.200> yourself<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:24.459> does

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
guys can see for yourself and it does

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.430 
guys can see for yourself and it does
split<00:03:24.940> does<00:03:25.390> yeah<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:25.690> does<00:03:25.870> splinter<00:03:26.200> thirds

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
split does yeah it does splinter thirds

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.750 
split does yeah it does splinter thirds
and<00:03:27.959> for<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.110> edge<00:03:29.380> piece<00:03:29.860> yes<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.340> see<00:03:30.519> here

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
and for the edge piece yes and see here

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.150 
and for the edge piece yes and see here
it's<00:03:31.630> like<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.019> long<00:03:32.260> basically<00:03:32.709> where<00:03:33.040> they

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
it's like I so long basically where they

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.180 
it's like I so long basically where they
put<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.540> torpedo<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.989> its<00:03:35.200> own<00:03:35.380> that<00:03:35.920> doesn't

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
put the torpedo on its own that doesn't

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.860 
put the torpedo on its own that doesn't
really<00:03:36.280> it's<00:03:36.730> not<00:03:36.850> like<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:37.030> die-in<00:03:37.299> where<00:03:37.780> the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
really it's not like a die-in where the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.810 
really it's not like a die-in where the
torpedo<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.440> like<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:39.100> can<00:03:39.220> take<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.549> out<00:03:39.670> this

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
torpedo is like you can take it out this

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.470 
torpedo is like you can take it out this
one<00:03:40.060> it's<00:03:40.239> just<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:40.630> bed<00:03:41.560> until<00:03:41.709> it's<00:03:42.130> just

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
one it's just in bed until it's just

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.180 
one it's just in bed until it's just
molded<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:43.630> just<00:03:44.470> like<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.860> it<00:03:44.950> splits

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
molded and just like that and it splits
