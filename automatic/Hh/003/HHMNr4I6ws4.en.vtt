here<00:04:08.850> is<00:04:08.940> step<00:04:09.209> two<00:04:09.420> step<00:04:09.660> 3

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
here is step two step 3

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.800 
here is step two step 3
so<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.470> also<00:04:10.709> use<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.310> as<00:04:11.450> presentation<00:04:12.450> the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
so I also use it as presentation the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.170 
so I also use it as presentation the
little<00:04:13.110> spiel<00:04:13.440> or<00:04:13.620> talk<00:04:13.950> about<00:04:14.160> origami<00:04:14.880> out

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
little spiel or talk about origami out

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.539 
little spiel or talk about origami out
and<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.510> literally<00:04:15.959> use<00:04:16.320> these<00:04:16.709> lab<00:04:16.920> boards<00:04:17.340> to

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
and I literally use these lab boards to

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.830 
and I literally use these lab boards to
talk<00:04:17.700> about<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.000> company<00:04:18.330> because<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.750> was

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
talk about the company because it was

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.420 
talk about the company because it was
you<00:04:19.020> know<00:04:19.140> visual<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.709> could<00:04:19.890> hold<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.160> up<00:04:20.280> like

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
you know visual I could hold it up like

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.940 
you know visual I could hold it up like
that<00:04:20.460> before<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.479> gave<00:04:21.630> out<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.530> lab<00:04:22.680> boards

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
that before I gave out the lab boards

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.040 
that before I gave out the lab boards
with<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.160> stuff<00:04:23.490> in<00:04:23.640> it

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
with a stuff in it

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.490 
with a stuff in it
so<00:04:24.379> again<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:25.039> is<00:04:25.220> like<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.460> five<00:04:25.639> steps<00:04:26.000> of

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
so again this is like the five steps of

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.469 
so again this is like the five steps of
creating<00:04:27.500> your<00:04:27.860> own<00:04:28.009> living<00:04:28.220> market<00:04:28.699> and<00:04:29.060> this

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
one right here is just a little bit of

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.640 
one right here is just a little bit of
like<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.449> definitions<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:33.289> what<00:04:33.409> things
