00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.970
 there guys on youtube who wants silva 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:12.889
 show you there right now how it is 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:16.299
 stuck the camera on the helmet and the 11 ls2 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.299
 boss 358 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.500
 here's the microphone cable I was hooking 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:29.930
 in this position here because here in the front 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:33.530
 you do not have that part here with that part 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.580
 here the year does not let the sticker look good 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.190
 fixed and do not stand and this tip here 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.220
 also a sustainability day is good 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.989
 to say why here is more crooked than 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.040
 the adhesive to stick with the two 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.930
 Tips on the top is collar on the helmet he is 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.190
 what is the mean but two points and fiscal 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.190
 and here it is held well 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:09.249
 though this part here is a 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:09.249
 little high but still safe, well 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:19.819
 so what happens this sticker is not e 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:25.249
 if this base is support is not original of the 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:28.999
 gopro was what I bought later and the 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:31.909
 sticker that came in here does not cover the 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:35.090
 camera was thus turning the camera 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.630
 the recording position is lower. 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:44.810
 getting wrong there that I did I spent 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.479
 araldite here starting to loosen up 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.849
 still firmly stirring a little 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.549
 but it is still well end will be the highlight 

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:55.849
 on the sides of it to be able to sign 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:59.869
 and it will not come and the camera will 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:01.669
 position so that you can bring the camera 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.840
 side for her to be right in front of 

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:10.189
 right 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.760
 I use this box base here that I use 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:17.939
 three of these 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.939
 these little arms 3 little arms of themselves 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:25.439
 then the shadow one but two arms here 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:28.799
 A crooked one picks up like this here turns to 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:32.060
 here and there that position that the Governor the 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:35.010
 next and another regular ahead here 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.829
 right, and there's another one that 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.159
 so I do not have three settings 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:49.140
 here with this one in this right arm of 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:51.560
 to fit the serve was complicated in the box 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.560
 only with one 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:06.799
 also goiano is directly in front of the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.799
 See you here 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:16.260
 What do you have to leave in the middle of the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.940
 helmet of the recording point that part 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.280
 white here 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.870
 from here is where the camera is made 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.849
 capturing the image 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.609
 so she has to stay the most 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.049
 near the middle of the helmet to 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.639
 Do you have a straight image? 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.829
 sometimes you think it's 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.989
 camera in the middle but it is not the camera that 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.160
 have to stay in the middle is this point 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.730
 here o 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.629
 this point here has to be in the middle of 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.120
 you can see that the camera is a 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:46.459
 little moved here only it's for 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.190
 so centralize to the point of capture 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.120
 That's right, this makes the image look good. 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.319
 very beautiful centralized 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:00.500
 the video and I use the original adapter 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.500
 from gopro here 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:12.000
 it has the micro usb input and the p2 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.700
 that goes here in the microphone 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.200
 the case I had bought a case that already 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.980
 came with the open side only that he 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.260
 broke and then I had to get the case 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.740
 Original did not want to do this but I 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.560
 I had to do otherwise I would have neither 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.100
 how to record the one who arbrobar whom the 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:42.510
 want original coming close that he 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:45.020
 You'll get Coophema there. 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.020
 working 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.470
 the mother 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.439
 it did not look pretty no more work thing 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.210
 box here 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.129
 I have another base that I put 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.199
 here recently for some 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:25.479
 other ideas focus this base one 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.059
 base is flat 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:31.990
 I did not was with base curve but until 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:44.620
 It's fine too, paste it over and I'll show it 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:52.689
 for you that my microphone will come to me 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:54.279
 tell everything that the microphone is up to a 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:59.349
 little ripped lei 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:06:04.689
 it is lean in the mouth is tearing 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:09.279
 the foam there I spend the fiuk 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:11.349
 of the side of the helmet and 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:15.099
 holding microphone with a tape 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:17.789
 even does not have a better place 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.789
 to put there 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:25.769
 good that's it is my my my 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:25.769

 good for the staff wanted to know how it is 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:38.379
