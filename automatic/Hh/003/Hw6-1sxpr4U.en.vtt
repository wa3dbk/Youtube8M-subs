because<00:00:26.070> zod<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.880> think<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
because zod we think about it the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.740 
because zod we think about it the
Superman<00:00:28.740> regime<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.400> more<00:00:30.029> likely<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.599> close

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
Superman regime is more likely the close

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.959 
Superman regime is more likely the close
enough<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.170> za<00:00:31.380> he<00:00:31.590> says<00:00:31.859> even<00:00:32.040> kneel<00:00:32.790> before

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
enough to za he says even kneel before

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.729 
enough to za he says even kneel before
him<00:00:33.300> that's<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:33.600> Zod<00:00:33.870> says<00:00:34.260> right<00:00:34.410> there<00:00:34.440> so

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
him that's what Zod says right there so

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.830 
him that's what Zod says right there so
I<00:00:34.950> don't<00:00:35.340> get<00:00:35.489> why<00:00:35.730> they<00:00:35.969> would<00:00:36.120> do<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.540> my

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
I don't get why they would do it but my

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.420 
I don't get why they would do it but my
thought<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.649> reason<00:00:37.920> why<00:00:38.010> they<00:00:38.160> want

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
thought is the reason why they want

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.040 
thought is the reason why they want
sought<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.450> kind<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.840> movie

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
sought is because it's kind of a movie
