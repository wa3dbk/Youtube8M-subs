taking once Groot is dead deal with any
of<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> ads<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.049> are<00:02:58.140> left<00:02:58.380> over<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:58.950> is

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
of the ads that are left over and it is

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.470 
of the ads that are left over and it is
this<00:02:59.310> point<00:02:59.610> you'll<00:02:59.819> just<00:02:59.940> need<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.150> split<00:03:00.390> up

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
this point you'll just need to split up

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.120 
this point you'll just need to split up
the<00:03:00.660> raid<00:03:00.810> again<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.500> deal<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.980> new

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
the raid again to deal with the new

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.890 
the raid again to deal with the new
artillery<00:03:02.670> from<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.299> point<00:03:03.480> onwards<00:03:03.810> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
artillery from this point onwards the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.199 
artillery from this point onwards the
fight<00:03:04.260> actually<00:03:04.799> becomes<00:03:05.160> incredibly<00:03:05.940> dull

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
fight actually becomes incredibly dull

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.420 
fight actually becomes incredibly dull
as<00:03:06.480> you'll<00:03:06.989> get<00:03:07.170> massive<00:03:07.590> gaps<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:08.040> time<00:03:08.069> where

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
as you'll get massive gaps of time where

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.039 
as you'll get massive gaps of time where
you<00:03:08.489> have<00:03:08.640> literally<00:03:09.030> nothing<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.720> do<00:03:09.840> but

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
you have literally nothing to do but

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.350 
you have literally nothing to do but
wait<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.349> ads<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:11.040> spawn<00:03:11.310> which<00:03:11.880> depending<00:03:12.269> on

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
wait for ads to spawn which depending on

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.210 
wait for ads to spawn which depending on
your<00:03:12.480> DPS<00:03:12.810> can<00:03:12.959> take<00:03:13.140> up<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.410> 10<00:03:13.650> or<00:03:13.680> even<00:03:13.830> 15

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
your DPS can take up to 10 or even 15

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.360 
your DPS can take up to 10 or even 15
seconds<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.120> really<00:03:15.360> extreme<00:03:15.750> cases<00:03:16.049> so<00:03:16.620> yeah

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
seconds in really extreme cases so yeah

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.310 
seconds in really extreme cases so yeah
it<00:03:17.609> does<00:03:17.790> become<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.150> little<00:03:18.329> bit<00:03:18.540> easier<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.230> if

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
it does become a little bit easier so if

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.410 
it does become a little bit easier so if
you<00:03:19.410> get<00:03:19.530> over<00:03:19.829> this<00:03:20.010> light<00:03:20.220> overlap<00:03:21.180> where

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
you get over this light overlap where

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.360 
you get over this light overlap where
you<00:03:21.510> have<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.780> deal<00:03:21.989> with<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.709> crusher<00:03:22.980> the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
you have to deal with the crusher the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.190 
you have to deal with the crusher the
transport<00:03:23.940> or<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.180> them<00:03:24.390> both<00:03:24.690> for<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.019> many
