00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.689
 hi friends, how are you? 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.430
 of the best and welcome to a new and 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.580
 of minecraft in which I bring you a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.039
 homo called ruby ​​gentlemen that well then 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.410
 as its name says it then this mode 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.179
 adds the ruby ore that is 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.640
 more or less like a diamond type but 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.739
 a little better gives you a little bit 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.239
 more than statistics then then 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.530
 it's fine to make the competition the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.720
 diamond and then not just search 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.269
 diamond for all of our eternity but 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.309
 that you can vary a bit with the ruby 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.079
 ruby but also costs is for the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.760
 mineral can confuse you with 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.329
 networks with that if so, let's go with 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.350
 little redstone this one 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.120
 well in this case we will not be able to 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.839
 see the difference by the texture back 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.629
 but then the point is that they look and 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.840
 Well, the ruby, let's look at it 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.090
 we are going to jump this little ruby is going 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.340
 to call this is that this name is what 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.030
 most obvious rubite rubite mines in the world 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.009
 and then already this signal is so so and so 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.530
 you have it so direct and if for some 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.659
 occasion or anything you have the gold 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.509
 because you simply put it there in the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.860
 oven and will give you the ruby ​​and what 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.500
 beautiful gentlemen 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.080
 and we wait like 10 years to not go 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.850
 our ruby and we already have our ruby ​​and 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.190
 so in a way that they gather a lot of rubies 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.620
 they will be able to do the classic thing 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.420
 typical not the tools and the armor 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.370
 not here we also have the block that 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.490
 is in this is nice is not like to 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.290
 make a ruby ​​floor whether or not it's a 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.200
 ruby statue because I think it is not 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.729
 ugly me that fits well and well its 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.770
 creative because it is very simple they are pure 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.140
 Rubies is not much minecraft logic 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.210
 this monkey is many things we already know 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.979
 all and well it's good to 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.440
 Everyone understands quickly 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.900
 so then with noise we can do what 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.910
 classic the armor this hard thermos and the 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.280
 set of tools just so let's go 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.410
 to compare now more or less this by 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.950
 difference between the diamond and the and the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.890
 rubin 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.280
 well here we have the diamond and the river 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.940
 limia for example on the ax 6.5 of 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.180
 damage the diamond of 6 and the sword of 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.000
 ruby 7.5 damage the diamond 7 is 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.739
 say for very little is better the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.350
 ruby then well it's fine it's fine 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.070
 ruby 5.5 and 5 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.980
 or 4.5 and 4 then by point 5 the ruby 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.670
 surpasses the diamond only that it does not have the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.100
 same duration 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.290
 that yes I have understood with a little 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.070
 less but but they go then they can 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.550
 do your leveling is this a peak of 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.440
 ruby and a shovel because here we conquer 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.510
 a mountain retraced us when we are 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.760
 in the mountains gentlemen I'm there is 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.410
 the Chinese wall how far away is that we 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.350
 they approach know like this from the side you see a 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.230
 little we have finished this we are going to 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.540
 say if we can find land I say 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.100
 that here is the stone and then 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.620
 we look very fast is not quite 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.630
 they are then it 's fine it's fine not 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.760
 mineral and for you there are also 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.010
 another way that brings minerals at the level 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.770
 that is going to bring them because soon I 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.690
 I think this has six mining nodes in the 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.160
 have which are very good or 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.870
 because he would give me a lot we know what 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.850
 sometimes it runs out of business no longer 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.310
 you know what's up, but with those 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.180
 minerals for a little more action more 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.370
 salsa to the tacos then gentlemen then 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.380
 if I'm not wrong according to me that's all 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.550
 not the typical postmen palito palito 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.920
 ruby palito stick 3 rubies this same 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.100
 do with the theme of the sword and the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.380
 ax palm stick ruby ​​what we have 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.710
 palito palito 2 ruiz and for all and 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.000
 all then it's practically the same 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.560
 so much needed to the alarm of 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.160
 diamond that looks very beautiful with that 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.160
 text for what 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.570
 rabat you are very epic 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.670
 and then because it gives us all 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.920
 full armor as you can see and then 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.640
 ruby obviously we are also going to 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.640
 try it for what 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.019
 we have the whole complete again 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.030
 then with the ruby ​​also a secret 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.960
 is that you can kill yourself and not 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.030
 suicidal since they said once like that 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.560
 yes it happens to say suicidal mom in case 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.960
 good to do this has been everything if it has 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.330
 liked then make sure you help me with 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.160
 a like because then this is like the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.050
 shows that they liked it and that therefore 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.790
 they want more epic motorcycles without anything else 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.380
 What to say, I say goodbye if you want to 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.210
 in the description will be for what 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.150
 go to your mods folder and then 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.150
 nothing more to say no 2 372 pisa
