00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:05.620 
hi this is brad beal on for truth about

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.990 
hi this is brad beal on for truth about
protein<00:00:05.980> calm<00:00:06.340> and<00:00:06.580> today<00:00:06.730> we're<00:00:06.880> answering

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 
protein calm and today we're answering

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.090 
protein calm and today we're answering
some<00:00:07.330> reader<00:00:07.540> mail<00:00:07.920> specifically<00:00:08.920> we're

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
some reader mail specifically we're

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.240 
some reader mail specifically we're
looking<00:00:09.280> at<00:00:09.340> how<00:00:09.520> much<00:00:09.670> protein<00:00:09.910> in<00:00:10.330> one<00:00:10.630> meal

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
looking at how much protein in one meal

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.250 
looking at how much protein in one meal
Jeremy<00:00:12.250> asked<00:00:12.549> me<00:00:12.730> that<00:00:13.119> long<00:00:13.900> story<00:00:14.139> short

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
Jeremy asked me that long story short

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.800 
Jeremy asked me that long story short
how<00:00:15.039> much<00:00:15.219> protein<00:00:15.369> can<00:00:15.670> you<00:00:15.730> actually<00:00:15.910> digest

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
how much protein can you actually digest

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.620 
how much protein can you actually digest
and<00:00:16.960> absorb<00:00:17.050> in<00:00:17.590> one<00:00:18.130> meal<00:00:18.369> he's<00:00:18.940> read<00:00:19.210> 30

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
and absorb in one meal he's read 30

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.240 
and absorb in one meal he's read 30
grams<00:00:19.960> and<00:00:20.289> a<00:00:20.349> number<00:00:20.500> of<00:00:20.650> different<00:00:20.949> fitness

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
grams and a number of different fitness

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.189 
grams and a number of different fitness
sites<00:00:21.460> so<00:00:21.910> he's<00:00:22.060> wondering<00:00:22.359> if<00:00:22.449> eats<00:00:22.599> 40<00:00:22.990> grams

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
sites so he's wondering if eats 40 grams

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.410 
sites so he's wondering if eats 40 grams
of<00:00:23.349> a<00:00:23.410> meal<00:00:23.589> does<00:00:24.279> 10<00:00:24.519> grams<00:00:24.789> just<00:00:24.939> simply<00:00:25.300> go

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
of a meal does 10 grams just simply go

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.929 
of a meal does 10 grams just simply go
to<00:00:25.449> waste<00:00:25.980> alright<00:00:26.980> so<00:00:27.160> Jeremy<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.550> answer<00:00:27.849> is

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
to waste alright so Jeremy the answer is

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.999 
to waste alright so Jeremy the answer is
this<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.599> strong<00:00:28.929> scientific<00:00:29.320> research<00:00:29.859> to

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
this the strong scientific research to

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.800 
this the strong scientific research to
support<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.519> concept<00:00:30.999> that<00:00:31.150> your<00:00:31.359> body<00:00:31.570> can

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
support the concept that your body can

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.660 
support the concept that your body can
up<00:00:32.020> and<00:00:32.230> down<00:00:32.439> regulate<00:00:32.950> its<00:00:33.220> ability<00:00:33.610> to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
up and down regulate its ability to

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.150 
up and down regulate its ability to
digest<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.180> absorb<00:00:34.300> protein<00:00:34.900> it's<00:00:35.560> based<00:00:35.890> on

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
digest and absorb protein it's based on

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.340 
digest and absorb protein it's based on
the<00:00:36.490> amount<00:00:36.940> of<00:00:37.090> protein<00:00:37.240> you<00:00:37.690> typically<00:00:38.080> eat

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
the amount of protein you typically eat

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.310 
the amount of protein you typically eat
so<00:00:39.130> if<00:00:39.550> you<00:00:39.760> typically<00:00:40.210> eat<00:00:40.480> very<00:00:40.840> small

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
so if you typically eat very small

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.040 
so if you typically eat very small
amounts<00:00:41.710> of<00:00:41.800> protein<00:00:41.950> both<00:00:42.940> in<00:00:43.270> a<00:00:43.540> single<00:00:43.870> meal

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
amounts of protein both in a single meal

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.630 
amounts of protein both in a single meal
and<00:00:44.230> throw<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.470> day<00:00:44.650> and<00:00:44.980> as<00:00:45.220> suddenly<00:00:45.520> you

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
and throw the day and as suddenly you

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.690

switch<00:00:46.000> to<00:00:46.030> higher<00:00:46.450> milk<00:00:46.750> your<00:00:47.470> body<00:00:47.650> may<00:00:48.460> not

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
switch to higher milk your body may not

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.970

be<00:00:48.910> ready<00:00:49.240> to<00:00:49.450> absorb<00:00:49.570> and<00:00:50.050> digest<00:00:50.170> or<00:00:50.620> digest

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
be ready to absorb and digest or digest

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.210 
be ready to absorb and digest or digest
and<00:00:51.070> absorb<00:00:51.160> that<00:00:52.120> much<00:00:52.180> protein<00:00:52.800> however<00:00:53.800> you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
and absorb that much protein however you

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.890 
and absorb that much protein however you
do<00:00:54.340> that<00:00:54.490> on<00:00:54.610> a<00:00:54.640> consistent<00:00:54.730> basis<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:55.630> your

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
do that on a consistent basis and your

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.600 
do that on a consistent basis and your
body<00:00:55.990> will<00:00:56.200> up<00:00:56.380> regulate<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.040> key<00:00:57.220> enzymes

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
body will up regulate the key enzymes

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.790 
body will up regulate the key enzymes
needed<00:00:58.090> to<00:00:58.510> take<00:00:58.720> care<00:00:59.050> of<00:00:59.200> that<00:00:59.380> extra

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
needed to take care of that extra

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.370 
needed to take care of that extra
protein<00:01:00.130> load<00:01:00.370> now<00:01:01.360> unfortunate<00:01:02.170> this<00:01:02.230> does

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
protein load now unfortunate this does

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.780 
protein load now unfortunate this does
not<00:01:02.530> mean<00:01:02.800> that<00:01:02.860> all<00:01:03.070> this<00:01:03.220> protein<00:01:03.520> is<00:01:03.610> simply

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
not mean that all this protein is simply

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.969 
not mean that all this protein is simply
going<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.059> building<00:01:04.449> muscle<00:01:04.479> right<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.619> lot<00:01:05.950> of

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
going to building muscle right a lot of

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.490 
going to building muscle right a lot of
the<00:01:06.130> enzymes<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.700> are<00:01:07.119> upregulated<00:01:08.050> are

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
the enzymes that are upregulated are

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.410 
the enzymes that are upregulated are
also<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.950> ones<00:01:08.980> of<00:01:09.250> oxidized<00:01:09.910> the<00:01:10.120> branched

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
also the ones of oxidized the branched

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.810 
also the ones of oxidized the branched
chain<00:01:10.510> amino<00:01:10.540> acids<00:01:11.140> so<00:01:11.410> it's<00:01:12.190> a<00:01:12.340> branch<00:01:12.580> chain

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
chain amino acids so it's a branch chain
