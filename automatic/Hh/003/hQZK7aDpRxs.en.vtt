00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
confused because it was really really

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.690 
confused because it was really really
good<00:03:36.810> but<00:03:37.080> then<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.350> was<00:03:37.410> sort<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.890> think<00:03:38.640> you

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
good but then it was sort of I think you

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.920 
good but then it was sort of I think you
need<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.850> put<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> little<00:03:39.180> more<00:03:39.300> content<00:03:39.780> in

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
need to put a little more content in

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.780 
need to put a little more content in
your<00:03:39.960> dances<00:03:40.440> like<00:03:40.890> everything<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.610> did

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
your dances like everything that you did

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.340 
your dances like everything that you did
was<00:03:42.000> fun<00:03:42.210> and<00:03:42.330> exciting<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:42.780> we<00:03:42.870> all<00:03:42.990> loved<00:03:43.230> it

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.990 
was fun and exciting and we all loved it
but<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.740> feel<00:03:44.160> like<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.400> could<00:03:44.550> do<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.670> little

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
but I feel like you could do a little

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.680 
but I feel like you could do a little
more<00:03:45.420> with<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.320> dances<00:03:46.680> okay<00:03:48.350> i<00:03:50.180> think<00:03:51.180> the

more with the dances okay i think the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.810 
more with the dances okay i think the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
hits of allergic to music because they

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.000 
hits of allergic to music because they
