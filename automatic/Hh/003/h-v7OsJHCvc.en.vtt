00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.479
 hi how about youtube friends here 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.759
 I'm in another boxing on a 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:11.910
 Case 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:15.909
 that he did protective as he wants to say 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.150
 for the nintendo 3ds is how can 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:24.590
 see is packed and is blue 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:29.960
 and light blue or light blue 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:34.160
 the fungus I chose because it combines a lot with 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.890
 the black and because the tri is that I have the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.440
 xl is also blue color then no 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.660
 I wanted to remove that color and choose 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.520
 this color as you can see has all 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.960
 the respective holes for 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.110
 cameras for the microphone and so on is 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.940
 aluminum and it also has all the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.520
 holes and from the back as 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.210
 can see is 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.610
 made of some kind of fabric 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.430
 that will protect the scratches from 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.350
 tri and that's not going to scratch and the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.080
 bottom part we also have the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.970
 housing with their respective holes for 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 the card the stylus the buttons and the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.250
 cartridge inlet 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.170
 and also has its respective protector 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.710
 inside so it does not scratch 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.180
 and as I said all the buttons is this 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.610
 product 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:36.820
 it cost me around 2 dollars 95 in 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.520
 ebay and I thought it was very a very 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.460
 good price 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.830
 and the shipping was free and good 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.930
 we will proceed to aa 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.710
 to remove it 3xl to put it and see 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:58.130
 how it works here would be built is xl 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:01.729
 we open it to see where it is 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.810
 if they put the covers and here we put the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.409
 from ahead 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.409
 Let's see 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.670
 efe 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.040
 we press and as you can see fits 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.829
 perfectly and the holes in the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.260
 camera and microphone are perfect on 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.480
 material is resistant and all ok 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.730
 how can you see the holes too 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.900
 of the volume and others are also 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.349
 perfect and it looks great and now the 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.450
 part of below we will also put 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.049
 we proceed to take out the casing and 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.049
 put it on 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.520
 why 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.689
 fits perfectly you do not have to do 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.389
 no effort and as you can see 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.879
 very very nice in my opinion I like it 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.469
 you see that it is protected by 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.770
 front and back all the holes 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:01.810
 they are perfect and aligned 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.000
 if you can get everything out normally and 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.130
 press the buttons and as is 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.120
 Aluminum is a very resistant material 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.810

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.520
