dual sport kind of urban styling now
it's<00:00:15.839> essentially<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> street<00:00:16.619> bike<00:00:16.800> helmet

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
it's essentially a street bike helmet

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.099 
it's essentially a street bike helmet
with<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.340> dirtbike<00:00:17.880> style<00:00:18.210> visor<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.930> but

with the dirtbike style visor on it but

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.750 
with the dirtbike style visor on it but
it<00:00:19.260> does<00:00:19.439> have<00:00:19.590> some<00:00:19.770> elongated<00:00:20.250> features<00:00:20.609> in

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
it does have some elongated features in

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.880 
it does have some elongated features in
the<00:00:20.850> front<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.750> really<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> hybrid<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the front this is really a hybrid of

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.439 
the front this is really a hybrid of
dirt<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.279> street<00:00:23.609> let's<00:00:23.820> talk<00:00:24.029> about<00:00:24.180> how

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
dirt and street let's talk about how

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.470 
dirt and street let's talk about how
it's<00:00:24.630> constructed<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.670> variant<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.269> made

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
it's constructed so the variant is made

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.439 
it's constructed so the variant is made
up<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.320> pretty<00:00:28.560> complex<00:00:29.010> shell<00:00:29.820> material<00:00:30.330> so

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
up of a pretty complex shell material so

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.120 
up of a pretty complex shell material so
that<00:00:30.480> uses<00:00:30.810> different<00:00:31.170> different<00:00:31.859> types<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that uses different different types of

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.340 
that uses different different types of
fibers<00:00:32.489> fiberglass<00:00:33.210> Dyneema<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.930> carbon

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
fibers fiberglass Dyneema and carbon

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.650 
fibers fiberglass Dyneema and carbon
fiber<00:00:34.590> those<00:00:35.160> are<00:00:35.399> blended<00:00:35.880> layered<00:00:36.390> together

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
fiber those are blended layered together

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.690 
fiber those are blended layered together
and<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.110> get<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.380> very<00:00:37.590> strong<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.370> light

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and you get this very strong but light

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.150 
and you get this very strong but light
outer<00:00:39.239> shell<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.410> manufactured<00:00:40.920> in

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
outer shell now it is manufactured in

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.100 
outer shell now it is manufactured in
different<00:00:41.460> sizes<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.090> something<00:00:42.960> that's

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
different sizes and something that's

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.229 
different sizes and something that's
important<00:00:43.559> about<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.550> vent<00:00:44.820> systems

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
important about it is the vent systems

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.200 
important about it is the vent systems
but<00:00:45.600> because<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.280> top<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.760> this

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
but because of this on the top this this

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.600 
but because of this on the top this this
visor<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.559> helps<00:00:49.890> channel<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> air

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
visor this really helps channel the air

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.250 
visor this really helps channel the air
and<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.879> plays<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> role<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> air<00:00:51.989> moves

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and it plays a role in how the air moves

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.959 
and it plays a role in how the air moves
around<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.620> helm<00:00:52.770> as<00:00:52.890> well<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.370> wind<00:00:53.699> tunnel

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
around the helm as well all wind tunnel

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
around the helm as well all wind tunnel
tested<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.780> development<00:00:55.320> system<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.829> does

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
tested in development system so it does

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.090 
tested in development system so it does
work<00:00:56.039> pretty<00:00:56.309> dang<00:00:56.879> good<00:00:57.149> alright<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
work pretty dang good alright so on the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.619 
work pretty dang good alright so on the
front<00:00:59.340> you're<00:00:59.460> gonna<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.789> some<00:01:00.000> some<00:01:00.390> vents

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
front you're gonna see some some vents

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.569 
front you're gonna see some some vents
here<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.170> chin<00:01:01.379> bar<00:01:01.530> has<00:01:01.739> two<00:01:02.039> vents<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.489> are

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
here the chin bar has two vents that are

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.700 
here the chin bar has two vents that are
actually<00:01:03.000> activated<00:01:03.570> inside<00:01:03.809> there's<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
actually activated inside there's a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.690 
actually activated inside there's a
multi-position

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
multi-position

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.609 
multi-position
closure<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.720> there<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.080> actually

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
closure in there so you can actually

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.560 
closure in there so you can actually
tailor<00:01:07.799> how<00:01:08.070> much<00:01:08.250> air<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.520> coming<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.360> is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
tailor how much air is coming in this is

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.960 
tailor how much air is coming in this is
also<00:01:09.780> adjustable<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.710> well<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.670> top

system air moves over the helmet across
the<00:01:29.579> back<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.150> spoiler<00:01:30.630> helps<00:01:30.930> pull<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> air

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the back this spoiler helps pull the air

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.499 
the back this spoiler helps pull the air
out<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.860> back<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.250> helmet<00:01:32.460> another<00:01:33.240> thing

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
out the back of the helmet another thing

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.999 
out the back of the helmet another thing
to<00:01:33.630> consider<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.799> great

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
to consider with this is it's great

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.890 
to consider with this is it's great
because<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.970> Sun<00:01:36.180> starts<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.509> drop<00:01:36.750> or

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
because as the Sun starts to drop or

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.270 
because as the Sun starts to drop or
whatever<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:37.710> use<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.189> your

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
whatever you can really use this to your

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.090
