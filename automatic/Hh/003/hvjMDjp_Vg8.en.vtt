the<00:02:06.869> motor<00:02:07.229> cool<00:02:10.580> it's<00:02:11.580> looking<00:02:11.880> great<00:02:12.030> it's

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
the motor cool it's looking great it's

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.100 
the motor cool it's looking great it's
got<00:02:12.569> electric<00:02:13.140> motor<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:15.180> about<00:02:15.660> how<00:02:15.870> much

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
got electric motor and about how much

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.229 
got electric motor and about how much
weight<00:02:16.410> does<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.950> add<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.220> batteries<00:02:18.000> in

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
weight does that add the batteries in

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.920 
weight does that add the batteries in
the<00:02:18.269> motor<00:02:18.540> well<00:02:19.470> I've<00:02:19.739> got<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.790> got<00:02:21.630> six

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the motor well I've got I got six

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.229 
the motor well I've got I got six
batteries<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.620> series<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.489> 72<00:02:23.970> volt

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
batteries in series so it's a 72 volt

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.960 
batteries in series so it's a 72 volt
system<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.260> batteries<00:02:25.680> are<00:02:25.860> about<00:02:26.099> 40<00:02:26.610> 45

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
system the batteries are about 40 45

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.050 
system the batteries are about 40 45
pounds<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.630> piece<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.680> when<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.370> get<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:30.000> all

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
pounds of piece so when you get that all

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.120 
pounds of piece so when you get that all
together<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:30.840> about<00:02:31.220> 240<00:02:32.220> 250<00:02:32.760> pounds

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
together it's about 240 250 pounds

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.729 
together it's about 240 250 pounds
however<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.430> don't<00:02:36.150> have<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.569> engine<00:02:37.079> back<00:02:37.470> there

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
however I don't have a engine back there

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.319 
however I don't have a engine back there
and<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.190> electric<00:02:38.549> motor<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.849> quite<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.120> bit

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
and the electric motor is quite a bit

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.949 
and the electric motor is quite a bit
lighter<00:02:39.510> than<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:39.989> full<00:02:40.799> engine<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.870> know

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
lighter than a full engine so you know

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.780 
lighter than a full engine so you know
until<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.319> get<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.620> on<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.769> scale<00:02:44.100> I'm<00:02:44.370> not<00:02:44.549> sure<00:02:44.730> I

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
until I get it on a scale I'm not sure I

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.009 
until I get it on a scale I'm not sure I
exactly<00:02:45.060> know<00:02:45.420> but<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> guess<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:46.230> probably

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.090 

and<00:02:52.019> you've<00:02:52.410> had<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> top<00:02:53.040> speed<00:02:53.069> so<00:02:53.880> far<00:02:54.239> of

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
and you've had a top speed so far of

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.860 
and you've had a top speed so far of
2530<00:02:56.100> I've<00:02:56.609> only<00:02:56.819> had<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.359> road<00:02:57.540> for<00:02:57.840> a

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
2530 I've only had it on the road for a

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.449 
2530 I've only had it on the road for a
handful<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.410> weeks<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.889> I'm<00:02:58.980> still<00:02:59.220> building

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
handful of weeks and I'm still building

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.270 
handful of weeks and I'm still building
confidence<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:03.180> at<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.720> point<00:03:04.010> drives<00:03:05.010> just

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
confidence and at that point drives just

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.390 
confidence and at that point drives just
fine<00:03:05.489> but<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:07.230> know<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.590> haven't<00:03:08.100> worked<00:03:08.190> up

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
fine but you know I haven't worked up

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.860 
fine but you know I haven't worked up
the<00:03:08.549> courage<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.850> take<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.269> as<00:03:09.359> fast<00:03:09.600> as<00:03:09.780> I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
the courage to take it as fast as I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.110 
the courage to take it as fast as I
think<00:03:10.109> I'll<00:03:10.230> go<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.859> can<00:03:11.370> tell<00:03:11.549> there's<00:03:11.790> plenty
