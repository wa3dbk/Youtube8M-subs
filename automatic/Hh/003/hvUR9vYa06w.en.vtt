were<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.190> with<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.730> decision<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.300> think

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
were you with that decision do you think

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.910 
were you with that decision do you think
he's<00:01:48.570> chosen<00:01:48.810> right<00:01:49.020> well<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> read<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
he's chosen right well I read in the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.070 
he's chosen right well I read in the
paper<00:01:50.010> that<00:01:50.340> quite<00:01:50.670> correctly<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:52.020> she

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
paper that quite correctly you know she

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.940 
paper that quite correctly you know she
stays<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> mile<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> half<00:01:53.130> well<00:01:53.870> and<00:01:54.870> that<00:01:55.410> he

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
stays a mile and a half well and that he

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.180 
stays a mile and a half well and that he
would<00:01:56.190> he's<00:01:56.490> not<00:01:56.520> entirely<00:01:57.060> sure<00:01:57.270> whether

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
would he's not entirely sure whether

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.500 
would he's not entirely sure whether
look<00:01:59.190> around<00:01:59.460> does<00:01:59.670> stay<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.120> mile<00:02:00.300> and<00:02:00.330> a

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
look around does stay the mile and a

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.140 
look around does stay the mile and a
half<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.900> probably<00:02:01.200> will<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.670> think<00:02:02.970> the

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
half you probably will and I think the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.790 
half you probably will and I think the
other<00:02:03.300> thing<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.440> three<00:02:04.650> row

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
other thing is you know the three row

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.880 
other thing is you know the three row
gets<00:02:05.010> to<00:02:05.160> pull<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> weights<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.890> Paul

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
gets to pull up the weights and Paul

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.679 
gets to pull up the weights and Paul
obviously<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.519> is<00:02:08.670> swayed<00:02:08.939> his<00:02:09.149> decision

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:09.689 
obviously that is swayed his decision

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.809 
obviously that is swayed his decision
it's<00:02:10.530> very<00:02:10.769> hard<00:02:11.189> to<00:02:11.310> assess<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
it's very hard to assess the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.850 
it's very hard to assess the
three-year-old<00:02:12.540> form

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
three-year-old form

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.890 
three-year-old form
three-year-old<00:02:14.490> colt<00:02:14.730> form<00:02:15.180> little<00:02:15.690> going

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
three-year-old colt form little going

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.830 
three-year-old colt form little going
against<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.440> older<00:02:16.710> horses<00:02:17.300> my<00:02:18.300> feeling<00:02:18.750> is

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
against the older horses my feeling is

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.480 
against the older horses my feeling is
that<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.140> three-year-old<00:02:19.650> colt<00:02:19.890> form<00:02:20.310> is

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
that the three-year-old colt form is

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.220 
that the three-year-old colt form is
stronger<00:02:21.030> probably<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.750> three-year-old

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
stronger probably in the three-year-old

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.840 
stronger probably in the three-year-old
filly<00:02:22.440> form<00:02:22.770> but<00:02:22.950> obviously<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.490> would<00:02:23.670> never

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
filly form but obviously I would never

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.670 
filly form but obviously I would never
have<00:02:24.030> worked<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.660> likes<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> Colts<00:02:25.590> and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
have worked the likes of the Colts and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.110 
have worked the likes of the Colts and
the<00:02:25.770> Phillies<00:02:26.100> aren't<00:02:26.280> declaring<00:02:27.000> tomorrow

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the Phillies aren't declaring tomorrow

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.400 
the Phillies aren't declaring tomorrow
together<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.630> would<00:02:27.870> never<00:02:28.020> dream<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.320> doing

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
together I would never dream of doing

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.340 
together I would never dream of doing
that<00:02:28.740> but<00:02:29.670> that's<00:02:30.210> my<00:02:30.450> suspicions<00:02:31.080> but<00:02:31.200> it's

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
that but that's my suspicions but it's

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.290 
that but that's my suspicions but it's
Millie<00:02:31.530> no<00:02:31.710> more<00:02:31.860> than<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.490> we<00:02:32.910> will<00:02:33.090> see

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
Millie no more than that and we will see

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.500 
Millie no more than that and we will see
I<00:02:33.540> think<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.080> race<00:02:34.260> itself<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:35.420> mean<00:02:36.420> I

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
I think in the race itself I mean I

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.390 
I think in the race itself I mean I
think<00:02:36.540> horses<00:02:37.200> being<00:02:37.590> slightly<00:02:37.860> overlooked

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
think horses being slightly overlooked

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.980 
think horses being slightly overlooked
