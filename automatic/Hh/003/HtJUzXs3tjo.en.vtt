00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.160
 the woman's bike is more and more these days 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.540
 to see more and the jet image 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.910
 a good folding bike has two 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.949
 qualities it must be a qualitative one 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.140
 bike are where you havesle free 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.269
 can last for years and it must be one 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.340
 decent fall mechanism like him 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.529
 does not have both characteristics 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.449
 then the bike shoots past its goal 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.279
 This also explains why solid 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.310
 folding bike has a certain price 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.230
 we therefore work with a company that 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.060
 specializes in development and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.710
 the production of folding bicycles are there 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.640
 different ways to make folding bikes 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.160
 to subdivide the wheel size 16 inches 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.870
 compact error small group is the disadvantage 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.640
 that you have slightly less comfort during 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.870
 cycling through that wants something 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.210
 be smaller 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.850
 the bike also steers a little more nervously 20 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.370
 inch cycles more comfort and more comfort 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.950
 but when folded it is 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.110
 bicycle larger gears 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.790
 internally this can go from an acceleration 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.119
 up to 8 speeds 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.070
 advantage is that the maintenance is 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.170
 disadvantages are the somewhat higher weight and 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.530
 the complex replacement of the inner tube 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.329
 external 7 8 or 9 gears 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.070
 this is lighter and simple with one 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.999
 flat tire type frame material 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.100
 aluminum 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:22.869
 this bike has a lighter and stiffer 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.359
 frame so you can work more efficiently 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.090
 cycling steel this bike is then again 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.229
 slightly heavier but cheaper in price 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.719
 must with the purchase of a folding bike 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.679
 first see what you specifically for him 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.359
 will use 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.130
 this is important for the size it 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.789
 number of gears and the choice of it 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.859
 frame 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.079
 commuting are important 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.439
 compact dimensions for example and 16 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.469
 inch 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.359
 because bike often has to be in case 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.729
 best internal and low-maintenance 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.429
 shift system with 3 gears 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.439
 usually trips or city trips are sufficient 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.240
 efficiency is important and therefore please 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.409
 your best and 20 inch model for the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.179
 gear and choose one 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.939
 derailleur gear which is lighter and 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.990
 an aluminum frame also switches faster 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.990
 gives you more returns
