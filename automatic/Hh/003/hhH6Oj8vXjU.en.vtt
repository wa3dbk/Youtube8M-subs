00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.720
 now I will write wood so we 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.780
 it turns out a sequence from the very 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.910
 light palate sweat medium spot this 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.889
 the grass could be done differently 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.109
 Now Iâ€™m talking about, we are just now 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.930
 so did not know that we must always even 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:23.980
 business and so is the brightest then medium 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.780
 then the darkest thing is that every 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.820
 selects the order of reference 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.320
 work itself 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.900
 there is no such rule that we should 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.030
 start with either the darkest or 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.030
 the brightest or the brightest 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.780
 no here everyone is guided by his 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.930
 logic that is, first to the idea we have to 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.030
 decide what we want our work and 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.860
 then, depending on this, we 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.809
 must build our whole process 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.250
 conducting work we must assume 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.980
 the end result that we have 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.469
 get and depending on that knowing 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.149
 how our material behaves knowing how 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.870
 it will be more convenient for us to work 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.329
 to build a process is therefore difficult at first 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.020
 understand what is better to start with or 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:09.159
 center so everything is logical to build 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.380
 use at the beginning of some such 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.600
 probably simple type rules from 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.639
 the brightest to the drift were from the very 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.729
 dark to the color itself or from the very 

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:22.829
 bright bright 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:26.009
 well and then there are some materials 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:30.490
 such as watercolor 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.069
 if you start too dark then you 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.740
 it will be very hard to brighten 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.289
 so some materials have their own 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.819
 features but again this does not mean 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.380
 that you must follow one 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.630
 the only rule just have to 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.119
 take into account the features and so now I 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.789
 proceed to the forest the forest we are not black is 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.939
 some dark blue green 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.399
 cold spot and now when i have 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.779
 the sky is taken and the grass is taken it will be easier for me 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.359
 pick this spot 

00:01:55.779 --> 00:02:00.999
 so that I have it in the first place was not 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.189
 black secondly she was gone 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:05.469
 too light in the third so she 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:09.080
 i'm gone too green and at 4 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.519
 so that it doesn't get too blue 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.819
 now I have here now on 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.760
 my palette is matched to the colors of the sky and 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.159
 grass and to them I will pick the color of the forest 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.400
 it turns out here here on the palette it 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:26.190
 abstract my landscape is just a set 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.140
 paint here i have this set of paint 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.870
 turned into a definite form in 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:39.799
 specific composition complex blue 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:39.799
 color can even be obtained 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.840
 addiction 1 add more green 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.730
 or more violet you get 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.730
 slightly greener or slightly more 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.739
 purple in general it will be order 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:08.720
 cold color some cold course 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:12.440
 novatek light the trees in our landscape 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.810
 they are also uneven thefts first 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.180
 some trees are further away from us 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.760
 they get colder some trees 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.900
 closer to us they become warmer during 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.310
 second these trees and well if it's not there 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.739
 solid pine trees grow 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.630
 if these are different tree species then they 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.849
 some trees are differently painted 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.500
 darker some trees are lighter 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.440
 some colder some warmer 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.329
 some bars are more rare by foliage 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:45.069
 some dense foliage and in addition 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:48.760
 trees change their color from top to bottom 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:53.090
 the light in our landscape shines from above 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:57.670
 so they are lit from above more than 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:00.100
 below that is above they will be lighter 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.160
 not only that the sun shines on them 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:08.060
 sometimes it happens that the sun shines 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:11.269
 still on them shine the sky because of this 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.489
 the cold light of the sky they are on top 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.840
 it becomes not only that lighter yet 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.500
 colder especially in the shadows is noticeable in 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.599
 tree tops 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:26.450
 above the crown is more transparent than the bottom 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:29.570
 from below it is tight and from above it skips 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.000
 more light and it turns out that the light is like 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.180
 would envelop the treetops at the expense of 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.960
 This and branches there more thin and also 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:43.630
 so the crown of the trees is lighter than 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.620
 down that is again i need 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.100
 primitively speaking i need to do 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.500
 stretching 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.490
 I shouldn't be like this here 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.050
 one color all over and such 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.750
 I shouldn't have one here either 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.760
 color all over 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.620
 first i pick colors on the palette if 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.610
 on the palette they will suit me then I can 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.610
 put them on canvas 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.050
 do not be afraid to make your head light 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:42.870
 thanks to my raw i 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.870
 I can write off the top of the head, that is, I 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.310
 just once i'm writing to the crown i 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.690
 I touch a piece of the sky and my sky 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.690
 written off with mother 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.770
 for this they dissolve in me 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.770
 in the sky 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:19.699
 blot paved color must be changed to 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:22.669
 this color I pick another color so 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:26.840
 Here it turned out such a horn 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:29.120
 good I'll correct it later if you
