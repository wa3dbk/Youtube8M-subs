00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.490
 ah 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.860
 now how arturo is welcome 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.439
 Dotcom today we have the 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.439
 lenovo yoga 13 to refer 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.940
 what stood out was yoga as he uses his 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.640
 name tells us is the versatile thing that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.380
 there ultrabooks the tablets we can 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.330
 use laptop mode for an excellent 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.100
 keyboard and tractor but in any 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.570
 moment we can just throw a 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.910
 backward screen using the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:01:01.170
 keyboard as a base and put what 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:03.210
 new flame mode of presentation others 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.979
 modes available are the tent mode that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.080
 maybe it's practical when we're seeing 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.550
 something in netflix or some other video and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.380
 we can usually recline 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:16.860
 completely the screen against the base 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.600
 to use it as a tablet in terms of 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 characteristics we have a usual 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.710
 i5 core processor or four gigabytes of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.750
 ram an integrated video card this 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.360
 4000 graphics of interest two usb ports 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.170
 one of which is 3.0 and the reader of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.170
 cards themselves 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.290
 The size and weight is not ideal for 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.970
 use it as tablets because it weighs 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.490
 about I want and half and the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.860
 13.3 inches of the screen do it 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.200
 something big for the category in this 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.360
 felt maybe for yoga 11-s that 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.370
 will launch later in this year be 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.330
 ideal for those who plan to use a 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.330
 good weather as a tablet 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.440
 despite this however I enjoyed 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.120
 quite my time with this laptop is 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.980
 At this time of mine, she works now 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.870
 not only offers the features to 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.090
 that we are already used to as 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.620
 portability battery life but 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.299
 that the extras like the ability to 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.739
 transform and fulfill different roles 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.739
 makes it extremely versatile
