is a correction another correction that

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.810

what<00:00:37.020> happened<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.980> know<00:00:38.070> nothing<00:00:38.280> goes<00:00:38.610> up

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
what happened you know nothing goes up

what happened you know nothing goes up
in<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> straight<00:00:39.270> line<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.780> look<00:00:40.649> at<00:00:40.770> all<00:00:40.890> markets

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
in a straight line I look at all markets

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430 
in a straight line I look at all markets
they<00:00:41.399> fluctuate<00:00:41.640> even<00:00:42.450> when<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.840> strong

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
they fluctuate even when you have strong

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.470 
they fluctuate even when you have strong
bullish<00:00:43.770> markets<00:00:44.309> near<00:00:44.760> our<00:00:44.910> Corrections

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
bullish markets near our Corrections

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.209 
bullish markets near our Corrections
within<00:00:46.140> those<00:00:46.260> ball<00:00:46.500> moves<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
within those ball moves and then the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.900 
within those ball moves and then the
market<00:00:47.579> resumes<00:00:48.320> its<00:00:49.320> its<00:00:50.250> move<00:00:50.489> let's<00:00:50.850> move

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
market resumes its its move let's move

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970 
market resumes its its move let's move
upward<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.440> that's<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.829> have

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
upward and I think that's what you have

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.400 
upward and I think that's what you have
in<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.430> gold<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:55.050> reason<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.379> say

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
in here in gold and the reason I say

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.979 
in here in gold and the reason I say
that<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.829> simple<00:00:56.280> because<00:00:57.059> if<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.660> look<00:00:57.809> back

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that is simple because if you look back

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.770 
that is simple because if you look back
in<00:00:58.199> September<00:00:58.739> back<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.820> September<00:01:00.390> sixth

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
in September back in September sixth

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.820 
in September back in September sixth
which<00:01:01.140> wasn't<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.530> long<00:01:01.770> ago<00:01:03.379> gold<00:01:04.379> made<00:01:04.680> our

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
which wasn't that long ago gold made our

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.859 
which wasn't that long ago gold made our
record<00:01:05.159> high<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.729> I'm<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.240> looking<00:01:06.570> at<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
record high and I'm just looking at the

that high in late last month the eighth
of<00:02:00.960> November<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.090> that's<00:02:03.090> that's<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.450> pretty

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
of November so that's that's a pretty

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.870 
of November so that's that's a pretty
strong<00:02:03.750> government<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.740> mean<00:02:05.219> if<00:02:05.460> goal<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
strong government so I mean if goal is a

happened to housing prices to mean

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.760 
happened to housing prices to mean
that's<00:02:20.460> wobble<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.410> bubble

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
that's wobble and that is that bubble

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.260 
that's wobble and that is that bubble
that<00:02:22.890> was<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.130> bottle<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.700> mean<00:02:23.880> he<00:02:23.970> saw<00:02:24.150> it

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
that was a bottle I mean he saw it

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.620 
that was a bottle I mean he saw it
serious<00:02:24.830> serious<00:02:25.830> moves<00:02:26.310> down<00:02:26.550> but<00:02:26.910> from

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
serious serious moves down but from

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.530 
serious serious moves down but from
market<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.050> come<00:02:28.230> back<00:02:28.410> quickly<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.980> this

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
market to come back quickly like this

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.170 
market to come back quickly like this
you<00:02:30.540> know<00:02:30.740> that's<00:02:31.740> not<00:02:31.920> what<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.130> market<00:02:33.090> that's

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you know that's not what a market that's

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.320 
you know that's not what a market that's
a<00:02:33.300> bubble<00:02:33.600> does<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.730> know<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:35.880> see<00:02:36.150> this

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
a bubble does so you know you see this

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.780 
a bubble does so you know you see this
move<00:02:36.570> down<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.800> another<00:02:38.070> correction<00:02:38.400> that's

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
move down it's another correction that's

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.700 
move down it's another correction that's
why<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.300> going<00:02:39.570> down<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.780> lot<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.290> reasons

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
why is it going down a lot of reasons

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.490 
why is it going down a lot of reasons
you<00:02:40.890> know<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.040> have<00:02:41.340> short-term<00:02:42.180> traders<00:02:42.810> you

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
you know you have short-term traders you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.370 
you know you have short-term traders you
have<00:02:43.620> profit<00:02:44.100> taking<00:02:44.340> your<00:02:45.240> expiration<00:02:45.990> and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
have profit taking your expiration and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.560 
have profit taking your expiration and
that's<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.530> reason<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.800> mean<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.980> lot<00:02:50.250> of

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
that's the reason I mean a lot of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.420 
that's the reason I mean a lot of
markets<00:02:51.570> have<00:02:51.930> Corrections<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:53.280> this

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
markets have Corrections and I see this

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.010 
markets have Corrections and I see this
as<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.610> correction<00:02:54.120> i<00:02:54.270> do<00:02:54.360> not<00:02:54.600> think<00:02:54.630> it's<00:02:54.960> a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
as a correction i do not think it's a

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.850 
as a correction i do not think it's a
bubble<00:02:55.320> at<00:02:55.410> all<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:58.170> reason<00:02:58.560> i<00:02:58.680> don't

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
bubble at all and the reason i don't

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.830 
bubble at all and the reason i don't
think<00:02:59.010> it's<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.190> bubble<00:02:59.490> is<00:02:59.580> because<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.630> have

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
think it's a bubble is because you have

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.390 
think it's a bubble is because you have
to<00:03:00.990> look<00:03:01.140> at<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.320> unlined<00:03:01.710> fundamentals

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
to look at the unlined fundamentals

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.030 
to look at the unlined fundamentals
markets<00:03:03.090> move<00:03:03.360> because<00:03:04.050> they<00:03:04.230> have<00:03:04.380> strong

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
markets move because they have strong

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.700 
markets move because they have strong
fundamentals<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.940> they're<00:03:06.180> moving<00:03:06.480> upward<00:03:06.810> if

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
fundamentals if they're moving upward if

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.170 
fundamentals if they're moving upward if
they<00:03:07.950> have<00:03:08.010> bearish<00:03:08.460> fundamentals<00:03:09.060> they're

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
they have bearish fundamentals they're

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.180 
they have bearish fundamentals they're
going<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.360> move<00:03:09.480> downward<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.170> if<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.040> look

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
going to move downward and if you look

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.540 
going to move downward and if you look
at<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.370> environment<00:03:11.730> right<00:03:12.180> now<00:03:12.210> we<00:03:12.660> have

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
at the environment right now we have

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.750 
at the environment right now we have
high<00:03:14.550> deficits<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.360> lot<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.320> spending<00:03:16.860> we<00:03:17.610> have

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
high deficits a lot of spending we have

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.270 
high deficits a lot of spending we have
inflation<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.630> proof<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:20.010> look<00:03:20.160> around

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
inflation and the proof just look around

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.890 
inflation and the proof just look around
you<00:03:20.580> look<00:03:20.760> at<00:03:20.880> all<00:03:21.000> commodities<00:03:21.510> look<00:03:21.720> at<00:03:21.810> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
you look at all commodities look at the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.750 
you look at all commodities look at the
crb<00:03:22.290> index<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:22.770> year<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.160> know<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.340> see

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
crb index this year you know you see

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.130 
crb index this year you know you see
commodities<00:03:24.330> of<00:03:24.420> course<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.780> board<00:03:24.960> this

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
commodities of course the board this

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.690 
commodities of course the board this
year<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.620> I've<00:03:25.710> made<00:03:25.830> record<00:03:26.250> highs<00:03:26.430> this

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
year that I've made record highs this

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.230 
year that I've made record highs this
year<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:28.140> it's<00:03:28.320> not<00:03:28.440> just<00:03:28.500> cold<00:03:29.000> lot<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.090> other

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
year so it's not just cold lot of other

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.050 
year so it's not just cold lot of other
markets<00:03:30.630> doing<00:03:30.960> it<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.320> then<00:03:31.950> one<00:03:32.850> way<00:03:33.000> to

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
markets doing it and then one way to

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.620 
markets doing it and then one way to
look<00:03:33.270> at<00:03:33.390> gold<00:03:34.100> as<00:03:35.100> far<00:03:35.370> as<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.610> price<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:36.210> to

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
look at gold as far as the price is to

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.130 
look at gold as far as the price is to
look<00:03:36.810> at<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:38.160> value<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.760> money<00:03:38.970> if<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:40.020> have

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
look at the value of money if you have

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.290 
look at the value of money if you have
inflation<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:41.340> value<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.760> money<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.060> going

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
inflation the value of money is going

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.210 
inflation the value of money is going
down<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:43.050> it's<00:03:43.200> not<00:03:43.320> necessarily<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.980> price

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
down so it's not necessarily the price

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.370 
down so it's not necessarily the price
of<00:03:44.400> gold<00:03:44.430> going<00:03:44.790> up<00:03:45.060> it's<00:03:45.630> just<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:45.960> money's

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
of gold going up it's just the money's

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.340 
of gold going up it's just the money's
worth<00:03:46.560> less<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.850> prices<00:03:48.300> of<00:03:48.540> things<00:03:48.600> go<00:03:49.200> up

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
worth less the prices of things go up

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.110 
worth less the prices of things go up
that's<00:03:49.590> what<00:03:49.710> inflation<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.400> that's<00:03:50.850> really

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
that's what inflation is that's really

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.180 
that's what inflation is that's really
the<00:03:51.210> definition<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.810> inflation<00:03:52.320> it's<00:03:53.010> the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
the definition of inflation it's the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.940 
the definition of inflation it's the
money<00:03:53.370> losing<00:03:53.790> value<00:03:54.140> so<00:03:55.140> what<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:55.710> have<00:03:55.740> is

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
money losing value so what you have is

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.690 
money losing value so what you have is
the<00:03:56.640> price<00:03:56.880> of<00:03:56.910> gold<00:03:57.500> reflecting<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.700> lower

something else to consider a lot of I

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.180 
something else to consider a lot of I
mean<00:04:37.420> how<00:04:37.540> many<00:04:37.600> cell<00:04:37.930> phones<00:04:37.960> have<00:04:38.710> gold<00:04:39.040> in

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
mean how many cell phones have gold in

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.950 
mean how many cell phones have gold in
them<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.550> how<00:04:40.120> many<00:04:40.210> cell<00:04:40.510> phones<00:04:40.540> already

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
them and how many cell phones already

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.130 
them and how many cell phones already
recycled<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:42.640> I<00:04:43.000> mean<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:43.900> know<00:04:43.990> you're

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
recycled so I mean you know you're

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.860 
recycled so I mean you know you're
talking<00:04:44.320> about<00:04:45.120> factors<00:04:46.120> that<00:04:46.330> can<00:04:46.480> make<00:04:46.720> the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
talking about factors that can make the

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.520 
talking about factors that can make the
price<00:04:47.080> of<00:04:47.260> gold<00:04:47.440> go<00:04:47.800> up<00:04:47.980> not<00:04:48.490> just<00:04:49.110> because<00:04:50.110> of

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
price of gold go up not just because of

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.260 
price of gold go up not just because of
what<00:04:50.800> i<00:04:50.830> was<00:04:50.980> talking<00:04:51.160> about<00:04:51.400> fiscally<00:04:52.090> and

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
what i was talking about fiscally and

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.510 
what i was talking about fiscally and
the<00:04:52.930> fact<00:04:53.170> that<00:04:53.260> gold<00:04:53.920> is<00:04:54.070> looked<00:04:54.280> at<00:04:54.400> his

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
the fact that gold is looked at his

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.580 
the fact that gold is looked at his
money<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:55.030> mean<00:04:55.330> it<00:04:55.420> has<00:04:55.570> been<00:04:55.810> for<00:04:56.260> thousands

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
money I mean it has been for thousands

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.960 
money I mean it has been for thousands
of<00:04:56.680> years<00:04:56.740> we<00:04:57.130> used<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.370> have<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.520> gold<00:04:57.760> standard

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
of years we used to have a gold standard

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.480 
of years we used to have a gold standard
so<00:04:58.540> that's<00:04:58.660> one<00:04:59.080> thing<00:04:59.290> it's<00:05:00.100> affecting<00:05:00.430> the

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
so that's one thing it's affecting the

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.770 
so that's one thing it's affecting the
price<00:05:00.670> of<00:05:00.820> gold<00:05:00.850> because<00:05:01.210> of<00:05:01.330> what's<00:05:01.510> happened

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
price of gold because of what's happened

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.000 
price of gold because of what's happened
with<00:05:01.870> inflation<00:05:02.230> but<00:05:02.470> then<00:05:02.620> you<00:05:02.710> have<00:05:02.860> the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
with inflation but then you have the

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.220 
with inflation but then you have the
industrial<00:05:03.520> demand<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:04.120> then<00:05:04.750> of<00:05:04.870> course<00:05:04.900> you

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
industrial demand and then of course you

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.990 
industrial demand and then of course you
have<00:05:05.380> another<00:05:05.710> demand<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.340> that's<00:05:06.460> jewelry

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
have another demand and that's jewelry

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.490 
have another demand and that's jewelry
look<00:05:07.240> at<00:05:07.330> all<00:05:07.420> the<00:05:07.510> jewelry<00:05:07.750> that's<00:05:08.080> made<00:05:08.320> of

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
look at all the jewelry that's made of

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.980 
look at all the jewelry that's made of
gold<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:09.300> here's<00:05:10.300> something<00:05:10.480> else<00:05:10.630> I<00:05:10.780> want<00:05:10.960> to

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990

talk about if you look at other

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.870 
talk about if you look at other
commodities<00:05:12.520> right<00:05:14.190> even<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.460> ones<00:05:15.670> that<00:05:15.790> we

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
commodities right even the ones that we

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.630 
commodities right even the ones that we
depend<00:05:16.030> on<00:05:16.390> so<00:05:16.930> much<00:05:17.140> like<00:05:17.470> wheat<00:05:17.770> corn<00:05:18.370> and

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
depend on so much like wheat corn and

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.270 
depend on so much like wheat corn and
you<00:05:19.540> know<00:05:19.660> grains<00:05:20.020> that<00:05:20.200> are<00:05:20.350> grown<00:05:20.620> you<00:05:20.950> know

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
you know grains that are grown you know

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.360 
you know grains that are grown you know
farmer<00:05:21.820> can<00:05:21.940> go<00:05:22.060> out<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:22.240> grow<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:23.260> I<00:05:23.470> mean<00:05:24.280> you

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
farmer can go out and grow it I mean you

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.190 
farmer can go out and grow it I mean you
can<00:05:24.490> actually<00:05:24.850> go<00:05:25.030> out<00:05:25.180> there<00:05:25.360> and<00:05:25.420> grow<00:05:25.780> corn

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
can actually go out there and grow corn

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.400 
can actually go out there and grow corn
you<00:05:26.440> can<00:05:26.590> grow<00:05:26.800> wheat<00:05:27.160> chicken<00:05:27.700> grow<00:05:28.120> old<00:05:28.420> you

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
you can grow wheat chicken grow old you

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.610 
you can grow wheat chicken grow old you
have<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.770> find<00:05:30.160> it<00:05:30.370> and<00:05:30.930> you<00:05:31.930> got<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.110> mind<00:05:32.410> that

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
have to find it and you got a mind that

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.160 
have to find it and you got a mind that
it's<00:05:32.740> difficult<00:05:33.040> it's<00:05:33.670> expensive<00:05:34.510> it's<00:05:34.840> labor

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
it's difficult it's expensive it's labor

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.750 
it's difficult it's expensive it's labor
intensive<00:05:35.320> and<00:05:35.890> that's<00:05:36.070> built<00:05:36.400> into<00:05:36.580> the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
intensive and that's built into the

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.850 
intensive and that's built into the
price<00:05:36.970> as<00:05:37.210> well<00:05:37.830> so<00:05:38.830> I<00:05:40.020> mean<00:05:41.020> it's<00:05:41.230> a<00:05:41.350> very<00:05:41.380> very

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
price as well so I mean it's a very very

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.640 
price as well so I mean it's a very very
important<00:05:42.580> metal<00:05:42.880> it's<00:05:43.030> very<00:05:43.270> desired<00:05:43.780> it's

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
important metal it's very desired it's

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.350 
important metal it's very desired it's
where<00:05:45.010> it's<00:05:45.850> beautiful<00:05:46.510> and<00:05:47.160> and<00:05:48.160> this<00:05:49.150> is

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
where it's beautiful and and this is

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.530 
where it's beautiful and and this is
these<00:05:49.750> factors<00:05:50.610> what's<00:05:51.610> going<00:05:51.880> to<00:05:52.150> contribute

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540

to<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:52.960> increase<00:05:53.350> in<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:53.560> price<00:05:53.740> of<00:05:53.770> gold<00:05:54.750> so

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
to the increase in the price of gold so

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.550 
to the increase in the price of gold so
they<00:05:56.470> answered<00:05:56.890> I<00:05:57.240> mean<00:05:58.240> my<00:05:58.570> opinion<00:05:58.990> no<00:05:59.260> I

they answered I mean my opinion no I
don't<00:05:59.740> think<00:05:59.830> gold<00:06:00.160> is<00:06:00.250> on<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:00.430> bubble<00:06:00.760> I<00:06:00.940> think

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
don't think gold is on a bubble I think

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.090 
don't think gold is on a bubble I think
because<00:06:01.690> of<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.080> current<00:06:02.350> environment<00:06:02.860> and

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
because of the current environment and

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.950 
because of the current environment and
then<00:06:03.670> of<00:06:03.820> course<00:06:04.030> you<00:06:04.180> get<00:06:04.330> on<00:06:04.510> the<00:06:04.660> industrial

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
then of course you get on the industrial

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.680 
then of course you get on the industrial
demand<00:06:05.650> for<00:06:05.920> it<00:06:06.010> I<00:06:06.130> think<00:06:06.820> gold<00:06:07.060> over<00:06:07.390> the<00:06:07.480> long

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
demand for it I think gold over the long

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.630 
demand for it I think gold over the long
term<00:06:08.130> it's<00:06:09.130> going<00:06:09.250> to<00:06:09.280> continue<00:06:09.640> to<00:06:09.910> go<00:06:10.030> up<00:06:11.640> so

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
term it's going to continue to go up so

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.640 
term it's going to continue to go up so
that's<00:06:12.820> my<00:06:13.000> opinion<00:06:13.270> and<00:06:13.540> that<00:06:14.320> is<00:06:14.530> the

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
that's my opinion and that is the

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.890 
that's my opinion and that is the
perspective<00:06:15.190> of<00:06:15.340> the<00:06:15.460> think<00:06:15.670> tank<00:06:15.880> I<00:06:16.180> would
