00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.170
 who die before directly 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.460
 invited this morning to pay attention 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.490
 evening in the six meters action 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.000
 cairn offensive actions collectively 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.000
 in the pits 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.650
 well the beginning of the match 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.300
 I told you earlier 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.400
 it's going to go fast and well this action the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.900
 letter remained empty its June share 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.329
 it's going to be windy at the door a 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.040
 release from june 2 to saint paul to 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.329
 the cookie cutter the deviation here from 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.290
 suarez outside right foot is 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.720
 absolutely superb 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.340
 alas the kidney shot to pass the tray 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.680
 the rest is the big class 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.600
 the perfect center left foot m bokani 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.359
 dancla bottom of the goal 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.899
 in the future three minutes of play this match 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:01:00.610
 at the top is launched live and in front 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.890
 mbokani who marks m okani we know the 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.540
 immense talent that he has but also this 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.820
 complementarity that it finds with the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.619
 other players who make the difference at 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.780
 offensive level and mam yovanovitch is 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.170
 and around that leaders 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.580
 had imagined at the beginning of the season a 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.159
 a little bit of space to say apart 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.899
 the center it is perfect for ming 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.229
 that's the release now of vasile 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.970
 vadis odjidja that was countered with 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.340
 vest 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.720
 10 pc sew it back again 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.950
 attack for sport a year in Act 1 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.299
 and i have rolled sanÃ© will go there alone 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.149
 problem is that good live and 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.469
 tactically very well placed sweat 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:43.229
 in the field there is virtually no 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:46.289
 of hope its not convocation at the moment 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.090
 can talk about the tactical aspect ace 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.619
 to surprise by penetration the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.229
 second water line didia yeah that's 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.069
 there that we find the vadis of the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.619
 beginning of season 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.270
 percussive there is an excellent opening 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.920
 I think it's erding who are coming 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.929
 to find it in the interval between 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.270
 spoiled and June at it does the most 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.130
 difficult unfortunately it's off 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.049
 frame 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.060
 while proto remains strong hope 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.750
 is apparently alone who has 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.680
 wounded hope that's because that's what 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.940
 who gives a good ball for to say 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.349
 if it was a bit difficult to control 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.920
 and boca ni morgane for yovanovich 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.450
 skaft but offers a solution to 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.140
 left 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.140
 ivanov and well 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.680
 the realism I had said 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.680
 to wear no acts on this shot there 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.910
 that part do more 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.230
 quickly realize it 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.230
 mbokani anarchist 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.360
 we saw 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.760
 exactly 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.760
 the best of all months 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.060
 yovanovitch who brand look for the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.280
 sporting of anderlecht 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.230
 this is his fifth goal this season 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.230
 bypass is also the origin of the rockrose 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.600
 these supports inside right foot no 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.270
 luck for keeping flocks 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.590
 gillet who also takes over 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.960
 stenman with mbokani now everything 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.300
 strikes in the little basquaise net no 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.570
 not to 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.570
 so 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.590
 cross-section of dongs for lestienne 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:41.740
 lestienne its center is perfect for 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:45.940
 akouala who wins by steadman biglia 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.940
 she accelerates it makes summits 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.860
 the elbow rears on 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.460
 will come out bold and rich td 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.460
 the match is over 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.020
 liveliness on the first meters 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.550
 This is exceptional 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.540
 what 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.420
 he has a stroke of kidney anyway 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.069
 amazing which player because that's 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.989
 on the spot culv and his defenders of 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.030
 bruges in bins to three meters advanced 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.829
 but do not know where he is and boys from 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.989
 act and among the orgas and will leave 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.820
 few apartments had it been necessary 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.610
 we must we must be consistent and yet 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.900
 this time an easy angle I deserved 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.740
 that's why he won 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.210
 necessarily the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.550
 if the tories there he has four meters on 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.470
 attack he manages to win his duel against 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.120
 the ferry and elsewhere is fast enough and 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.540
 scored a splendid goal 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.199
 that's what they said there was 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.790
 but still a two tweeters 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:48.080
 since he does not even touch the ball 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:52.569
 in this part will just have time to 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:57.099
 to thank stenman here is bruges 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.099
 bow heavily
