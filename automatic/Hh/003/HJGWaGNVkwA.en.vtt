right on that liner one and then lightly

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.190 
right on that liner one and then lightly
lift<00:02:55.530> up<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:57.000> smudge<00:02:58.460> the<00:02:59.460> liner<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.050> way

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
lift up to smudge the liner so that way

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.020 
lift up to smudge the liner so that way
you<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.770> nice<00:03:01.920> gradient<00:03:02.190> fade<00:03:02.610> from<00:03:02.850> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030

you have a nice gradient fade from the
solid<00:03:03.240> black<00:03:03.600> right<00:03:04.020> at<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.260> lash<00:03:04.410> line<00:03:04.440> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
solid black right at the lash line and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.630 
solid black right at the lash line and
then<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.340> will<00:03:05.520> fade<00:03:05.820> out<00:03:06.680> into<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.040> red<00:03:08.340> color

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640

then it will fade out into the red color
that's<00:03:08.880> on<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.300> lid<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.970> now<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.390> looks

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
that's on the lid so now it looks

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.690 
that's on the lid so now it looks
something<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:14.160> can<00:03:14.310> see<00:03:14.580> it's

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
something like that you can see it's

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.430 
something like that you can see it's
really<00:03:15.060> dark<00:03:15.210> at<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.540> glass<00:03:15.720> line<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.350> then

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
really dark at the glass line and then

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.440 
really dark at the glass line and then
the<00:03:16.470> black<00:03:16.860> just<00:03:17.220> fades<00:03:17.520> out<00:03:17.700> into<00:03:18.150> my<00:03:18.270> other

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
the black just fades out into my other

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.270 
the black just fades out into my other
colors<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.230> then<00:03:19.590> everything<00:03:19.980> else<00:03:20.100> just

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
colors and then everything else just

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.190 
colors and then everything else just
fades<00:03:20.700> out<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.210> then<00:03:21.810> I'm<00:03:21.900> going<00:03:21.990> to<00:03:22.080> take

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
fades out and then I'm going to take

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.080
