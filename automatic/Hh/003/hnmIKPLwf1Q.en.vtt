not always the case with titanium is the

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.760 
not always the case with titanium is the

result the aesthetic results are far

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.740 
result the aesthetic results are far

black lines or around the teeth usually

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.870 
black lines or around the teeth usually
it's<00:01:43.330> because<00:01:43.390> they<00:01:43.720> have<00:01:44.040> meddled<00:01:45.040> in<00:01:45.700> their

over time to show those black lines
their<00:01:52.960> cornea<00:01:53.290> implants<00:01:53.710> much<00:01:54.370> different<00:01:54.900> the

their cornea implants much different the

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.230 
their cornea implants much different the
gums<00:01:56.200> love<00:01:56.740> zirconia<00:01:57.369> so<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.610> gums<00:01:57.850> tend<00:01:58.150> to

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
gums love zirconia so the gums tend to

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.390 
gums love zirconia so the gums tend to
attach<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:58.690> zirconia<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.320> lot<00:01:59.500> better<00:01:59.740> than

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
attach to zirconia a lot better than

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.760 
attach to zirconia a lot better than
around<00:02:00.610> titanium<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.869> when<00:02:02.049> that<00:02:02.260> happens

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
around titanium and when that happens

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.039 
around titanium and when that happens
that<00:02:03.070> means<00:02:03.250> oh<00:02:03.340> come<00:02:03.580> doesn't<00:02:04.000> move<00:02:04.180> if<00:02:04.810> the

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
that means oh come doesn't move if the

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.170 
that means oh come doesn't move if the
gum<00:02:05.290> doesn't<00:02:05.560> move<00:02:05.860> then<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.729> implant

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
gum doesn't move then the implant

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.029 
gum doesn't move then the implant
doesn't<00:02:07.479> show<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.110> that's<00:02:08.619> what<00:02:08.769> happens

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
doesn't show and that's what happens

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.679 
doesn't show and that's what happens
with<00:02:09.159> metal<00:02:09.459> implants<00:02:09.849> when<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.090> good<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.479> gum

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:10.689 
with metal implants when a good the gum

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.210 
with metal implants when a good the gum
moves<00:02:10.959> away<00:02:11.170> from<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.500> metal<00:02:11.769> because<00:02:11.980> gum

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
moves away from the metal because gum

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.570 
moves away from the metal because gum
doesn't<00:02:12.459> like<00:02:12.760> them<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:14.140> much<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.709> over

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
doesn't like them that much and over

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.780 
doesn't like them that much and over
time<00:02:15.939> you<00:02:16.120> start<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.510> see<00:02:16.659> black<00:02:16.870> lines<00:02:17.110> around

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
time you start to see black lines around

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.699 
time you start to see black lines around
the<00:02:18.790> teeth<00:02:19.000> or<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.080> crowns<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.439> the<00:02:20.560> other
