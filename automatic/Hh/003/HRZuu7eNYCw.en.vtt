00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.220 
so I'm about to head down to get my hair
done<00:00:04.770> because<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:05.460> figured<00:00:05.910> it's<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.660> new<00:00:06.810> year

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
done because I figured it's a new year

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.709 
done because I figured it's a new year
and<00:00:07.470> it's<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.099> first<00:00:08.400> day<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.210> new<00:00:09.360> Mayan

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
and it's the first day of the new Mayan

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.080 
and it's the first day of the new Mayan
calendar<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.160> just<00:00:11.309> decided<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.849> time

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
calendar and so I just decided it's time

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.480 
calendar and so I just decided it's time
for<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> change<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.049> do<00:00:13.170> something<00:00:13.530> new<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.040> as

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
for a change and do something new and as

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.240 
for a change and do something new and as
you<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.730> see<00:00:14.849> my<00:00:15.000> hair<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.240> very<00:00:15.599> very<00:00:16.590> long<00:00:17.039> so

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
you can see my hair is very very long so

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.179 
you can see my hair is very very long so
I<00:00:17.340> decided<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.859> kind<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.890> want<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.070> keep

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
I decided that I kind of want to keep

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.740 
I decided that I kind of want to keep
the<00:00:20.340> length<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.119> really<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.600> my<00:00:21.720> hair

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750
