okay<00:00:04.620> we're<00:00:04.770> back<00:00:04.890> plate<00:00:05.339> tectonics<00:00:06.029> uh

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
okay we're back plate tectonics uh

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:14.839 
okay we're back plate tectonics uh
here's<00:00:06.930> another<00:00:07.170> one<00:00:07.379> here<00:00:07.529> we<00:00:07.620> go<00:00:13.519> okay<00:00:14.519> here

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
here's another one here we go okay here

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.790 
here's another one here we go okay here
we<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.299> earthquake<00:00:15.960> focus<00:00:16.410> here<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.710> it

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
we have earthquake focus here and it

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.859 
we have earthquake focus here and it
shows<00:00:16.980> earthquake<00:00:17.580> wage<00:00:17.820> how<00:00:18.119> they<00:00:18.330> travel

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
shows earthquake wage how they travel

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.650 
shows earthquake wage how they travel
through<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.039> Inner<00:00:20.400> Earth<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.539> have

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
through the Inner Earth and we have

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.720 
through the Inner Earth and we have
p-waves<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.500> s-waves<00:00:22.590> or<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:23.369> were<00:00:23.460> mainly

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
p-waves and s-waves or what were mainly

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.939 
p-waves and s-waves or what were mainly
concerned<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.500> trying<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
concerned with what this is trying to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.140 
concerned with what this is trying to
show<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:27.949> and<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.130> says<00:00:29.279> S<00:00:29.460> waves<00:00:29.760> cannot

show is and it says S waves cannot
travel<00:00:30.570> through<00:00:30.779> liquids<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.439> know<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.800> they

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
travel through liquids we know that they

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.470 
travel through liquids we know that they
cannot<00:00:32.070> travel<00:00:32.250> through<00:00:32.550> liquids<00:00:32.910> when

cannot travel through liquids when

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.200 
cannot travel through liquids when
there's<00:00:33.630> an<00:00:33.719> earthquake<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:34.760> there<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.969> this

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
there's an earthquake here there is this

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.360 
there's an earthquake here there is this
law<00:00:41.660> there<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.050> whole<00:00:43.350> area<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:44.100> in

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
law there is this whole area there in

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.869 
law there is this whole area there in
green<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.969> does<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.960> receive<00:00:46.649> s<00:00:47.070> waves<00:00:47.550> from

green that does not receive s waves from
that<00:00:49.309> earthquake<00:00:50.309> at<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.989> how

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that earthquake at all and that is how

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.750 
that earthquake at all and that is how
we<00:00:52.170> know<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> outer<00:00:53.190> core<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.610> liquid

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
we know that the outer core is liquid

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.700 
we know that the outer core is liquid
that<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.600> we've<00:00:54.930> hit<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.500> stop

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that as we've hit there and they stop

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.549 
that as we've hit there and they stop
they<00:00:55.829> can't<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.219> through<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:57.230> that's<00:00:58.230> that's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
they can't go through it that's that's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.700 
they can't go through it that's that's
how<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.770> know<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.870> what<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> force<00:01:01.440> that

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
how we know that what is the force that

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.590 
how we know that what is the force that
causes<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.309> plates<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.940> move<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.300> drives

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
causes the plates to move or drives

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.750 
causes the plates to move or drives
plate<00:01:03.930> tectonics<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.979> see<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.309> here

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
plate tectonics and here you see it here

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.070 
plate tectonics and here you see it here
you<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> plate<00:01:06.270> moving<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.659> way<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> plate

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
you see a plate moving this way a plate

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.710 
you see a plate moving this way a plate
moving<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.439> way<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:11.720> convection

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
moving this way and it is convection

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.990 
moving this way and it is convection
currents<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> asthenosphere<00:01:14.070> it's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
currents in the asthenosphere it's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.850 
currents in the asthenosphere it's
heated<00:01:15.420> down<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.590> rises

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
heated down here and then it rises

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.550 
heated down here and then it rises
because<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.549> little<00:01:17.850> lower<00:01:18.450> density<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.290> it

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
because this little lower density and it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.950 
because this little lower density and it
goes<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.950> way<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:21.150> convection<00:01:21.570> cell

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
goes this way and this convection cell

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.570 
goes this way and this convection cell
is<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.530> way<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> way

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
is going this way this is going this way

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.280 
is going this way this is going this way
so<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.880> plate<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.210> top<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.810> moving<00:01:24.960> this

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
so the plate on top of it is moving this

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
so the plate on top of it is moving this
way<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.490> plate<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.909> moving<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.299> way

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
way and this plate is moving that way

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.910 
way and this plate is moving that way
that<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:27.990> believe<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> four

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that is what we believe to be the four

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.480 
that is what we believe to be the four
step<00:01:29.310> moves<00:01:29.970> these<00:01:30.329> plates<00:01:32.600> here<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
step moves these plates here you have a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.039 
step moves these plates here you have a
divergent<00:01:35.490> plate<00:01:35.640> boundary<00:01:36.180> moving<00:01:36.540> apart<00:01:36.810> no

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
divergent plate boundary moving apart no

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.469 
divergent plate boundary moving apart no
that<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.430> get<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.030> place<00:01:39.210> move

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that what you get is the place move

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.550 
that what you get is the place move
apart<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.400> between<00:01:41.400> between<00:01:42.240> them<00:01:42.560> magma

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
Pacific Ocean and South America here
this<00:02:13.920> plate<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.549> Nazca<00:02:14.940> plate<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.269> moving<00:02:15.420> is

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
this plate that Nazca plate is moving is

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.570 
this plate that Nazca plate is moving is
moving<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.590> moving<00:02:17.010> towards<00:02:17.310> each<00:02:17.430> other

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
moving that moving towards each other

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.339 
moving that moving towards each other
and<00:02:17.849> this<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.269> getting<00:02:18.510> subducted<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.110> moving

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
and this is getting subducted and moving

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.979 
and this is getting subducted and moving
down<00:02:19.379> but<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.459> is<00:02:20.640> showing<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.180> depth<00:02:21.780> of

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
down but this is showing is depth of

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.990 
down but this is showing is depth of
earthquakes<00:02:22.410> shallow<00:02:23.010> earthquakes<00:02:23.610> not<00:02:23.819> that

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
earthquakes shallow earthquakes not that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.880 
earthquakes shallow earthquakes not that
far<00:02:24.209> down<00:02:24.239> as<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.959> go<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.380> way<00:02:25.440> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
far down as I go this way the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.910 
far down as I go this way the
earthquakes<00:02:26.819> occur<00:02:27.599> deeper<00:02:28.140> down<00:02:28.349> below<00:02:28.799> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
earthquakes occur deeper down below the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.210 
earthquakes occur deeper down below the
surface<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:31.290> kind<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.650> where<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:32.099> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
surface and here kind of where like the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.789 
surface and here kind of where like the
deepest<00:02:32.610> ones<00:02:32.790> are<00:02:33.200> yeah<00:02:34.200> here's<00:02:34.500> where<00:02:34.709> the

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
deepest ones are yeah here's where the

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.740 
deepest ones are yeah here's where the
deepest<00:02:35.130> ones<00:02:35.340> are<00:02:35.549> right<00:02:36.030> here<00:02:36.269> why<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.780> that

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
deepest ones are right here why is that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.069 
deepest ones are right here why is that
excuse<00:02:39.750> me

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
excuse me

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.350 
excuse me
because<00:02:41.010> when<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.700> crust<00:02:42.150> go

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
because when you have this crust go

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.509 
because when you have this crust go
below<00:02:42.750> here<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.860> have<00:02:44.040> where<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> plates

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
below here you have where the plates

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.979 
below here you have where the plates
kind<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.819> rub<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.030> have<00:02:45.120> shallow<00:02:45.450> earthquake

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
kind of rub you have shallow earthquake

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.920 
kind of rub you have shallow earthquake
here<00:02:46.200> not<00:02:46.379> down<00:02:46.620> very<00:02:46.920> far<00:02:49.549> here<00:02:50.810> where<00:02:51.810> this

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
here not down very far here where this

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.839 
here not down very far here where this
plate<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.410> going<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.650> rub<00:02:52.799> in<00:02:52.950> here<00:02:53.129> this<00:02:53.250> gets

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
plate is going to rub in here this gets

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.199 
plate is going to rub in here this gets
deeper<00:02:54.390> here<00:02:55.079> this<00:02:55.290> hard<00:02:55.680> more<00:02:56.400> rigid<00:02:56.910> plate

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
deeper here this hard more rigid plate

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.000 
deeper here this hard more rigid plate
as<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.690> moves<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.440> may<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.680> earthquakes

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
as it moves you may have earthquakes

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.620 
as it moves you may have earthquakes
that<00:02:59.100> occur<00:02:59.310> this<00:02:59.549> far<00:02:59.819> down<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.420> pretty

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
that occur this far down this is pretty

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.280 
that occur this far down this is pretty
far<00:03:00.870> down

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
far down

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.680 
far down
that's<00:03:01.709> your<00:03:01.859> deep<00:03:02.100> focus<00:03:02.340> earthquakes<00:03:02.970> so

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
that's your deep focus earthquakes so

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.120 
that's your deep focus earthquakes so
what<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.019> is<00:03:04.200> getting<00:03:04.380> at<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.889> is<00:03:06.799> deep<00:03:07.799> focus

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
what this is getting at is is deep focus

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.240 
what this is getting at is is deep focus

drives kids crazy I'll show you how to
do<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.140> again<00:03:39.380> first<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:40.100> want<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.430> know<00:03:40.520> what

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
do it again first you want to know what

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
do it again first you want to know what
time<00:03:41.060> did<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.790> what<00:03:43.790> time<00:03:44.060> did<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.420> p-wave

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810

arrive<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:46.489> p-wave<00:03:46.910> riding<00:03:47.239> you<00:03:47.300> got<00:03:47.420> to

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
arrive the p-wave riding you got to

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.330 
arrive the p-wave riding you got to
figure<00:03:47.690> out<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:47.900> scale<00:03:48.170> always<00:03:48.890> count<00:03:49.190> out

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
figure out the scale always count out

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.970 
figure out the scale always count out
the<00:03:49.370> scale<00:03:49.700> nine<00:03:50.090> oh<00:03:50.120> five<00:03:50.510> nine<00:03:50.900> ten<00:03:51.260> what

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
the scale nine oh five nine ten what

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.410 
the scale nine oh five nine ten what
does<00:03:52.069> it<00:03:52.160> go<00:03:52.250> by<00:03:52.430> minus<00:03:52.790> six<00:03:53.000> nine<00:03:53.150> oh<00:03:53.180> seven

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
does it go by minus six nine oh seven

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.880 
does it go by minus six nine oh seven
nine<00:03:53.690> oh<00:03:53.720> eight<00:03:53.810> nine<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:54.290> nine<00:03:54.380> nine<00:03:54.620> ten

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
nine oh eight nine and nine nine ten

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:55.750 
nine oh eight nine and nine nine ten
that<00:03:55.310> works

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
that works

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.620 
that works
so<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:55.970> p-wave<00:03:56.300> got<00:03:56.540> there<00:03:56.810> at<00:03:56.959> nine<00:03:57.230> oh<00:03:58.630> eight

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
so the p-wave got there at nine oh eight

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.830 
so the p-wave got there at nine oh eight
s-wave<00:04:00.620> got<00:04:00.890> there<00:04:01.190> at<00:04:03.850> nine<00:04:04.850> fifteen<00:04:05.570> what's

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
s-wave got there at nine fifteen what's

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.229 
s-wave got there at nine fifteen what's
the<00:04:06.019> difference<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.310> difference<00:04:07.340> in<00:04:08.060> their

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
the difference the difference in their

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.740 
the difference the difference in their
time<00:04:11.440> right<00:04:12.519> 9:50<00:04:13.519> mine's<00:04:13.760> not<00:04:13.940> only<00:04:14.150> seven

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
time right 9:50 mine's not only seven

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.229 
time right 9:50 mine's not only seven
minutes<00:04:15.170> okay<00:04:15.650> but<00:04:16.220> how<00:04:16.370> far<00:04:16.669> away<00:04:16.940> in

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
minutes okay but how far away in

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.780 
minutes okay but how far away in
kilometers<00:04:18.200> is<00:04:18.380> that<00:04:18.620> this<00:04:19.130> is<00:04:19.310> waiting<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:19.700> go

Kizuna all the time
mark<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.419> bolts<00:04:59.810> then<00:05:00.169> you<00:05:00.350> have<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.530> go<00:05:00.650> here

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
mark the bolts then you have to go here

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.700 
mark the bolts then you have to go here
and<00:05:01.190> hold<00:05:01.580> them<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:02.479> where<00:05:02.690> they<00:05:02.870> hit<00:05:03.080> both<00:05:03.380> and

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
and hold them to where they hit both and

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.219 
and hold them to where they hit both and
maybe<00:05:04.280> it's<00:05:04.580> like<00:05:04.880> it's<00:05:05.300> kind<00:05:05.539> of<00:05:05.600> hard<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:05.840> see

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
maybe it's like it's kind of hard to see

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.159 
maybe it's like it's kind of hard to see
there<00:05:06.530> maybe<00:05:07.100> it's<00:05:07.400> like<00:05:07.550> right<00:05:07.789> there

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
there maybe it's like right there

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.550 
there maybe it's like right there
right<00:05:10.479> it<00:05:11.479> hits<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.930> line<00:05:12.110> right<00:05:12.289> there<00:05:12.500> and

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
right it hits the line right there and

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.620 
right it hits the line right there and
there<00:05:12.979> so<00:05:13.340> I<00:05:13.400> follow<00:05:13.669> that<00:05:13.880> down<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.510> it's

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
there so I follow that down and it's

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.860 
there so I follow that down and it's
right<00:05:17.530> it's<00:05:18.530> like<00:05:18.740> right<00:05:19.010> there<00:05:19.270> so<00:05:20.270> the

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
right it's like right there so the

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.140 
right it's like right there so the
answer<00:05:21.470> is<00:05:21.680> in<00:05:22.280> these<00:05:22.400> count<00:05:22.610> by<00:05:22.760> two<00:05:22.820> hundred

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
answer is in these count by two hundred

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.550 
answer is in these count by two hundred
is<00:05:23.419> about<00:05:23.660> five<00:05:23.930> thousand<00:05:25.120> six<00:05:26.120> hundred

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
is about five thousand six hundred

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.350 
is about five thousand six hundred
kilometers<00:05:27.560> that's<00:05:27.770> how<00:05:28.039> far<00:05:28.340> away<00:05:28.400> the

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
kilometers that's how far away the

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.490 
kilometers that's how far away the
