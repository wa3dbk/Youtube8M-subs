drawer<00:00:09.340> seems<00:00:09.670> to<00:00:09.820> be<00:00:09.940> a<00:00:09.970> pretty<00:00:10.300> good<00:00:10.510> start

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:10.720 
drawer seems to be a pretty good start

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.690 
drawer seems to be a pretty good start
yeah<00:00:11.350> it<00:00:11.500> has<00:00:11.650> been<00:00:11.680> a<00:00:11.860> good<00:00:12.040> start<00:00:12.340> I<00:00:12.460> think

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
yeah it has been a good start I think

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.950 
yeah it has been a good start I think
you'll<00:00:13.030> have<00:00:13.150> to<00:00:13.269> balance<00:00:13.420> it<00:00:13.690> against

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
you'll have to balance it against

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.700 
you'll have to balance it against
expectations<00:00:14.290> and<00:00:15.510> rightly<00:00:16.510> or<00:00:16.630> wrongly<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
expectations and rightly or wrongly the

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.220 
expectations and rightly or wrongly the
expectations<00:00:18.490> have<00:00:18.640> been<00:00:18.669> exceptional<00:00:19.329> this

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
expectations have been exceptional this

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.380 
expectations have been exceptional this
season<00:00:20.619> that<00:00:20.859> advance<00:00:21.189> this<00:00:21.429> season<00:00:21.849> and<00:00:22.060> so

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
season that advance this season and so

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.089 
season that advance this season and so
you<00:00:22.929> can<00:00:23.109> take<00:00:23.380> a<00:00:23.409> view<00:00:23.560> and<00:00:23.859> think<00:00:24.009> will

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
you can take a view and think will

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.519 
you can take a view and think will
unless<00:00:24.249> you<00:00:24.429> win<00:00:24.550> all<00:00:24.669> seven<00:00:25.029> games<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:26.439> not

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
unless you win all seven games it's not

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.470 
unless you win all seven games it's not
working<00:00:26.710> well<00:00:27.069> when<00:00:27.279> I<00:00:27.339> think<00:00:27.550> we<00:00:28.089> further<00:00:28.300> for

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
working well when I think we further for

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.359 
working well when I think we further for
the<00:00:28.539> truth<00:00:28.749> I<00:00:28.960> think<00:00:29.649> it's<00:00:29.769> been<00:00:29.859> a<00:00:29.890> good<00:00:30.069> solid

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
the truth I think it's been a good solid

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.759 
the truth I think it's been a good solid
start<00:00:30.609> we've<00:00:31.599> progressed<00:00:32.020> well<00:00:32.380> in<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.559> cup

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
start we've progressed well in the cup

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.799 
start we've progressed well in the cup
couldn't<00:00:33.460> have<00:00:33.550> embraced<00:00:33.789> that<00:00:33.940> any<00:00:34.600> better

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
couldn't have embraced that any better

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.560 
couldn't have embraced that any better
two<00:00:35.469> games<00:00:35.769> two<00:00:36.579> wins<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:36.969> not<00:00:37.120> considered<00:00:37.510> a

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
two games two wins and not considered a

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.200 
two games two wins and not considered a
goal<00:00:37.780> I<00:00:38.530> think<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.039> league<00:00:39.219> it's<00:00:39.670> a<00:00:39.789> challenge

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
goal I think the league it's a challenge

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.330 
goal I think the league it's a challenge
I<00:00:40.390> mean<00:00:40.600> it's<00:00:41.199> not<00:00:41.469> described<00:00:41.949> as<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:42.250> know

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
I mean it's not described as you know

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.459 
I mean it's not described as you know
the<00:00:42.429> hardest<00:00:42.760> lead<00:00:43.000> to<00:00:43.210> get<00:00:43.329> out<00:00:43.449> of<00:00:43.480> any<00:00:44.320> other

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
the hardest lead to get out of any other

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:45.750 
the hardest lead to get out of any other
reason<00:00:44.530> and<00:00:44.890> its<00:00:44.980> artists<00:00:45.280> need<00:00:45.429> to<00:00:45.550> get<00:00:45.670> out

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
reason and its artists need to get out

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.349 
reason and its artists need to get out
of<00:00:46.000> and<00:00:46.719> it's<00:00:46.929> hard<00:00:47.230> hard<00:00:47.530> work<00:00:47.859> but<00:00:48.699> it's<00:00:49.179> not

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
of and it's hard hard work but it's not

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.579 
of and it's hard hard work but it's not
been<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.600> worst<00:00:49.719> start<00:00:49.989> in<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.170> world<00:00:50.350> you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
been the worst start in the world you

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.450 
been the worst start in the world you
know<00:00:50.760> which<00:00:51.760> was<00:00:51.969> seventh<00:00:52.300> after<00:00:52.480> a<00:00:52.660> few<00:00:53.050> games
