is a weird place anyone who's trying to
make<00:00:47.640> things<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:48.329> start<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> realize<00:00:48.840> that

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
make things you start to realize that

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.910 
make things you start to realize that
decisions<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:49.829> made<00:00:50.120> for<00:00:51.120> odd<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.260> obscure

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
decisions get made for odd and obscure

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.459 
decisions get made for odd and obscure
reasons<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.600> there's<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.690> very<00:00:54.989> complicated

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
reasons and there's a very complicated

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.790 
reasons and there's a very complicated
system<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.870> influence<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.079> funding<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
system of influence and funding and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.040

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
policy that is obscured from public site

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
policy that is obscured from public site
and<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.859> big<00:01:02.100> part<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.910> project

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and I think a big part of this project

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
and I think a big part of this project
has<00:01:03.960> been<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.290> untangle<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> shine

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
has been to untangle that and and shine

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.940 
has been to untangle that and and shine
a<00:01:06.000> light<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.229> when

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
a light on it and you know when

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.370 
a light on it and you know when
necessary<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.610> say<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:10.140> how<00:01:10.320> we

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
necessary to say is this really how we

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.580 
necessary to say is this really how we
want<00:01:10.680> things<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.869> when<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.900> found<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.500> the

canada line existed i was so excited
just<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.950> about<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.820> was<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
just just about that that there was a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.800 
just just about that that there was a
show<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:19.189> took<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.369> Canadian<00:01:21.180> culture<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
what's good and what's bad and look a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.179 
what's good and what's bad and look a

change in what we all want to see and
and<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.369> immediately<00:01:27.240> went<00:01:27.689> through<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.229> five

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and I immediately went through like five

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.370 
and I immediately went through like five
episodes<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.759> row<00:01:29.990> just<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.290> were

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
episodes in a row just that there were

to<00:01:38.100> listen<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.460> they<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.670> disappear<00:01:39.060> just

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
to listen to you they can disappear just

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.850 
to listen to you they can disappear just
like<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.020> mean<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.470> not<00:01:40.619> even

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
like that I mean it's not even

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.530 
like that I mean it's not even
surprising<00:01:41.250> anymore<00:01:41.340> when<00:01:41.729> they<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:41.880> there

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
surprising anymore when they do there

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.730 
surprising anymore when they do there
have<00:01:42.630> been<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> number<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.020> attempts<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
have been a number of attempts and I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.170 
have been a number of attempts and I
think<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.189> what<00:01:44.310> we've<00:01:44.460> seen<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.149> that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
think that what we've seen is that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.600 
think that what we've seen is that
trying<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.930> journalism<00:01:46.280> supported<00:01:47.280> purely

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
trying to do journalism supported purely

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.940 
trying to do journalism supported purely
by<00:01:47.820> advertising<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.020> doesn't<00:01:49.229> work<00:01:49.320> it's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
by advertising it just doesn't work it's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.530 
by advertising it just doesn't work it's
not<00:01:50.070> sustainable<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.729> numbers<00:01:50.970> don't<00:01:51.390> add<00:01:51.479> up

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
not sustainable the numbers don't add up

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.230 
not sustainable the numbers don't add up
in<00:01:51.810> Canada

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
in Canada

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.710 
in Canada
so<00:01:53.130> Canada<00:01:54.130> land<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.399> at<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.549> crossroads<00:01:54.729> it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
so Canada land is at a crossroads it

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.760 
so Canada land is at a crossroads it
won't<00:01:55.990> continue<00:01:56.320> without<00:01:56.560> list<00:01:56.860> or<00:01:56.979> support

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
won't continue without list or support

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.670 
won't continue without list or support
you<00:01:59.770> know<00:01:59.860> criticism<00:02:00.549> it<00:02:01.000> sounds<00:02:01.299> so<00:02:01.420> negative

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you know criticism it sounds so negative

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.499 
you know criticism it sounds so negative
but<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.770> response<00:02:03.159> is<00:02:03.369> being<00:02:03.580> overwhelmingly

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
but the response is being overwhelmingly

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.230 
but the response is being overwhelmingly
positive<00:02:05.369> there's<00:02:06.369> this<00:02:06.520> momentum<00:02:07.060> with

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
positive there's this momentum with
