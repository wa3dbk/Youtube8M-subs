00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.940
 master's degree in efficient building and 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.540
 environmental energy rehabilitation 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.730
 in madrid I had the opportunity to tell 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.870
 with a faculty of teachers that with 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.150
 another is going to have many aspects 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.210
 singular in the city many be 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.220
 too much has been built and everything 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.589
 is very much in the investigation of 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.899
 new things not to certifications the 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:38.000
 products the benefits that it was 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.190
 nuevoleonés go to learn things that wal 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.199
 mart that here is missing not that here just 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.590
 is knowing what countries have it so 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.080
 developed 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.420
 and will absorb it for this is to come 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.930
 here to transmit it and to be able to investigate 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:57.550
 more thanks paco I was born in the institute of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.250
 free transfer technology this 2 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.890
 and help me an airplane that got the scholarship 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.979
 to be able to do my studies I think 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.290
 that we have many opportunities 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.960
 very much is a new lion is there 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.700
 is always always a very state 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.010
 innovator who is always worried 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.450
 why this continues and so this kind of 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.100
 opportunities is an example of that not 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.860
 of the whole plan they have to give 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.310
 to be able to innovate and to be able to do 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.560
 that people get more involved then 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.570
 I believe that we are going very well and 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.729
 can open what belongs to me now 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.070
 is to convey this demand that you are 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.610
 opportunities exist and they are here

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.960

 I saw what I had not seen in other places 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.130
 invest a lot in technology develop 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.150

 here there is a lot of investment in what is the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.670
 innovation theme because here is the park 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.990
 the gd thank you very much and two of 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.700

 initiative to put the park of 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:48.209
 innovation research in technology 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.280
 the pib this is something that not all 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.950
 states have and even not all 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.760

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.760
 where should I be 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.439

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.180
 the career of my development engineer 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.620
 of software and if the expertise in 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.659
 artificial intelligence in the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.519
 University of Edinburgh in Great Britain 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.700
 you change the perspective completely 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.769
 already in the studies and everything and 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.450
 you realize that it is general while 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.730
 which are much wider than 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.150
 they seem and you learn a lot in my case 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.010
 I learned from a little bit of all the branches of 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.780
 artificial intelligence and already arriving 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.829
 I have put myself into practice 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.470
 what else brings me to attention 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.239

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.530
 I was working helping to automate 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.000
 the processes that the systems of 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.560
 administration and a short time ago I decided 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.180
 start with my own company is called 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.129
 cervantes and we make systems of 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.959
 semi-automated administration with 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.209
 automatic integration processes 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.090
 data I thank the government very much for not 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.859

 it is up to you to share from the start 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.680
 did not have the economic resources 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.390
 to pay for the expertise of which 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.810
 postulate 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.330
 I found support in the conacyt and the 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.000
 government of new lion that without a doubt 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.160
 this support would not have achieved my 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.720
 objective of bringing this diploma from

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.470
 power of dear mechanical and electrical 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.230
 they invited me to participate in the 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.980
