a lot of people ask about paper grains
what<00:00:07.720> it<00:00:07.870> is<00:00:08.080> and<00:00:08.440> why<00:00:09.010> you<00:00:09.070> need<00:00:09.370> to<00:00:09.430> know<00:00:09.730> what

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
what it is and why you need to know what

paper grain is going in will affect the
outcome<00:00:16.960> of<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.920> book<00:00:18.690> one<00:00:19.690> of<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:19.810> best<00:00:20.050> ways

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.130 
outcome of the book one of the best ways
that<00:00:20.530> I've<00:00:20.890> been<00:00:21.100> able<00:00:21.280> to<00:00:21.550> explain<00:00:22.000> a<00:00:22.390> paper

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
that I've been able to explain a paper

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.590 
that I've been able to explain a paper
grain<00:00:23.500> that<00:00:24.430> it's<00:00:24.760> a<00:00:24.850> lot<00:00:25.030> like<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.300> piece<00:00:25.570> of

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
grain that it's a lot like a piece of

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.830 
grain that it's a lot like a piece of
corrugated<00:00:26.080> cardboard<00:00:26.560> where<00:00:27.550> ELLs<00:00:28.420> are

corrugated cardboard where ELLs are

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.180 
corrugated cardboard where ELLs are
running<00:00:29.170> this<00:00:29.619> way

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
running this way

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.420 
running this way
part<00:00:31.119> of<00:00:31.180> the<00:00:31.300> process<00:00:31.829> when<00:00:32.829> they<00:00:32.980> shake<00:00:33.250> the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
part of the process when they shake the

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.580 
part of the process when they shake the
water<00:00:33.640> out<00:00:33.940> of<00:00:33.969> the<00:00:34.180> sheet<00:00:34.360> of<00:00:34.390> paper<00:00:34.510> is<00:00:35.079> that

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
water out of the sheet of paper is that

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.620 
water out of the sheet of paper is that
the<00:00:35.710> fibers<00:00:36.130> sort<00:00:36.340> of<00:00:36.400> naturally<00:00:36.940> line<00:00:37.270> up

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
the fibers sort of naturally line up

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.680 
the fibers sort of naturally line up
with<00:00:37.900> each<00:00:38.050> other<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.560> they<00:00:38.829> create<00:00:39.250> a<00:00:39.690> sort

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
with each other and they create a sort

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.569 
with each other and they create a sort
of<00:00:40.750> direction<00:00:41.230> that<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.829> fibers<00:00:42.370> are<00:00:42.489> all

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
of direction that the fibers are all

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.530 
of direction that the fibers are all
going<00:00:42.850> in<00:00:43.149> that's<00:00:43.750> your<00:00:44.020> paper<00:00:44.230> brain<00:00:44.620> so<00:00:45.540> the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
going in that's your paper brain so the

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.950 
going in that's your paper brain so the
thing<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.079> way<00:00:47.110> to<00:00:47.380> find<00:00:47.770> paper<00:00:48.340> grain<00:00:48.670> is<00:00:49.390> to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
thing the way to find paper grain is to

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.840 
thing the way to find paper grain is to
think<00:00:50.140> of<00:00:50.260> it<00:00:50.380> like<00:00:50.559> corrugated<00:00:51.460> cardboard

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
think of it like corrugated cardboard

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.720 
think of it like corrugated cardboard
it's<00:00:52.630> really<00:00:53.110> easy<00:00:53.380> to<00:00:53.800> fold<00:00:54.100> piece<00:00:54.550> of

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
it's really easy to fold piece of

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.130 
it's really easy to fold piece of
corrugated<00:00:55.030> cardboard<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:58.140> really

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
corrugated cardboard with the really

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.260 
corrugated cardboard with the really
hard<00:00:59.590> to<00:01:00.130> fold<00:01:00.370> piece<00:01:00.790> of<00:01:00.969> corrugated

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
hard to fold piece of corrugated

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.160 
hard to fold piece of corrugated
cardboard<00:01:01.800> against<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.160> grain<00:01:03.839> and<00:01:04.839> I<00:01:05.019> think

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
cardboard against the grain and I think

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.260 
cardboard against the grain and I think
you<00:01:05.259> know<00:01:05.379> ready<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.460> can<00:01:06.520> say<00:01:06.729> any<00:01:06.969> sheet

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
you know ready and you can say any sheet

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.230 
you know ready and you can say any sheet
of<00:01:07.390> paper<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:08.079> fold<00:01:08.499> it<00:01:08.679> over<00:01:08.799> not<00:01:09.579> fold<00:01:10.030> it

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
of paper and fold it over not fold it

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.660 
of paper and fold it over not fold it
but<00:01:10.420> just<00:01:10.630> bounce<00:01:10.869> it<00:01:11.109> like<00:01:11.319> this<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:12.399> feel

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
but just bounce it like this and feel

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.870 
but just bounce it like this and feel
the<00:01:12.850> difference<00:01:13.270> between<00:01:14.100> how<00:01:15.100> easy<00:01:15.459> it<00:01:15.759> is

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
the difference between how easy it is

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.529 
the difference between how easy it is
for<00:01:16.530> artists<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.829> fold<00:01:18.639> the<00:01:18.759> paper<00:01:18.909> to<00:01:19.209> bounce

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
for artists to fold the paper to bounce

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.529 
for artists to fold the paper to bounce
the<00:01:19.779> paper<00:01:19.990> this<00:01:20.950> way<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.700> giving<00:01:22.149> me<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.270> lot

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
the paper this way is giving me a lot

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.910 
the paper this way is giving me a lot
less<00:01:22.869> resistance<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:25.090> this<00:01:25.389> way<00:01:25.659> is<00:01:25.929> so<00:01:26.200> I

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
less resistance then this way is so I

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.800 
less resistance then this way is so I
know<00:01:27.189> that<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.969> grain<00:01:28.179> of<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:28.389> paper<00:01:28.420> is

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
know that the grain of the paper is

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.099 
know that the grain of the paper is
running<00:01:29.079> this<00:01:29.229> way<00:01:29.439> and<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:31.689> always<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.929> good

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
running this way and it's always a good

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.199 
running this way and it's always a good
idea<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.469> mark<00:01:32.889> the<00:01:33.009> back<00:01:33.159> of<00:01:33.310> your<00:01:33.399> paper<00:01:33.639> with

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
idea to mark the back of your paper with

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.870 
idea to mark the back of your paper with
the<00:01:34.389> direction<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:36.009> of<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.219> things<00:01:36.459> that<00:01:36.789> you

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
the direction one of the things that you

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.809 
the direction one of the things that you
can<00:01:37.060> also<00:01:37.270> learn<00:01:37.990> about<00:01:38.349> paper<00:01:38.829> grain<00:01:39.159> is<00:01:39.459> that

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
can also learn about paper grain is that

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.879 
can also learn about paper grain is that
if<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:40.060> fold<00:01:40.450> paper<00:01:40.869> against<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.619> grain

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:41.889 
if you fold paper against the grain

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:44.519 
if you fold paper against the grain
you're<00:01:42.819> going<00:01:42.969> to<00:01:43.029> have<00:01:43.240> this<00:01:43.599> sort<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.109> choppy

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:44.529 
you're going to have this sort of choppy

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:46.800 
you're going to have this sort of choppy
broken<00:01:45.159> up<00:01:45.310> isn't<00:01:46.240> going<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.539> be<00:01:46.599> nice<00:01:46.779> and

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
broken up isn't going to be nice and

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.429 
broken up isn't going to be nice and
smooth<00:01:47.380> now<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.189> can<00:01:48.789> fold<00:01:49.630> that<00:01:49.869> down<00:01:49.929> with<00:01:50.409> a

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
smooth now you can fold that down with a

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.050 
smooth now you can fold that down with a
bone<00:01:50.859> folder<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.429> get<00:01:51.520> away<00:01:51.609> with<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:51.909> it

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
bone folder and get away with it it

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.679 
bone folder and get away with it it
won't<00:01:52.149> look<00:01:52.450> all<00:01:52.689> cracked<00:01:53.109> like<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.880> the

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
won't look all cracked like that but the

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.980 
won't look all cracked like that but the
paper<00:01:55.990> grain<00:01:56.649> is<00:01:57.490> going<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:57.999> wrong<00:01:58.179> way<00:01:58.240> this

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
paper grain is going the wrong way this

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.809 
paper grain is going the wrong way this
is<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.499> correct<00:01:59.829> way<00:02:00.039> if<00:02:00.279> you<00:02:00.399> fold<00:02:00.609> a<00:02:00.700> piece

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
is the correct way if you fold a piece

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.409 
is the correct way if you fold a piece
of<00:02:00.969> paper<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.299> get<00:02:01.389> a<00:02:01.450> nice<00:02:01.659> crisp<00:02:02.229> edge<00:02:02.529> to<00:02:03.130> it

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:03.419 
of paper to get a nice crisp edge to it

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:06.020 
of paper to get a nice crisp edge to it
that's<00:02:04.419> the<00:02:04.689> grain<00:02:04.899> of<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.109> paper

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that's the grain of the paper

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.850 
that's the grain of the paper
why<00:02:06.870> do<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.350> need<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> paper<00:02:07.950> grain<00:02:08.399> well

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
why do you need the paper grain well

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.270 
why do you need the paper grain well
especially<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.280> making<00:02:11.670> book<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.950> want<00:02:14.160> to

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
especially in making book you want to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.130 
especially in making book you want to
make<00:02:14.460> sure<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.820> all<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.240> paper<00:02:15.480> grain<00:02:15.840> is

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
make sure that all the paper grain is

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.420 
make sure that all the paper grain is
going<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.740> same<00:02:17.010> way<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.450> generally

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
going the same way and generally

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.470 
going the same way and generally
depending<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.550> which<00:02:20.730> kind<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.030> book<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.360> is

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
depending on which kind of book it is

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.900 
depending on which kind of book it is
but<00:02:21.780> generally<00:02:22.410> speaking<00:02:22.709> you'll<00:02:23.490> want<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
but generally speaking you'll want the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.530 
but generally speaking you'll want the
paper<00:02:24.150> ring<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:24.959> running<00:02:25.260> top<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.770> bottom

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
paper ring to be running top to bottom

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.240 
paper ring to be running top to bottom
along<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.750> spine<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.380> that's<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.770> direction

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
along the spine so that's the direction

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.740 
along the spine so that's the direction
that<00:02:29.340> all<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.700> paper<00:02:29.940> grain<00:02:30.270> is<00:02:30.450> going<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.660> be

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
that all the paper grain is going to be

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.860 
that all the paper grain is going to be
going<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.150> want<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.450> make<00:02:36.540> sure<00:02:36.720> that

right brain and the reason that's so

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.010 
right brain and the reason that's so
important<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.660> pasta<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.840> you're

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
important is that pasta that you're

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.180 
important is that pasta that you're
gluing<00:02:55.489> paper<00:02:56.489> or<00:02:57.360> if<00:02:57.450> any<00:02:57.660> moisture<00:02:58.230> gets<00:02:58.950> at

gluing paper or if any moisture gets at
paper<00:02:59.750> paper<00:03:00.750> has<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> tendency<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.450> expand<00:03:03.450> and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
paper paper has a tendency to expand and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.290 
paper paper has a tendency to expand and
contract<00:03:03.890> so<00:03:04.890> if<00:03:05.280> your<00:03:05.489> grain<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:06.000> going<00:03:06.150> this

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
contract so if your grain is going this

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.590 
contract so if your grain is going this
way<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:06.959> every<00:03:07.500> single<00:03:07.709> piece<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.070> paper

go<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.570> same<00:03:12.660> direction<00:03:12.870> if<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.130> comes<00:03:14.370> up

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
go in the same direction if it comes up

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.970 
go in the same direction if it comes up
against<00:03:14.970> any<00:03:15.150> moisture<00:03:15.660> at<00:03:15.780> all<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.590> paper<00:03:16.799> is

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
against any moisture at all the paper is

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.960 
against any moisture at all the paper is
going<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.220> swell<00:03:17.580> out<00:03:17.820> this<00:03:17.850> way<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:20.010> go

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
going to swell out this way and to go

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.640 
going to swell out this way and to go
back<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.540> way<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.200> want<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.560> make

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
back in that way so you want to make

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.770 
back in that way so you want to make
sure<00:03:22.680> they're<00:03:22.890> all<00:03:22.920> all<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.150> papers<00:03:24.570> are

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
sure they're all all the papers are

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.320 
sure they're all all the papers are
swelling<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.650> same<00:03:25.890> direction<00:03:26.250> if<00:03:26.730> you

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
swelling in the same direction if you

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.140 
swelling in the same direction if you
have<00:03:27.660> one<00:03:28.590> sheet<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.010> paper<00:03:29.160> with<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.880> grain

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
have one sheet of paper with a grain

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.210 
have one sheet of paper with a grain
going<00:03:30.360> this<00:03:30.570> way<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.260> another<00:03:31.590> with<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
going this way and another with the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.949 
going this way and another with the
grain<00:03:32.400> going<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.940> way<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.450> same<00:03:33.660> book

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
grain going this way in the same book

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.449 
grain going this way in the same book
you're<00:03:34.290> going<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.500> see<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.829> these<00:03:34.980> two<00:03:35.250> are

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
you're going to see that these two are

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.860 
you're going to see that these two are
going<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.670> fight<00:03:35.910> each<00:03:35.940> other<00:03:36.299> when<00:03:36.540> they<00:03:36.690> eat

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
going to fight each other when they eat

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.960 
going to fight each other when they eat
as<00:03:37.079> well<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:40.500> that's<00:03:40.739> why<00:03:41.010> paper<00:03:41.340> rain<00:03:41.700> is

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
as well so that's why paper rain is

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.360 
as well so that's why paper rain is
important<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.840> know<00:03:42.989> especially<00:03:43.890> when<00:03:44.160> you're

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
important to know especially when you're

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.000 
important to know especially when you're
book<00:03:44.519> binding
