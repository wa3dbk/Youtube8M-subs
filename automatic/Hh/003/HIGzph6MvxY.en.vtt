00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 I will cook an even more delicious version 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.919
 of toast with cheese 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.230
 rugby is a typical welsh dish 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.889
 prepare a bechamel sauce by taking the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.740
 50 g of butter and 3 tablespoons of flour of 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.320
 butter and flour are usually used 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.539
 milk but in the preparation of the match 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.150
 heirs the milk is often replaced 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.010
 with a dose of stout beer gives a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.010
 strong and intense aftertaste 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.170
 I want it to be very dense eliminated 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.280
 all lumps add a tablespoon of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.550
 mustard and flavored with his excellent 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.100
 itself will give the mixture a taste 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.110
 intriguing has a crazy scent has 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.500
 tears almost come to my eyes 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.570
 fine but rugby would not be good 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.129
 such if we did not use the fantastic 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.660
 seasoned cheese then grated 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.190
 of the excellent Montgomery Cheddar that is 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.170
 marries well with beer is important 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.220
 add it when the mixture is still 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.400
 warm and so that it melts and now the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.140
 I will choose a nice loaf of bread 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.290
 rustic that lives up to mine 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.450
 seasoning I want my usb to have 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.710
 a nice crunchy base then toasted 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.710
 bread on both sides 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.710
 spread our beautiful cream 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.130
 spicy with cheese and beer 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.900
 some more cheese will have to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.090
 bubbles should form 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:43.810
 scorch table a touch of gloss 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.810
 same pass it to the grill for 90 seconds 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:52.670
 look at that goodness other than simple 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.289
