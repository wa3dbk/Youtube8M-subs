00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 what is the real meaning of the past you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.029
 presidential messages about this reason 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.429
 our political columnist 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.370

 Speech at the court she abishevicha and me 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.859
 of course did not leave the thought that it is 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.160
 about building 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.510
 in 2010 not a lot is not enough of communism 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.240
 in a single country 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.090
 specifically in Kazakhstan, that is, others 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.040
 in words it looked like that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.230
 it was possible to determine the meaning of promises 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.579
 President of Kazakhstan, its data 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.750
 I offer you a speech 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.879
 concentrate on some of them 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.980
 we need four and a half times 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.820
 increase GDP per capita 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.480
 population 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.910
 from 13 thousand today to 60 thousand 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.359
 Kazakhstan side dollars 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.370
 prevailing middle class 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.990
 following the global trend of organization 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.439
 the proportion of urban residents will reach 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:14.600
 today's 55 to 70 percent of all 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.030
 population of the city and towns 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.170
 will connect quality roads 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.259
 all types of speed trails 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.259
 of transport 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.119
 approval of a healthy lifestyle and 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.250
 the development of medicine will increase 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.970
 life expectancy of Kazakhstan citizens to 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.220
 80 years and above Kazakhstan will be one of 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.560
 leading eurasian center from 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.229
 medical tourism will end 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.320
 the formation of advanced on the national 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.320
 educational system our country 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.630
 should be one of the safest 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.140
 comfortable countries for living 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.960
 of the world 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.720
 peace and stability fair 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.460
 justice is an effective rule of law 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.979
 Here is the basis of a developed country, well, if not 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.619
 take into account several exotic 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.959
 concepts of medical tourism 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.000
 as well as the promise of all to live to 8 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.400
 decades apparently meant here 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.090
 especially with me Suta Nazarbayev 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.299
 Nazarbayev 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.010
 then in general, all this we have already heard I want 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.980
 remind that we heard it in the distant 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.019
 now ninety-seventh year when 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.359
 young and promising president 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.489
 Sultan Abishevich promised to build 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:34.329
 communism in a single country but not 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.420
 in the year 2050 in 2013 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.880
 only half passed 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.820
 allotted to this construction of light 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.700
 future term but apparently even 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.190
 himself and announced mfti places in some 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.829
 it became obvious that no 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.590
 bright future will not be and yet how 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.959
 known in politics there is nothing worse 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.720
 unfulfilled promises especially then 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.930
 when they are obvious to observers and 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.720
 here then Nursultan Nazarbayev 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.430
 decided to make a simple move he suffered 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.239
 the date of the promise of the bright 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.250
 future for 20 years ahead and now these 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.890
 most promises are already full 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.290
 corresponds to the famous and which 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.459
 Hajj nasredin did such long-term 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.010
 forecasts 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.280
 but then clarified that during this time either 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.350
 the padishah will die either the donkey will die who is 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.019
 In this case, the step act of the Padish 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.430
 guess in general it is easy and the people 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.190
 Kazakhstan does not believe any 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.450
 promises chords and in principle for 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.350
 successive 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.560
 anime president and not particularly watched 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.520
 Moreover, I want to note that 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.690
 the participants of this meeting looked 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.569
 a little scary 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.600
 strange and impressed 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.110
 sometimes freakshow cabaret attention specifically 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.150
 as Nursultan Abishevich himself 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.480
 appreciates what he does and that to me 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.459
 seems to characterize best 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.190
 attitude of people who are called 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:11.140
 politicians in Kazakhstan to the fact that 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:15.700
 there is a growing demand in the country 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.730
 our energy food resources 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:23.440
 and the horns are not the third industrial 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:26.140
 revolutions and so-called problems 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.700
 global drowning warming and so 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:34.090
 then she all in this period in this window 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.650
 will be favorably for us thanks 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.620
 you very much for your attention how you paid 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.960
 attention that drowning warming well 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.410
 so briefly 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.410
 after us even the flood
