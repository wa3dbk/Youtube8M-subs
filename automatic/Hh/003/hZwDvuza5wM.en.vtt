 of collagen production that like 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.420
 result of this is not proper and much 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.030

 those accumulated one newly transferred 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.829
 is the important thing also that from that 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.010

 red stalls have more antioxidants and 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.390
 It is also important that grapefruit 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.780
 has the pectin that helps lower the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.840
 bad cholesterol of 15% and in our 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.030

 subtract freshly and ingested and in addition to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.440
 that balances insulin levels 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.610
 so blood can also reach 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.190
 people who have problems of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.020
 Diabetes also helps to have a skin 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.600
 radiant because as I mentioned 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.920
 helps to produce collagen and this helps 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.560
 that is not lost will be healthier more 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.110

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.300
 way we are going to make the cube that 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.300
 had promised at the beginning and this line 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.119
 with mythological you first need 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.509

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.820
 more are they that two ways is more or 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.890
 less than 12 minutes each for 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.000
 perform this game so let's
