it it's not as pastel as I would like it
to<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.440> still<00:00:55.860> more<00:00:56.129> vibrant<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.780> if

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
to be it is still more vibrant but if

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.139 
to be it is still more vibrant but if
that's<00:00:58.530> something<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.160> you're<00:00:59.520> wanting<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.490 
that's something that you're wanting to
go<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> would<00:01:00.989> definitely<00:01:01.379> recommend

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
go for I would definitely recommend

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.429 
go for I would definitely recommend
using<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.190> products<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.030> used<00:01:03.480> just

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
using the products that I used just

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.399 
using the products that I used just
because<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.700> use<00:01:05.909> conditioner<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.960> hair

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
because if you use conditioner with hair

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.840 
because if you use conditioner with hair
dye<00:01:07.560> which<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.159> what<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
dye which is what I was going to do that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.859 
dye which is what I was going to do that
I<00:01:09.240> saw<00:01:09.390> they<00:01:09.630> came<00:01:09.869> out<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.350> product<00:01:10.650> um

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
review on this product yet and that's

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.360 
review on this product yet and that's
why<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:24.930> was<00:02:25.050> kind<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.319> skeptical<00:02:25.650> about<00:02:26.069> buying

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
why I was kind of skeptical about buying

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.490 
why I was kind of skeptical about buying
it<00:02:26.640> at<00:02:26.760> first<00:02:26.970> but<00:02:27.840> then<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.080> thought<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.470> myself

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
it at first but then I thought to myself

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.600 
it at first but then I thought to myself
well<00:02:29.370> my<00:02:29.700> viewers<00:02:30.090> might<00:02:30.360> want<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.600> use<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.990> so

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
well my viewers might want to use it so

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.590 
well my viewers might want to use it so
if<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.820> get<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:34.050> turns<00:02:34.290> out<00:02:34.440> great<00:02:34.650> then

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
if I get it and it turns out great then

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.790 
if I get it and it turns out great then
there's<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.690> review<00:02:37.080> out<00:02:37.230> there<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.620> people

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
there's a review out there that people

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.340 
there's a review out there that people
can<00:02:37.920> see<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.700> if<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.270> doesn't<00:02:39.750> turn<00:02:39.989> out<00:02:40.200> great

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
can see and if it doesn't turn out great

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.220 
can see and if it doesn't turn out great

conditioner<00:03:07.580> so<00:03:08.580> if<00:03:08.940> you're<00:03:09.180> very<00:03:09.360> sensitive

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
conditioner so if you're very sensitive

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.840 
conditioner so if you're very sensitive
to<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.380> fumes<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:11.160> that's<00:03:11.340> why<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.550> don't

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
to like fumes and that's why you don't

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.449 
to like fumes and that's why you don't
want<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.180> use<00:03:12.390> certain<00:03:13.200> dyes<00:03:13.530> then<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.070> think

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
want to use certain dyes then I think

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.819 
want to use certain dyes then I think
you<00:03:14.640> would<00:03:14.760> be<00:03:14.790> fine<00:03:15.090> with<00:03:15.329> this<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.410> used

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
you would be fine with this so I used

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.009 
you would be fine with this so I used
the<00:03:17.010> whole<00:03:17.130> tub<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:18.090> mixed<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.510> with<00:03:18.660> just<00:03:18.870> a

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
the whole tub and I mixed it with just a

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.750 
the whole tub and I mixed it with just a
little<00:03:19.170> bit<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.620> my<00:03:19.829> hair<00:03:20.040> dye<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.459> used

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
little bit of my hair dye that I used

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.860 
little bit of my hair dye that I used
which<00:03:21.000> I'll<00:03:21.150> get<00:03:21.299> into<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:22.250> basically<00:03:23.250> it

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
which I'll get into and basically it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.770 
which I'll get into and basically it
turned<00:03:24.870> like<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:27.030> didn't<00:03:27.390> look<00:03:27.510> like<00:03:27.570> it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
turned like it didn't look like it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.780 
turned like it didn't look like it
changed<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.410> hair<00:03:28.590> dyes<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.220> did<00:03:29.610> just

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
changed the hair dyes so I did just

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.520 
changed the hair dyes so I did just
start<00:03:29.910> off<00:03:30.180> with<00:03:30.209> my<00:03:30.540> bangs<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.110> then<00:03:31.290> when<00:03:31.500> I

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
start off with my bangs but then when I

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.110 
start off with my bangs but then when I
put<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:31.860> on<00:03:31.920> my<00:03:32.040> bangs<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.430> was<00:03:32.549> like<00:03:32.670> okay<00:03:33.000> it

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
put it on my bangs I was like okay it

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.539 
put it on my bangs I was like okay it
looks<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:33.480> little<00:03:33.600> bit<00:03:33.840> more<00:03:34.620> pastel<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.310> just

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
looks a little bit more pastel so I just

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.830 
looks a little bit more pastel so I just
put<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.760> throughout<00:03:35.910> my<00:03:35.970> whole<00:03:36.150> hair<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.750> I

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
put it throughout my whole hair and I

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.500 
put it throughout my whole hair and I
left<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:37.290> for<00:03:37.320> about<00:03:37.590> an<00:03:37.860> hour<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.670> it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
left it in for about an hour and it

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.630 
left it in for about an hour and it
turned<00:03:39.780> very<00:03:39.989> vibrant<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:41.160> that's<00:03:41.340> another

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
turned very vibrant so that's another

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.460 
turned very vibrant so that's another
