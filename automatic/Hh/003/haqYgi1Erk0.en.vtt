 Good beer started more or less. 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.020
 eight thousand years before Christ 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.019
 started there in Mesopotamia where 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.880
 practically today iran and iraq started 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.640
 with the people called Sumerian dominated 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.679
 that region the Sumerians is had a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.780
 beer as something so important 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.790
 in their lives that a law found 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.829
 1780 before Christ called the code of 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.870

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.910
 during his reign some 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.190
 things very important to you 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.079
 observe during beer promotion 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.780
 knew that at that time if someone was 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.000
 stay if a beer could be killed and 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.289
 was condemned even death for example if 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.350
 You were going to have a beer in a 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.500
 inn in a tavern men spoke and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.690
 The tavern keeper must have something 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.479
 wanted to overturn the price 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.510
 he could also be killed the beer is 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.700
 so important to them that the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.549
 code of Hamurabi wrote that the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.130
 of the web itself who worked 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.840
 the workers had secured two 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.729
 empty of beer, we do not know what 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.340
 is a measure presenting a vague 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.259
 we know that the plebs won had 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.009
 right to 29 of the day 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.390
 the civil servant administrators 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.329
 three places per day 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.579
 the priests and the high dome nelson 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.490
 ruler five pots a day 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.790
 beer was was dedicated to god 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.770
 were worshiped at that time and who 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.040
 beer at that time were the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.439
 women beer started in the pre 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.649
 story when the man moved in 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.369
 began to grow cereals 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.920
 there we are saying that he probably 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:02.250
 this is a county council with wheat or 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.219
 barley will ask for a rain fell to the water 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.770
 there and if serial prompted for some 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.270
 you do not know how many, and then you 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.580
 Someone passed by nearby to feel the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.160
 The smell was to try what is 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.950
 that 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.770
 beer was created to conquests 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.480
 of people by other people or 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.010
 bringing the beer closer to the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.680
 European continent 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.520
 the Egyptians were clean the beer for 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.380
 he 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.450
 beer so a very important 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.930
 great also the workers themselves 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.220
 who will not build the same aspirants 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.920
 being slaves he had a daily quota 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.690
 of beer and beer has always been 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.570
 with liquid as it also 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.390
 food then heard crossed hear 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.480
 Greeks hear the Romans the Romans were 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.700
 the big thrusters of beer 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.800
 Roman empire stretched as far as Asia 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.170
 less than the land throughout Europe all 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.260
 guys all germanium to where it is today 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.750
 france, as in germany, beer 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.330
 during the reign of the Roman Empire it 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.670
 was losing its great importance for 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.500
 the highest houses that were given 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.560
 wines but the large population 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.850
 workers they all followed firm 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.920
 drinking beer 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.900
 the beer is like ours was not not 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.400
 Just like ours she had no filtering 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.270
 she was not allowed as people 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.760
 knows today 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.400
 so they had a great load of 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.870
 materials its manufacturing process 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.600
 the beer was not 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.690
 we often see today was blurred 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.000
 very dark they were taking the parents 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.850
 since the propellers of all history 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.550
 with the fall of the Roman empire the priests 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.680
 kept all their writings with 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.470
 all the recipes and were propagating 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.570
 That's the beer as we know it today. 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.950
 made from water barley hops and yeast 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.080
 very different at that time 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.630
 at that time they put barley 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.239
 wheat malt placed herbs 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.840
 aromatic and diverse they could be 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.800
 the shop could 7 miisia police mika could 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.470
 be jealous 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.410
 the zimbru and several others placed honey 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.459
 They put spices much in 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.190
 15th century 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.060
 the duct of the abav was in decreed 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.850
 right rebound of mouth to speak or 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.500
 simply purity law and this prior 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.930
 establish a standard for manufacturing 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.570
 where this law determined that 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.720
 the beer was only produced 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.150
 the barley malt hops and water they do not 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.430
 they knew until then what she yeast 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.080
 the fermentation believed that it was 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.500
 including that it could be a divine work 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.100
 no beer was growing and expanding 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.479
 was expanding in england they 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.280
 they could not I and I would not profit them 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.680
 I was a beer thing was that 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.630
 thing that was made with profit the beer 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.050
 was expanding to belgium for the 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.919
 france for holland austria the people 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:03.270
 Nordic countries including Finland 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.180
 they produce sat at a profit 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.800
 made with the symbol I remember including 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.140
 used to make the beer today was 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.320
 growing growing more and more in the 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.110
 14th century a sitter from a monastery to 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.340
 playing games found that the profit was very 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.039
 important for beer 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.900
 profit is used and not for 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.539
 primarily to give bitterness and 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.800
 unused flavor for preserving a 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.960
 natural preservative 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.560
 profit is called a jump one of the 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.380
 nuclei used only the female flower 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.570
 and her profit can give you so much scent 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.210
 when the flavor you have profits only from 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.900
 aroma taste and have the profits that are 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.720
 called both high aroma 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.570
 the injury was discovered only 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.660
 18th century by louis pasteur 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:54.320
 he got was the first person he saw 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.690
 the microscope or a bacterium that was 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.039
 time to the person in charge of the fermentation 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.190
 It is called saccharomyces. 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.830
 cerevisiae or sakharov from brewer to 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.870
 beer has been improving has been improving and 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.550
 hence thousand children born in that me a 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.160
 biochemist who was working on the 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.930
 carlsberg tv already in denmark 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.780
 discovered two different types of 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.400
 yeast yeast to do and then I 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.039
 to do the best to make the 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.400
 are beers to make 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:25.780
 low fermentation and are in acai and 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.880
 high fermentation or linde was a great 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.810
 propellant also because he discovered the 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.270
 cooling 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:36.080
 from there it was possible to make beer 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.000
 the year in which anything else that 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.000
 people are already right 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.220
 140 more are being produced today. 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.349
 styles worldwide more or 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.419
 less one 50 styles are not produced 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:49.849
 And so people, I'm enjoying our chat.
