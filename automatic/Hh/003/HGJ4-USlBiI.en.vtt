the first explosion lasted for about 10
minutes<00:00:39.450> where<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> house<00:00:40.020> was<00:00:40.230> shaking

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.550 

hey<00:00:46.540> this<00:00:46.750> thing<00:00:46.930> is<00:00:46.990> huge

no specifics on what went wrong but
obviously<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.750> gas<00:01:03.990> line<00:01:04.230> was<00:01:04.290> struck<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
obviously that gas line was struck and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.450 
obviously that gas line was struck and
ruptured

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460

it's<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.150> hot<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:26.190> explosion<00:01:26.700> was<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:26.820> big<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
it's so hot the explosion was so big and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
it's so hot the explosion was so big and
the<00:01:27.540> chaos<00:01:27.840> was<00:01:28.050> so<00:01:28.259> bad<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> numbers<00:01:29.130> all

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the chaos was so bad the numbers all

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.780 
the chaos was so bad the numbers all
afternoon<00:01:29.670> were<00:01:29.940> across<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.300> board<00:01:31.729> it's<00:01:32.729> not

for continues to give us a look at the
smoldering<00:01:35.970> aftermath<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.770> only<00:01:38.220> person

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
smoldering aftermath the only person

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.399 
smoldering aftermath the only person
missing<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.720> person<00:01:40.020> who<00:01:40.080> was<00:01:40.200> actually

missing is the person who was actually
driving<00:01:41.039> that<00:01:41.369> heavy<00:01:41.640> equipment

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.840 

as<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> 36<00:01:46.500> inch<00:01:46.710> pipe<00:01:47.369> with

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
as it was a 36 inch pipe with

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.390 
as it was a 36 inch pipe with
high-pressure<00:01:48.390> natural<00:01:49.049> gas<00:01:52.220> that's<00:01:53.220> a

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
high-pressure natural gas that's a

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:11.010 
high-pressure natural gas that's a
telling<00:01:53.790> picture<00:01:54.150> right<00:01:54.330> there

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.590 

and<00:02:11.530> it's<00:02:11.800> pretty<00:02:12.130> amazing<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.730> power<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.330> the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
and it's pretty amazing the power of the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.590 
and it's pretty amazing the power of the
force<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.170> explosion
