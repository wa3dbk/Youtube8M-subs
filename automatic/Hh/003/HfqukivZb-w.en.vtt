00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
start off by just pointing some sort of

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.810 
start off by just pointing some sort of
shapes<00:00:07.290> into<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.859> hands<00:00:08.250> because<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.519> hand<00:00:08.760> I

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
shapes into the hands because the hand I

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.120 
shapes into the hands because the hand I
hated<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.780> do<00:00:09.900> anything<00:00:10.260> on<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> hand<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:10.889> I

hated to do anything on the hand so I
was<00:00:11.759> just<00:00:11.790> sculpting<00:00:12.330> go<00:00:12.799> out<00:00:13.799> those<00:00:14.099> big<00:00:14.370> sort

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
was just sculpting go out those big sort

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.400 
was just sculpting go out those big sort
of<00:00:14.670> bulges<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.330> see<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.599> hands<00:00:16.020> trying

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
of bulges that you see on hands trying

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.660 
of bulges that you see on hands trying
to<00:00:16.470> make<00:00:16.590> him<00:00:16.680> look<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.830> bit<00:00:16.980> more<00:00:17.070> realistic<00:00:17.400> in

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
to make him look a bit more realistic in

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.650 
to make him look a bit more realistic in
that<00:00:17.699> get<00:00:18.690> bit<00:00:18.840> more<00:00:18.960> shape<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.470> there<00:00:19.760> I<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:21.420> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
that get bit more shape in there I was I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.840 
that get bit more shape in there I was I
was<00:00:21.779> considering<00:00:22.279> subdividing<00:00:23.279> again<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.820> I

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
was considering subdividing again but I

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.009 
was considering subdividing again but I
don't<00:00:24.000> think<00:00:24.330> I'm<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> bother<00:00:24.750> now

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
don't think I'm going to bother now

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.950 
don't think I'm going to bother now
because<00:00:25.670> I've<00:00:26.670> done<00:00:26.970> quite<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.420> detail<00:00:27.779> on

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
because I've done quite on detail on

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.439 
because I've done quite on detail on
this<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.470> sub<00:00:28.710> divisional<00:00:29.010> level<00:00:29.240> in<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
this this sub divisional level in the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.370 
this this sub divisional level in the
next<00:00:30.480> video<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:32.690> but<00:00:33.690> yeah<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.870> know<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.200> try

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
next video so but yeah you know so try

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.290 
next video so but yeah you know so try
to<00:00:34.440> make<00:00:34.620> them<00:00:34.739> look<00:00:34.860> more<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.190> hands<00:00:35.610> I

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
to make them look more like hands I

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.740 
to make them look more like hands I
might<00:00:36.840> do<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> bit<00:00:37.950> more<00:00:37.980> work<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.460> there

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
might do so do a bit more work on there

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.819 
might do so do a bit more work on there
try<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.840> make<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.050> more<00:00:40.140> interesting<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.710> it's

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
try and make it more interesting so it's

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.500 
try and make it more interesting so it's
just<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.070> kind<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.700> big<00:00:41.940> spot<00:00:42.300> cheese

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
just a kind of big spot cheese

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.650 
just a kind of big spot cheese
everywhere<00:00:42.870> at<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.110> point<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.510> but<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> don't

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
everywhere at this point so but I don't

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.000 
everywhere at this point so but I don't
know<00:00:45.780> when<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> zoom<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.649> stuff<00:00:46.890> it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
know when you zoom out and stuff it

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.880 
know when you zoom out and stuff it
looks<00:00:47.190> looks<00:00:47.789> okay<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.719> really<00:00:49.469> when<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
looks looks okay and really when you

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.400 
looks looks okay and really when you
actually<00:00:50.100> bake<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.820> baked<00:00:51.390> hands<00:00:51.930> down<00:00:52.260> into

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
actually bake the baked hands down into

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.520 
actually bake the baked hands down into
a<00:00:52.530> texture<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:54.570> lose<00:00:54.750> mostly<00:00:55.199> detail

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
a texture you you lose mostly detail

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.490 
a texture you you lose mostly detail
anyway<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:55.920> from<00:00:56.910> experience<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.899> tend

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
anyway so from experience I just I tend

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.389 
anyway so from experience I just I tend
not<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.680> go<00:00:59.190> mental<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.699> hands<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:01.710> depends

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
not to go mental on the hands it depends

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.100 
not to go mental on the hands it depends
if<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> characters<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:03.989> be

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
if the characters like I'm going to be

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.600 
if the characters like I'm going to be
seen<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> think<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.250> look<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
seen you know I think I look at the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.000 
seen you know I think I look at the
hands<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.970> well<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.600> mean<00:01:07.439> most<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.799> time

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
hands as well so I mean most of the time

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.700 
hands as well so I mean most of the time
this<00:01:08.520> character<00:01:09.060> would<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.409> no<00:01:10.409> charge

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
this character would be like no charge

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.410 
this character would be like no charge
you're<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:10.979> used<00:01:11.130> swinging<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.909> know

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you're not used swinging like I know

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.630 
you're not used swinging like I know
knifes<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.170> stuff<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.560> he<00:01:14.280> probably

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
knifes at you and stuff so he probably

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
knifes at you and stuff so he probably
won't<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> chance<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.570> see<00:01:16.439> all

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
won't really have a chance to see all

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.890 
won't really have a chance to see all
the<00:01:16.680> detail<00:01:16.979> his<00:01:17.130> hands<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:18.570> long<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.750> they

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the detail his hands but as long as they

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.830 
the detail his hands but as long as they
look<00:01:19.049> good<00:01:19.229> good<00:01:20.040> enough<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.400> solve<00:01:20.689> come<00:01:21.689> off

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
look good good enough to solve come off

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.580 
look good good enough to solve come off
his<00:01:21.990> hands<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.560> that's<00:01:23.520> cool<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.350> it's<00:01:25.350> pretty

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
his hands and that's cool so it's pretty

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.530 
his hands and that's cool so it's pretty
much<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.100> deny<00:01:26.700> anything<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:27.060> well<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.450> had

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
much one deny anything as well as I had

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.390 
much one deny anything as well as I had
to<00:01:27.630> do<00:01:27.780> them<00:01:27.900> twice<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:29.220> really<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.700> yeah

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
to do them twice so I was really so yeah

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.100 
to do them twice so I was really so yeah
but<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> did<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.909> could<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.840> been<00:01:33.900> done<00:01:34.079> with

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
but I did it could have been done with

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.810 
but I did it could have been done with
and<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:34.979> look<00:01:35.130> okay<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.549> yeah<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.670> pretty

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and they look okay so yeah it's pretty

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.370 
and they look okay so yeah it's pretty
much<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.270> really<00:01:39.360> finish<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.960> hands<00:01:40.170> I'll

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
much it really finish up the hands I'll

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.770 
much it really finish up the hands I'll
up<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.700> started<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.210> refine<00:01:42.509> some<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
up and then I started to refine some of

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780 
up and then I started to refine some of
the<00:01:42.840> muscles<00:01:43.170> again<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:44.369> put<00:01:44.549> some<00:01:44.759> more

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the muscles again just put some more

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.330 
the muscles again just put some more
shapes<00:01:45.360> into<00:01:45.689> there<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.799> video<00:01:47.040> was

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
shapes into there because this video was

interesting I think the belts ain't
really<00:02:13.590> done<00:02:13.740> anything<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.160> belt<00:02:14.340> yet<00:02:14.640> so

sure<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.239> everything's<00:03:45.540> right<00:03:46.760> might<00:03:47.760> do<00:03:47.910> a

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
sure that everything's right might do a

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.180 
sure that everything's right might do a
bit<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.090> work<00:03:48.239> on<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.860> belt<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.920> little<00:03:50.070> bit

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
bit of work on that belt a little bit

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.680 
bit of work on that belt a little bit
more<00:03:50.310> add<00:03:50.400> some<00:03:50.610> more<00:03:50.760> wear<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.180> tear<00:03:51.420> though

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
more add some more wear and tear though

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.350 
more add some more wear and tear though
it's<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.110> bit<00:03:52.260> sort<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:53.190> know<00:03:53.250> it's<00:03:54.150> do<00:03:54.269> it

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
it's a bit sort of you know it's do it

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.360 
it's a bit sort of you know it's do it
flat<00:03:54.660> at<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:54.870> point<00:03:55.140> which<00:03:55.950> looks<00:03:56.190> like<00:03:56.340> a

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
flat at this point which looks like a

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.690 
flat at this point which looks like a
rectangle<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:57.620> nice<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.920> know<00:03:58.950> just<00:03:59.400> try<00:03:59.549> make

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
rectangle a nice you know just try make

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.530 
rectangle a nice you know just try make
a<00:03:59.730> bit<00:03:59.940> more<00:04:00.120> sort<00:04:00.390> of<00:04:00.420> level<00:04:00.810> Rio<00:04:00.930> something

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.060 

yeah<00:04:04.540> it's<00:04:04.720> then<00:04:04.870> look<00:04:05.080> a<00:04:05.140> lot<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.560> lot<00:04:06.010> more

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
yeah it's then look a lot a lot more

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.860 
yeah it's then look a lot a lot more
finished<00:04:06.550> not<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.790> lot<00:04:07.000> on<00:04:07.120> polish<00:04:07.480> now<00:04:07.750> I've

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
finished not a lot on polish now I've

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.990 
finished not a lot on polish now I've
got<00:04:08.020> these<00:04:08.170> source<00:04:08.440> traps<00:04:08.770> in<00:04:08.950> there<00:04:09.130> just

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
got these source traps in there just

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.370 
got these source traps in there just
finishing<00:04:10.420> up<00:04:10.480> this<00:04:10.630> art<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:10.990> strapped<00:04:11.230> as

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
finishing up this art and strapped as

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.090 
finishing up this art and strapped as
well<00:04:11.760> now<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:13.240> think<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.750> end<00:04:13.900> up<00:04:14.110> copying<00:04:14.320> a<00:04:14.710> copy

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
well now I think I end up copying a copy

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.850 
well now I think I end up copying a copy
the<00:04:15.370> belt<00:04:15.550> up<00:04:15.700> here<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:16.090> belt<00:04:16.240> buckle<00:04:16.860> she

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
the belt up here the belt buckle she

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.440 
the belt up here the belt buckle she
shifts<00:04:18.220> my<00:04:18.370> fart<00:04:18.730> of<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:18.940> way<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.090> little<00:04:19.270> bit

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
shifts my fart of the way a little bit

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.260 
shifts my fart of the way a little bit
as<00:04:19.540> well<00:04:22.050> same<00:04:23.050> process<00:04:23.500> again<00:04:24.060> extract<00:04:25.060> out

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
as well same process again extract out

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.030 
as well same process again extract out
yeah<00:04:25.750> sort<00:04:26.470> of<00:04:26.560> end<00:04:26.860> of<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.460> belt<00:04:27.640> as<00:04:27.790> well<00:04:29.040> I'm

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
yeah sort of end of the belt as well I'm

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.980 
yeah sort of end of the belt as well I'm
just<00:04:30.250> trying<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.430> make<00:04:30.580> everything<00:04:31.060> how<00:04:31.600> it

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
just trying to make everything how it

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.160 
just trying to make everything how it
would<00:04:32.440> sort<00:04:32.980> of<00:04:33.040> exist<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:33.760> know<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:33.940> mean

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
would sort of exist you know I mean

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.690 
would sort of exist you know I mean
that's<00:04:35.170> often<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.680> easiest<00:04:36.100> way<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.370> do<00:04:36.580> it

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
that's often the easiest way to do it

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.680 
that's often the easiest way to do it
when<00:04:36.820> ZBrush<00:04:37.150> you<00:04:37.240> know<00:04:37.330> just<00:04:37.480> think<00:04:37.630> about

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
when ZBrush you know just think about

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.960 
when ZBrush you know just think about
ways<00:04:38.200> in<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:38.680> real<00:04:38.860> world<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.370> just<00:04:39.550> make<00:04:39.730> in

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
ways in the real world and just make in

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.720 
ways in the real world and just make in
ZBrush<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.570> it's<00:04:41.350> great<00:04:41.620> pretty<00:04:42.580> simple

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
ZBrush and it's great pretty simple

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.950 
ZBrush and it's great pretty simple
stuff<00:04:42.880> early<00:04:43.950> but<00:04:45.150> if<00:04:46.150> you're<00:04:46.330> new<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.480> ZBrush

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
stuff early but if you're new to ZBrush

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.770 
stuff early but if you're new to ZBrush
like<00:04:47.140> understand<00:04:47.620> -<00:04:47.830> pretty<00:04:48.130> solve<00:04:48.780> difficult

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
like understand - pretty solve difficult

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.570 
like understand - pretty solve difficult
to<00:04:50.110> sort<00:04:50.350> of<00:04:50.470> think<00:04:50.800> about<00:04:50.890> how<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:51.280> can<00:04:51.460> it

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
to sort of think about how you can it

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.120 
to sort of think about how you can it
builds<00:04:51.850> with<00:04:52.000> incus<00:04:52.650> see<00:04:53.650> I've<00:04:53.860> been<00:04:53.950> using

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
builds with incus see I've been using

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.980 
builds with incus see I've been using
ZBrush<00:04:54.550> for<00:04:54.700> so<00:04:54.820> long<00:04:55.030> now<00:04:55.240> I<00:04:55.270> can<00:04:55.660> just<00:04:55.810> think

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
ZBrush for so long now I can just think

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.720 
ZBrush for so long now I can just think
of<00:04:56.140> something<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:56.650> I<00:04:56.710> just<00:04:56.740> know<00:04:57.160> how<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.460> make

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
of something and I just know how to make

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.760 
of something and I just know how to make
it<00:04:57.940> straight<00:04:58.180> away<00:04:58.270> some<00:04:59.050> so<00:04:59.260> comfortable

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
it straight away some so comfortable

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.020 
it straight away some so comfortable
tools<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:00.520> that's<00:05:01.390> just<00:05:01.600> all<00:05:01.780> down<00:05:02.140> to<00:05:02.380> how

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
tools and that's just all down to how

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.650 
tools and that's just all down to how
much<00:05:04.030> you<00:05:04.270> use<00:05:04.540> ZBrush<00:05:05.350> so<00:05:05.650> you<00:05:06.610> know<00:05:06.700> just<00:05:07.210> try

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
much you use ZBrush so you know just try

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.270 
much you use ZBrush so you know just try
to<00:05:07.780> open<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.110> program<00:05:08.320> open<00:05:08.620> up<00:05:08.740> everyday<00:05:08.980> and

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
to open the program open up everyday and

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.950 
to open the program open up everyday and
just<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:09.730> know<00:05:09.760> get<00:05:10.060> into<00:05:10.180> sculpting<00:05:10.750> stuff

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
just you know get into sculpting stuff

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.860 
just you know get into sculpting stuff
and<00:05:11.320> you'll<00:05:12.010> soon<00:05:12.190> so<00:05:12.670> get<00:05:13.540> more<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:13.840> more

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
and you'll soon so get more and more

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.140 
and you'll soon so get more and more
comfortable<00:05:14.110> in<00:05:17.400> using<00:05:18.400> different<00:05:18.640> out<00:05:18.880> front
