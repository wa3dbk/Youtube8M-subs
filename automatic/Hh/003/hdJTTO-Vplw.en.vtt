00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello shop welcomes you 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.080
 electrical market will want you 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.849
 demonstrate voltage relay adex 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.920
 this manufacturers is in the city 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.980
 Kharkov, that is, the production of Ukrainian 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.170
 so this relay has certain 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.240
 features that is she firstly can 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.320
 show on the display you see 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.359
 we have such a double 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.619
 she will show how voltage is like at all 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.960
 straps so there will still be the same 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.060
 show load current not all irises 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.279
 or voltage shows this parameter 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.189
 here it is the load current in amperes 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.809
 respectively you can see and 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.010
 understand what the load on your object 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.030
 This is currently connected as well. 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.079
 feature of this relay 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.719
 are two levels of disconnection by 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.420
 voltage is simply the level 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.800
 voltage outages well let me 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.780
 I'll show you right away how she is 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.860
 actually looks then press 2 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.829
 buttons to go to mode 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.940
 programming for the button right away we 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.399
 see 245 one fault 260 volts below this 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.040
 a second pair of 200 songs 45 is the threshold 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.720
 shutdown at which shutdown 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.549
 happen in one second robe 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.600
 voltage at which the connection 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.220
 will pass in one second that is 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.650
 rose sharply voltage let's say in 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.369
 particular 245 climbed flight to to 200 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.890
 46 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.360
 the relay waits one second and then 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.040
 disconnects the output voltage 2 threshold 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.140
 the stage is already the threshold at which 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.659
 achieving this voltage relay 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.869
 disconnect the load at the output for a while 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.590
 four hundredths of a second that's what these 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.049
 all rapids 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.960
 need that is if you have tension in 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.520
 the network is very much walking and do you have your 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.200
 the relay allows only one threshold 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.329
 to regulate you constantly the light in the house 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.860
 it will constantly turn off that relyushka 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.570
 programmed let's say you will be on 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.790
 two hundred forty two volts someone 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.649
 voltage reaches 200 45 principle 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.780
 nothing critical at such a voltage with 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.579
 your technique should not happen but 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.470
 you all will turn off all the settings 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.090
 if at home there are all sorts of microwaves 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.610
 on which let's say the clock is set yet 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.829
 something kite audio video equipment is all 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.390
 will constantly shoot down this housing 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.430
 provided 2 thresholds 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.049
 that is, at the first if it is these jumps 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.610
 short-term voltage 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.650
 jumped cutting there to 200 47 volts 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.080
 up to 1 second and again 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.180
 returned to normal relay is not disabled and 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.090
 now two hundred and sixty is the threshold at 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.110
 which it will include 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.580
 shut off as quickly as possible 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.380
 speed with 4 speed 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.870
 milliseconds look further further 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.730
 move on to the following so we also 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.130
 turned off the programming mode you to 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:38.170
 5 turn it on go to the second threshold 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.320
 there are two thresholds next 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.570
 low voltage shutdowns 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.250
 we see the first 195 2 180 when reaching 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.560
 195 volts and drop below there let's say up 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.270
 190 4 volt relay shuts off in one 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.760
 a second if the voltage drops to the threshold 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:01.470
 instant shutdown to 180 volts there 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.959
 already off in four hundredths of a second 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.120
 we go further that she still knows how to eat 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.850
 this relay can also limit us 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.770
 load if roughly you know 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.140
 let us let you old wiring in the house 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.120
 relays you have 40 amps like this which 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.560
 we show now but you want 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.680
 limit and for some reason 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.709
 consumption you can limit it 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.470
 current with this relay now 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.900
 You see the limit is 40 amps 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.280
 you can in programming mode and 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.290
 replace can put limit 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.830
 load 32 amps 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.830
 can put 25 with a lower threshold of 25 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.290
 push again decreasing and the relay is not 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.220
 allow you to turn on the load more than 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.680
 25 amps 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.030
 this other voltage relays too 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.110
 manufacturers can not do this 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.580
 the next mode here it is now with us 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.290
 indication is 30 this is the time at which 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.820
 the relay turns on that is roughly speaking 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.049
 now it costs 30 seconds if we do it 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.970
 mode remember the mouth roughly speaking 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.829
 turned off our voltage turned off 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.560
 then the district turned on again 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.450
 only starts after 30 seconds if 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.430
 you want to run faster then you 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.200
 you can click a button to empty then it 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.690
 will go into enable mode 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.690
 but faster then there will be a 10 second mode 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.220
 us for now 10 seconds gone the timer here 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.440
 these are the main features of the data 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.500
 relyushki although warranty for voltage relays 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.350
 adex goes 5 years they all fasten on 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.390
 din rail is standard like all relyushki 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.290
 voltage that is signed by us 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.460
 terminals means lower lyudmila left crank 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.250
 Klem it will be with us 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.600
 phase input to this terminal is connected 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.230
 0 well, yes here we have phase 1 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.230
 Thank you all for your attention
