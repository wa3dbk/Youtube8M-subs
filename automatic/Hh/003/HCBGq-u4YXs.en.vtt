00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779 
very very nice it's a bit different than

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.360 
very very nice it's a bit different than
just<00:05:29.810> air<00:05:30.110> getting<00:05:30.379> princesses<00:05:30.979> all<00:05:31.099> the<00:05:31.190> time

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
just air getting princesses all the time

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.450 
just air getting princesses all the time
I<00:05:32.680> think<00:05:33.680> we've<00:05:33.770> time<00:05:33.979> this<00:05:34.190> just<00:05:34.219> right

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
I think we've time this just right

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.610 
I think we've time this just right
obviously<00:05:34.789> because<00:05:35.120> a<00:05:35.150> Angelina<00:05:36.139> Jolie<00:05:36.469> is

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
obviously because a Angelina Jolie is

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.550 
obviously because a Angelina Jolie is
going<00:05:36.860> to<00:05:37.039> take<00:05:37.339> up<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:37.580> role<00:05:37.729> of<00:05:37.759> Maleficent

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
going to take up the role of Maleficent

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.779 
going to take up the role of Maleficent
which<00:05:39.560> I<00:05:39.830> don't<00:05:39.919> think<00:05:40.400> they<00:05:40.520> could<00:05:40.669> have

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
which I don't think they could have

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.570 
which I don't think they could have
picked<00:05:40.940> a<00:05:41.150> better<00:05:41.379> actress<00:05:42.379> to<00:05:42.620> do<00:05:42.710> it<00:05:42.889> so

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
picked a better actress to do it so

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.490 
picked a better actress to do it so
hopefully<00:05:44.089> Disney<00:05:45.020> he'll<00:05:45.139> have<00:05:45.289> a<00:05:45.319> lot<00:05:45.469> of

preorder them in a batch for 300 pounds
but<00:06:09.500> I<00:06:09.529> think<00:06:10.039> the<00:06:10.190> only<00:06:10.370> character<00:06:10.729> I'm<00:06:10.789> not

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:10.909 
but I think the only character I'm not

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.399 
but I think the only character I'm not
going<00:06:11.029> to<00:06:11.089> get<00:06:11.240> and<00:06:11.449> forgive<00:06:11.870> me<00:06:12.020> I<00:06:12.050> forget<00:06:12.349> a

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
tangled but did enjoy the movie but

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.180 
tangled but did enjoy the movie but
obviously<00:06:19.009> it's<00:06:19.159> not<00:06:19.279> as<00:06:19.430> classic<00:06:20.240> as<00:06:20.539> you<00:06:20.810> say

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
obviously it's not as classic as you say

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.529 
obviously it's not as classic as you say
as<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.580> other<00:06:22.699> villains<00:06:23.029> that<00:06:23.270> they<00:06:23.449> are

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
as the other villains that they are

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.899 
as the other villains that they are
doing<00:06:23.750> in<00:06:23.870> the<00:06:23.990> range<00:06:24.199> so<00:06:24.589> that's<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.699> reason

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
doing in the range so that's the reason

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.820 
doing in the range so that's the reason
why<00:06:25.969> I<00:06:26.029> didn't<00:06:26.209> Pro<00:06:26.330> them<00:06:26.569> in<00:06:26.719> a<00:06:26.750> bulk<00:06:27.319> because

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
why I didn't Pro them in a bulk because

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.480 
why I didn't Pro them in a bulk because

to<00:06:45.460> say<00:06:45.580> what<00:06:45.759> sort<00:06:45.970> of<00:06:46.060> quality<00:06:46.840> the<00:06:46.930> body<00:06:47.110> is

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:47.259 
to say what sort of quality the body is

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:49.290 
to say what sort of quality the body is
like<00:06:47.440> I<00:06:47.470> mean<00:06:47.710> it<00:06:47.830> is<00:06:47.919> just<00:06:47.949> like<00:06:48.340> plastic<00:06:48.879> but

like I mean it is just like plastic but

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.920 
like I mean it is just like plastic but
I<00:06:49.360> won't<00:06:49.509> say<00:06:49.659> it's<00:06:49.810> like<00:06:49.930> Barbie<00:06:50.349> doll<00:06:50.500> style

I won't say it's like Barbie doll style

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.230 
I won't say it's like Barbie doll style
because<00:06:52.930> it<00:06:53.050> feels<00:06:55.409> quite<00:06:56.409> different<00:06:56.770> to<00:06:56.889> that

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240
