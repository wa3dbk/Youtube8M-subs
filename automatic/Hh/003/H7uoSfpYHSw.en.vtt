your<00:01:03.840> use<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.110> models<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.799> let<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.790> one

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
your use of models so let this one

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.120 
your use of models so let this one
you'll<00:01:06.119> notice<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.540> got<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> pretty<00:01:06.900> strong

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
you'll notice it's got a pretty strong

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.320 
you'll notice it's got a pretty strong
engine<00:01:08.130> swivel<00:01:08.520> hinge<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> middle

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
engine swivel hinge here in the middle

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.870 
engine swivel hinge here in the middle
bi-directional<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.130> only<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.729> this

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
bi-directional so not only will in this

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.710 
bi-directional so not only will in this
way<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> opens<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.380> way<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.590> well<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
way that opens on this way as well and

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.170 
way that opens on this way as well and
supports<00:01:15.720> both<00:01:15.840> pen<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.500> touch<00:01:17.030> with<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
supports both pen and touch with the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
supports both pen and touch with the
freenas<00:01:18.750> capacity<00:01:19.320> pudge<00:01:19.500> solution<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.100> is

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
freenas capacity pudge solution which is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.340 
freenas capacity pudge solution which is
similar<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.030> we've<00:01:21.180> had<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> past<00:01:23.210> so

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
similar to what we've had in the past so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.120 
similar to what we've had in the past so
so<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.710> here<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.070> currently<00:01:26.729> running

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
so this one here is currently running

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.600 
so this one here is currently running
7bit<00:01:29.130> GCC<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.729> peak<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.799> pretty<00:01:31.799> easy<00:01:32.070> touch

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
7bit GCC is peak a pretty easy touch

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.910 
7bit GCC is peak a pretty easy touch
interface<00:01:33.770> sees<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> little<00:01:35.100> bit<00:01:35.220> simple<00:01:35.670> paint

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
interface sees a little bit simple paint

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.149 
interface sees a little bit simple paint
application<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:39.140> anyway<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.590> cushy

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
application here but anyway it's a cushy

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.190 
application here but anyway it's a cushy
little<00:01:41.280> bit<00:01:41.460> more<00:01:41.610> fingering<00:01:42.450> Mueller<00:01:42.899> yes

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
little bit more fingering Mueller yes

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.410 
little bit more fingering Mueller yes
sure<00:01:43.350> yeah<00:01:44.220> we're<00:01:44.369> get<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.550> push<00:01:44.789> off<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.340 

so<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.600> is<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.780> 44<00:01:53.350> point<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:54.190> touch<00:01:55.140> screen<00:01:56.140> and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
so this is a 44 point I touch screen and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.380 
so this is a 44 point I touch screen and
this<00:01:56.440> is<00:01:56.590> intricate<00:01:57.310> again<00:01:57.730> yes<00:01:58.060> which<00:01:58.240> was

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
this is intricate again yes which was

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.480 
this is intricate again yes which was
like<00:01:58.510> before<00:01:58.630> right<00:01:59.470> that's<00:01:59.950> right<00:02:02.370> and<00:02:03.370> then

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
like before right that's right and then

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.250 
like before right that's right and then
we've<00:02:03.670> retained<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.270> lot<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.630> tablet

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
we've retained a lot of the tablet

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.840 
we've retained a lot of the tablet

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.100 
centric features we built on the first
few<00:02:06.970> models<00:02:07.240> interviewing<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.750> lot<00:02:07.870> of<00:02:07.960> we<00:02:08.020> have

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
few models interviewing a lot of we have

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.830 
few models interviewing a lot of we have
programmable<00:02:08.619> buttons<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.450> know<00:02:10.540> serve

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
programmable buttons and you know serve

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.330 
programmable buttons and you know serve
volume<00:02:11.200> up<00:02:11.320> here<00:02:11.530> but<00:02:11.680> then<00:02:11.770> programmable

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
volume up here but then programmable

areas down here the power button here
which<00:02:14.530> really<00:02:14.800> makes<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.100> easier<00:02:15.400> for<00:02:15.580> an<00:02:15.670> a

camera actually appear on the top which

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.170 
camera actually appear on the top which
makes<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.070> easier<00:02:18.340> when<00:02:18.460> your<00:02:18.580> tablet<00:02:18.940> mug<00:02:19.090> you

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
don't have to do so many things like

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.930 
don't have to do so many things like
open<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.590> system<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.010> get<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.280> keyboard

open the system and get to the keyboard

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.640 
open the system and get to the keyboard
to<00:02:22.210> having<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.930> do<00:02:23.020> some<00:02:23.200> function<00:02:23.560> you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
to having to do some function you

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.870 
to having to do some function you
actually<00:02:23.890> program<00:02:24.190> some<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:24.670> here

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
actually program some of that in here

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.280 
actually program some of that in here
now<00:02:25.209> you'll<00:02:25.360> notice<00:02:25.510> in<00:02:25.750> your<00:02:25.840> hand<00:02:26.050> it's<00:02:26.200> a

we could do to have a bit harder we
looked<00:02:48.100> at<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.220> couple<00:02:48.370> options<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:49.090> can<00:02:49.209> go

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
looked at a couple options you can go

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.170 
looked at a couple options you can go
from<00:02:49.600> what<00:02:50.140> we<00:02:50.230> shipping<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.490> 12.1<00:02:52.030> inch

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
from what we shipping is a 12.1 inch

12.5<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.570> but<00:02:55.840> then<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.470> look<00:02:56.800> at<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
12.5 in but then you look at the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.470 
12.5 in but then you look at the
differences<00:02:57.489> in<00:02:57.550> size<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.120> weight<00:02:58.300> and

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
just wasn't a lot of extra weight but it

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.190 
just wasn't a lot of extra weight but it
certainly<00:03:05.980> added<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.850> screen<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.360> distinctive

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200
