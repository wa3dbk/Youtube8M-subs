00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
and this video I'll be showing you how I

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.800 
and this video I'll be showing you how I
made<00:00:14.919> a<00:00:14.950> dress<00:00:15.429> for<00:00:15.669> a<00:00:15.700> pattern<00:00:16.059> that<00:00:16.209> I<00:00:16.390> made

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
made a dress for a pattern that I made

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.290 
made a dress for a pattern that I made
by<00:00:17.080> cutting<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:17.560> seams<00:00:17.890> open<00:00:18.160> of<00:00:18.609> a<00:00:18.759> shirt<00:00:19.060> and

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
by cutting the seams open of a shirt and

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.540 
by cutting the seams open of a shirt and
tracing<00:00:19.810> it<00:00:19.930> out<00:00:20.079> on<00:00:20.349> a<00:00:20.380> piece<00:00:20.770> of<00:00:20.950> paper<00:00:21.130> you

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
tracing it out on a piece of paper you

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.400 
tracing it out on a piece of paper you
can<00:00:21.970> see<00:00:22.180> how<00:00:22.329> I<00:00:22.360> did<00:00:22.689> that<00:00:22.840> in<00:00:23.020> my<00:00:23.140> previous

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
can see how I did that in my previous

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.490 
can see how I did that in my previous
video

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.560 

right<00:00:28.500> now<00:00:28.710> I'm<00:00:29.009> just<00:00:29.369> laying<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:29.849> fabric<00:00:30.359> out

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
right now I'm just laying my fabric out

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.900 
right now I'm just laying my fabric out
it<00:00:31.230> would<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.560> cut<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.919> a<00:00:31.949> fall<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:32.759> now

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
it would be cut on a fall but right now

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.970 
it would be cut on a fall but right now
I'm<00:00:33.059> using<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.540> single<00:00:33.960> side<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.800> when<00:00:34.949> I

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
I'm using a single side and when I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.700 
I'm using a single side and when I
finish<00:00:35.550> pinning<00:00:36.420> down<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:37.050> pattern<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.649> will

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
finish pinning down my pattern I will

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.650 
finish pinning down my pattern I will
fold<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.340> over<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.970> can<00:00:39.180> cut<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
fold it over so that I can cut it on a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.280 
fold it over so that I can cut it on a
fold

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.780 

when<00:00:47.290> you<00:00:47.440> buy<00:00:47.620> patterns<00:00:48.130> from<00:00:48.340> this<00:00:48.520> store

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
when you buy patterns from this store

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.310 
when you buy patterns from this store
they<00:00:49.000> have<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.239> line<00:00:49.570> on<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.810> that's<00:00:50.170> a

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
they have a line on it that's a

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.740 
they have a line on it that's a
straighter<00:00:50.680> grain<00:00:51.040> so<00:00:51.820> right<00:00:52.059> now<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.540> am

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
straighter grain so right now I am

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.210 
straighter grain so right now I am
measuring<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.320> straight<00:00:53.620> line<00:00:53.830> of<00:00:54.010> my

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
measuring the straight line of my

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.970 
measuring the straight line of my
pattern<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:54.970> making<00:00:55.180> sure<00:00:55.510> that<00:00:55.690> it<00:00:55.900> is

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
pattern and making sure that it is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.530 
pattern and making sure that it is
parallel<00:00:56.980> with<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.400> selvage<00:00:57.940> edge<00:00:58.150> of<00:00:58.360> my

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
parallel with the selvage edge of my

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.450 
parallel with the selvage edge of my
fabric

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.170 

I<00:01:03.710> am<00:01:04.710> securing<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> pattern<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> fabric

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
I am securing this pattern to the fabric

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.440 
I am securing this pattern to the fabric
as<00:01:06.630> best<00:01:06.900> as<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.820> fold<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
as best as I can I have to fold the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.899 
as best as I can I have to fold the
fabric<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.140> half<00:01:10.229> across<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.430> straight<00:01:11.700> line

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
fabric in half across the straight line

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.120 
fabric in half across the straight line
of<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.150> pattern<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.470> both<00:01:13.770> sides

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
of the pattern so that I have both sides

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:58.970 
of the pattern so that I have both sides
and<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.970> half

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.760 

be<00:01:59.640> sure<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.180> cut<00:02:00.450> enough<00:02:00.840> space<00:02:01.260> for<00:02:01.290> your

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
be sure to cut enough space for your

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.340 
be sure to cut enough space for your
hips<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.460> booty<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.660> have<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.870> lot<00:02:04.170> of

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
hips and your booty if you have a lot of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.810 
hips and your booty if you have a lot of
it<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.650> you<00:02:04.800> don't<00:02:04.980> cut<00:02:05.160> you<00:02:05.250> knock<00:02:05.460> space

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
it and you don't cut you knock space

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.580 
it and you don't cut you knock space
then<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.360> won't<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.720> able<00:02:06.870> to<00:02:07.020> fit<00:02:07.290> into<00:02:07.440> your
