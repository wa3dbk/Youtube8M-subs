00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
bit of what makes her difficult to be

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.209 
bit of what makes her difficult to be
played<00:00:49.190> she<00:00:50.190> has<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:51.090> pretty<00:00:51.739> uncommon<00:00:52.739> skill

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
rate I think that you can see the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.630 
rate I think that you can see the
pattern<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:09.810> right<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.470> mean<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.370> higher<00:02:11.610> we

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
pattern here right I mean the higher we

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.960 
pattern here right I mean the higher we
get<00:02:12.120> in<00:02:12.360> the

the<00:02:58.240> answer<00:02:58.630> is<00:02:58.660> probably<00:02:59.140> no<00:02:59.980> but<00:03:00.850> if<00:03:01.390> you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
the answer is probably no but if you

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.660 
the answer is probably no but if you

in<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.440> wind<00:03:38.680> rate<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.250> high<00:03:39.280> is<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.300> really

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
in the wind rate so high is it really

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.449 
in the wind rate so high is it really
because<00:03:40.750> people<00:03:41.410> player<00:03:41.680> better<00:03:42.100> or<00:03:42.400> just
