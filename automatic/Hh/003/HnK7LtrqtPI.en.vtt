00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
well if you wanted to and then this is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.730 
well if you wanted to and then this is
the<00:01:08.700> clamp<00:01:08.909> right<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.450> there's<00:01:09.960> also<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.350> drag

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the clamp right here there's also a drag

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.260 
the clamp right here there's also a drag
if<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> too<00:01:11.490> loose<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.119> could

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
if this is too loose for you you could

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.480 
if this is too loose for you you could
drag<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.780> over<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.979> will<00:01:14.159> tighten

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
drag it over here and this will tighten

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.390 
drag it over here and this will tighten
up<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.580> drag<00:01:15.170> it's<00:01:16.170> gotten<00:01:16.530> an<00:01:16.619> adjustable

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
up the drag it's gotten an adjustable

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100 
up the drag it's gotten an adjustable
rail<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.509> line<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.960> with

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
rail here so you can line it up with

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.590 
rail here so you can line it up with
your<00:01:19.200> lens<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.070> then<00:01:20.310> also<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:21.060> quick<00:01:21.450> release

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
your lens and then also a quick release

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.539 
your lens and then also a quick release
to<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> clamp<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> comes<00:01:23.100> right<00:01:23.369> off<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
to the clamp so it comes right off the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.160 
to the clamp so it comes right off the
top<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.090> don't<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.540> slide<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.900> over<00:01:24.990> your

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
top you don't have to slide it over your

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.630 
top you don't have to slide it over your
rods<00:01:25.850> also<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> has<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:28.130> repositionable<00:01:29.130> marker

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
rods also it has a repositionable marker

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.660 
rods also it has a repositionable marker
here<00:01:30.439> marking<00:01:31.439> disc<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.159> also<00:01:32.310> your

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
here marking disc and then also your

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.050 
here marking disc and then also your
variable<00:01:33.270> AV<00:01:33.450> heart<00:01:33.780> stops<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.880> then

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
variable AV heart stops and then

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.550 
variable AV heart stops and then
obviously<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.540> could<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> crank<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
obviously you could put a crank or a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.920 
obviously you could put a crank or a
whip<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.920> either<00:01:38.100> side<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.430> these<00:01:39.270> knobs<00:01:39.570> so

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
whip on either side of these knobs so

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.030 
whip on either side of these knobs so
you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.439> also<00:01:40.590> take<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.430> 42<00:01:42.090> tooth<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.619> move

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
you can also take the 42 tooth and move

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.319 
you can also take the 42 tooth and move
it<00:01:44.159> over<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> other<00:01:44.700> side<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.180> could

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
it over to the other side so you could

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.960 
it over to the other side so you could
reverse<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> wanted<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.619> back<00:01:47.340> here

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
reverse that if you wanted to back here

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.410 
reverse that if you wanted to back here
and<00:01:48.450> aside<00:01:48.720> from<00:01:48.750> 42<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.829> also<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.329> 60<00:01:51.329> if

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and aside from 42 you can also do 60 if

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.690 
and aside from 42 you can also do 60 if
you<00:01:51.509> wanted<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.840> larger<00:01:52.200> gear<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.490> swap

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
you wanted a larger gear so you can swap

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.580 
you wanted a larger gear so you can swap
that<00:01:53.729> out<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.899> also<00:01:55.049> comes<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
that out and then it also comes with a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.999 
that out and then it also comes with a
