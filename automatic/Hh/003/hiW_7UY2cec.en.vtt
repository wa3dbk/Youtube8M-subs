00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.910
 b + of the wreck body 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.910
 Earthquake-proof 's 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.980
 Pre- verified child of the recorder 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.870
 Sound comparison 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.420
 It is a microphone of the main body right now Selfie taking boa sister role I 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.950
 Because there are 8 meters 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.550
 I think it is quite good speaking voice 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.390
 But this say stick It is and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.020
 I think I'm picking up this too 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.440
 Because 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 ic recorder is ãƒ¼ 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.050
 Panasonic's rr eh 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.050
 455 h and Kana camphor s 4 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:57.420
 Not written up rr xs No. 4 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.680
 Using this microphone is an Audio-Technica monaural microphone at 990 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.219
 Four 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.740
 It is using it is pure 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.480
 Sponge window disturbed 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.290
 Even N flowers say Windomafu say this before I say 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.490
 Put it on now 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.820
 I am taking it here 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.880
 It is still just as it is of the body microphone 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.310
 I have never been 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.030
 in ic recorder microphone 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.440
 Switch 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.440
 Yes I switched now 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.440
 This is ic recorder mcm now pcm 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.300
 Jenny has taken with pcm 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.659
 Well when you mentioned youtube so much 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:45.909
 I think it will be converted but once 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:48.090
 Hanashiko I think that is also contains far is I voices doing this is we take in pcm 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.770
 This kind of like this 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.080
 So that sounds to think the body it this together almost from here and does not contain only the sound of fatigue only 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.000
 I think there is no sound 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:04.930
 In it it is also when you shorten this 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.930
 I think that there is no drop to pick things up from here 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.630
 Away doing well this 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.790
 Even taking 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.560
 I hear that there is a voice 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.709
 Are taking had one person with two people doing this I'm this convenient at the time of something really I travel 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.709
 No 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.640
 Where walking is incredible countryside now 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.780
 Rice has paid off 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.580
 I also liked Nette's all ic trip now 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.580
 Switch to the microphone 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.360
 I will ne 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.360
 A large Fighter Association probably so 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.150
 I think I will go east 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.870
 Maybe the sound of the wall is also included 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.870
 I wonder if I wind you 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.220
 If you switch to ic recorder microphone 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.680
 Yes switched 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.980
 How about that 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.980
 rain 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.650
 Let's bring the body closer 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:09.260
 Distance just stretched out of the arm about 60cm 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.150
 There is now the main body When it comes to here , I think that the sound is easy to enter after all even with the main body 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.300
 I will 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:19.620
 I think you have picked up firmly towards the ic recorder 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.620
 This is I think about because much the same as now eyes until near the face 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.640
 This is the main body ic recorder 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.910
 Together 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.430
 Well though it has switched hobbling now 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:37.719
 I think that I have entered the sound quality just after all 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.719
 I think it's different, isn't it monaural microphone degree at 9904? 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.250
 There is a paraglider there 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.410
 I'm landing 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.650
 Fly from the top of that mountain 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.650
 Yes 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.599
 What do you think 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.599
 I will extend it one more time Last 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.790
 Now this is an ic recorder microphone 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.709
 From picture books overseas 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.709
 ano ah ah ah ah 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.860
 What do you think 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.550
 There is also a main unit ic recorder microphone 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:16.139
 I 'm switching to go with this pig timer ic 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.440
 It's on this side of the screen screen that I'm switching. 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.250
 Go pro image and 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.580
 I think that the image of the ic recorder is the image of the p microphone 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.920
 That 's a package 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.510
 I think it is changing now 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.920
 Who is glowing 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.920
 It is voice input of that 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.620
 I am walking next to Imagawa 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:43.340
 This is it about immersion 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.340
 We leave contains the length of the Well 2 persons body weight of 1.8+ arm 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:53.580
 Such a feeling is well in ic decoder microphone, is n't it? 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.580
 Is a little might possibly voice has become strapping now 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.120
 There people have put you Yonee' 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.630
 I 'm a four of that person 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.280
 When I was traveling, I took the ic recorder with two cats and I couldn't help 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.870
 After all Tuesday of two people 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.740
 It Tteyuu two people be separated there is also two people of the conversation enters away 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.040
 This is great for everyday go- pros 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.330
 Put 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.330
 I think it's a good thing 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.330
 It is the end when it enters
