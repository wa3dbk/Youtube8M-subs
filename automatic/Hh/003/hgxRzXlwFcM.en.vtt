00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.579 

just<00:00:00.420> doing<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.719> little<00:00:00.840> experimenting<00:00:01.740> with

00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:03.589 
just doing a little experimenting with

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:09.440 
just doing a little experimenting with
some<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.799> new<00:00:05.629> spider<00:00:06.629> web<00:00:06.899> blocks<00:00:08.450> these

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
some of the new spider web blocks these

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.280 
some of the new spider web blocks these
are<00:00:09.630> not<00:00:09.750> actually<00:00:10.139> official<00:00:10.559> new<00:00:10.920> blocks<00:00:11.219> but

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
are not actually official new blocks but

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.529 
are not actually official new blocks but
they<00:00:13.290> are<00:00:14.150> available<00:00:15.150> if<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.450> have<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:16.520> item

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
they are available if you have a item

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.990 
they are available if you have a item
editor<00:00:18.619> you'll<00:00:19.619> find<00:00:19.859> them<00:00:20.100> along<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
editor you'll find them along with the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.470 
editor you'll find them along with the
other<00:00:21.119> new<00:00:21.750> mind<00:00:22.289> track<00:00:22.529> blocks<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:24.269> I've<00:00:24.330> got

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
other new mind track blocks so I've got

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.300 
other new mind track blocks so I've got
a<00:00:24.510> few<00:00:24.660> experiments<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:26.070> right<00:00:26.130> now

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
a few experiments going on right now

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.099 
a few experiments going on right now
I've<00:00:26.550> got<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.789> couple<00:00:26.970> animals<00:00:27.269> trapped<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:27.990> you

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
I've got a couple animals trapped as you

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.919 
I've got a couple animals trapped as you
can<00:00:28.230> see<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.880> does<00:00:29.880> slow<00:00:30.240> down<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> movement

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
can see it does slow down the movement

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.590 
can see it does slow down the movement
of<00:00:30.960> mobs<00:00:31.640> which<00:00:32.640> could<00:00:32.820> be<00:00:32.910> useful<00:00:33.090> especially

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
of mobs which could be useful especially

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.750 
of mobs which could be useful especially
for<00:00:34.140> traps<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.860> sure<00:00:35.130> that's<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
for traps I'm sure that's one of the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.020 
for traps I'm sure that's one of the
main<00:00:35.969> uses<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.200> will<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.590> 40<00:00:38.100> sheep<00:00:38.790> just

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
main uses that will see 40 sheep just

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.529 
main uses that will see 40 sheep just
escaped<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.660> little<00:00:40.309> pen<00:00:41.309> over<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:44.539> pretty

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
escaped this little pen over here pretty

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.860 
escaped this little pen over here pretty
sure<00:00:45.750> they<00:00:45.899> slow<00:00:46.140> down<00:00:46.170> minecarts<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.129> well<00:00:47.870> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
sure they slow down minecarts as well it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.729 
sure they slow down minecarts as well it
certainly<00:00:49.079> slowed<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.620> me<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.680> I

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
certainly slowed on me and actually I

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.049 
certainly slowed on me and actually I
find<00:00:52.949> these<00:00:53.039> blocks<00:00:53.340> rather<00:00:53.579> annoying

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
find these blocks rather annoying

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.459 
find these blocks rather annoying
because<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.539> difficult<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:56.989> move<00:00:57.989> when

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
because it's difficult to a move when

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.810 
because it's difficult to a move when
you're<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.070> mean<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.520> obvious

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you're in them I mean for obvious

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.600 
you're in them I mean for obvious
reasons<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.300> suppose<00:01:00.859> kept<00:01:01.859> here<00:01:04.250> so<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
reasons I suppose kept here so this is a

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.600 
reasons I suppose kept here so this is a
minecart<00:01:06.360> which<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:07.130> pushed<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.280> onto<00:01:08.520> this

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
minecart which I pushed up onto this

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.700 
minecart which I pushed up onto this
incline<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.409> moves<00:01:10.619> very

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
incline and as you can see it moves very

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.600 
incline and as you can see it moves very
slowly<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:13.400> eventually<00:01:14.400> stops<00:01:15.500> moving<00:01:19.610> now

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
slowly and eventually stops moving now

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.090 
slowly and eventually stops moving now
for<00:01:21.210> reference<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:22.020> push<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.770> other<00:01:22.920> end

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
for reference I push it to the other end

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
for reference I push it to the other end
of<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.840> normally<00:01:24.840> when<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> block

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
of this normally when you have a block

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.340 
of this normally when you have a block
there<00:01:25.770> it'll<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.340> stop<00:01:26.640> moving<00:01:26.759> entirely

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.130 

but<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.590> case<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:33.509> did<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> just

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
but in this case you know did I just

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.370 
but in this case you know did I just
stop<00:01:34.350> there<00:01:36.229> now<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:39.659> web's<00:01:39.990> above

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
stop there now so that the web's above

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.929 
stop there now so that the web's above
it<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:40.829> block<00:01:41.040> above<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.460> don't<00:01:41.640> seem<00:01:41.820> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it one block above it don't seem to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.780 
it one block above it don't seem to
affect<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.270> even<00:01:42.600> when<00:01:43.310> we<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> writer

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
affect it even when we have a writer

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.630 
affect it even when we have a writer
present<00:01:45.360> oh<00:01:47.299> crap<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:49.280> another<00:01:50.280> annoying

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
present oh crap it's another annoying

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
present oh crap it's another annoying
thing<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.090> should<00:01:51.329> probably<00:01:51.420> get<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.869> out<00:01:51.990> of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
thing I should probably get this out of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.260 
thing I should probably get this out of
my<00:01:52.140> hands

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.170 

there<00:01:58.270> we<00:01:58.390> go<00:01:59.400> okay<00:02:00.400> so<00:02:00.460> let's<00:02:00.760> see<00:02:00.880> if<00:02:00.970> we<00:02:01.030> can

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
there we go okay so let's see if we can

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.840 
there we go okay so let's see if we can
push<00:02:01.330> this<00:02:01.540> cart<00:02:04.800> now<00:02:05.800> this<00:02:06.010> will<00:02:06.160> fix<00:02:06.580> there

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
push this cart now this will fix there

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.330 
push this cart now this will fix there
even<00:02:07.270> when<00:02:07.330> I'm<00:02:07.480> present<00:02:08.040> it<00:02:09.040> doesn't<00:02:09.280> get

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
even when I'm present it doesn't get

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.580 
even when I'm present it doesn't get
slowed<00:02:09.640> down<00:02:09.729> until<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.090> card<00:02:10.420> hits<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
slowed down until the card hits the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.620 
slowed down until the card hits the
webbing<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.850> I'm<00:02:15.940> also<00:02:16.060> going<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.270> run<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> quick

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
webbing so I'm also going to run a quick

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.090 
webbing so I'm also going to run a quick
experiment<00:02:17.020> over<00:02:17.350> here<00:02:17.530> since<00:02:17.740> i<00:02:17.830> have<00:02:17.980> this

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
experiment over here since i have this

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.790 
experiment over here since i have this
convenient<00:02:19.380> lake<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.590> ice<00:02:24.150> i'm<00:02:25.150> going<00:02:25.390> to

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
convenient lake of ice i'm going to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.310 
convenient lake of ice i'm going to
place<00:02:26.800> this<00:02:26.980> card<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:28.440> as<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.590> can<00:02:29.740> see<00:02:31.320> well

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
place this card and as you can see well

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.690 
place this card and as you can see well
the<00:02:32.410> ice<00:02:32.530> didn't<00:02:32.830> actually<00:02:32.950> help<00:02:33.280> much<00:02:33.460> but

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
the ice didn't actually help much but

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.200 
the ice didn't actually help much but
whatever<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.900> see<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.170> point<00:02:35.410> here<00:02:35.620> um

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
whatever you you see the point here um

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.540 
whatever you you see the point here um
the<00:02:37.210> card<00:02:37.450> gets<00:02:37.690> stuck<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.290> it's<00:02:39.130> not<00:02:39.310> just<00:02:39.490> a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
the card gets stuck and it's not just a

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.220 
the card gets stuck and it's not just a
normal<00:02:39.730> block<00:02:40.000> block<00:02:40.360> collision<00:02:40.720> because<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
normal block block collision because the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.690 
normal block block collision because the
cart<00:02:41.470> actually<00:02:41.800> does<00:02:41.980> move<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.340> little<00:02:42.610> bit

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
cart actually does move a little bit

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.960 
cart actually does move a little bit
into<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:44.380> spider<00:02:44.830> web<00:02:45.040> but<00:02:45.730> it's<00:02:45.880> a

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
into the spider web but it's a

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.260 
into the spider web but it's a
significant<00:02:46.660> stop<00:02:47.730> I'm<00:02:48.730> not<00:02:48.940> sure<00:02:49.090> if<00:02:49.210> it's

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
significant stop I'm not sure if it's

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.800 
significant stop I'm not sure if it's
possible<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.900> use<00:02:50.740> these<00:02:50.890> as<00:02:50.950> breaks<00:02:51.810> arm

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
possible to use these as breaks arm

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.120 
possible to use these as breaks arm
seems<00:02:53.230> like<00:02:53.410> you'd<00:02:53.560> be<00:02:53.680> better<00:02:53.830> off<00:02:53.890> just

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
seems like you'd be better off just

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.850 
seems like you'd be better off just
putting<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.490> block<00:02:54.700> there<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:56.410> since<00:02:56.680> they

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
putting a block there and since they

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.540 
putting a block there and since they
can't<00:02:57.130> be<00:02:57.280> used<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:59.680> interact<00:02:59.950> with<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.310> cart

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
can't be used to interact with the cart

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.000 
can't be used to interact with the cart
that's<00:03:00.700> rotting<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.239> track<00:03:01.480> because<00:03:02.010> you

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
that's rotting on the track because you

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.140 
that's rotting on the track because you
know<00:03:03.130> there's<00:03:03.310> nowhere<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.640> put<00:03:03.790> them<00:03:03.850> that

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
know there's nowhere to put them that

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.660 
know there's nowhere to put them that
the<00:03:04.450> car<00:03:04.600> will<00:03:04.720> actually<00:03:05.020> intersect<00:03:05.410> them

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
the car will actually intersect them

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.210 
the car will actually intersect them
while<00:03:06.670> it's<00:03:06.820> riding<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.180> track<00:03:08.220> you're

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
while it's riding on a track you're

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.370 
while it's riding on a track you're
better<00:03:09.370> off<00:03:09.459> just<00:03:09.730> using<00:03:10.150> an<00:03:10.480> unlit<00:03:10.840> booster

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
better off just using an unlit booster

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.500 
better off just using an unlit booster
block<00:03:11.650> for<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.340> break<00:03:15.150> final<00:03:16.150> experiment

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
block for a break final experiment

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:25.199 
block for a break final experiment
involves<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:18.930> little<00:03:19.930> bit<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.440> danger<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:24.209> think

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
involves a little bit of danger I think

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.670 
involves a little bit of danger I think
the<00:03:25.300> reason<00:03:25.510> these<00:03:25.780> aren't<00:03:26.110> in<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.290> game<00:03:26.470> yet

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
the reason these aren't in the game yet

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.699 
the reason these aren't in the game yet
is<00:03:26.890> probably<00:03:27.580> because<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.560> as<00:03:29.620> you

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
is probably because of this so as you

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.890 
is probably because of this so as you
can<00:03:29.860> see<00:03:32.280> these<00:03:33.280> things<00:03:33.580> will<00:03:34.140> stop<00:03:35.140> my<00:03:35.260> fall

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
can see these things will stop my fall

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.660 
can see these things will stop my fall
which<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.080> I'm<00:03:38.230> sure<00:03:38.470> going<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.830> be<00:03:38.920> one<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.220> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
which is I'm sure going to be one of the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.790 
which is I'm sure going to be one of the
other<00:03:39.820> primary<00:03:40.269> uses<00:03:40.420> for<00:03:40.780> them<00:03:43.410> but<00:03:44.410> if<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.590> let

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
other primary uses for them but if I let

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.530 
other primary uses for them but if I let
myself<00:03:44.950> fall<00:03:45.400> all<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.580> way<00:03:45.670> down<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.209> the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
myself fall all the way down to the

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.130 
myself fall all the way down to the
ground<00:03:47.019> level<00:03:47.350> here<00:03:48.720> this<00:03:49.720> might<00:03:49.930> take<00:03:50.080> a

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
ground level here this might take a

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.620 
ground level here this might take a
little<00:03:50.320> while<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:52.470> believe<00:03:53.470> you'll<00:03:53.709> find

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
little while I believe you'll find

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.800 
little while I believe you'll find
little<00:03:55.630> bug<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:55.989> uncovered<00:03:56.500> yes<00:03:57.430> i<00:03:57.850> still<00:03:58.690> take

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
little bug I uncovered yes i still take

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.550 
little bug I uncovered yes i still take
fall<00:03:59.050> damage<00:03:59.220> all<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.959> that's<00:04:02.380> not

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
fall damage all of it so that's not

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.460 
fall damage all of it so that's not
especially<00:04:02.860> useful<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:04.510> happens<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.900> way<00:04:05.140> no

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
especially useful it happens that way no

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.380 
especially useful it happens that way no
matter<00:04:05.620> what<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:05.890> do<00:04:06.130> basically<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.090> moment

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
matter what you do basically the moment

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.370 
matter what you do basically the moment
you<00:04:07.450> enter

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
you enter

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.140

the webbing you're still destined to

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.970 
the webbing you're still destined to
take<00:04:10.300> that<00:04:10.510> damage<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.260> still<00:04:11.530> will<00:04:11.710> no

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
take that damage and you still will no

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.610 
take that damage and you still will no
matter<00:04:12.130> what<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.460> do<00:04:13.080> unless<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:14.230> manage<00:04:14.470> to

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
matter what you do unless you manage to

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.510 
matter what you do unless you manage to
get<00:04:14.710> yourself<00:04:14.830> into<00:04:15.190> water<00:04:15.460> and<00:04:17.280> in<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.370> end

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
get yourself into water and in the end

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.240 
get yourself into water and in the end
water<00:04:18.760> seems<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.270> be<00:04:19.420> a<00:04:19.450> much<00:04:19.660> better<00:04:20.080> use<00:04:20.350> for

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
water seems to be a much better use for

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.810 
water seems to be a much better use for
fall<00:04:21.970> damage<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.510> turn<00:04:22.690> right<00:04:22.930> now<00:04:23.670> so<00:04:24.670> that's

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
fall damage to turn right now so that's

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.540 
fall damage to turn right now so that's
all<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:24.940> useful<00:04:25.150> applications<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:25.930> can<00:04:25.960> see<00:04:26.550> at

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
all the useful applications I can see at

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.780 
all the useful applications I can see at
the<00:04:27.700> moment<00:04:27.820> for<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.390> webbing<00:04:29.490> as<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:30.670> can

the moment for the webbing as you can
see<00:04:30.910> i<00:04:30.940> was<00:04:31.090> experimenting<00:04:31.390> here<00:04:31.780> on<00:04:31.870> how<00:04:31.990> many

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
see i was experimenting here on how many

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.510 
see i was experimenting here on how many
booster<00:04:32.380> blocks<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.950> would<00:04:33.040> take<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.400> get

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
booster blocks it would take to get

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.570 
booster blocks it would take to get
something<00:04:33.820> up<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:34.000> hill<00:04:34.590> this<00:04:35.590> works<00:04:35.830> by<00:04:36.520> the

way empty and full carts but that's
