answer it next month well um that was
quite<00:02:06.569> an<00:02:06.720> interesting<00:02:06.869> average<00:02:07.550> that<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
quite an interesting average that was a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.759 
quite an interesting average that was a
15:05<00:02:09.629> average<00:02:10.520> I<00:02:11.930> got<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.959> lot<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.410> good<00:02:13.560> songs

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
15:05 average I got a lot of good songs

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.150 
15:05 average I got a lot of good songs
in<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.129> one<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.879> personal<00:02:15.569> best<00:02:16.160> that

in that one and a personal best that

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.559 
in that one and a personal best that
10/10<00:02:17.970> was<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.959> personal<00:02:19.410> best<00:02:19.940> oh<00:02:20.940> my<00:02:21.420> gosh

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
10/10 was a personal best oh my gosh

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.050 
10/10 was a personal best oh my gosh
that<00:02:22.019> was<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.709> close<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.280> being<00:02:23.459> sub<00:02:23.819> 10

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
that was like so close to being sub 10

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.770 
that was like so close to being sub 10
that<00:02:24.660> was<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> ridiculously<00:02:25.620> easy<00:02:25.770> scramble

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
that was a ridiculously easy scramble

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.360 
that was a ridiculously easy scramble
and<00:02:27.780> then<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:27.990> got<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> 14<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.100> 13

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
and then I got a 14 and a 13

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.839 
and then I got a 14 and a 13
and<00:02:30.459> then<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:31.090> couple<00:02:31.480> 17s<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.099> a<00:02:33.190> 1505

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
and then a couple 17s so it's a 1505

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.920 
and then a couple 17s so it's a 1505
average<00:02:34.269> I<00:02:34.930> am<00:02:35.860> so<00:02:36.700> surprised<00:02:38.670> anyways<00:02:39.930> let's

challenge comes from Connor Fisher he
challenged<00:02:48.700> me<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.819> solve<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.629> normal

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
challenged me to solve just the normal

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.530 
challenged me to solve just the normal
three<00:02:50.079> by<00:02:50.170> three<00:02:50.319> by<00:02:50.349> five<00:02:51.209> I'm<00:02:52.209> gonna<00:02:52.390> be

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
three by three by five I'm gonna be

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.210 
three by three by five I'm gonna be
using<00:02:52.720> my<00:02:52.900> handmade<00:02:53.590> three<00:02:53.769> by<00:02:53.860> three<00:02:54.010> by<00:02:54.040> five

anything like that um I haven't done

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.979 
anything like that um I haven't done
through<00:03:00.040> our<00:03:00.099> 3<00:03:00.310> by<00:03:00.489> 5<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.790> forever<00:03:01.239> so<00:03:01.629> I<00:03:01.659> hope

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
through our 3 by 5 and forever so I hope

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.920 
through our 3 by 5 and forever so I hope
I<00:03:02.140> remember<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.560> algorithms<00:03:02.980> anyway<00:03:03.750> he<00:03:04.750> got

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
I remember the algorithms anyway he got

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.110 
I remember the algorithms anyway he got
the<00:03:05.230> he<00:03:05.680> sent<00:03:06.010> me<00:03:06.099> a<00:03:06.129> scramble<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:06.879> all<00:03:06.970> that

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
the he sent me a scramble and all that

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.729 
the he sent me a scramble and all that
kind<00:03:07.299> of<00:03:07.329> stuff<00:03:07.569> so<00:03:07.599> I'm<00:03:08.230> gonna<00:03:08.410> do<00:03:08.620> the

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
kind of stuff so I'm gonna do the

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.210 
kind of stuff so I'm gonna do the
scramble<00:03:09.190> so<00:03:09.760> here<00:03:10.030> we<00:03:10.120> go<00:03:13.410> ok<00:03:14.410> here<00:03:14.769> we<00:03:14.859> go

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
scramble so here we go ok here we go

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:27.860 
scramble so here we go ok here we go
so<00:03:15.780> we'll<00:03:16.780> just<00:03:16.959> inspect<00:03:25.890> all<00:03:26.890> right<00:03:27.040> oh

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
so we'll just inspect all right oh

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:53.320 
so we'll just inspect all right oh
that's<00:03:28.870> not<00:03:29.049> an<00:03:29.170> inspection

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.660

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
finally I finally want a challenge okay

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.600 
finally I finally want a challenge okay
um<00:03:59.700> I<00:04:00.450> pretty<00:04:00.690> much<00:04:00.810> creamed<00:04:01.260> him<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:02.430> even

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
um I pretty much creamed him and I even

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.450 
um I pretty much creamed him and I even
forgot<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:04.170> algorithm<00:04:04.650> for<00:04:04.830> like<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.250> couple

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
forgot the algorithm for like a couple

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.580 
forgot the algorithm for like a couple
like<00:04:05.910> 15<00:04:06.390> seconds<00:04:06.780> or<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.110> don't<00:04:07.380> know<00:04:07.470> what

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
like 15 seconds or so I don't know what

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.350 
like 15 seconds or so I don't know what
it<00:04:07.680> was<00:04:07.800> I<00:04:08.040> forgotten<00:04:08.610> algorithm<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.180> was<00:04:09.270> like

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
it was I forgotten algorithm I was like

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.070 
it was I forgotten algorithm I was like
what<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:11.030> he<00:04:12.030> got<00:04:12.180> like<00:04:12.330> almost<00:04:12.750> four

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
what is it he got like almost four

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.640 
what is it he got like almost four
minutes<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.850> so<00:04:14.850> but<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:16.110> know<00:04:16.140> I've<00:04:16.320> solved

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
minutes and so but you know I've solved

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.500 
minutes and so but you know I've solved
the<00:04:16.709> three<00:04:16.860> by<00:04:16.980> three<00:04:17.130> by<00:04:17.160> five<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.430> lot<00:04:17.700> yeah<00:04:18.330> if

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.140 
month so onto cubing news there were
only<00:04:31.350> two<00:04:31.800> cubes<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:32.370> came<00:04:32.610> out<00:04:32.790> this<00:04:32.970> month

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
only two cubes that came out this month

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.740 
only two cubes that came out this month
one<00:04:33.780> of<00:04:33.900> them<00:04:34.050> was<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.650> mo<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.480> yiling<00:04:36.480> or

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
one of them was the mo you yiling or

yelling whoever you want to pronounce it

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.030 
yelling whoever you want to pronounce it
it's<00:04:39.060> actually<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.630> kuan-yin<00:04:40.290> version<00:04:40.800> too

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
it's actually the kuan-yin version too

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.520 
it's actually the kuan-yin version too
but<00:04:41.730> I<00:04:42.000> have<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.420> coming<00:04:42.600> it<00:04:42.870> looks<00:04:43.080> really

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
but I have it coming it looks really

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.760 
but I have it coming it looks really
good<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:45.060> other<00:04:45.090> cube<00:04:45.630> is<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.170> V<00:04:46.500> Cube

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
good and the other cube is the V Cube
