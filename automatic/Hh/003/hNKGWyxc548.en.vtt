00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
ridiculous I had to get him right when I

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.729 
ridiculous I had to get him right when I
say<00:00:43.010> mark<00:00:43.460> when<00:00:43.609> I<00:00:43.670> saw<00:00:43.850> him<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:44.500> yeah

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
so these are a nine which is surprising

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.180 
so these are a nine which is surprising
because<00:00:50.750> my<00:00:51.050> other<00:00:51.199> janowski's<00:00:51.739> are<00:00:51.859> nine<00:00:52.039> and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
because my other janowski's are nine and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.599 
because my other janowski's are nine and
a<00:00:52.219> half<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:52.640> my<00:00:52.820> elmore<00:00:53.000> salazar's<00:00:53.780> or<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:53.989> ten

a half and my elmore salazar's or a ten

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.669 
a half and my elmore salazar's or a ten
but<00:00:55.609> uh<00:00:55.640> I<00:00:56.300> guess<00:00:56.839> you<00:00:56.960> know<00:00:57.079> they<00:00:57.410> all<00:00:57.500> just

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:58.840 
but uh I guess you know they all just
fit<00:00:57.829> different<00:00:58.160> in<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.280> leather<00:00:58.460> stretches

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
so right when I saw them I was kind of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.109 
so right when I saw them I was kind of
skeptical<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.340> sell<00:01:31.520> them<00:01:31.579> online<00:01:31.729> just

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
skeptical and I sell them online just

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.179 
skeptical and I sell them online just
because<00:01:32.450> usually<00:01:32.689> mids<00:01:33.200> kind<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.649> look<00:01:33.950> funny

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
because usually mids kind of look funny

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.050 
because usually mids kind of look funny
with<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:35.380> with<00:01:36.380> like<00:01:36.560> higher<00:01:36.829> like<00:01:37.159> high<00:01:37.610> nike

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.090 
with a with like higher like high nike
socks<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.630> i<00:01:38.680> thought<00:01:39.680> they<00:01:39.799> would<00:01:39.950> look

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
socks and i thought they would look

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.679 
socks and i thought they would look
funny<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.520> you'd<00:01:40.610> have<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.790> were<00:01:40.939> short<00:01:41.420> socks

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
funny and you'd have to were short socks

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.170 
funny and you'd have to were short socks
with<00:01:41.899> them<00:01:41.990> but<00:01:42.259> they<00:01:42.740> actually<00:01:43.159> looked<00:01:43.369> fine

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
with them but they actually looked fine

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.810 
with them but they actually looked fine
just<00:01:44.930> because<00:01:45.140> they<00:01:45.259> work<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:45.770> mid<00:01:46.009> like<00:01:46.250> if

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
just because they work to mid like if

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.600 
just because they work to mid like if
you<00:01:46.969> look<00:01:47.090> at<00:01:47.180> these<00:01:47.270> Salazar's<00:01:48.610> they

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
red you know skis but it I guess it was

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.390 
red you know skis but it I guess it was
getting<00:02:46.079> too<00:02:46.200> expensive<00:02:46.409> for<00:02:46.739> Nike<00:02:47.220> or

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
getting too expensive for Nike or

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.559 
getting too expensive for Nike or
something<00:02:47.819> or<00:02:47.879> that<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.120> heard<00:02:48.329> something

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
something or that I heard something

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.440 
something or that I heard something
about<00:02:48.599> that<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.079> so<00:02:49.349> they<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:51.030> stopped

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
about that and so they just stopped

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.509 
about that and so they just stopped
using<00:02:51.629> them<00:02:51.870> which<00:02:52.079> is<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.230> shame<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:52.889> these

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
using them which is a shame but these

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.699 
using them which is a shame but these
are<00:02:53.670> still<00:02:53.909> really<00:02:54.150> cool<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:54.629> look<00:02:55.440> really

are still really cool and look really
good<00:02:55.829> they<00:02:56.040> might<00:02:56.190> even<00:02:56.400> look<00:02:56.609> better<00:02:56.819> this

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
good they might even look better this

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.849 
good they might even look better this
with<00:02:57.269> these<00:02:57.389> regular<00:02:57.750> laces<00:02:58.109> because<00:02:58.620> I've

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
with these regular laces because I've

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.899 
with these regular laces because I've
never<00:02:58.980> seen<00:02:59.129> them<00:02:59.370> with<00:02:59.489> leather<00:02:59.670> laces<00:03:00.150> so
