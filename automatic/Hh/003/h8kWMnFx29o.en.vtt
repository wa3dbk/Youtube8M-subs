00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.399 
add your second piece of fabric and
again<00:02:02.670> don't<00:02:02.969> put<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.420> exactly<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.079> top

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
again don't put it exactly on the top

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.020 
again don't put it exactly on the top
otherwise<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:05.100> not<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> look<00:02:05.549> scrappy

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
otherwise it's not going to look scrappy

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.330 
otherwise it's not going to look scrappy
at<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.810> offset<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.619> again<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.099> probably

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
at all so offset it again but probably

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.100 
at all so offset it again but probably
offset<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> opposite<00:02:09.509> direction<00:02:09.660> to

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
offset it in the opposite direction to

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.930 
offset it in the opposite direction to
what<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.349> did<00:02:10.500> before<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.069> then<00:02:11.610> again

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
what you did before and then again

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.300 
what you did before and then again
follow<00:02:12.330> down<00:02:12.629> with<00:02:12.840> you

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
follow down with you

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.960 
follow down with you
on<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.790> edge<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.569> second<00:02:15.260> Pete<00:02:15.970> continue

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
on the edge of the second Pete continue

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.510 
on the edge of the second Pete continue
doing<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.330> all<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.600> way<00:02:17.810> across<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.590> till

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
doing this all the way across and till

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.770 
doing this all the way across and till
you're<00:02:19.670> done<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.420> what<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.690> will

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
you're done and this is what it will

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.199 
you're done and this is what it will
look<00:02:20.870> like<00:02:20.930> on<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> front<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.830> on<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.310> back

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.120 

now<00:02:26.209> it's<00:02:26.420> time<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:26.930> trim<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.440> square<00:02:27.920> up

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
now it's time to just trim and square up

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.490 
now it's time to just trim and square up
so<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.790> can<00:02:29.060> use<00:02:29.270> your<00:02:29.480> rotary<00:02:30.050> cutter<00:02:30.080> or

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
so you can use your rotary cutter or

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.710 
so you can use your rotary cutter or
scissors<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.069> just<00:02:31.100> cut<00:02:31.370> away<00:02:31.819> those<00:02:32.150> scrappy

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
scissors and just cut away those scrappy

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.809 
scissors and just cut away those scrappy
edges<00:02:33.080> where<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.709> little<00:02:33.920> bits<00:02:34.069> of<00:02:34.220> fabric<00:02:34.400> of

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
edges where the little bits of fabric of

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.309 
edges where the little bits of fabric of
overhung<00:02:35.620> it's<00:02:36.620> also<00:02:36.770> good<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.130> use<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.790> big

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
overhung it's also good to use a big

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.630 
overhung it's also good to use a big
square<00:02:39.319> quilting<00:02:39.830> ruler<00:02:40.130> like<00:02:40.280> I've<00:02:40.430> got<00:02:40.610> here

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
square quilting ruler like I've got here

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.610 
square quilting ruler like I've got here
because<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.540> can<00:02:41.660> really<00:02:41.810> help<00:02:42.050> you<00:02:42.170> get

it's time to cut the fabric for the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.340 
it's time to cut the fabric for the
backing<00:03:52.640> you'll<00:03:53.150> need<00:03:53.359> to<00:03:53.480> cut<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.870> one<00:03:54.140> inch

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
backing you'll need to cut it one inch

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.340 
backing you'll need to cut it one inch
larger<00:03:54.980> all<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.430> way<00:03:55.549> around<00:03:55.790> so<00:03:56.150> use<00:03:57.049> your

each of the four sides and this will

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.780 
each of the four sides and this will

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
around the four edges fold over just

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.770 
around the four edges fold over just

then<00:05:12.440> there<00:05:12.680> are<00:05:12.800> several<00:05:13.100> ways<00:05:13.340> you<00:05:13.370> can

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
attach the binding on one of mine I did

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.730 
attach the binding on one of mine I did
a<00:05:16.820> hand<00:05:17.060> stitch<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:18.020> can<00:05:18.169> see<00:05:18.350> it's

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
a hand stitch and you can see it's

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.650 
a hand stitch and you can see it's
pretty<00:05:18.919> neat<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.669> I<00:05:20.030> like<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.360> way<00:05:20.480> that

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
pretty neat and I like the way that

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.210 
pretty neat and I like the way that
looks<00:05:20.960> on<00:05:21.230> the<00:05:21.320> back<00:05:21.470> because<00:05:21.830> it<00:05:21.950> doesn't

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
looks on the back because it doesn't

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.760 
looks on the back because it doesn't
have<00:05:22.370> any<00:05:22.550> stitching<00:05:23.120> on<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:23.419> back<00:05:23.450> or<00:05:24.290> if<00:05:24.620> you

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
have any stitching on the back or if you

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.280 
have any stitching on the back or if you
prefer<00:05:25.130> you<00:05:25.280> can<00:05:25.430> also<00:05:25.550> use<00:05:26.150> a<00:05:26.480> sewing<00:05:27.169> machine

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
prefer you can also use a sewing machine

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.100 
prefer you can also use a sewing machine
and<00:05:27.770> just<00:05:27.860> stitch<00:05:28.310> close<00:05:28.700> but<00:05:29.450> that<00:05:29.630> does<00:05:29.870> give

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
and just stitch close but that does give

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.420 
and just stitch close but that does give
a<00:05:30.140> line<00:05:30.350> of<00:05:30.500> stitching<00:05:30.800> on<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.010> back<00:05:31.040> which

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
a line of stitching on the back which

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.040 
a line of stitching on the back which
you<00:05:31.580> may<00:05:31.730> or<00:05:31.820> may<00:05:31.850> not<00:05:32.120> like<00:05:32.300> so<00:05:32.600> those<00:05:32.780> are<00:05:32.960> the

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
you may or may not like so those are the

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.940 
you may or may not like so those are the
two<00:05:33.200> options<00:05:33.410> and<00:05:33.860> therefore<00:05:34.760> your<00:05:35.300> two

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
two options and therefore your two

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.860 
two options and therefore your two
placemats<00:05:36.950> are<00:05:37.370> completed<00:05:38.060> with<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.720> nice
