00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
something and most of these things that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
something and most of these things that
the<00:02:05.909> plate<00:02:06.420> was<00:02:06.600> hurt<00:02:06.840> into<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.409> came<00:02:07.590> off<00:02:08.690> as

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the plate was hurt into just came off as

the plate was hurt into just came off as
you<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:09.959> see<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.229> by<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.440> high<00:02:10.649> beams<00:02:10.920> which

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
you can see up by the high beams which

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.370 
you can see up by the high beams which
there's<00:02:11.519> more<00:02:11.700> repair<00:02:12.060> up<00:02:12.269> there<00:02:12.510> it's

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
there's more repair up there it's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.580 
there's more repair up there it's
probably<00:02:13.560> actually<00:02:13.860> worse<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:14.579> this<00:02:14.790> side

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
probably actually worse on this side

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.970 
probably actually worse on this side
under<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.709> gas<00:02:16.890> pedal<00:02:17.430> has<00:02:18.380> got<00:02:19.380> some<00:02:19.590> repairs

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
under the gas pedal has got some repairs

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.680 
under the gas pedal has got some repairs
but<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.549> see<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.850> repairs<00:02:21.120> are<00:02:21.360> running

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
but you can see that repairs are running

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:41.120 
but you can see that repairs are running
through<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:24.650> but<00:02:25.650> again<00:02:25.829> up<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:40.130> just
