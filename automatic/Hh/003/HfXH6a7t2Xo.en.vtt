there<00:01:08.490> are<00:01:08.610> very<00:01:08.850> few<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.240> them<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.920> what<00:01:10.920> this

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
there are very few of them and what this

there are very few of them and what this
basically<00:01:11.430> means<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.270> we're<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> be

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
basically means is we're not going to be

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.140 
basically means is we're not going to be
the<00:01:13.350> best<00:01:13.530> choice<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.860> fines<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.610> council

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
or mogera anymore because dots will also

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.090 
or mogera anymore because dots will also

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
do large amount of damage but we're not

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.380 
do large amount of damage but we're not
going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> get<00:01:23.430> any<00:01:23.610> shooting<00:01:23.850> stars<00:01:23.970> and

going to get any shooting stars and
shooting<00:01:24.720> stars<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.950> only<00:01:26.189> viable<00:01:26.610> way<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
shooting stars is the only viable way to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.170 
shooting stars is the only viable way to
do<00:01:27.390> competitive<00:01:27.840> dps<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.280> move<00:01:29.490> pumpkins

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
do competitive dps on the move pumpkins

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.630 
do competitive dps on the move pumpkins
have<00:01:30.390> nothing<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.680> spam<00:01:31.950> moon<00:01:32.220> fire<00:01:32.430> but

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
have nothing you can spam moon fire but

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.780 
have nothing you can spam moon fire but
it's<00:01:32.820> that's<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.840> 40<00:01:34.290> k<00:01:34.470> dps<00:01:34.829> so

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
it's that's going to do like 40 k dps so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
it's that's going to do like 40 k dps so
moon<00:01:36.150> gains<00:01:36.450> are<00:01:36.810> gonna<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.229> even<00:01:37.500> more

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
moon gains are gonna be even more

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.120 
moon gains are gonna be even more
stationary<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.890> we<00:01:40.890> just

shooting<00:01:51.000> stars<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.780> move<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.229> can

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
shooting stars so you can move you can

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.289 
shooting stars so you can move you can
plan<00:01:52.710> ahead<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:53.369> you're<00:01:53.640> shooting<00:01:53.820> started

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
plan ahead if you're shooting started

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.670 
plan ahead if you're shooting started
like<00:01:54.420> okay<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> need<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> move<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.380> three

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
like okay I need to move in three

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.649 
like okay I need to move in three
seconds<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.729> I'm<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:56.939> gonna<00:01:57.030> stay<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.479> I'm

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
seconds so I'm just gonna stay here I'm

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.969 
seconds so I'm just gonna stay here I'm
not<00:01:57.810> gonna<00:01:57.930> use<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> shooting<00:01:58.500> stars<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.920> I'm

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
not gonna use the shooting stars and I'm

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.499 
not gonna use the shooting stars and I'm
gonna<00:01:59.070> use<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.430> when<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> need<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.850> move<00:02:00.000> that's

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
gonna use it when I need to move that's

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.780 
gonna use it when I need to move that's
no<00:02:00.840> longer<00:02:01.049> thing<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:02.009> not<00:02:02.219> gonna<00:02:02.430> proc

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
no longer thing it's just not gonna proc

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.450 
no longer thing it's just not gonna proc
it's<00:02:03.570> gonna<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.930> even<00:02:04.079> less<00:02:04.409> reliable<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.340> I

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
it's gonna be even less reliable and I

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.889 
it's gonna be even less reliable and I
think<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.030> gonna<00:02:06.180> hit<00:02:06.390> boom<00:02:06.600> Keynes

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
think this is gonna hit boom Keynes

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.729 
think this is gonna hit boom Keynes
pretty<00:02:07.619> damn<00:02:07.920> hard<00:02:08.869> good<00:02:09.869> job<00:02:10.080> Lee<00:02:10.349> said<00:02:10.590> we

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
pretty damn hard good job Lee said we

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.619 
pretty damn hard good job Lee said we
had<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:11.069> thing<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.670> had<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:12.150> freaking

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
had one thing and you had to freaking

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.080 
had one thing and you had to freaking
nerve<00:02:12.930> it

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
nerve it

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.110 
nerve it
yeah<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> don't<00:02:15.330> like<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.720> change<00:02:15.990> at<00:02:16.260> all<00:02:16.620> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
yeah I don't like this change at all and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.330 
yeah I don't like this change at all and
the<00:02:18.120> last<00:02:18.270> two<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.600> wasn't<00:02:19.080> quite<00:02:19.170> sure<00:02:19.340> about

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
the last two I wasn't quite sure about

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.690 
the last two I wasn't quite sure about
those<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.630> wasn't<00:02:22.020> really<00:02:22.170> quite<00:02:23.160> sure<00:02:23.400> what<00:02:23.580> to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
those I wasn't really quite sure what to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.180 
those I wasn't really quite sure what to
think<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:24.390> Star<00:02:24.720> Search<00:02:25.020> rat<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.710> Starfire

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
think so Star Search rat and Starfire

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.240 
think so Star Search rat and Starfire
now<00:02:26.430> cost<00:02:26.730> fifty<00:02:27.030> percent<00:02:27.300> more<00:02:27.510> mana<00:02:27.780> which<00:02:28.500> I

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
now cost fifty percent more mana which I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.190 
now cost fifty percent more mana which I
don't<00:02:29.520> think<00:02:29.820> makes<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.120> lot<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.300> sense<00:02:30.450> because

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
don't think makes a lot of sense because

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.230 
don't think makes a lot of sense because
well<00:02:32.010> you're<00:02:32.160> gonna<00:02:32.340> get<00:02:32.550> into<00:02:32.820> an<00:02:32.910> eclipse

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
well you're gonna get into an eclipse

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.640 
well you're gonna get into an eclipse
and<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:33.570> gonna<00:02:33.660> give<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.960> fifty<00:02:34.290> percent<00:02:34.530> of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
and it's gonna give you fifty percent of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.010 
and it's gonna give you fifty percent of
your<00:02:34.770> mana<00:02:35.100> back<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.580> that's<00:02:35.760> 150<00:02:36.420> thousand

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
your mana back so that's 150 thousand

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.050 
your mana back so that's 150 thousand
manna<00:02:37.230> every<00:02:37.470> time<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.190> enter<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.520> eclipse<00:02:38.850> of

manna every time you enter in eclipse of

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
if this is a nerf or buff because I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.870 
if this is a nerf or buff because I
wasn't<00:03:11.580> able<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.970> find<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.750> amount<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:14.700> will

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
wasn't able to find the amount it will

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.430 
wasn't able to find the amount it will
actually<00:03:15.090> restore<00:03:16.310> right<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.550> have<00:03:17.820> no<00:03:17.970> idea

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
actually restore right so I have no idea

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.560 
actually restore right so I have no idea
what<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.710> calculation<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.640> how<00:03:21.150> much<00:03:21.330> money

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
what the calculation is how much money

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.920 
what the calculation is how much money
it<00:03:21.750> actually<00:03:22.170> restores<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:24.450> know<00:03:24.510> if<00:03:24.780> you

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
it actually restores you know if you

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.210 
it actually restores you know if you
have<00:03:25.080> this<00:03:25.290> much<00:03:25.530> spirit<00:03:25.890> it's<00:03:26.010> going<00:03:26.160> to

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
have this much spirit it's going to

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.680 
have this much spirit it's going to
restore<00:03:26.520> this<00:03:26.610> much<00:03:26.820> money<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.150> wasn't<00:03:27.450> able<00:03:27.510> to

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
restore this much money I wasn't able to

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.220 
restore this much money I wasn't able to
find<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.080> anywhere<00:03:28.490> but<00:03:29.490> yeah<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.210> just<00:03:30.690> not

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
find that anywhere but yeah I just not

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.440 
find that anywhere but yeah I just not
quite<00:03:31.440> sure<00:03:31.500> about<00:03:31.770> these<00:03:32.070> two<00:03:32.450> especially

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
quite sure about these two especially

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.760 
quite sure about these two especially
the<00:03:33.570> first<00:03:33.780> one<00:03:34.020> that<00:03:34.140> just<00:03:34.440> doesn't<00:03:34.620> make

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
the first one that just doesn't make

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.650 
the first one that just doesn't make
sense<00:03:34.830> but<00:03:35.280> anyway<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:35.940> was<00:03:36.150> just<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.450> quick

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
sense but anyway this was just a quick
