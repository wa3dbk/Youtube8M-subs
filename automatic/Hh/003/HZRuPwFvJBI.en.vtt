the<00:00:06.960> next<00:00:07.200> thing<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.410> want<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.620> talk<00:00:07.830> about<00:00:08.480> is

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
the next thing I want to talk about is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.190 
the next thing I want to talk about is
our<00:00:10.260> three<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.040> buffer<00:00:11.490> mantle

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
our three on buffer mantle

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.599 
our three on buffer mantle
now<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.410> mandrel<00:00:14.839> as<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.020> can<00:00:16.199> see<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:17.010> 3/4

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
now this mandrel as you can see is 3/4

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.029 
now this mandrel as you can see is 3/4
inch<00:00:17.760> steel<00:00:17.970> mandrel<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:19.020> has<00:00:19.199> all<00:00:19.529> three

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
inch steel mandrel and it has all three

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.170 
inch steel mandrel and it has all three
buffs<00:00:20.340> mounted<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.550> basically

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
buffs mounted on it and we basically

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.500 
buffs mounted on it and we basically
made<00:00:24.539> some<00:00:24.750> changes<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.529> mandrel<00:00:26.510> when

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
made some changes in this mandrel when

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.970 
made some changes in this mandrel when
we<00:00:27.630> first<00:00:27.869> started<00:00:28.170> making<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.740> had<00:00:28.949> it

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
we first started making it we had it

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.030 
we first started making it we had it
threaded<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.789> both<00:00:30.000> ends<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.679> had<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> couple

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
threaded on both ends and had a couple

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.670 
threaded on both ends and had a couple
of<00:00:32.189> nuts<00:00:32.399> here<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> lock<00:00:33.149> nut<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:34.050> regular

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
of nuts here a lock nut and a regular

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.330 
of nuts here a lock nut and a regular
nut<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.219> they<00:00:36.120> held<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.630> end<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.340> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
nut and they held this end of the the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.979 
nut and they held this end of the the
set<00:00:38.550> up<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> other<00:00:39.120> end<00:00:39.300> had<00:00:39.480> another<00:00:39.750> nut

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
set up and the other end had another nut

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.450 
set up and the other end had another nut
and<00:00:40.200> they<00:00:40.260> tightened<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.710> against<00:00:41.100> those<00:00:41.250> two

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
and they tightened up against those two

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.450 
and they tightened up against those two
and<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.820> held<00:00:42.239> all<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.450> wheels<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.930> place<00:00:43.460> we

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and that held all the wheels in place we

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.450 
and that held all the wheels in place we
did<00:00:44.640> find<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.120> though<00:00:46.100> after<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.129> started

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
did find out though after we started

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.270 
did find out though after we started
making<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.940> first<00:00:48.149> mandrel<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
making the first mandrel that the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.340 
making the first mandrel that the
threads<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.789> were<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.149> here<00:00:51.360> partially<00:00:51.930> down

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
threads that were in here partially down

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.100 
threads that were in here partially down
to<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> number<00:00:53.129> two<00:00:53.280> Morse<00:00:53.520> taper<00:00:53.760> had<00:00:54.660> little

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to the number two Morse taper had little

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.720 
to the number two Morse taper had little
burrs<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.620> them<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.920> sometimes<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.520> would

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
burrs on them and sometimes they would

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.610 
burrs on them and sometimes they would
jam<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.469> lay<00:00:58.620> spindle<00:00:59.129> so<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:01.350> first

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
jam in the lay spindle so the first

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.609 
jam in the lay spindle so the first
thing<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:01.949> did<00:01:02.129> was<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.699> deburr<00:01:03.570> those<00:01:04.260> threads

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
thing we did was to deburr those threads

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.130 
thing we did was to deburr those threads
and<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.189> worked<00:01:05.549> pretty<00:01:05.640> well<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.750> recently

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and that worked pretty well but recently

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.050 
and that worked pretty well but recently
we<00:01:07.320> decided<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.100> would<00:01:08.250> change<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.820> take

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
we decided we would change it and take

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.850 
we decided we would change it and take
the<00:01:09.180> threads<00:01:09.450> off<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:09.900> altogether<00:01:10.080> so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
the threads off here altogether so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
the threads off here altogether so
instead<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.220> using<00:01:11.430> threads<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> nut<00:01:12.390> down

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
instead of using threads on the nut down

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.810 
instead of using threads on the nut down
here<00:01:12.960> we're<00:01:13.380> using<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.860> shaft<00:01:14.100> collar<00:01:14.430> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
here we're using this shaft collar and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.390 
here we're using this shaft collar and
that<00:01:15.210> holds<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.780> end<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.950> there<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.369> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
that holds this end and then there is a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
that holds this end and then there is a
nut<00:01:17.700> against<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> other<00:01:18.299> end<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.140> also

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
nut against the other end and you also

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.960 
nut against the other end and you also
notice<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.159> end<00:01:20.400> here<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
notice in this end here there is a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.030 
notice in this end here there is a
Center<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.570> that's<00:01:22.020> where<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.590> tail

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
Center and that's where your a tail

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.980 
Center and that's where your a tail
stock<00:01:23.369> from<00:01:23.729> your<00:01:23.880> lathe<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.390> your<00:01:24.570> lathe<00:01:24.720> tail

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
stock from your lathe or your lathe tail

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.690 
stock from your lathe or your lathe tail
stock<00:01:25.259> will<00:01:25.530> go<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.740> hold<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> other<00:01:26.340> end<00:01:26.430> of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
stock will go to hold the other end of

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.870 
stock will go to hold the other end of
the<00:01:26.759> mandrel<00:01:27.170> now<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.619> also<00:01:28.829> made<00:01:29.220> recently

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the mandrel now we also made recently

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
the mandrel now we also made recently
decided<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.750> make<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:31.290> bit<00:01:31.500> shorter

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
decided to make it a little bit shorter

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.069 
decided to make it a little bit shorter
we<00:01:32.040> made<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.579> inch<00:01:32.759> shorter<00:01:33.180> than<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.869> used

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
we made it one inch shorter than we used

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.710 
we made it one inch shorter than we used
to<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.500> because<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.610> barely<00:01:36.329> fits

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to have it because it just barely fits

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.880 
to have it because it just barely fits
in<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.990> jet<00:01:37.200> mini<00:01:37.409> lathe<00:01:37.820> but<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> will<00:01:39.090> fit<00:01:39.329> in

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
in a jet mini lathe but it will fit in

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.580 
in a jet mini lathe but it will fit in
quite<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.009> now<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.200> you've<00:01:43.200> got<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> little

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
quite well now and you've got a little

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.620 
quite well now and you've got a little
bit<00:01:43.829> more<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:46.759> grab<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> hold<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.420> so

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
bit more here to grab a hold of it so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.719 
bit more here to grab a hold of it so
you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.930> put<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.320> your<00:01:49.439> lathe<00:01:49.649> tighten<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you can put it in your lathe tighten it

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.760 
you can put it in your lathe tighten it
up<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.750> then<00:01:52.170> when<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.439> turn<00:01:52.590> it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
up like that and then when you turn it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.209 
up like that and then when you turn it
on<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.600> we're<00:01:54.600> running<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.170> 1,800<00:01:55.740> rpms

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
on and we're running this at 1,800 rpms

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.789 
on and we're running this at 1,800 rpms
on<00:01:56.460> our<00:01:56.610> lathe<00:01:57.509> which<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.960> fine<00:01:58.200> that's<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.649> good

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
on our lathe which is fine that's a good

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.969 
on our lathe which is fine that's a good
speed<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.490> and<00:02:00.170> now<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.710> three

bowl<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.850> small<00:04:07.450> buff<00:04:07.720> will<00:04:07.930> do<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.080> big<00:04:08.350> bowl<00:04:08.590> but

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
bowl a small buff will do a big bowl but

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.850 
bowl a small buff will do a big bowl but
a<00:04:09.640> big<00:04:10.330> buff<00:04:10.540> won't<00:04:10.780> fit<00:04:11.050> into<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.320> small<00:04:11.620> bowl

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
a big buff won't fit into a small bowl

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.170 
a big buff won't fit into a small bowl
so<00:04:12.160> those<00:04:12.370> are<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.670> things<00:04:12.880> you<00:04:13.000> have<00:04:13.030> to

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
so those are the things you have to

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.740 
so those are the things you have to
consider<00:04:13.950> now<00:04:14.950> in<00:04:15.220> order<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.640> mount<00:04:16.390> these<00:04:16.600> of

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
consider now in order to mount these of

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.840 
consider now in order to mount these of
us<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.169> use<00:04:17.350> them<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:18.070> need<00:04:18.250> to<00:04:18.310> have<00:04:18.430> more

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
us and use them you need to have more

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.750 
us and use them you need to have more
speed<00:04:19.269> than<00:04:20.109> on<00:04:20.470> our<00:04:20.950> standard<00:04:21.400> buffing

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
speed than on our standard buffing

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.690 
speed than on our standard buffing
system<00:04:22.120> because<00:04:22.830> 1725<00:04:23.830> is<00:04:24.100> fine<00:04:24.370> for<00:04:24.610> an

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
system because 1725 is fine for an

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.490 
system because 1725 is fine for an
8-inch<00:04:25.030> diameter<00:04:25.240> buff

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
8-inch diameter buff

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.440 
8-inch diameter buff
down<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:26.800> two<00:04:27.070> inch<00:04:27.250> diameter<00:04:27.550> buff<00:04:28.000> your

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
down to a two inch diameter buff your

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.450 
down to a two inch diameter buff your
surface<00:04:28.870> speed<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.320> reduced<00:04:29.680> quite<00:04:29.920> a<00:04:29.980> bit<00:04:30.250> and

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
surface speed is reduced quite a bit and

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.150 
surface speed is reduced quite a bit and
it<00:04:30.760> won't<00:04:31.000> really<00:04:31.330> buff<00:04:31.960> enough<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.710> do<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.890> good

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
it won't really buff enough to do a good

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.800 
it won't really buff enough to do a good
job<00:04:33.220> so<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:33.820> need<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.120> speed<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.390> up<00:04:34.630> and

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
job so you need to speed it up and

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.080 
job so you need to speed it up and
that's<00:04:34.900> why<00:04:35.170> we<00:04:35.710> use<00:04:35.740> we<00:04:36.460> suggest<00:04:36.910> that<00:04:36.970> you

hardware store and you can cut a little

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.600 
hardware store and you can cut a little
piece<00:05:52.510> of<00:05:52.690> that<00:05:53.020> put<00:05:53.740> it<00:05:53.860> into<00:05:54.250> your<00:05:54.370> lathe

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
piece of that put it into your lathe

with a nut and a washer on the back end

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.430 
with a nut and a washer on the back end
and<00:05:57.490> that<00:05:57.970> will<00:05:58.210> lock<00:05:58.479> this<00:05:58.690> in<00:05:58.930> so<00:05:59.110> it<00:05:59.200> can't

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
and that will lock this in so it can't

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.620 
and that will lock this in so it can't
possibly<00:05:59.620> come<00:06:00.130> out<00:06:00.250> and<00:06:00.610> that's<00:06:01.090> probably<00:06:01.360> a

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
possibly come out and that's probably a

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.930 
possibly come out and that's probably a
good<00:06:01.840> idea<00:06:02.169> although<00:06:02.410> they<00:06:03.190> do<00:06:03.250> seem<00:06:03.610> to<00:06:03.760> stay

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
good idea although they do seem to stay

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.880 
good idea although they do seem to stay
in<00:06:04.090> perfectly<00:06:04.630> well<00:06:04.930> and<00:06:05.169> I've<00:06:05.260> never<00:06:05.470> had<00:06:05.650> any

in perfectly well and I've never had any

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.830 
in perfectly well and I've never had any
problem<00:06:06.280> much<00:06:06.430> with<00:06:06.610> them<00:06:06.729> coming<00:06:07.000> out<00:06:07.120> now<00:06:07.780> I

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
problem much with them coming out now I

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.430

want<00:06:07.990> to<00:06:08.020> make<00:06:08.169> sure<00:06:08.200> that<00:06:08.560> my<00:06:08.710> speed<00:06:09.040> is<00:06:10.440> right

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440

now you can you can sand these a little
bit<00:06:25.810> too<00:06:26.140> when<00:06:26.380> you<00:06:26.470> first<00:06:26.710> start<00:06:26.979> using<00:06:27.160> it

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
bit too when you first start using it

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.590 
bit too when you first start using it
