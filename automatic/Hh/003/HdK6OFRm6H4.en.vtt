00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.699
 video and good this time I'm going to 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.310
 show the gta five franklin house 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.720
 for the minecraft 0.12 point 1 or the 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.430
 version that you have because you are going to 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.320
 continue to work for the future 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.610
 clear versions yes and good in this 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.779
 occasion will wonder why not 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.519
 is doing the review with the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.590
 riders and it's because I've noticed that 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.029
 record better without the block launcher as well 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.890
 that I'm going to bring them like this normal 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.510
 first let's see around here 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.820
 outside that looks very cool to me 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.500
 I seem to like it a lot because it has 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.110
 A lot of glass was also made in a 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.850
 mountain as it is in the game and 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.600
 Well now we are going to enter here we have 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.600
 two tickets 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.149
 we are going to enter through this part that then 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.070
 we have here to the left something 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.890
 that in the game I do not know what there is but 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.839
 here on the map there is also nothing 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.640
 let me finish in the comments that 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.649
 there is here because the truth I do not even 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.570
 I remember here we have a terrace 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.250
 pretty cool that if we go here 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.399
 we have the tracking of the terrace 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.330
 to see in or out 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.330
 that is very very cool 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.210
 here we have the outside or good part 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.130
 the one below that we have here the dog does not 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.780
 I remember very well how it is called let me 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.509
 also down here in the comments 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.399
 I think it was called voice or something like that 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.190
 what am I going to fix here we have the 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.990
 Jacuzzi and here we have what is the 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.409
 pool that's pretty cool though 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.090
 lacks lighting or something like that here 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.860
 we have next to the jacuzzi a part 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.200
 Well, to have a great time 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.520
 and here we have a very nice view 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.159
 that I recommend you to wear the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.200
 view forgiveness the night vision the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.960
 position so that it looks much much 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.119
 better and now we are going to go through here 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.770
 that in this part we have say because 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.840
 It's all black because if you 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.729
 they break they can realize that inside 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.069
 there are no blocks or there is nothing there is pure 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.069
 zombies made crypt I'm going to break in there 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.340
 as you can see it's all dark good 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.709
 I put a glock stop there but 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.480
 there is practically nothing, although you 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.180
 they could open it and make a room for 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.700
 that the house is more complete here 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.100
 we have the franklin room that is 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.020
 very nice here we have the dark bed and 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.480
 around here we have the closet very very 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.190
 difficult here we have a view also and 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.350
 Well now we are going to enter the part 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.800
 through the other entrance they saw that there was 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.800
 two tickets 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.520
 that is here is now yes 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.890
 let's go through here that would be 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.870
 and the main door that actually gta 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.790
 5 is one of my favorites 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.330
 I love here we have a part of 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.490
 bookstore here we have then to eat and 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.590
 here we have a room or something like that 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.240
 just like here although this part 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.860
 it's more complete because it's more 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.360
 wide and we also have this 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.340
 spectacular view out here 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.290
 we have a chest that good colors 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.190
 I have not put anything and here we have 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.330
 this part that is cooking 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.890
 that here this 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.970
 A) Yes 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.400
 well yes I think it should go like this and here 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.319
 I thought about putting cakes but they were 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.920
 pretty bad so I did not put them and what 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.480
 I left everything alone here we have several 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.910
 Potions stands here we have here 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.740
 ovens that look pretty good and then 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.160
 I think that would be all we need the 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.360
 part of 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.360
 down here 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.090
 and here we have iron doors that yes 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.710
 they wonder why they are 'iron is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.780
 because they are practically not to be 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.490
 open but because inside there is no 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.490
 blocks for example if we break here 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.829
 let's put it here in block and let's 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.930
 break if we break here we can give 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.280
 realize that there is practically nothing 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.859
 but as I already mentioned to you 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.510
 can accommodate him here so they can 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.849
 put chests for example that would be 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.010
 pretty cool and also for this part 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.730
 I'm going to teach them 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.530
 let's break here 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.569
 and as you can see we have here as a 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.220
 hallway in which as I already told you if 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.540
 you know how to fit it would be 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.970
 pretty good for you to put 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.250
 there a bookstore or its chests but here 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.680
 we finally have the door to the 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.049
 wing to bed good to room 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.180
 franklin so then nothing friends I hope 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.829

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.600
