00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it's a bit of a challenge to get this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.660 
it's a bit of a challenge to get this
off<00:01:21.930> when<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> comes<00:01:22.740> time<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.490> because

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
off when it comes time to do so because

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.910 
off when it comes time to do so because
of<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.110> good<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.650> once

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
of that but that's good because once

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.230 
of that but that's good because once
it's<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> come
