so<00:02:09.720> now<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.319> see<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.280> meant

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
so now you can see it is all meant

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.010 
so now you can see it is all meant
and<00:02:12.340> immediately<00:02:12.790> what<00:02:13.240> I'm<00:02:13.420> going<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.720> do<00:02:13.870> is

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
and immediately what I'm going to do is

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.340 
and immediately what I'm going to do is
keep<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.800> milk<00:02:15.670> mixture<00:02:16.060> again<00:02:16.360> on<00:02:16.750> heat<00:02:17.140> and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
keep the milk mixture again on heat and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.680 
keep the milk mixture again on heat and
add<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:17.950> butterscotch<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.270> melted

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
add this butterscotch that is the melted

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.380 
add this butterscotch that is the melted
butter<00:02:19.720> Scotch<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.830> milk<00:02:21.340> mixture<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
butter Scotch to the milk mixture the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.750 
butter Scotch to the milk mixture the
reason<00:02:22.720> why<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:22.960> am<00:02:23.170> adding<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.460> hot

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
reason why I am adding this to the hot

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.790 
reason why I am adding this to the hot
milk<00:02:25.120> mixture<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.780> if<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.050> add<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.650> the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
milk mixture is if you add it to the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.520 
milk mixture is if you add it to the
school<00:02:27.580> down<00:02:27.760> milk<00:02:28.150> mixture<00:02:28.450> what<00:02:29.020> happens<00:02:29.410> is

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
school down milk mixture what happens is

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.780 
school down milk mixture what happens is
the<00:02:29.650> butterscotch<00:02:30.130> will<00:02:30.340> start<00:02:30.640> to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
the butterscotch will start to

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.940 
the butterscotch will start to
solidified<00:02:31.330> again<00:02:31.480> even<00:02:32.200> now<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.410> can<00:02:32.740> see

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
solidified again even now you can see

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.740 
solidified again even now you can see
the<00:02:33.160> starter<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.790> salt<00:02:34.000> if<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.240> dab<00:02:34.420> it

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
the starter to salt if I dab it

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750 
the starter to salt if I dab it
so<00:02:35.050> again<00:02:35.530> if<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.800> heat<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.340> will<00:02:36.490> start

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
so again if you heat it it will start

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.970 
so again if you heat it it will start
melting<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.540> if<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.930> get<00:02:38.080> combined<00:02:38.590> with<00:02:38.770> the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
melting and if you get combined with the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.460 
melting and if you get combined with the
milk<00:02:39.370> mixture<00:02:39.730> very<00:02:40.060> well<00:02:40.510> now<00:02:40.960> you<00:02:41.020> can<00:02:41.290> see

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
milk mixture very well now you can see

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.380 
milk mixture very well now you can see
it<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.680> all<00:02:41.890> dissolved<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.520> combined<00:02:43.060> well

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
it is all dissolved and combined well

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.410 
it is all dissolved and combined well
with<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.810> milk<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.950> now<00:02:45.370> again<00:02:45.670> has<00:02:46.000> come<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.390> a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
with the milk so now again has come to a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.170 
with the milk so now again has come to a
boil<00:02:46.690> take<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.590> out<00:02:47.770> of<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:48.190> heat<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.730> keep<00:02:48.970> it

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
boil take it out of the heat and keep it

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.290 
boil take it out of the heat and keep it
aside<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.590> hot<00:02:51.310> mixture<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:51.940> am<00:02:52.030> going

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
aside so to this hot mixture I am going

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.590 
aside so to this hot mixture I am going
to<00:02:52.420> add<00:02:52.570> that<00:02:52.920> 250<00:02:53.920> ml<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.430> heavy<00:02:54.970> cream<00:02:55.270> that's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
it well together and then it is combined

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.520 
it well together and then it is combined

morning just pop it in the freezer for
about<00:03:09.400> 2<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.820> 3<00:03:10.300> hours<00:03:10.330> until<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:11.110> becomes

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
about 2 to 3 hours until it becomes

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.430 
about 2 to 3 hours until it becomes
thick<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:12.130> consistency<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.720> when<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.350> are

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
thick in consistency so when you are

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.320 
thick in consistency so when you are
ready<00:03:14.650> with<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.130> Misha<00:03:15.430> I'm<00:03:15.820> going<00:03:16.209> to

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.540 
transfer it to the ice cream bowl you
can<00:03:18.700> see<00:03:18.850> this<00:03:19.060> very<00:03:19.330> thick<00:03:19.810> in<00:03:19.989> consistency

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
can see this very thick in consistency

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.890 
can see this very thick in consistency
so<00:03:21.550> if<00:03:21.820> you<00:03:21.940> are<00:03:22.060> put<00:03:22.270> it<00:03:22.360> in<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.540> fridge<00:03:22.720> you

so if you are put it in the fridge you

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.780 
so if you are put it in the fridge you
could<00:03:23.110> do<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.650> next<00:03:23.860> day<00:03:23.980> morning<00:03:24.220> or

after 2 to 3 hours from a freezer so

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.760 
after 2 to 3 hours from a freezer so
paddle<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.300> start<00:03:28.780> churning<00:03:29.110> for<00:03:29.320> about

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
paddle it and start churning for about

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.949 
paddle it and start churning for about
30<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.459> 40<00:03:31.000> minutes<00:03:31.330> or<00:03:31.480> until<00:03:31.630> the
