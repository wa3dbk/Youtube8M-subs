00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.490
 hello very good to all youtubers and 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.650
 Welcome back to my channel before 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.660
 start I wanted to thank you all 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.030
 you to all the people who follow me 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.269
 we have reached a thousand and I never imagined that 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 far from serving 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.730
 and good as a gift as a reward for this 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.560
 I hope to upload a video raffling 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.619
 we will measure what you prefer player in a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.020
 good player contracts the money for 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.030
 be able to get to work and well that already 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.090
 we will talk about it but you know it 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.719
 I'm going to do something I will overcome 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.360
 although I know what but I'm going to draw 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.570
 I also wanted to tell you that forgiveness is 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.480
 apologize the last two videos the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.120
 people complained a little about the micro or 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.680
 I am by the audio I'm sorry I 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.850
 there was facial audio and I had the videos 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.309
 engravings and he says 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.930
 and the thousand stories to be able to climb the 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.180
 volume and I was not able to and I uploaded it to the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.320
 final and good today micro new video 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.650
 new 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.380
 Well what we said I was going to upload 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.690
 that I was going to upload a video about the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.150
 handicap to start because I am 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.710
 affects me and knew that it will affect everything 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.030
 the world already 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.240
 to people who start having less 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.399
 We continue and not so good but 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.549
 if it matches the inferior team to the 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.490
 yours will annoy you by then already 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.470
 that the machine has to decant 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.600
 make the other player win since 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.000
 this is you can get to understand that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.159
 is marketing the people who have to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.689
 lose this game and if people an uncle 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.159
 that is bad will never win a match 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.899
 Well, that person is going to stop buying 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.299
 the fifa then what they do is make you 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.729
 that wins a language what never wins that 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.520
 does not have a decent team and if you 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.990
 we won one that has to be messi 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.819
 to cristian this if he has anger himself 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.730
 so when I have this team I go 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:57.610
 to raze worth that's what it's based 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.490
 the handicap that he does as he does 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.430
 the rebounds his players are at a hundred 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.680
 per hundred to 200% and yours do not run 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.710
 you reject them a video that has 89 of 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.410
 head jumps and comes one with that comes 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.300
 any one any one a silver a 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.000
 bronze or whatever and it jumps and gives you 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.690
 head went to the goal goal and a thousand 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.760
 countless things I would like to have a 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.900
 grabber that is what we already are 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.200
 that I close I'm going to buy a 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.030
 grabber and videos teaching how 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.450
 affects the handicap to the first made lower 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.760
 to third 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.140
 and third was when I told you that I 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.580
 I was going to make a motivated team and today 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.989
 I already have it for a long time and what 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.840
 I was testing I was doing the 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.879
 changes of players and watching to see how 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.160
 they worked and today I wanted to bring it 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.220
 to show you what you do not have to prove to 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.190
 all I tell you 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.690
 for me they are the best of the best 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.170
 because they are the ones that affect me this 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.480
 year wins the line or the Brazilians 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.820
 they raze everywhere gods in kobe 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.620
 for example in Wellington has nothing 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.810
 that envy Messi committed rhythm 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.120
 79 shot no matter what shot you have 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.140
 67 dribbling pass 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.239
 eder luis you see 90 rhythm and dribbles 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.310
 80 an uncle who is not playing or 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.500
 even his position and I can tell you that 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.830
 I take a lot of goals resolved 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.440
 party is the sun and the same is jose 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.110
 enrique josÃ© enrique with 90 rhythm and 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.239
 dribble 78 that does not have much dribble but 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.510
 when you play with him he seems to have 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.120
 more than messi game that hunt or that the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.310
 own di Maria I have all the 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.799
 good players I will teach you my 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.890
 players that we buy buy from robben 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.360
 and they go persie and have nothing to 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.520
 to envy 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.500
 this guy lucas well I do not know I do not 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.590
 I understand but I prefer to play with him 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.270
 rather than with xavi and how they are 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.040
 marcelo who buy it here because he has 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.010
 pretty rhythm and it's pretty good and 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.500
 It serves for a handicap because it has 83 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.530
 average that is not very high and plays very 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.330
 well what about the stockings what 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.640
 what you have to notice is in this the 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.580
 equipment that you do with the handicap 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.200
 can go up more than 879 because it's 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.239
 easy to find your equipment that has more 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.620
 81 average for us what 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.680
 we want to do is find a team 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.360
 that has less than us or is more 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.340
 that we and we have less than 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.930
 them then that's when it 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.300
 will decant the machine for giving us the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.230
 handicap for us also I follow a 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:38.160
 rhythm 81 of this is milk also the 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.680
 naldo another plus 74 rhythm another felipe 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.009
 santana rhythm 81 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.580
 and already the interest that is with 88 him 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:50.220
 jonathan giving with more rhythm so much more 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.620
 rhythm that marcelo and I tell you lucas moura 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.050
 It goes very well 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.360
 we all know diego alves that no 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.920
 has nothing to envy to squares anything 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.810
 but nothing to envy to squares 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.840
 and I tell you, provide all the Moors with 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.300
 boxes to all unless a Christian who 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.310
 I'm still missing I'm going to the best next 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.200
 videos will be how to get to get 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.610
 Messi or Christian and I tell you it does not have 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.560
 nothing to envy the players 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.270
 then you need some reservations for 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.970
 These people, what I always do 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.400
 on my computers also or with that 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.140
 equipment as original equipment with cushions 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.300
 of all these always played his team 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.280
 and then the controls to rest and play 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.400
 to another good team because the other one you have 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.170
 here at the arsenal you have something not 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.630
 you have sturridge is that if there 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.280
 very many if you notice 91 of rhythm and 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.940
 this one you have who knew him not even 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.170
 kabul that goes great 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:49.920
 you have just like this is another more 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.960
 other motivated than for what there is not at 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.490
 happy and this also goes for likes to me 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.400
 I like filial and also how little I 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.050
 I took and there is more just to look at the 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.990
 mean and always see the players them 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.289
 they go well if to theirs to walcott by 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.379
 course, the same with love 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:10.099
 and another one with another defense of the 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:13.900
 manchester 74 and jose enrique good 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:15.639
 I tell you that if you want to win games 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.100
 play with our players I have already 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.070
 won two top leagues with them and 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.600
 playing against really good teams 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.400
 and well I opted for this 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.600
 Brazilians because they send and then for 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.529
 give a little truth 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.219
 I have signed these 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:33.989
 good also what you really tell 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:38.050
 I do not like to play this team because 

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:40.120
 once you have a team like 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.470
 mine for example and people are already 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.659
 saying that the 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.090
 Here I meet a guy who 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:48.430
 He signed that he already got to see if I 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.409
 I love that you liked the trick 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.759
 I love that you get it right I love that 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:54.759
 you are -free all our players 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.379
 preferred but I fuck a lot no 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:57.940
 be able to play with them because after 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:59.530
 the moment arrives I start playing with 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.530
 they and they will persie again euros 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.270
 robben for the 93 place of pace and 92 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.729
 of dribble seems to have 20 because no 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.370
 I would haggle one silver 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:11.120
 and well I have everything is good already known 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.940
 I'm here for the truth 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.430
 and it bothered me point 1 not being able to 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.260
 play with them but good as I say 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.050
 this already comes from years ago the handicap 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.610
 it was not done now in cifa 13 and there 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.400
 several tricks to play with 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.990
 your favorite teams and play with 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.210
 them and that affects you so much the handicap 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.830
 - I promise that you will win with the 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.080
 trick that I tell you in the next video 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.470
 that you are going to win but that is going to 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.960
 affect the handicap that if I promise 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:41.479
 then I have presented you to the team to 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.830
 that you start if you want to try it you can 

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:45.560
 play a match opposites I will play with 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.900
 my original team and then play with 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.260
 the motivated team so you can see the 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:53.240
 difference and between today and tomorrow go up the 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.410
 video how to play how is the team 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.940
 I for example want to play with this 

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.010
 team how would I do to play with this 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.870
 team and you're going to like the truth because 

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.760
 yes, the handicap affects the new 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.400
 retested and works again here 

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.260
 already worked on fifa 12 and here it goes back to 

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.500
 function 

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.420
 Well that friends if you like the video 

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.370
 give you like to subscribe if you are not for 

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.400
