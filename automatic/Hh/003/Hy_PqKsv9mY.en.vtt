with water yes you're right if we cut

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.499 
with water yes you're right if we cut
the<00:01:10.560> earth<00:01:10.590> apple<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.219> four<00:01:11.460> parts<00:01:11.729> three<00:01:12.420> of

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
the earth apple in four parts three of

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.690 
the earth apple in four parts three of
those<00:01:12.659> parts<00:01:13.079> would<00:01:13.289> be<00:01:13.500> water<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.430> can't

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
those parts would be water so we can't

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.260 
those parts would be water so we can't
grow<00:01:14.850> any<00:01:15.030> food<00:01:15.240> plants<00:01:15.719> there<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:17.700> only

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
grow any food plants there so only

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.709 
grow any food plants there so only
one-fourth<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> earth<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.619> land

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
one-fourth of the earth there is land

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.569 
one-fourth of the earth there is land
but<00:01:21.719> again<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.350> can't<00:01:22.619> use<00:01:22.829> all<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> remaining

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579

to grow this part is called subsoil and
has<00:03:28.080> small<00:03:28.410> particles<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.100> rock<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:30.330> part<00:03:30.690> is

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
has small particles of rock this part is

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.840 
has small particles of rock this part is
called<00:03:31.140> parent<00:03:31.530> material<00:03:32.040> these<00:03:32.550> are<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
called parent material these are the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.550 
called parent material these are the
parents<00:03:33.180> rocks<00:03:33.510> which<00:03:33.870> get<00:03:34.080> broken<00:03:34.380> down

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
parents rocks which get broken down

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.280 
parents rocks which get broken down
slowly<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.460> become<00:03:35.940> smaller<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.570> smaller<00:03:36.630> to

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
slowly and become smaller and smaller to

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.740 
slowly and become smaller and smaller to
form<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.680> soil<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.820> this<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.210> the<00:03:39.330> part<00:03:39.600> in

which the parents of topsoil and subsoil

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.280 
which the parents of topsoil and subsoil
live<00:03:42.500> aha<00:03:43.530> these<00:03:44.100> are<00:03:44.520> big<00:03:44.790> rocks<00:03:45.060> these<00:03:45.870> big

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
live aha these are big rocks these big

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.410 
live aha these are big rocks these big
rocks<00:03:46.500> are<00:03:46.800> kind<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.220> grandparents<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.300> the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
rocks are kind of grandparents of the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.050 
rocks are kind of grandparents of the
soil<00:03:48.690> they<00:03:49.230> break<00:03:49.590> down<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.860> form<00:03:50.490> the<00:03:50.670> parent

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
soil they break down and form the parent

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.420 
soil they break down and form the parent
material<00:03:51.230> then<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.470> parents<00:03:52.890> rocks<00:03:53.100> break

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
material then the parents rocks break

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.370 
material then the parents rocks break
down<00:03:53.670> due<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.210> pressure<00:03:54.480> temperature<00:03:55.020> and

to show you something oh look it's an

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.010 
to show you something oh look it's an
earthworm<00:04:05.760> don't<00:04:06.330> worry<00:04:06.540> they<00:04:06.840> aren't

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
earthworm don't worry they aren't

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.650 
earthworm don't worry they aren't
harmful<00:04:07.730> earthworms<00:04:08.730> are<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:08.970> friend<00:04:09.360> of<00:04:09.540> the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
harmful earthworms are a friend of the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.980 
harmful earthworms are a friend of the
soil<00:04:09.990> and<00:04:10.260> plants<00:04:10.710> okay<00:04:11.570> now<00:04:12.570> we<00:04:12.630> have<00:04:12.810> to

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
soil and plants okay now we have to

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.910 
soil and plants okay now we have to
study<00:04:13.200> in<00:04:13.380> a<00:04:13.440> classroom<00:04:13.740> ah<00:04:15.170> so<00:04:16.170> now<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.530> know

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
study in a classroom ah so now you know

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.130 
study in a classroom ah so now you know
why<00:04:17.160> top<00:04:17.430> soil<00:04:17.730> is<00:04:17.880> important<00:04:18.390> for<00:04:18.540> us<00:04:18.660> as<00:04:18.870> it

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
why top soil is important for us as it

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.990 
why top soil is important for us as it
is<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.380> only<00:04:19.560> place<00:04:19.980> where<00:04:20.190> we<00:04:20.310> can<00:04:20.489> grow<00:04:20.640> food

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
is the only place where we can grow food

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.330 
is the only place where we can grow food
for<00:04:21.209> ourselves<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:21.900> other<00:04:22.049> animals<00:04:22.560> see<00:04:23.190> what

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
for ourselves and other animals see what

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.130 
for ourselves and other animals see what
a<00:04:23.370> small<00:04:23.730> portion<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.360> earth<00:04:24.390> we<00:04:24.690> have<00:04:24.720> for

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
a small portion of the earth we have for

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.469 
a small portion of the earth we have for
growing<00:04:25.290> food<00:04:25.590> did<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:26.610> know<00:04:26.940> that<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.300> takes

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
growing food did you know that it takes

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.420 
growing food did you know that it takes
five<00:04:27.750> hundred<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.350> thousand<00:04:28.919> years<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.310> get

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
five hundred to a thousand years to get

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.279 
five hundred to a thousand years to get
one<00:04:29.760> inch<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.270> topsoil

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
one inch of topsoil

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.529 
one inch of topsoil
yes<00:04:31.499> nature<00:04:32.039> takes<00:04:32.309> many<00:04:32.550> years<00:04:32.639> to<00:04:32.939> make<00:04:33.240> even

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
yes nature takes many years to make even

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.559 
yes nature takes many years to make even
an<00:04:33.659> inch<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.229> topsoil<00:04:35.089> but<00:04:36.089> did<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:36.389> know<00:04:36.539> that

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
an inch of topsoil but did you know that

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.829 
an inch of topsoil but did you know that
even<00:04:37.080> this<00:04:37.259> tiny<00:04:37.589> part<00:04:37.949> is<00:04:38.189> in<00:04:38.369> danger<00:04:38.839> yes

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:39.839 
even this tiny part is in danger yes

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.570 
even this tiny part is in danger yes
this<00:04:40.169> part<00:04:40.409> is<00:04:40.649> getting<00:04:40.919> smaller<00:04:41.249> and<00:04:41.520> smaller

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
this part is getting smaller and smaller

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.200 
this part is getting smaller and smaller
due<00:04:42.149> to<00:04:42.180> soil<00:04:42.539> erosion<00:04:42.869> oh<00:04:43.729> you<00:04:44.729> didn't<00:04:45.119> know

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
due to soil erosion oh you didn't know

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.689 
due to soil erosion oh you didn't know
about<00:04:45.330> soil<00:04:45.719> erosion<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.289> is<00:04:46.949> about<00:04:47.189> our<00:04:47.249> top

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
about soil erosion it is about our top

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.670 
about soil erosion it is about our top
soil<00:04:47.999> getting<00:04:48.360> washed<00:04:48.629> or<00:04:48.930> blown<00:04:48.960> away<00:04:49.469> by

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
soil getting washed or blown away by

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.939 
soil getting washed or blown away by
water<00:04:49.949> and<00:04:50.309> wind<00:04:51.199> we<00:04:52.199> humans<00:04:52.649> are<00:04:52.770> also

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
water and wind we humans are also

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.920 
water and wind we humans are also
responsible<00:04:53.729> for<00:04:53.789> it<00:04:54.089> we're<00:04:54.389> making<00:04:54.749> new

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
responsible for it we're making new

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.049 
responsible for it we're making new
houses<00:04:55.349> and<00:04:55.529> roads<00:04:55.710> all<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.129> time<00:04:56.369> so<00:04:56.909> the

00:04:57.049 --> 00:04:57.059 
houses and roads all the time so the

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:59.029 
houses and roads all the time so the
area<00:04:57.419> for<00:04:57.599> plant<00:04:57.839> life<00:04:58.080> is<00:04:58.259> becoming<00:04:58.439> smaller

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
area for plant life is becoming smaller

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.119 
area for plant life is becoming smaller
and<00:04:59.159> smaller<00:04:59.839> you're<00:05:00.839> right<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.649> area<00:05:01.949> for

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
and smaller you're right the area for

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.040 
and smaller you're right the area for
plant<00:05:02.369> life<00:05:02.580> is<00:05:02.759> becoming<00:05:03.240> increasingly

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
plant life is becoming increasingly

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.459 
plant life is becoming increasingly
smaller<00:05:05.149> did<00:05:06.149> you<00:05:06.300> know<00:05:06.449> that<00:05:06.479> plants<00:05:07.080> help<00:05:07.289> in

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
smaller did you know that plants help in

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:08.809 
smaller did you know that plants help in
stopping<00:05:08.009> soil<00:05:08.309> erosion

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
stopping soil erosion

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.239 
stopping soil erosion
look<00:05:09.419> at<00:05:09.539> this<00:05:09.689> on<00:05:09.930> one<00:05:10.649> side<00:05:10.919> there<00:05:11.219> are

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:11.249 
look at this on one side there are

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:13.549 
look at this on one side there are
plants<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.119> on<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.360> other<00:05:12.479> side<00:05:12.809> it<00:05:13.080> is<00:05:13.110> plain

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:13.559 
plants and on the other side it is plain

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.369 
plants and on the other side it is plain
land<00:05:13.919> when<00:05:14.610> rain<00:05:14.879> comes<00:05:15.209> plants<00:05:15.959> hold<00:05:16.199> the

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
land when rain comes plants hold the

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.649 
land when rain comes plants hold the
soil<00:05:16.589> so<00:05:17.159> it<00:05:17.279> isn't<00:05:17.550> eroded<00:05:17.999> on<00:05:18.149> the<00:05:18.240> left-hand

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
soil so it isn't eroded on the left-hand

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:20.959 
soil so it isn't eroded on the left-hand
side<00:05:18.899> on<00:05:19.529> the<00:05:19.589> right-hand<00:05:19.860> side<00:05:20.309> there<00:05:20.789> are<00:05:20.819> no

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969 
side on the right-hand side there are no

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:22.999 
side on the right-hand side there are no
plants<00:05:21.479> or<00:05:21.599> trees<00:05:21.629> so<00:05:22.349> the<00:05:22.469> land<00:05:22.680> is<00:05:22.830> getting

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
plants or trees so the land is getting

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.129 
plants or trees so the land is getting
eroded<00:05:23.369> so<00:05:24.089> we<00:05:24.240> see<00:05:24.479> plants<00:05:24.899> are<00:05:25.110> very

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
eroded so we see plants are very

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.739 
eroded so we see plants are very
important<00:05:25.979> in<00:05:26.129> preventing<00:05:26.789> soil<00:05:27.029> erosion

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:27.749 
important in preventing soil erosion

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:30.799 
important in preventing soil erosion
so<00:05:28.740> you<00:05:28.800> see<00:05:29.099> plants<00:05:29.699> are<00:05:29.909> very<00:05:29.939> important

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:30.809 
so you see plants are very important

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:32.869 
so you see plants are very important
they<00:05:31.169> not<00:05:31.319> only<00:05:31.349> give<00:05:31.740> us<00:05:31.860> food<00:05:32.129> clothes<00:05:32.610> and

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:32.879 
they not only give us food clothes and

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.059 
they not only give us food clothes and
many<00:05:33.119> other<00:05:33.360> things<00:05:33.659> but<00:05:34.080> they<00:05:34.199> also<00:05:34.379> save<00:05:34.860> our

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
many other things but they also save our

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.579 
many other things but they also save our
soil<00:05:35.339> from<00:05:35.580> being<00:05:35.789> eroded<00:05:36.059> but<00:05:36.809> we<00:05:37.019> humans<00:05:37.439> are

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:37.589 
soil from being eroded but we humans are

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:39.499 
soil from being eroded but we humans are
cutting<00:05:37.919> down<00:05:38.099> trees<00:05:38.370> without<00:05:38.849> planting<00:05:39.330> new

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
cutting down trees without planting new

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.689 
cutting down trees without planting new
ones<00:05:39.749> we're<00:05:40.349> putting<00:05:40.649> more<00:05:40.830> animals<00:05:41.309> to<00:05:41.490> graze

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
ones we're putting more animals to graze

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.089 
ones we're putting more animals to graze
in<00:05:41.999> small<00:05:42.300> areas<00:05:42.749> so<00:05:43.289> the<00:05:43.409> protective<00:05:43.919> layer

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
in small areas so the protective layer

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.790 
in small areas so the protective layer
of<00:05:44.309> the<00:05:44.399> earth<00:05:44.550> is<00:05:44.849> decreasing<00:05:45.659> let's<00:05:46.559> go<00:05:46.740> to

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
of the earth is decreasing let's go to

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.559 
of the earth is decreasing let's go to
the<00:05:46.949> laboratory<00:05:47.519> and<00:05:47.610> see<00:05:47.849> an<00:05:47.939> experiment<00:05:48.269> on

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 
the laboratory and see an experiment on

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:50.329 
the laboratory and see an experiment on
how<00:05:48.749> plants<00:05:49.110> help<00:05:49.409> in<00:05:49.559> decreasing<00:05:49.949> soil

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:50.339 
how plants help in decreasing soil

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:52.820 
how plants help in decreasing soil
erosion<00:05:50.610> so<00:05:51.479> let's<00:05:51.659> put<00:05:51.839> water<00:05:52.050> in<00:05:52.379> both<00:05:52.620> of

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
erosion so let's put water in both of

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.989 
erosion so let's put water in both of
these<00:05:54.620> so<00:05:55.620> we<00:05:55.649> saw<00:05:55.919> today<00:05:56.159> that<00:05:56.490> plants<00:05:56.849> and

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:56.999 
these so we saw today that plants and

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.299 
these so we saw today that plants and
trees<00:05:57.120> are<00:05:57.419> very<00:05:57.629> important<00:05:58.259> for<00:05:58.469> us<00:05:58.589> if<00:05:59.069> we

00:05:59.299 --> 00:05:59.309 
trees are very important for us if we

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:01.249 
trees are very important for us if we
don't<00:05:59.490> save<00:05:59.759> them<00:05:59.999> then<00:06:00.360> more<00:06:00.659> soil<00:06:00.930> erosion

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
don't save them then more soil erosion

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.439 
don't save them then more soil erosion
will<00:06:01.559> occur<00:06:01.919> and<00:06:02.189> the<00:06:02.399> area<00:06:02.759> for<00:06:02.969> plant<00:06:03.180> growth

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
will occur and the area for plant growth

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.809 
will occur and the area for plant growth
will<00:06:03.629> become<00:06:03.869> smaller<00:06:04.259> and<00:06:04.529> smaller<00:06:04.589> I<00:06:05.219> hope

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
will become smaller and smaller I hope

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.429 
will become smaller and smaller I hope
everybody<00:06:06.269> understands<00:06:06.809> that<00:06:07.050> we<00:06:07.199> need<00:06:07.229> to

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:07.439 
everybody understands that we need to

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:09.409 
everybody understands that we need to
plant<00:06:07.680> more<00:06:07.949> trees<00:06:07.979> and<00:06:08.669> should<00:06:09.119> avoid

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
plant more trees and should avoid

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.719 
plant more trees and should avoid
cutting<00:06:09.779> them<00:06:10.050> down<00:06:10.080> otherwise<00:06:10.979> there<00:06:11.580> won't

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
cutting them down otherwise there won't

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.629 
cutting them down otherwise there won't
be<00:06:11.819> any<00:06:11.999> soil<00:06:12.389> left<00:06:12.719> for<00:06:13.050> drawing<00:06:13.289> food<00:06:13.639> here's

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
be any soil left for drawing food here's

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.609
