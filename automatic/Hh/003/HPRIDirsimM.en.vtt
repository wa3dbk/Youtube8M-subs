00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
through the forest these are excellent

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.500 
through the forest these are excellent
plants<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.369> northern<00:00:23.670> New<00:00:23.699> Mexico<00:00:24.240> for<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
plants for northern New Mexico for the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.300 
plants for northern New Mexico for the
most<00:00:24.660> part<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.470> they're<00:00:25.619> good<00:00:25.800> from<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
most part but they're good from the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.730 
most part but they're good from the
whole<00:00:26.460> state<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.789> New<00:00:27.060> Mexico<00:00:27.529> Rick<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:28.680> do

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
whole state of New Mexico Rick what do

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.650 
whole state of New Mexico Rick what do
we<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:28.949> right<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.300> Curtis<00:00:30.300> we've<00:00:30.449> got<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
we have right here Curtis we've got a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
we have right here Curtis we've got a
Bosnian<00:00:31.260> pine<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.769> gets<00:00:31.890> about<00:00:32.099> 40<00:00:32.520> feet<00:00:32.759> tall

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
Bosnian pine it gets about 40 feet tall

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.870 
Bosnian pine it gets about 40 feet tall
and<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:34.410> will<00:00:34.649> take<00:00:34.890> minimum<00:00:35.280> temperatures

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and it will take minimum temperatures

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.930 
and it will take minimum temperatures
down<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.270> 30<00:00:36.540> degrees<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.219> takes<00:00:38.730> pretty

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
down to 30 degrees so it takes pretty

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.459 
down to 30 degrees so it takes pretty
cold<00:00:39.180> temperature<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.690> be<00:00:39.809> good<00:00:39.960> way<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.350> in

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
cold temperature so be good way up in

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.780 
cold temperature so be good way up in
northern<00:00:40.739> New<00:00:40.770> Mexico<00:00:40.860> up<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> mountains

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
northern New Mexico up on the mountains

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.729 
northern New Mexico up on the mountains
so<00:00:42.000> that's<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.329> good<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:42.660> 10<00:00:43.020> feet<00:00:43.230> tall

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
so that's a good one 10 feet tall

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.569 
so that's a good one 10 feet tall
30<00:00:44.430> 30<00:00:45.210> feet<00:00:45.450> tall<00:00:45.600> that's<00:00:46.469> right<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.370> that's<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
30 30 feet tall that's right so that's a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.549 
30 30 feet tall that's right so that's a
pretty<00:00:47.790> nice<00:00:47.940> sized<00:00:48.239> tree<00:00:48.480> not<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> giant<00:00:49.260> tree

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
pretty nice sized tree not a giant tree

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.650 
pretty nice sized tree not a giant tree
no<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.370> really<00:00:50.550> well<00:00:50.969> proportion<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> lot

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
no but really well proportion to a lot

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660 
no but really well proportion to a lot
of<00:00:51.750> landscapes<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.219> we've<00:00:53.340> got<00:00:53.460> some

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
of landscapes so here we've got some

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.150 
of landscapes so here we've got some
upright<00:00:53.969> juniper<00:00:54.420> these<00:00:55.410> are<00:00:55.649> some<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.039> are

upright juniper these are some that are

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.850 
upright juniper these are some that are
useful<00:00:56.760> throughout<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.390> state<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.649> good

to it that is interesting and useful in
some<00:01:33.840> settings<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.529> landscape<00:01:35.039> I<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.999> you

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
some settings in the landscape I see you

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.149 
some settings in the landscape I see you
have<00:01:36.299> other<00:01:36.509> some<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.959> aren't<00:01:37.139> spiraled<00:01:38.039> and

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
some that are trimmed to be spiral and I

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.679 
some that are trimmed to be spiral and I
see<00:01:40.709> over<00:01:40.919> here<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.429> Austrian<00:01:41.999> black<00:01:42.329> pine

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
see over here the Austrian black pine

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.959 
see over here the Austrian black pine
it's<00:01:43.319> a<00:01:43.409> good<00:01:43.709> well<00:01:44.009> adapted<00:01:44.399> tree<00:01:44.549> especially

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
it's a good well adapted tree especially

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.510 
it's a good well adapted tree especially
for<00:01:45.090> lower<00:01:45.329> land<00:01:45.659> type<00:01:46.349> of<00:01:46.560> settings<00:01:46.950> where

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520

feet<00:02:18.220> 12<00:02:18.610> feet<00:02:18.700> tall<00:02:18.970> it's<00:02:19.420> appropriate<00:02:19.900> for<00:02:20.020> a

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
feet 12 feet tall it's appropriate for a

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.840 
feet 12 feet tall it's appropriate for a
lot<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.260> landscapes<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.340> looks<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:21.700> an

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
lot of landscapes so that looks like an

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.820 
lot of landscapes so that looks like an
interesting<00:02:21.970> tree<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> have<00:02:22.690> then<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:23.620> here<00:02:23.800> I

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
interesting tree to have then in here I

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.670 
interesting tree to have then in here I
see<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.400> Japanese<00:02:25.090> black<00:02:25.360> pine<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:26.350> that's<00:02:26.530> a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
see the Japanese black pine and that's a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.890 
see the Japanese black pine and that's a
fast-growing<00:02:27.040> pine<00:02:27.430> tree<00:02:27.670> yeah<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.600> can<00:02:28.750> see

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
fast-growing pine tree yeah you can see

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.600 
fast-growing pine tree yeah you can see
the<00:02:29.020> candles<00:02:29.470> on<00:02:29.650> these<00:02:29.860> guys<00:02:30.070> are<00:02:30.310> already<00:02:30.460> a

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
the candles on these guys are already a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.240 
the candles on these guys are already a
couple<00:02:30.940> feet<00:02:31.120> tall<00:02:31.560> growing<00:02:32.560> fast<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.100> this

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
couple feet tall growing fast and this

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.160 
couple feet tall growing fast and this
grows<00:02:33.520> with<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.790> very<00:02:33.970> irregular<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.900> kind<00:02:35.110> of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
grows with a very irregular and kind of

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.450 
grows with a very irregular and kind of
twisting<00:02:35.530> form<00:02:35.770> which<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.070> interesting<00:02:36.280> in

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
twisting form which is interesting in

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.010 
twisting form which is interesting in
the<00:02:36.550> landscape<00:02:37.000> that's<00:02:37.450> right<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:37.960> a

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
the landscape that's right this is a

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.270 
the landscape that's right this is a
good<00:02:38.200> tree<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.440> have<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:38.770> well<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.160> well

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
good tree to have as well and well

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.960 
good tree to have as well and well
adapted<00:02:39.400> here<00:02:40.710> lots<00:02:41.710> of<00:02:41.890> forest<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.730> really

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
adapted here lots of forest just really

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.430 
adapted here lots of forest just really
pretty<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.360> here<00:02:43.540> with<00:02:43.690> all<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.930> trees<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:44.380> I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
pretty in here with all the trees but I

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.990 
pretty in here with all the trees but I
see<00:02:44.650> we're<00:02:45.010> getting<00:02:45.250> close<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.640> some<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.850> my

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
see we're getting close to some of my

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.570 
see we're getting close to some of my
favorites<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:47.110> Deardorff<00:02:47.560> Cedars<00:02:47.950> one<00:02:48.490> of

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
favorites the Deardorff Cedars one of

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.580 
favorites the Deardorff Cedars one of
the<00:02:48.640> true<00:02:48.850> Cedars<00:02:49.260> native<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.500> Middle

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
the true Cedars native to the Middle

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.710 
the true Cedars native to the Middle
East<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.550> it's<00:02:51.700> fairly<00:02:51.850> well<00:02:52.030> adapted<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.510> our

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
East so it's fairly well adapted to our

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.650 
East so it's fairly well adapted to our
conditions<00:02:53.640> its<00:02:54.640> hardiness<00:02:55.120> though<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.510> not

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
conditions its hardiness though is not

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.260 
conditions its hardiness though is not
for<00:02:56.110> northern<00:02:56.650> New<00:02:56.740> Mexico<00:02:57.030> they<00:02:58.030> will<00:02:58.150> make

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
for northern New Mexico they will make

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.790 
for northern New Mexico they will make
it<00:02:58.360> up<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.480> her<00:02:58.900> maybe<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.410> little<00:02:59.620> further

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
it up to her maybe a little further

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.760 
it up to her maybe a little further
north<00:02:59.950> yeah<00:03:00.430> zero<00:03:01.270> degrees<00:03:01.660> it'll<00:03:01.990> take<00:03:02.260> okay

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
north yeah zero degrees it'll take okay

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.980 
north yeah zero degrees it'll take okay
so<00:03:02.950> but<00:03:03.280> this<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.460> a<00:03:03.610> tree<00:03:03.880> where<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.660> spruce

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
so but this is a tree where the spruce

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.290 
so but this is a tree where the spruce
doesn't<00:03:05.410> do<00:03:05.530> well<00:03:05.770> this<00:03:06.430> will<00:03:06.670> do<00:03:06.820> better<00:03:07.030> and

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
doesn't do well this will do better and

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.270 
doesn't do well this will do better and
it<00:03:07.420> has<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.840> form<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.290> very<00:03:08.500> elegant<00:03:08.860> looking

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
it has the form a very elegant looking

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.940 
it has the form a very elegant looking
spruce<00:03:09.640> very<00:03:09.910> graceful<00:03:10.660> weeping<00:03:11.050> form<00:03:11.320> your

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
spruce very graceful weeping form your

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.740 
spruce very graceful weeping form your
tip<00:03:12.190> at<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.640> top<00:03:12.820> is<00:03:12.970> really<00:03:13.060> bent<00:03:13.390> over<00:03:13.570> a

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
tip at the top is really bent over a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.450 
tip at the top is really bent over a
little<00:03:13.930> bit<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:14.380> it's<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.040> very<00:03:15.220> attractive

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
little bit so it's a very attractive

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.090 
little bit so it's a very attractive
tree<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:16.840> noticed<00:03:17.110> on<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.290> tag<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.590> says

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
tree and I noticed on the tag that says

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.850 
tree and I noticed on the tag that says
it's<00:03:18.340> deer<00:03:18.730> resistant<00:03:19.480> that's<00:03:20.410> right<00:03:20.709> and

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
it's deer resistant that's right and

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.290 
it's deer resistant that's right and
that's<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:21.130> nice<00:03:21.340> thing<00:03:21.790> about<00:03:21.820> from<00:03:22.209> New

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
that's a nice thing about from New

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.199 
that's a nice thing about from New
