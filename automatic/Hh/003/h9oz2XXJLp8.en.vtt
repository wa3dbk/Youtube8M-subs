the if the dwell cap is 40 that's fine

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.620 
the if the dwell cap is 40 that's fine
if<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.650> 36<00:02:13.650> that's<00:02:14.069> fine<00:02:14.340> too<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.330> try<00:02:15.569> to

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
if it's 36 that's fine too but try to

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.759 
if it's 36 that's fine too but try to
get<00:02:15.870> close<00:02:16.290> as<00:02:16.530> close<00:02:16.769> as<00:02:17.660> 38f<00:02:18.720> your<00:02:19.290> manual

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
get close as close as 38f your manual
