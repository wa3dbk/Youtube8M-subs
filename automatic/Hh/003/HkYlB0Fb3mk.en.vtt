00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:09.019
 [Music] 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.420
 [Applause] 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.429
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.310
 so today I'm bringing a lot of trial 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.900
 For you , how low are you? 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.060
 giving installing spitalfields game 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.269
 so this game was released just a few 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.240
 days it is in beta although 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.460
 was released a few months ago, right? 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:40.050
 was released on the 23rd of 2013 and a game 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.350
 well light it's only 99 mere you go 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.239
 need an ex 1ghz processor 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.530
 memory of at least 512 direct x 9 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.750
 So you guys might be finding here 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.309
 From the bottom here I was pulling a link 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.309
 in the description of the video explained in download 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.870
 You can see here so it's common for them 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.500
 It's a game button I think it's still 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.860
 it will take some updates is 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.470
 in it that will improve these can see 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.810
 here on the counter but I think after that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.939
 it will change 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.420
 So here, afterwards, let's get him down. 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.909
 live in this file here in this part 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.909
 to click on the button. 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.890
 right-click it and click 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:33.150
 draw to warm installs 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.140
 there you wait is there and you open it 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.049
 folder 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.810
 and if you paint the part that will create 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.110
 players in this installer giving two 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.110
 clicks 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:52.820
 he expects me here to prepare everything 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.370
 It's just that you're going to give the next one. 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.710
 here you choose the folder he goes 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:02.630
 be there I'll leave it right here 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.470
 then next normally next and it goes 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.470
 start installing 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.650
 then threw myself very light and very good're 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.510
 watching some videos some gameplay it 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.580
 on the Internet 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.239
 I find it very interesting he does here 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.700
 everything is for you to tell by installing it 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.380
 I think it will succeed there in 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.840
 some months 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:32.600
