day how Tim and I met I was up in the

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.299 
day how Tim and I met I was up in the
Swan<00:00:34.089> Valley<00:00:34.289> Tim<00:00:35.289> was<00:00:35.469> working<00:00:35.829> on<00:00:35.920> trapping

Swan Valley Tim was working on trapping

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.759 
Swan Valley Tim was working on trapping
for<00:00:37.089> a<00:00:37.149> problem<00:00:37.719> grizzly<00:00:38.109> bear<00:00:38.319> right<00:00:38.530> across

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
for a problem grizzly bear right across

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.000 
for a problem grizzly bear right across
the<00:00:39.100> street<00:00:39.339> I<00:00:39.870> asked<00:00:40.870> him<00:00:40.989> I<00:00:41.109> said<00:00:41.139> what<00:00:41.679> would

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
the street I asked him I said what would

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.509 
the street I asked him I said what would
a<00:00:42.399> better<00:00:43.030> bear<00:00:43.389> trap<00:00:43.809> look<00:00:44.170> like<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:44.829> I

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
a better bear trap look like and I

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.000 
a better bear trap look like and I
basically<00:00:45.760> said<00:00:46.120> a<00:00:46.690> culvert<00:00:47.199> trap<00:00:47.469> that<00:00:47.829> we

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
basically said a culvert trap that we

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.399 
basically said a culvert trap that we
could<00:00:48.219> monitor<00:00:48.639> through<00:00:48.999> the<00:00:49.179> Internet<00:00:49.629> so

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
could monitor through the Internet so

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.379 
could monitor through the Internet so
what<00:00:50.589> we<00:00:50.769> did<00:00:50.979> is<00:00:51.129> we<00:00:51.159> took<00:00:51.489> an<00:00:51.639> industrial

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.389 
what we did is we took an industrial

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:55.109 
what we did is we took an industrial
computer<00:00:52.959> and<00:00:53.170> we<00:00:53.829> wrote<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.429> bear<00:00:54.760> trap

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:55.119 
computer and we wrote a bear trap

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:57.779 
computer and we wrote a bear trap
program<00:00:55.809> for<00:00:56.229> it<00:00:56.379> that<00:00:57.010> is<00:00:57.159> meant<00:00:57.459> to<00:00:57.519> do

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
program for it that is meant to do

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.809 
program for it that is meant to do
exactly<00:00:58.329> what<00:00:58.600> Tim<00:00:59.499> and<00:00:59.799> the<00:01:00.069> bear<00:01:00.249> managers

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
exactly what Tim and the bear managers

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:03.660 
exactly what Tim and the bear managers
tell<00:01:01.209> it<00:01:01.359> to<00:01:01.479> do<00:01:01.659> the<00:01:02.589> way<00:01:02.709> this<00:01:02.889> trap<00:01:03.129> works<00:01:03.339> is

tell it to do the way this trap works is

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.209 
tell it to do the way this trap works is
when<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.720> door<00:01:04.900> goes<00:01:05.080> down<00:01:05.320> I<00:01:05.619> get<00:01:05.950> an<00:01:06.070> email

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219 
when the door goes down I get an email

allows us to see what's going on through
the<00:01:14.289> computer<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:14.979> then<00:01:15.640> if<00:01:15.939> for<00:01:16.509> example<00:01:16.570> we

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
the computer and then if for example we

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.770 
the computer and then if for example we
caught<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.649> non-target<00:01:18.280> bear<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:19.299> ability<00:01:19.750> to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
caught a non-target bear the ability to

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.080 
caught a non-target bear the ability to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
actually remotely open the door and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.929 
actually remotely open the door and
release<00:01:22.359> the<00:01:22.570> animal<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:24.159> actually<00:01:24.340> reset

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
release the animal and actually reset

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.310 
release the animal and actually reset
the<00:01:25.090> trap<00:01:25.329> so<00:01:25.570> we<00:01:25.689> didn't<00:01:25.899> have<00:01:25.929> to<00:01:26.079> drive<00:01:26.259> all

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
the trap so we didn't have to drive all

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.649 
the trap so we didn't have to drive all
the<00:01:26.619> way<00:01:26.649> back<00:01:26.740> down<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.579> that<00:01:27.820> location<00:01:28.299> and

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
the way back down to that location and

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.200 
the way back down to that location and
do<00:01:29.229> that<00:01:29.460> sometimes<00:01:30.460> we're<00:01:30.670> trapping<00:01:30.909> for

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
do that sometimes we're trapping for

family groups of grizzly bears and

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.739 
family groups of grizzly bears and
occasionally<00:01:33.159> we'll<00:01:33.340> catch<00:01:33.549> a<00:01:33.670> cup<00:01:33.909> and<00:01:34.119> one

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:34.749 
occasionally we'll catch a cup and one

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:36.569 
occasionally we'll catch a cup and one
of<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:34.960> most<00:01:35.170> dangerous<00:01:35.380> situations<00:01:35.829> that<00:01:36.399> we

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
of the most dangerous situations that we

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.760 
of the most dangerous situations that we
worry<00:01:36.789> about<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.299> having<00:01:37.659> a<00:01:37.719> cub<00:01:37.960> caught<00:01:38.200> but

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
worry about is having a cub caught but

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.950 
worry about is having a cub caught but
not<00:01:38.950> having<00:01:39.219> mom<00:01:39.520> caught<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:40.539> it<00:01:40.780> gives

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
not having mom caught and so it gives

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.200 
not having mom caught and so it gives
you<00:01:41.049> an<00:01:41.170> idea<00:01:41.310> ahead<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.429> time<00:01:42.640> what<00:01:43.060> you're
