00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
that's the side that's going to receive

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.110 
that's the side that's going to receive
my<00:03:06.900> tipper<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:07.859> if<00:03:08.280> you're<00:03:08.459> really<00:03:08.669> bothered

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
my tipper so if you're really bothered

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.599 
my tipper so if you're really bothered
by<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.480> rough<00:03:09.810> scraping<00:03:10.530> sound<00:03:10.889> of<00:03:11.159> the

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
by that rough scraping sound of the

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.119 
by that rough scraping sound of the
tipper<00:03:11.909> dragging<00:03:12.510> on<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.780> skin<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.709> softer

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
tipper dragging on the skin the softer

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.119 
tipper dragging on the skin the softer
you<00:03:14.219> make<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.579> skin<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.859> especially<00:03:16.859> the

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
you make that skin and especially the

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.860 
you make that skin and especially the
side<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.669> tipper<00:03:17.879> is<00:03:18.060> making<00:03:18.719> contact

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
side that the tipper is making contact

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.209 
side that the tipper is making contact
with<00:03:19.290> it's<00:03:19.469> going<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.680> make<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.829> lot<00:03:20.040> more<00:03:20.159> sense

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:20.219 
with it's going to make a lot more sense

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.909 
with it's going to make a lot more sense
to<00:03:20.609> treat<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.359> side<00:03:21.659> the<00:03:22.379> other<00:03:22.500> thing<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.799> if

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
to treat that side the other thing is if

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.580 
to treat that side the other thing is if
you<00:03:23.010> have<00:03:23.159> a<00:03:23.189> non<00:03:23.400> tunable<00:03:23.909> drum<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.870> wouldn't

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
you have a non tunable drum I wouldn't

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.860 
you have a non tunable drum I wouldn't
treat<00:03:26.430> both<00:03:26.699> sides<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.419> skin<00:03:27.689> because

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
treat both sides of the skin because

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.280 
treat both sides of the skin because
that<00:03:28.620> kind<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.370> waterproofs<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.419> will

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
that kind of waterproofs it and will

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.809 
that kind of waterproofs it and will
make<00:03:31.409> it<00:03:31.470> harder<00:03:31.859> to<00:03:31.979> wet<00:03:32.099> down<00:03:32.129> so<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.519> would

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
make it harder to wet down so I would

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.949 
make it harder to wet down so I would
wet<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.560> inside<00:03:34.819> to<00:03:35.819> slack<00:03:36.509> in<00:03:36.659> the<00:03:36.750> skin

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
wet the inside to slack in the skin

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.960 
wet the inside to slack in the skin
tension<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.409> non<00:03:37.560> tunable<00:03:38.009> Boram<00:03:38.340> also<00:03:38.909> if

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
tension of a non tunable Boram also if

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.479 
tension of a non tunable Boram also if

central heating on the drum seems really
really<00:03:54.030> tight<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.689> can<00:03:54.840> kind<00:03:55.079> of<00:03:55.139> get

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
really tight you can kind of get

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.170 
really tight you can kind of get
overexcited<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.099> over<00:03:56.459> treat<00:03:56.759> it<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:57.030> then

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
overexcited and over treat it and then

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.199 
overexcited and over treat it and then
come<00:03:57.509> the<00:03:57.989> humid<00:03:58.409> summer<00:03:59.099> time<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.759> can<00:04:00.030> be<00:04:00.180> a

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
come the humid summer time it can be a

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.729 
come the humid summer time it can be a
little<00:04:00.419> bit<00:04:00.599> too<00:04:00.750> floppy<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.199> if<00:04:01.349> it's<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.560> non

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
little bit too floppy and if it's a non

little bit too floppy and if it's a non
tunable<00:04:02.250> drum<00:04:02.840> then<00:04:03.840> you're<00:04:04.049> left<00:04:04.349> with

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
tunable drum then you're left with

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.979

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
much easier to wet it down with a spray

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.729 
much easier to wet it down with a spray
bottle<00:04:09.239> than<00:04:09.629> to<00:04:09.870> take<00:04:10.079> your<00:04:10.199> hair<00:04:10.379> dryer<00:04:10.590> or
