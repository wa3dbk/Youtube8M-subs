00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
I had a lot of trouble on finding away

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.700 
I had a lot of trouble on finding away
on<00:00:29.820> my<00:00:29.970> own<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.390> searched<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.170> internet<00:00:31.199> for

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
on my own I searched the internet for

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.799 
on my own I searched the internet for
some<00:00:31.859> tutorials<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.489> there<00:00:32.640> weren't<00:00:32.790> any<00:00:32.969> so

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
some tutorials but there weren't any so

some tutorials but there weren't any so
I'm<00:00:33.989> making<00:00:34.140> one<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:35.390> it's<00:00:36.390> actually

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
I'm making one for you it's actually

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.110 
I'm making one for you it's actually
very<00:00:36.870> easy<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.520> first<00:00:38.760> thing<00:00:38.910> you'll<00:00:39.000> need

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
very easy so the first thing you'll need

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.049 
very easy so the first thing you'll need
to<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:40.140> install<00:00:40.829> hamachi<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.730> probably

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
to do is install hamachi you probably

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.410 
to do is install hamachi you probably
have<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> already<00:00:43.250> join<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> network<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:45.239> make

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
have it already join a network you make

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.959 
have it already join a network you make
with<00:00:45.600> friends<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.770> make<00:00:47.370> everybody<00:00:47.730> join

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
with friends the make everybody join

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.400 
with friends the make everybody join
then<00:00:48.780> check<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.710> hamachi<00:00:49.980> network<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
then check if the hamachi network is the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.900 
then check if the hamachi network is the
first<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.770> priority<00:00:53.280> network<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.760> your

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
first the priority network of your

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.020 
first the priority network of your
computer<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.980> need<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.699> check

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
computer to do this you need to check

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.740 
computer to do this you need to check
your<00:00:57.149> network<00:00:57.960> connections<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.420> start

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
your network connections so go to start

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.820 
your network connections so go to start
and<00:01:00.930> type<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.469> bar<00:01:01.969> network<00:01:02.969> connections

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
and type in this bar network connections

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.649 
and type in this bar network connections
for<00:01:04.830> me<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.280> Dutch<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
for me it's in Dutch because I have a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.740 
for me it's in Dutch because I have a
because<00:01:07.380> 11<00:01:07.619> Belgium<00:01:08.270> but<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.390> English<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
because 11 Belgium but in English it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.280 
because 11 Belgium but in English it
will<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:10.080> network<00:01:10.530> connections<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.229> go<00:01:13.229> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
will be network connections so you go to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.899 
will be network connections so you go to
that<00:01:13.560> page

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.569 

this<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:22.860> press<00:01:23.100> alt'

this one you press alt'

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.590 
this one you press alt'
so<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.600> additional<00:01:25.200> options<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.600> then

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
so you get additional options here then

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.069 
so you get additional options here then
go<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> advanced<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.969> advanced<00:01:29.969> settings<00:01:31.700> so

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
go to advanced and advanced settings so

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.469 
go to advanced and advanced settings so
this<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.450> window<00:01:36.450> you'll<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.990> looking<00:01:37.289> for

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
this is the window you'll be looking for

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.350 
this is the window you'll be looking for
now<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:40.409> make<00:01:40.590> sure<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:41.039> can<00:01:41.159> join<00:01:41.399> a<00:01:41.429> game<00:01:41.729> on

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
now to make sure we can join a game on

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.450 
now to make sure we can join a game on
I<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.630> sentiment<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.380> one<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.219> have<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
I know sentiment and one you have to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.039 
I know sentiment and one you have to
make<00:01:44.610> sure<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.060> how<00:01:45.210> much<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.600> has<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
make sure that how much it has the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.800 
make sure that how much it has the
network<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:47.429> on<00:01:47.640> top<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.909> these<00:01:48.390> other

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
network that's on top of these other

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.800 
network that's on top of these other
networks<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:50.130> normally<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.789> will<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
networks so normally it will be in the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.679 
networks so normally it will be in the
third<00:01:52.020> place<00:01:52.349> you<00:01:52.819> just<00:01:53.819> click<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.509> use

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
third place you just click on it and use

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.219 
third place you just click on it and use
this<00:01:54.869> arrow<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.500> move<00:01:56.069> it<00:01:56.189> up<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:57.229> it's

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
this arrow to move it up so it's

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.219 
this arrow to move it up so it's
entirely<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.310> top<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.700> these<00:01:59.909> networks

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
entirely at the top of these networks

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.109 
entirely at the top of these networks
press<00:02:01.229> ok

exit your network connections and start

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.460 
exit your network connections and start

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
if it will record my game but it won't

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.270 
if it will record my game but it won't
be<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.269> quality<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> would<00:02:22.799> just<00:02:22.980> tell<00:02:23.130> you
