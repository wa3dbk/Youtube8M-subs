00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.090 
always wondered what what's this all
about<00:01:54.009> why<00:01:54.610> is<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.940> like<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:56.100> thought

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
about why is it like this I thought

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.359 
about why is it like this I thought
nothing<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.789> for<00:01:58.119> many<00:01:59.020> years<00:01:59.319> and<00:01:59.710> then

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
nothing of it for many years and then

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.669 
nothing of it for many years and then
got<00:02:00.670> talking<00:02:01.179> someone<00:02:01.569> about<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:02.020> Alegre<00:02:02.440> and

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
got talking someone about the Alegre and

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.580 
got talking someone about the Alegre and
my<00:02:03.280> mind<00:02:03.520> went<00:02:03.700> back<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.210> those<00:02:04.390> funny<00:02:05.380> old

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
my mind went back to those funny old

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.790 
my mind went back to those funny old
copies<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.869> had<00:02:07.869> a<00:02:07.899> bit<00:02:08.050> of<00:02:08.140> time<00:02:08.289> on<00:02:08.319> my<00:02:08.560> hands

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
copies and had a bit of time on my hands

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.550 
copies and had a bit of time on my hands
and<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.039> thought<00:02:09.270> I'm<00:02:10.270> going<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.509> see<00:02:10.869> what<00:02:11.080> what

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
before it got transformed into this 20th

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.560 
before it got transformed into this 20th
century<00:04:24.350> hybrid<00:04:25.460> which<00:04:26.460> which<00:04:26.940> is<00:04:26.970> equally

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
century hybrid which which is equally

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:37.610

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
evocative piece I think it's the sheer

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.620 
evocative piece I think it's the sheer
fact<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:40.860> it's<00:04:41.010> actually<00:04:41.160> quite<00:04:41.850> static<00:04:42.300> it

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
fact that it's actually quite static it

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.090
