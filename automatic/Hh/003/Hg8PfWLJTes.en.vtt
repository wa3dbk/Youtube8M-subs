00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.620
 hello we are students of the university 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.299
 tecnology de gutiérrez zamora yo hoy 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.520
 we have them to travel the 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.500
 dynamo performance the name of 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.400
 román gonzález during the series la 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.650
 energy and luisa 10 professor mister a 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.820
 worthy as it is an electric generator 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.339
 we allocate the energy transformation 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.140
 mechanical and electrical generating a 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.850
 current with climate whose attention 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.620
 depends on the speed of the motor 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.440
 by increasing the number of revolutions 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.390
 it also increases the attention is called 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.730
 direct current because it keeps 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.700
 always the same polarity the address 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.650
 of the group of electrons changed a money 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.960
 it gets used to turn inhibit 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.660
 where there is a constant movement and 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.180
 take advantage to generate that energy as 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.590
 for example in fallen windmills 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.110
 of water or on the tires of a 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.699
 bicycle the dynamo's advantage is that 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.489
 it wears out in the least of its 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.770
 internal parts and a disadvantage is that 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.180
 it has a significant weight and you have to 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.180
 connect it perfectly 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.520
 the crank is made with a wire and 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.230
 a pen cap a big game 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.230
 who recovered from a toy car 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.240
 a motor of a radio control car a 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.390
 capacitor that stores the energy 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.340
 the driver a horn wire and 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.970
 Power dissipators that are a game 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.970
 of leds 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.560
 to explain how the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.840
 dynamo it is necessary to refer to a 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.610
 feeding machine constituted by nigga 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.920
 and by a conductive spiral that 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.930
 moves between the poles of the magnet given that 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.270
 the driver turns is necessary to 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.270
 connections the güito is done through 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.730
 sliding contacts the brushes by 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.950
 so the connection that are generated be 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.170
 alternate that will become continuous to 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.540
 turn since half a turn can be 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.400
 reverse the connection between the rings and 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.560
 our feet shape each 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.870
 brush you go in relax m positive wave 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.990
 while the other half wave 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.990
 negative
