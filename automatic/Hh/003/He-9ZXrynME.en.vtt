was<00:02:35.950> kind<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.220> corny<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.940> think<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.720> my<00:02:37.959> opinion

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
was kind of corny I think in my opinion

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.039 
was kind of corny I think in my opinion
the<00:02:38.799> only<00:02:39.129> thing<00:02:39.519> is<00:02:39.549> he<00:02:39.970> was<00:02:40.060> being<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.780> little

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
the only thing is he was being a little

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.949 
the only thing is he was being a little
too<00:02:41.590> easily<00:02:41.829> like<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:43.000> guess<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.629> could<00:02:43.810> say

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
too easily like I guess you could say

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.270 
too easily like I guess you could say
that<00:02:43.989> he<00:02:44.590> was<00:02:44.709> being<00:02:44.950> easily<00:02:45.280> because<00:02:46.030> of

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
that he was being easily because of

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.069 
that he was being easily because of
she's<00:02:48.280> under<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.700> control<00:02:49.209> of<00:02:49.239> somebody<00:02:49.690> not

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
she's under the control of somebody not

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.660 
she's under the control of somebody not
actually<00:02:50.440> using<00:02:50.500> his<00:02:50.829> mind<00:02:51.099> because<00:02:51.400> in<00:02:51.549> my

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
actually using his mind because in my

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.610 
actually using his mind because in my
opinion<00:02:51.790> want<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.359> ask<00:02:52.510> my<00:02:52.780> strongest<00:02:53.230> points

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
opinion want to ask my strongest points

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.979

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
was his mine that he created you know it

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.740 
was his mine that he created you know it
was<00:02:56.140> pretty<00:02:56.349> good<00:02:57.310> with<00:02:57.609> them<00:02:57.819> strategy<00:02:58.599> and

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
was pretty good with them strategy and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.000 
was pretty good with them strategy and
such<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.200> since<00:02:59.379> he<00:02:59.530> was<00:02:59.650> just<00:02:59.680> being

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
such and since he was just being

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.910 
such and since he was just being
controlled<00:03:00.519> he<00:03:01.000> didn't<00:03:01.299> have<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.780> big<00:03:02.650> and

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
controlled he didn't have that big and

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.860 
controlled he didn't have that big and
that's<00:03:03.400> what<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:03.670> think<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:04.120> kind<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.420> messed<00:03:04.599> up
