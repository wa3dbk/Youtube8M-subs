00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
don't know if I just one handed but this

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.979 
don't know if I just one handed but this
is<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.160> looks<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.510> it's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
is what looks like as you can see it's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.779 
is what looks like as you can see it's
more<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.230> an<00:00:49.410> MMO<00:00:49.800> gaming<00:00:50.160> mouse<00:00:50.460> but

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
more of like an MMO gaming mouse but

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.090 
more of like an MMO gaming mouse but
should<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.719> pretty<00:00:51.989> interesting<00:00:52.110> compared<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
should be pretty interesting compared to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.090 
should be pretty interesting compared to
this<00:00:53.340> hopefully<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.829> I'll<00:00:55.920> do

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
this hopefully so I think what I'll do

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.849 
this hopefully so I think what I'll do
is<00:00:56.449> skip<00:00:57.449> ahead<00:00:57.600> cuz<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:58.379> think<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.739> do

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
is skip ahead cuz I don't think I can do

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.090 
is skip ahead cuz I don't think I can do
this<00:00:58.890> from<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.309> hand<00:00:59.870> anyway<00:01:00.890> yeah<00:01:01.890> that's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
