of<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.060> eye<00:02:26.349> so<00:02:27.349> next<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.859> liquid<00:02:28.249> eyeliner

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
of the eye so next is liquid eyeliner

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.309 
of the eye so next is liquid eyeliner
and<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:28.849> think<00:02:29.060> liquid<00:02:29.389> eyeliner<00:02:29.689> is<00:02:29.930> probably

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
and I think liquid eyeliner is probably

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.160 
and I think liquid eyeliner is probably
the<00:02:30.409> most<00:02:30.560> difficult<00:02:31.060> makeup<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.180> apply<00:02:32.510> the
