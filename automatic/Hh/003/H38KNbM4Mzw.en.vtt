barrier<00:02:58.750> um<00:02:59.100> we<00:03:00.100> tried<00:03:00.340> jumping<00:03:00.579> out<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.820> the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
barrier um we tried jumping out of the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.670 
barrier um we tried jumping out of the
map<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.420> we<00:03:01.510> couldn't<00:03:01.750> what<00:03:02.350> we're<00:03:02.500> thinking

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
map and we couldn't what we're thinking

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.280 
map and we couldn't what we're thinking
is<00:03:03.070> there's<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:04.030> sky<00:03:04.390> with<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.690> high<00:03:04.930> as<00:03:04.989> we

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
is there's the sky with the high as we

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.259 
is there's the sky with the high as we
are<00:03:05.500> we<00:03:05.769> are<00:03:05.980> at<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.459> hotlink<00:03:06.880> that<00:03:07.060> would<00:03:07.180> be

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
are we are at the hotlink that would be

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.400 
are we are at the hotlink that would be
to<00:03:07.390> jump<00:03:07.570> out<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.810> map<00:03:07.959> but<00:03:08.140> we<00:03:08.260> can't

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
to jump out of the map but we can't

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.780 
to jump out of the map but we can't
stray<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.829> far<00:03:08.890> because<00:03:09.160> we<00:03:09.370> can't<00:03:09.579> really

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
stray that far because we can't really

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.789 
stray that far because we can't really
see<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:09.970> barrier<00:03:10.420> so<00:03:11.170> if<00:03:11.290> we<00:03:11.380> found<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.650> way<00:03:11.739> to

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
see the barrier so if we found a way to

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.170 
see the barrier so if we found a way to
get<00:03:11.950> onto<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.340> building<00:03:12.670> right<00:03:12.700> beside<00:03:13.150> us

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
get onto the building right beside us

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.850 
get onto the building right beside us
then<00:03:13.750> yeah<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:14.860> we'll<00:03:15.430> eventually
