part of the world wall it's perfectly

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.330 
part of the world wall it's perfectly
fine<00:01:02.070> I'm<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.550> smooth<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:07.340> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
fine I'm just kind of smooth it out and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
fine I'm just kind of smooth it out and
if<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:08.939> perfectly<00:01:09.540> flat<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.229> fine

if it's not perfectly flat that's fine

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
if it's not perfectly flat that's fine
because<00:01:10.830> you'd<00:01:11.100> rather<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.610> excess<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
because you'd rather have excess on the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.499 
because you'd rather have excess on the
outside<00:01:14.240> then<00:01:15.240> too

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
outside then too

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.609 
outside then too
then<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:19.610> not<00:01:20.610> enough<00:01:21.170> is<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.470> you're

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
then to have not enough is what you're

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.179 
then to have not enough is what you're
going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> end<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.070> doing<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:25.619> say<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.979> can

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
going to end up doing and say you can

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.010 
going to end up doing and say you can
see<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.610> takes<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.180> little<00:01:27.390> bit<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.630> trial<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
see this takes a little bit of trial and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.980 
see this takes a little bit of trial and
error<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.500> especially<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.070> larger<00:01:29.400> hole

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
error here especially with a larger hole

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.910 
error here especially with a larger hole
but<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.200> want<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:32.040> good

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
but you just want to get a really good

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.429 
but you just want to get a really good
piece<00:01:34.920> over<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:35.850> got<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.439> so

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
piece over it and see now we got it so

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.780 
piece over it and see now we got it so
we<00:01:37.530> got<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> perfect<00:01:38.420> covering<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.600> hole

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
we got a perfect covering of the hole

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.670 
we got a perfect covering of the hole
it's<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.329> dry<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.960> usually<00:01:43.500> give

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
it's going to have to dry I usually give

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.410 
it's going to have to dry I usually give
it<00:01:43.799> about<00:01:43.890> an<00:01:44.130> hour<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.909> safe<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
it about an hour just to be safe and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.630 
it about an hour just to be safe and
that's<00:01:45.479> probably<00:01:45.930> overkill<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:47.220> once<00:01:47.460> it's

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that's probably overkill but once it's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.100 
that's probably overkill but once it's
dry<00:01:47.880> out<00:01:47.909> then<00:01:48.270> come<00:01:48.479> back<00:01:48.509> with<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.899> piece<00:01:49.049> of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
dry out then come back with a piece of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.039 
dry out then come back with a piece of
sandpaper<00:01:49.790> I'll<00:01:50.790> sand<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.329> down<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.810> it's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
sandpaper I'll sand it down so that it's

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.319 
sandpaper I'll sand it down so that it's
smooth<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.619> then<00:01:53.299> paint<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.829> paint<00:01:55.829> over<00:01:56.189> it

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
smooth and then paint the paint over it

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.399 
smooth and then paint the paint over it
with<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> same<00:01:57.659> color<00:01:57.840> paint<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.290> was<00:01:58.380> used

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
with the same color paint that was used

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.600 
with the same color paint that was used
for<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> door<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.159> shouldn't<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.549> able

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
for the door and you shouldn't be able
