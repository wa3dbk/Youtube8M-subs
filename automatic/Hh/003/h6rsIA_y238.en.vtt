00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.570
 to the whole world of the anses guide and 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.880
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.680
 multiplayer of grand theft auto 5 and 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.110
 this trick is to get the mode 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.849
 creator we can use it in games 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.860
 public with people within the 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.689
 game 1 for the truth that is very 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.980
 good to troll and well then let's 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.200
 start with the tutorial of this trick 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.180
 well all the first thing we will have 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.099
 what to do is to be in a game in 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.750
 forward with more people and what 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 we will have to do is put all the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.490
 money that we have in hand we put it 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.890
 in the bank it is worth if you have little money or 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.050
 less than 100 then perfect if you have 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.850
 You put a lot in the bank, and now 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.370
 what we will have to do is give the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.680
 start menu we go online and change 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.810
 of character as we see here then I 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.940
 I have two if you do not have the other one because 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.290
 secondary simply create it fast 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.329
 as I have done it is worth it believes this 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.130
 very fast and good because when 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.860
 let's be in the game what we will have 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.780
 what to do is give the mobile and what 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.939
 we have to do is take all the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.280
 bank money we will put it in hand 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.980
 worth everything or almost everything I have left some 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.140
 20 29 dollars if I remember correctly 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.880
 and well when you have all this what 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.070
 I'm going to cut a little bit what we have to 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.960
 do when we have very little money 29 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.720
 dollars approximately then we're going 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.730
 the main character this is worth and what 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.670
 we will do is take a car no matter 7 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.890
 the street or our we put some 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.600
 host not so to speak for us 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.400
 put the repair thing we have to be 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.600
 in the game onwards with more people 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.640
 it is very important that I am 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.010
 saying because if it's not going to work for us 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.390
 and what we will do when the menu of 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.520
 repair the vehicle as the hosts 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.710
 we have given then we give to the start and 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.540
 quickly to the X when it leaves 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.310
 less alert we wait three seconds 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.620
 and we give back to the X again 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.900
 when this menu is removed what we will do 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.560
 is to go quickly to online and we will give you 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.780
 to the creator this so to speak 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.340
 it costs a little bit I tried about seven 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.440
 times because what happened to me is that 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.510
 when I went up to the cloud and I went back to 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.700
 going down if it comes out that 's because it's gone 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.410
 bad but if the cards come out it's because 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.630
 It has gone well and trivializes about seven 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.210
 attempts and in the end it came out to me is question 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.710
 to practice a bit and more or less 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.140
 at the end it will come out and well 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.880
 we quickly give this menu to the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.010
 create the death game 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.750
 I recommend it to be quick because I did it 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.310
 again and it did not work for me and well 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.530
 to know if it has worked is because 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.440
 we have to see cars on the street that 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.090
 as you have seen, there was a vehicle 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.710
 orange then that means you have 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.940
 worked out what happened that was 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.280
 looking to see if there were more cars 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.200
 because I only saw that one until at the end 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.690
 We saw the victim here as well 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.100
 say a vehicle in motion and 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.660
 from someone who was controlling him 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.760
 because as you are seeing it is 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.610
 trying to enter the custom saints and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.230
 I'm blocking him with the barrier is 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.540
 the truth is that it's pretty funny 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.390
 because if we have people of our 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.130
 friends in this game in the public and 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.320
 how are you seeing the truth that 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.750
 it's pretty funny power or so 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.510
 tell it to cover the put cars or 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.220
 things about them putting guns we can 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.080
 put everything we can even move 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.570
 site vehicles there are as you have 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.460
 seen as they have exploded they have done 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.690
 a lot of things do not and the truth that 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.120
 he is quite handsome because it is as if 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.890
 We were the god of this world, not because 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.110
 we can create structures we can 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.330
 put it where we want and such and all this 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.460
 in online game as you have seen and 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.850
 Well, in the end what I did was 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.040
 pull the cable 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.020
 to remove the connection because I stayed 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.300
 caught charging all the time when 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.000
 I left the menu this and when I went to the menu 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.280
 of the campaign because I saw the view is how 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.200
 you are looking here from above not the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.700
 it's true that he's pretty handsome is a bug 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.440
 that I do not know how it was created I suppose 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.660
 by removing the connection, it has 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.950
 happened this but good we see here the 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.900
 seen from above that is pretty 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.790

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.560
