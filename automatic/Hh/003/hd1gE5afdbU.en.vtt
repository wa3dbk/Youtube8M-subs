advertisements saying no no modification

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.549 
advertisements saying no no modification
required<00:00:38.760> because<00:00:39.660> obviously<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
required because obviously I have to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.490 
required because obviously I have to
modify<00:00:40.980> something<00:00:41.280> or<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.000> won't<00:00:42.090> fit<00:00:42.500> just

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

thought I'd give you heads up in case
you're<00:00:44.730> dry<00:00:45.559> considering<00:00:46.559> getting<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you're dry considering getting one of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.100 
you're dry considering getting one of
these<00:00:47.129> cheap<00:00:47.340> e<00:00:47.460> aftermarket<00:00:48.030> ones<00:00:48.180> it's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
these cheap e aftermarket ones it's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.110 
these cheap e aftermarket ones it's
probably<00:00:49.440> better<00:00:49.620> off<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> rebuilt

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
probably better off you get a rebuilt

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.750 
probably better off you get a rebuilt
one<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.539> turn<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> core<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.640> at

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
one and turn in the core because then at

00:00:53.760 --> 00:02:04.150 
one and turn in the core because then at
least<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.329> case<00:00:54.510> will<00:00:54.629> fit

these<00:03:28.790> buttons<00:03:32.140> let's<00:03:33.140> see<00:03:33.230> what<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.410> work

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
these buttons let's see what to work

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.120 
these buttons let's see what to work
especially<00:03:36.290> after<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:36.560> nailed<00:03:36.830> everything

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
especially after I nailed everything

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.780 
especially after I nailed everything
with<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.460> bunch<00:03:37.670> of<00:03:37.820> that<00:03:39.580> white<00:03:40.580> lithium

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
with a bunch of that white lithium

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:50.140 
with a bunch of that white lithium
grease<00:03:41.030> Lube<00:03:48.580> it's<00:03:49.580> definitely<00:03:49.910> not<00:03:50.000> as

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
grease Lube it's definitely not as

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.830 
grease Lube it's definitely not as
powerful<00:03:50.330> as<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.050> standard<00:03:51.590> style<00:03:52.510> om<00:03:53.510> style

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
powerful as the standard style om style

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.890 
powerful as the standard style om style
but<00:03:54.080> it<00:03:54.890> works<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.400> that's<00:03:56.270> one<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.630> I<00:03:56.720> can

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
but it works and that's one that I can

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.650 
but it works and that's one that I can
see<00:03:57.080> for<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.560> field<00:03:58.340> water<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:59.770> have<00:04:00.770> fun<00:04:01.660> it's

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
see for the field water so have fun it's

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.890 
see for the field water so have fun it's
definitely<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.730> bad<00:04:04.730> project<00:04:05.330> for<00:04:05.480> anyone<00:04:05.720> with

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
definitely a bad project for anyone with

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.630 
definitely a bad project for anyone with
large<00:04:06.320> forearms<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:07.750> fat<00:04:08.750> fingers<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:10.280> if<00:04:10.520> you

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
large forearms and fat fingers so if you

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.280 
large forearms and fat fingers so if you
have<00:04:10.760> kids<00:04:11.030> maybe<00:04:11.600> you'd<00:04:11.780> like<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:11.960> enslave

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
have kids maybe you'd like to enslave

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.890
