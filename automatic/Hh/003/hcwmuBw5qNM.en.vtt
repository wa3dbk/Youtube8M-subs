people<00:04:37.199> understand<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.770> when<00:04:37.919> people<00:04:38.130> have

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
people understand that when people have

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.790 
people understand that when people have
these<00:04:38.669> like<00:04:39.000> outlets<00:04:39.720> for<00:04:39.930> things<00:04:40.199> it's<00:04:40.500> it's

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
these like outlets for things it's it's

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.710 
these like outlets for things it's it's
it's<00:04:41.370> not<00:04:41.550> causation<00:04:42.030> it's<00:04:42.419> just<00:04:42.630> a

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
it's not causation it's just a

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.590 
it's not causation it's just a
correlation<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.560> them<00:04:44.120> going<00:04:45.120> towards

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
correlation of them going towards

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.159 
correlation of them going towards
outlets<00:04:46.410> that<00:04:47.090> associate<00:04:48.090> with<00:04:48.120> them<00:04:48.510> so<00:04:49.080> if

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
outlets that associate with them so if

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.770 
outlets that associate with them so if
you're<00:04:49.290> messed<00:04:49.770> up<00:04:50.040> in<00:04:50.190> ultra<00:04:50.639> violent<00:04:51.060> yeah

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
you're messed up in ultra violent yeah

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.030 
you're messed up in ultra violent yeah
you'll<00:04:51.960> probably<00:04:52.199> play<00:04:52.500> violent<00:04:52.919> games

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
you'll probably play violent games

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.760 
you'll probably play violent games
because<00:04:53.310> that's<00:04:53.699> what<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.090> like<00:04:54.410> but<00:04:55.410> doesn't

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
because that's what you like but doesn't

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.409 
because that's what you like but doesn't
mean<00:04:55.860> that<00:04:56.010> because<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:56.400> play<00:04:56.699> ultra<00:04:56.970> violence

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
I'm going to be ultra violet right it's

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.070 
I'm going to be ultra violet right it's
the<00:04:59.669> predisposition<00:05:00.030> there's<00:05:00.780> probably

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
the predisposition there's probably

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.450 
the predisposition there's probably
already<00:05:01.260> there<00:05:01.410> to<00:05:01.620> play<00:05:01.800> them<00:05:02.010> I<00:05:02.100> mean<00:05:02.220> the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
already there to play them I mean the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.129 
already there to play them I mean the
article<00:05:02.850> says<00:05:03.030> it<00:05:03.210> perfectly<00:05:03.630> right<00:05:03.870> here

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
article says it perfectly right here

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.330 
article says it perfectly right here
which<00:05:04.320> is<00:05:04.440> kind<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:04.710> what<00:05:04.830> I<00:05:04.919> was<00:05:05.039> trying<00:05:05.250> to

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
which is kind of what I was trying to

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.279 
which is kind of what I was trying to
say<00:05:05.550> in<00:05:05.669> rambling<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.150> bit<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.510> yet<00:05:07.080> this

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
say in rambling a bit and yet this

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.020 
say in rambling a bit and yet this
pairing<00:05:07.680> almost<00:05:08.039> seems<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.490> trivialize

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
pairing almost seems to trivialize

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.909 
pairing almost seems to trivialize
domestic<00:05:09.660> violence<00:05:09.960> itself<00:05:10.320> I'm<00:05:10.560> like<00:05:10.710> toy

has never been firmly established

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.710 
has never been firmly established
I<00:05:23.220> mean<00:05:23.610> hell<00:05:23.789> they<00:05:23.940> should<00:05:24.090> be<00:05:24.180> given<00:05:24.479> out<00:05:24.600> in
