 to present 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.420
 what I know if they were not then I 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.390
 I am sure that there would be no Latvian 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.700
 legendary DJs and only then became 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.690
 understand that 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.940

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.609
 the parties are heading towards Berlin 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.850
 walls if walls I did not fall it would 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:00.930
 that society was no longer intelligent and 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.729
 jace culture she originated not from 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.049
 commercial need it arose from 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.049
 cultural needs 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.380
 here it was a political coup and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.110
 simultaneously musical revolution so 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.000
 it arrived the Soviet Union 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.160
 in fact, the rig became general for the whole 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.940
 elite of the soviet country hotbed of this 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.130
 dj culture 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.870
 Of course the first thing is killed 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.510
 reality they led something perfect 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.229
 new but on learning they influenced the course 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.240
 of events 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.610
 I was not the first to fall 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.130
 I will just follower at the beginning 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.630
 90s we were missionaries because 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.560
 that the disco was a massive new 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.410
 cultural phenomenon 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.330
 wow we create history despite 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.090
 on a political standoff between 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.080
 tips and america this whole culture for 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.770
 those who are looking for it exploded more 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.920
 eastern europe 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.860
 than west europe western public on 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.550
 in fact it was necessary to have it already 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.550
 get used to 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.240
 all this was possible only because 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.830
 motivation was due when you 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.690
 doing so heart 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.940
 people take off before you it was the last 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.250
 exhale but let's say such a romantic 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.840
 period 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.360
 saves after this thugs all this 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.150
 spiced up with human nature 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.730
 always young we changed in all 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.460
 relationship as possible for it 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.990
 Do not educate people DJing 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.580
 and dance music looks at it 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.980
 distinguish music is certain 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.560
 vibrations through the fact that we present 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.140
 time is playing all over the world and what it is 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.370
 everywhere there is nothing ended so 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.370
 worth talking about principles 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.230
 Think about it
