and and that's what I kind of like is
about<00:05:15.430> two<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:15.910> a<00:05:16.000> quarter<00:05:16.240> inch<00:05:17.430> height<00:05:18.430> of

I<00:05:36.130> think<00:05:36.820> this<00:05:36.970> was<00:05:37.150> kind<00:05:37.180> of<00:05:37.540> the<00:05:37.600> runt<00:05:38.050> of<00:05:38.200> the

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
I think this was kind of the runt of the

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.310 
I think this was kind of the runt of the
litter<00:05:38.470> of<00:05:38.910> that<00:05:39.910> series<00:05:40.600> that<00:05:40.630> you<00:05:41.110> know<00:05:41.200> he

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
litter of that series that you know he

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.410 
litter of that series that you know he
kind<00:05:41.560> of<00:05:41.710> puts<00:05:41.890> out<00:05:42.070> five<00:05:42.520> or<00:05:42.700> six<00:05:42.880> pipes<00:05:43.150> at<00:05:43.360> a

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
kind of puts out five or six pipes at a

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:50.310 
kind of puts out five or six pipes at a
time<00:05:43.660> and<00:05:44.260> some<00:05:45.270> physics<00:05:46.380> but<00:05:48.900> I've<00:05:49.900> always

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
time and some physics but I've always

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.400 
time and some physics but I've always
had<00:05:50.500> an<00:05:50.680> affection<00:05:51.010> for<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.460> underdog<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:53.020> a

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
had an affection for the underdog and a

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.710 
had an affection for the underdog and a
little<00:05:53.830> bit<00:05:54.010> of<00:05:54.190> imperfection<00:05:55.180> it's<00:05:55.390> just

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
little bit of imperfection it's just

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
little bit of imperfection it's just
fine<00:05:55.990> with<00:05:56.260> me<00:05:58.080> it<00:05:59.080> works<00:05:59.320> it<00:05:59.650> looks<00:05:59.680> great<00:06:00.100> I

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
fine with me it works it looks great I

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:11.390 
fine with me it works it looks great I
love<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:02.860> way<00:06:02.980> a<00:06:03.010> team

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.530 

so<00:06:11.940> my<00:06:12.090> changes<00:06:12.540> are<00:06:13.639> the<00:06:14.639> little<00:06:14.820> beeswax<00:06:15.300> on

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
so my changes are the little beeswax on

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.090 
so my changes are the little beeswax on
the<00:06:15.720> tenant<00:06:16.139> and<00:06:17.130> then<00:06:17.970> put<00:06:18.270> a<00:06:18.800> piece<00:06:19.800> of<00:06:19.830> vinyl

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
the tenant and then put a piece of vinyl

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.640 
the tenant and then put a piece of vinyl
tubing<00:06:20.520> on<00:06:20.729> the<00:06:20.880> bit<00:06:21.030> and<00:06:21.900> we<00:06:22.169> are<00:06:22.350> ready<00:06:22.560> to

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
tubing on the bit and we are ready to

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:31.940 
tubing on the bit and we are ready to
stop<00:06:27.979> so<00:06:28.979> I'll<00:06:29.070> get<00:06:29.250> this<00:06:29.370> broken

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:41.350 

you<00:06:32.700> may<00:06:32.850> probably<00:06:33.600> see<00:06:33.900> this<00:06:34.050> pipe<00:06:34.290> again

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.850 

as<00:06:41.870> far<00:06:42.110> as<00:06:42.139> British<00:06:42.470> goes<00:06:43.449> it's<00:06:44.449> good<00:06:44.860> it's

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
as far as British goes it's good it's

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.570 
as far as British goes it's good it's
not<00:06:46.069> uh<00:06:48.520> all<00:06:49.520> that<00:06:49.699> distinctive<00:06:51.580> sometimes

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
not uh all that distinctive sometimes

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.700 
not uh all that distinctive sometimes
you<00:06:52.699> don't<00:06:52.879> really<00:06:53.000> want<00:06:53.270> to<00:06:53.330> stay<00:06:53.710> sometimes

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
you don't really want to stay sometimes

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.070 
you don't really want to stay sometimes
you<00:06:54.830> just<00:06:54.860> want<00:06:55.190> a<00:06:55.280> good<00:06:55.400> solid<00:06:55.699> smoke<00:06:56.150> that's

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
you just want a good solid smoke that's

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.590 
you just want a good solid smoke that's
