00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.760
 what 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.760
 between these 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.360
 i 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.570
 and 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.120
 ah 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.200
 i 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.760
 d 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.100
 good for me on stage has always 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.890
 been a wonderful experience the 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.640
 stepping on a stage whether it's dancing 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.920
 singing and I love to dance that you take everything 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.140
 that you bring inside and you express yourself with your 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.480
 body 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.670
 well I went in basically because I am 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.590
 a large person who had not had 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.870
 this experience and I started by exercise 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.850
 but I found a nice group 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.130
 where I already tell you tomÃ¡s that a school 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.560
 of dance is like a brotherhood is only 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.660
 has managed to see is with aliens that is 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.100
 as the group is called among all 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.620
 They encouraged to come out mattered 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.060
 as he did but the case was to win 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.060
 fear level I think I did it 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:59.680
 good after sales because this 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.050
 festival for us is already a 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.390
 consolidation of five festivals for 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.340
 personal media of the academy are more 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.370
 of seven festivals then it's a 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.350
 huge job but the most important thing is 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.100
 that I personally want to see 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:28.480
 all the effort that makes us do 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:34.280
 all very much ahead be 50,000 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:36.910
 festivals are 22 for all 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.910
 but 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.530
 Apart from dancing, it's like freeing yourself from 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.949
 everything you forget you enjoy moving is 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.400
 very father and you can see it is the same 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.379
 I admire her a lot is one of my teachers 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.780
 pampered or brazil and I do not know you 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:04.010
 I want a lot 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.010
 often charity 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.020
 is that you can really support the 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.470
 family and then also the taste that 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.100
 have for the arts I presume that my 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.070
 goddaughter dance sings acts 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.720
 if ready, you have to support them well 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.980
 I want to thank all of my 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.680
 students for all the effort that 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.230
 did in this festival this year the 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.360
 truth is that I felt it and in good 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.920
 workers and good especially the 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.570
 enthusiasm and affection that we have 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.120
 all but with what was noticed in the 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.030
 scenario and well we did girls the 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.150
 truth is that I love them very much and that 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:46.220
 continue adding successes to friends there is a 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.220
 I want a lot and good, that's all
