00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
string the whole time so that's the way

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.729 
string the whole time so that's the way
that<00:03:05.980> works<00:03:06.639> that<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.329> goes<00:03:07.660> on<00:03:07.989> until<00:03:08.500> the

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
that works that that goes on until the

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.580 
that works that that goes on until the
change<00:03:09.010> comes<00:03:09.370> now<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.000> change<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.810> very

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
change comes now the change is very

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.740 
change comes now the change is very

simple - we're going to use basic chords
down<00:03:13.959> here<00:03:14.109> in<00:03:14.169> the<00:03:14.229> first<00:03:14.440> position<00:03:14.889> we're

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
down here in the first position we're

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.600 
down here in the first position we're
going<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.519> use<00:03:15.820> G

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
going to use G

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:38.360 
going to use G

D F C B flat F C G B flat F and then our
note<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:40.530> note<00:03:40.560> there<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.730> an<00:03:42.150> F

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
note and that note there is an F

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:53.270 
note and that note there is an F
II<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:45.569> open<00:03:46.569> D<00:03:46.719> so<00:03:47.519> that's<00:03:48.519> right<00:03:49.109> f<00:03:50.109> e<00:03:51.150> open<00:03:52.150> D

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280
