00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.930
 but 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:25.349
 spot pilot 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:28.560
 type 1 is practically one of the first 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:36.150
 serial samples like this now 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:38.940
 It looks like the length of the body is only about 25 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.160
 centimeters unlike previous 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:48.180
 models power 4 kilowatts 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.510
 4 4 and a half roughly wrong 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.890
 understood the main back also we 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.659
 see the cooler thermal fuse 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:04.400
 grounding on the front panel have 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:09.780
 button network minimum maximum 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.900
 mode of operation and 2 modes of operation 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.660
 warming up and fields that is to work 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.520
 polishing for warming up work we 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.210
 minimum maximum current regulates 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.990
 speed from this format is available 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.330
 switch delay and max 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:36.480
 duration from 0 5 was one and a half seconds 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:40.010
 and the regulator itself 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.010
 pulse duration 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.460
 In this unit, I still have an additional 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.250
 was restored to vows 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.380
 which is controlled by the mains voltage i 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.620
 asked and I did it in principle 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.300
 This option is available for all that is, 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.750
 you can be paid extra 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.160
 I see such a 1 meter network 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:08.860
 good 247 here now figures 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:15.030
 the weekend also has a feed light 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.030
 transformer protection standard cable 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:25.020
 how long 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.020
 meter forty meter sixty 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.950
 already worked for them tried 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.180
 work great so good 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.769
 alternative for those who start 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.609
 work in this body repair business 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:50.069
 why is a good alternative because 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.950
 he and such a compact device 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:58.000
 although pretty and weight and 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:02.099
 what can you do there transformer and not 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.099
 with aluminum beam like a chinese coin 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:10.530
 The main advantage of this device is 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.530
 its cost is about 13,000 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.700
 kit included 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:20.919
 clamp mass plate massive bullets and 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.689
 3 nozzles that is a standard set for 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:29.849
 minimum set so please 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.849
 love and delight as they say
