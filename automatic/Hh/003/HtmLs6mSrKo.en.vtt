00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.549
 well it it everybody knows I 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.650
 put 11 78 I hope you are well 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.170
 we meet again today for sugar 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.590
 is stingy in quingey so get the exo 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.260
 combination without spending money but 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.750
 before that a little riddle know 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.660
 how do you communicate the bees the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.850
 response right after so so turn this success 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.100
 already what I'm going to advise you 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.149
 is to throw it to two so with a 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.610
 person you know 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.890
 because for the little anecdote I 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.410
 take at least an hour to turn around 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.750
 these images because I launched in 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.910
 multi shocks person to connect and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.280
 guys do not know how to play 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 because the map just came out 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.180
 they still do not know much about it 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.710
 and it's really a mess not possible 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
 so what am I really going to do you 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.649
 advise his two shots to 2 then 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.719
 whoever wants the success radin will do me 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.119
 strictly nothing in the party so he 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.510
 will not even light a generator anything from the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.970
 everything and so the second player louis 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.580
 park we will have to make the maximum of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.860
 points and to do this the maximum of 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.020
 points are going to have to turn on them 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.580
 generators who take the money that 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.710
 ensures the walls all that species of 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.759
 small distributors and another 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.159
 technique that you do not know 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.500
 maybe you should not know that at the sleeve 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.909
 one you can put four balls on 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.430
 a biscuit sound with a knife stab 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.650
 eat his five balls followed by a 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.060
 knives and sleeves 3 his six 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.040
 bullets followed by a knife stab 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.020
 and all that will really allow you 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.930
 finally will allow the other player to 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.119
 earn a lot of money and power 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.299
 open the doors the fastest 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.310
 possible and so must know so there 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.869
 will have three doors to open 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.420
 whatever path you take 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.720
 there will be 3 doors the first at 750 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.329
 points 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.540
 the second at 1000 points and the 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.310
 third at 1250 points I cut you 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.149
 some passage on this video otherwise 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.159
 she was at least 10 minutes 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.840
 so guys have rowed before 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.710
 to open the doors so there you can 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.539
 to see that 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.780
 I was opened so this famous 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.340
 first door which was 750 points on 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.080
 then finds himself in the room 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.670
 power plant 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.930
 and again, there is 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.090
 parts and whatever is the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.340
 whatever the door while 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.959
 you take it's the same but will not 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.850
 after there will be a third 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.500
 so me you as you can see 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.930
 I stay at 100 his point I do not 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.489
 absolutely nothing of course you have the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.140
 right to shoot if you are in danger 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.390
 that you will fall to the ground this is 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.739
 not forbidden but I advise you to 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.410
 do that in fact so that our two 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.989
 players simply win a lot 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.580
 money waiting to arrive to the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.590
 end where we open the last doors and 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.230
 I have the exodus continues his I wanted 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.790
 thank you because here I have a 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.019
 video that has just exceeded 10 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.790
 billion it's true that it can 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.200
 look a lot and not a lot but 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.820
 for me it's really huge because 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.650
 know that I only have 500 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.760
 subscribers to the passage we can see that they 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.920
 have to eat the second door 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.630
 finally g500 I really aaron diderot 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.060
 saying it smells like the 450 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.350
 and well here I really wanted you 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.910
 thank you it's true that I do not have the 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.709
 mass of subscribers but I make I 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.230
 a lot of videos that exceeds 1000 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.180
 see and here it is my first video 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.370
 which exceeds 10 thousand view so I 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.450
 I'm really very happy and here we go 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.329
 I wanted to thank you that makes me 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.739
 really very pleasure there as you 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.049
 can see it we arrive in the room 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.910
 where there is no going on if I do not say 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.760
 nonsense here accelerated reloading 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.870
 there they will turn on the generator of 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.170
 heat is 100 points more 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.989
 and then there after we arrive near 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.180
 the room exos exoskeletons and there 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.459
 my child my friend I do not know I 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.200
 do not know this guy open the door 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.000
 he turned on the generator 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.350
 you can see I'm still at 100 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.299
 points to show you that I have 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.160
 Strictly nothing I'm stealing the exodus 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.500
 combinations and there normally your 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.579
 success will appear and you see like 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.230
 you can see it by loving each 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.209
 you can even arrive at the hall 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.400
 of exoskeleton 4-6 sleeves wanted to play 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.260
 very very very well and that will allow you 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.700
 during the dog's sleeve all 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.079
 just fingering a punch on 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.870
 the dogs and they will die 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:10.350
 and so here it is, well, it's friends 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.030
 finished for this video the the answer to the 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.060
 guess you know how communicates 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.079
 the bees it was by email that's m 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.280
 who will understand a tomorrow I make you the 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.470

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.860
 two level 20 weapons as requested 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.540
 then it will be Friday so it will be

 I have like and of earth and after I you 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.850
 will certainly make a complete video where 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.169
 I play so on this zombie mode 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.150
 maybe with subscribers I do not know 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.400
 not too much to see 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.139
 Well, here I go, let's you play 10 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.139
 to everyone else that at the lease 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.730
 so
