00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.299
 new video and good guys in this 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.360
 occasion we are with a mini tutorial 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.550
 for minecraft and 0.12 point 1 this time 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.530
 boys and girls I will show you how they can 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.089
 get obsidian this actually that 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.250
 it's a very easy task for people who 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.830
 I do not know how to do it, it's very simple but 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.900
 good to do this again today the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.910
 base of guys how to get the camera 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.760
 frontal in the third person in this 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.160
 ok ok version I tell you that this is not 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.019
 it is an option in itself in the game but 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.570
 we can achieve it with the help of a 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.579
 one application program sorry 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.500
 let us see files in our 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.570
 well then on our tablet in our 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.670
 smartphone cones as it is and in this case 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.710
 I'm going to recommend one that is and that's the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.360
 explore then in the description I leave you 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.129
 the link for you to find it is very 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.230
 good is very simple to use but good 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.120
 well here they see that I am in third 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.309
 person and I'm looking straight ahead but 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.469
 If I take it off, I'll tell you that it 's 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.660
 something temporary not before we go too 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.480
 we will see at dawn see how nice is the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.160
 dawn over there will be good dawn 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.799
 they see that the third person took off 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.390
 Well, we are as we would see 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.400
 normally but 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.490
 and activate it again happens that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.350
 removes them I repeat that it is something temporary and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.330
 it only works in the time that we are 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.070
 well not then to get them guys 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.590
 it's very, very simple to do it 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.350
 then we will be in third person not 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.790
 we will go here we go to third options 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.860
 person and after this what we will do 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.190
 it will be closing the game we left 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.470
 so we closed it on this part and we 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.330
 we will go with the application that I say 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.369
 that I recommend this one that is and is file 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.470
 explorer but you can use the one 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.539
 you want but that as long as you 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.580
 can not see the files so so 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.740
 we will go with the application and we 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.110
 we will go to a minecraft folder that is 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.509
 the game folder we will go to point 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.149
 We will go to minecraft and we will 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.030
 we will go in the options file dot txt 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.030
 we give it here we will edit it in this 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.560
 case then we would give it in and snow editor and 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.960
 because in our part we will go with 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.399
 game with bashir person see that then here 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.200
 is in 1 we will give in the three 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.090
 dots that are up here you 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.190
 we give in edit and we will go in this 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.500
 part where it says game under being 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.630
 person that we touch and erase and masters 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.150
 1 to replace it with a 2 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.190
 we go down this we give it back and what 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.470
 we keep very important this what 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.260
 we save and we can go out here 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.030
 we'll go to minecraft to the game so you see 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.530

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.300
