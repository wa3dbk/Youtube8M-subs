00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
purposely a foot of wire you may need

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.960 
purposely a foot of wire you may need
more<00:02:28.610> if<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.030> screws<00:02:29.360> are<00:02:29.540> farther<00:02:29.900> apart<00:02:30.970> now

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
more if the screws are farther apart now

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.460 
more if the screws are farther apart now
just<00:02:32.770> take<00:02:33.770> about<00:02:34.660> two<00:02:35.660> two<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.260> half

just take about two two and a half

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.710 
just take about two two and a half
inches<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:38.440> fold<00:02:39.440> like<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.940> wrap<00:02:41.480> it

screw go around twice I go like it going
around<00:02:57.620> again

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
around again

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.500 
around again
but<00:02:58.760> then<00:02:58.940> pull<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.390> back<00:02:59.660> and<00:03:00.049> wrap<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.160> around

the<00:03:02.510> wire<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:03.489> couple<00:03:04.489> times<00:03:07.330> you'll<00:03:08.330> need<00:03:08.510> to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
the wire a couple times you'll need to

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.759 
the wire a couple times you'll need to
take<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.900> pliers<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:11.510> grab<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.170> twist<00:03:12.410> it

take the pliers and grab it and twist it

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.340 
take the pliers and grab it and twist it
to<00:03:13.010> make<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:13.760> tight<00:03:14.030> make<00:03:14.690> sure<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.049> loop

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
to make it tight make sure the loop

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.840 
to make it tight make sure the loop
always<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.820> smaller<00:03:17.209> than<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.720> head<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.850> the

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
that is tight take the other part wrap

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
that is tight take the other part wrap
it<00:03:45.110> around<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:47.510> screw<00:03:48.140> on<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.470> piece<00:03:48.650> of

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
it around the screw on the piece of

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:58.770 
it around the screw on the piece of
furniture<00:03:49.010> twice<00:03:50.950> wrap<00:03:51.950> as<00:03:52.310> tight<00:03:52.790> as<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.150> can

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.090 

like<00:03:59.780> you<00:04:00.020> going<00:04:00.230> around<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.500> third<00:04:00.740> time<00:04:01.070> but

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
like you going around a third time but

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.090 
like you going around a third time but
then<00:04:01.940> loop<00:04:02.270> it<00:04:02.540> around<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.530> wire<00:04:03.740> that's

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
then loop it around the wire that's

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:15.370 
then loop it around the wire that's
coming<00:04:04.610> from<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:06.820> other<00:04:07.820> screw<00:04:14.110> little<00:04:15.110> tight

here<00:04:15.710> you<00:04:15.860> might<00:04:16.070> need<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.430> pliers<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:17.750> help

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
here you might need the pliers to help

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:30.760 
here you might need the pliers to help
nibble<00:04:18.470> ate<00:04:18.590> it<00:04:23.980> two<00:04:24.980> times<00:04:26.920> at<00:04:27.920> least<00:04:29.770> maybe

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
nibble ate it two times at least maybe

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:40.120 
nibble ate it two times at least maybe
three<00:04:31.310> is<00:04:31.460> good<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:34.610> take<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.000> pliers<00:04:38.800> in<00:04:39.800> as

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
three is good and take the pliers in as

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:53.460 
three is good and take the pliers in as
tight<00:04:40.520> as<00:04:40.760> you<00:04:40.790> can

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.590 

always<00:04:54.470> make<00:04:54.770> sure<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.940> loops<00:04:56.180> are

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
always make sure that the loops are

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.450 
always make sure that the loops are
smaller<00:04:56.960> than<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.320> head<00:04:57.530> of<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.770> screw<00:04:58.010> so<00:04:58.370> it

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
smaller than the head of the screw so it

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.380 
smaller than the head of the screw so it
can't<00:04:58.730> come<00:04:58.820> off<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.950> after<00:05:01.820> it's<00:05:01.970> all<00:05:02.060> tight

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
can't come off and after it's all tight

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.820 
can't come off and after it's all tight
cut<00:05:02.960> off<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.350> excess<00:05:03.770> leave<00:05:04.130> about<00:05:04.430> an<00:05:04.580> inch

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
cut off the excess leave about an inch

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.670 
cut off the excess leave about an inch
so<00:05:06.830> you<00:05:06.860> can<00:05:07.220> remove<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:07.880> easier<00:05:08.540> to<00:05:09.140> remove<00:05:09.470> it

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
so you can remove it easier to remove it

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.220 
so you can remove it easier to remove it
later<00:05:09.880> when<00:05:10.880> you<00:05:11.000> need<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.420> remove<00:05:11.660> to<00:05:11.840> move

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
later when you need to remove to move

pointed<00:05:15.260> areas<00:05:15.620> so<00:05:15.980> they<00:05:16.130> don't<00:05:16.810> poke<00:05:17.810> anybody

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
pointed areas so they don't poke anybody

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.990 
pointed areas so they don't poke anybody
and<00:05:20.750> there<00:05:21.530> you<00:05:21.620> go<00:05:21.860> because<00:05:22.520> it's<00:05:22.730> still<00:05:22.970> a

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
and there you go because it's still a

move a little bit go with the flow if

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.050 
move a little bit go with the flow if
you're<00:05:30.350> worried<00:05:30.590> about<00:05:30.710> it<00:05:30.920> banging<00:05:31.580> into<00:05:32.030> the
