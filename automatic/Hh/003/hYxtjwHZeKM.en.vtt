00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.769
 hello guys I bring you a new video and 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.880
 Well it took a few weeks without uploading 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.690
 videos because I have not had time 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.820
 expect that under the sound 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:23.980
 Well today I bring you a new video 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.320
 about how good what we should 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.590
 modify the interior of the chests or 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.140
 I mean expose a chest with 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.450
 some objects inside choosing the one 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.930
 be and choosing by choosing the position 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.210
 that we want good 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.800
 and you can say okay and this for 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.630
 that can serve us because I have made a 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.430
 small example here for if any one is 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.910
 making a map and looking at this 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.910
 video then 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.360
 you can do something kind me this is a 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.620
 little thing that I have created but 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.750
 you can do it however you want 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.880
 but this is a valuable idea 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.500
 we could do like that and make it appear 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.290
 this chest what 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.059
 You see if I see that there is nothing you 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.000
 placed the stone and the chest appears 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.820
 valley would have good at disposal 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.690
 these things with the lever to open the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.680
 door is worth then we go to the commands and 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.090
 well first of all I wanted to tell you that 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.250
 leave them in the description as always 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.020
 and another thing I wanted to comment on is that 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.510
 good to a subscriber is making me 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.140
 a map 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:29.080
 it's called Mr. ny thank you but hey 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.960
 is making me a map for good map 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.530
 a small sand is worth it because I have 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.940
 thought about uploading a tutorial of good all 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.190
 the world knows that many maps are 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.090
 they place voices of final bosses then 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.190
 he is making me the sand 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.620
 because I did not have time and I what 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.940
 I'm going to do is to create the subjects 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.970
 well I'm thinking a lot of things 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.530
 I 'm going to prepare it tomorrow and I'll tell you 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.800
 I will go up on Sunday surely if not the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.900
 Monday is good, let's go with the command, 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.860
 main thing that is here is the clock worth 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.570
 with a text for block 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.030
 well this basically what it does is 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.890
 test if there is a stone here it's worth it 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.800
 in the coordinates festoons minister is 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.240
 other material not going to give it signal 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.110
 you see that it does not give a signal but it is a 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.720
 stone the sign is worth 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.960
 and well this takes us is a tour to the very 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.350
 simple you'll see u and it would take us to 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.440
 next command worth is a set blog in 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:32.810
 these coordinates mini craft chest vale 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:35.510
 the air from the chest or replace is worth this 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.970
 means that the chest valer is the 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.020
 chest if that a stone with 0 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.240
 replace what you 're going to do 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.920
 replace it but cleanly you're worth 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.900
 will not do or know that sometimes 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.730
 when in creative when you break one in 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.280
 your rival when you break something because it falls 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.750
 European elite do not worth it 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.209
 will modify as well as if I broke it 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.920
 we are without taking advantage of particles and 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.020
 nothing is like something like that but if you pulled 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.350
 particular the law 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.950
 well, we 're still going to be a chest and 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.290
 here starts the command vale would be items 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.780
 and we already open the label items and inside 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.150
 of this we are going to open another paragraph with 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.460
 the labels and fingers that in this case 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.890
 I think it equals the earth 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.830
 song 80 worth this is a test of 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.710
 done to see if I could place 80 between 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.540
 64 the number that is going to be worth this is 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.930
 the idea the number that is going to be and the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.460
 slot where we want to put it 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.980
 then we are going to do the following 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.920
 well I caught a ragpicker 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.080
 one two three four five or six 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.990
 these are the slots go like this in order 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.020
 well and well then you can choose here the 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:46.190
 slots and you are worth this will be in the slot 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.250
 2 and of 5 extract slot 15 ide 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.990
 with vale reads from 1 that would be the stone 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.150
 is slot 14 and 69 extract the 11 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.490
 ok let's check if this is true 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.840
 because right now I do not know if to see 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:07.569
 ok if you see it here is the 14 slot 15 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.629
 ok so I'm going to pick this up 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.219
 good guys I do not know if you have heard 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.730
 very well I think that it is quite 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.919
 simple to learn this 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.070
 Well I will try to prepare the best 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.840
 can I'm thinking about doing 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.080
 a kind of silk a tiny sand 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.760
 but it will give enough play as I thought 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.600
 do that by right clicking on a 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.520
 leaf fall I know 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.600
 villagers to distract the 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.280
 zombies I know good , and think 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.450
 good guys this is all I hope you 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.220
 have liked the video if you have any 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.340
 video suggestion that some girls 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.380
 you say I appreciate it because I'm good at 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.790
 Sometimes I have no idea if I need your 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.920
 help to know what interests you and what 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.150
 I do not and well guys I hope that I 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.360
 like the video I'll let the commands the 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.360
 decision and nothing until another goodbye
