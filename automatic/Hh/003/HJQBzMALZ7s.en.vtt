in<00:00:02.909> our<00:00:03.030> video<00:00:03.330> review<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.080> swift<00:00:04.319> tech

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
in our video review of the swift tech

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:05.539 
in our video review of the swift tech
age<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:05.040> 20

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
age to 20

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.080 
age to 20
we<00:00:05.850> had<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.150> 20<00:00:06.960> degree<00:00:07.350> difference<00:00:07.620> between

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
we had a 20 degree difference between

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.530 
we had a 20 degree difference between
our<00:00:09.090> noctua<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.809> ff12<00:00:10.349> fans<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:12.150> swift

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
our noctua and ff12 fans and the swift

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.230 
our noctua and ff12 fans and the swift
tech<00:00:12.780> helix<00:00:13.230> fans<00:00:13.530> now<00:00:13.830> we<00:00:14.460> thought<00:00:15.030> those

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
tech helix fans now we thought those

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.849 
tech helix fans now we thought those
results<00:00:15.690> were<00:00:15.809> pretty<00:00:15.990> suspect<00:00:16.560> at<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.830> time

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
results were pretty suspect at the time

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.179 
results were pretty suspect at the time
but<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:17.340> rerun<00:00:17.670> them<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.970> few<00:00:18.180> times<00:00:19.189> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
but we rerun them a few times the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.830 
but we rerun them a few times the
problem<00:00:20.460> though<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.600> made<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
problem though is that we made a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.170 
problem though is that we made a
critical<00:00:22.109> error<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:23.130> were<00:00:23.279> using<00:00:23.490> naktu<00:00:24.060> as

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
critical error we were using naktu as

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.390 
critical error we were using naktu as
low-speed<00:00:24.720> adapters<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.800> all<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> fans

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
low-speed adapters on all of the fans

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.130 
low-speed adapters on all of the fans
and<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.970> past<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.539> never<00:00:27.750> been<00:00:27.900> an<00:00:28.050> issue

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and in the past it's never been an issue

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.900 
and in the past it's never been an issue
because<00:00:28.619> we've<00:00:28.800> always<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.369> run<00:00:29.519> knocked<00:00:29.789> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
because we've always just run knocked to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.240 
because we've always just run knocked to
a<00:00:29.939> fence<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.109> discovered<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.830> that

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
a fence but what we discovered is that

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.889 
a fence but what we discovered is that
while<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.640> low-speed<00:00:33.090> adapters<00:00:33.540> which<00:00:33.719> we

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
while the low-speed adapters which we

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.840 
while the low-speed adapters which we
thought<00:00:34.079> were<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.500> your<00:00:34.860> standard<00:00:35.399> sort<00:00:35.760> of

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
thought were just your standard sort of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.670 
thought were just your standard sort of
under<00:00:36.329> volt<00:00:36.540> from<00:00:36.719> 12<00:00:36.989> volt<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.290> nine<00:00:37.440> volt

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
under volt from 12 volt to nine volt

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.619 
under volt from 12 volt to nine volt
sort<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.190> adapters<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:39.210> thought<00:00:39.390> everything

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
sort of adapters we thought everything

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.650 
sort of adapters we thought everything
was<00:00:39.899> hunky-dory<00:00:40.850> what<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:41.940> discovered<00:00:42.480> is

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
was hunky-dory what we discovered is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
was hunky-dory what we discovered is
that<00:00:42.690> while<00:00:43.079> it'll<00:00:43.379> tone<00:00:43.890> these<00:00:44.100> guys<00:00:44.340> down

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
that while it'll tone these guys down

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.029 
that while it'll tone these guys down
from<00:00:44.850> around<00:00:44.969> 1,400<00:00:45.750> rpm<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.260> around<00:00:46.410> 1,100

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
from around 1,400 rpm to around 1,100

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.819 
from around 1,400 rpm to around 1,100
rpm<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.940> turned<00:00:48.300> swift<00:00:48.660> Tex<00:00:48.870> helix<00:00:49.260> fans<00:00:49.500> all

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
rpm it turned swift Tex helix fans all

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.779 
rpm it turned swift Tex helix fans all
the<00:00:49.860> way<00:00:50.100> down<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.460> 1800<00:00:51.239> rpm<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.079> 600<00:00:52.920> rpm<00:00:53.039> so

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the way down from 1800 rpm to 600 rpm so

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.000 
the way down from 1800 rpm to 600 rpm so
the<00:00:53.910> helix<00:00:54.270> fans<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.230> 20<00:00:55.649> degree

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the helix fans to get that 20 degree

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.770 
the helix fans to get that 20 degree
difference<00:00:56.219> we're<00:00:56.910> actually<00:00:57.030> running<00:00:57.390> at

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
difference we're actually running at

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.310 
difference we're actually running at
half<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> RPM<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> Noctua<00:01:00.359> fans<00:01:00.660> not

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
half of the RPM of the Noctua fans not

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.290 
half of the RPM of the Noctua fans not
only<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> Swift<00:01:02.579> tech<00:01:02.820> fans<00:01:03.059> were

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
only that but the Swift tech fans were

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.390 
only that but the Swift tech fans were
only<00:01:03.570> run<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> pump<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.559> full<00:01:04.830> speed<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
only run with the pump at full speed and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.060 
only run with the pump at full speed and
what<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:05.970> found<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.990> our<00:01:07.260> units<00:01:07.799> here

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
what we found out is that our units here

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.539 
what we found out is that our units here
may<00:01:08.580> actually<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:10.110> quite<00:01:10.470> optimal<00:01:11.310> in

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
may actually be not quite optimal in

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.070 
may actually be not quite optimal in
terms<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.909> their<00:01:12.060> performance<00:01:12.240> because<00:01:12.900> these

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
terms of their performance because these

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.320 
terms of their performance because these
are<00:01:13.260> early<00:01:13.470> samples<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.060> using

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
are early samples that are not using

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.899 
are early samples that are not using
Swift<00:01:15.750> Tech's<00:01:16.020> new<00:01:16.380> vacuum<00:01:17.009> filling

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
Swift Tech's new vacuum filling

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.020 
Swift Tech's new vacuum filling
procedure<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:19.020> basically<00:01:19.680> amounts<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> zero

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
procedure that basically amounts to zero

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.240 
procedure that basically amounts to zero
air<00:01:21.330> bubbles<00:01:21.750> inside<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.380> system<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.100> we

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
air bubbles inside the system so we

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.770 
air bubbles inside the system so we
might<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.520> had<00:01:23.640> air<00:01:23.880> bubbles<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.509> we're

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
might have had air bubbles that we're

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.240 
might have had air bubbles that we're
getting<00:01:24.869> caught<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> pump<00:01:25.680> causing<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
getting caught in the pump causing the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.910 
getting caught in the pump causing the
performance<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.939> degrade<00:01:27.590> with<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> pump

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
performance to degrade with the pump

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.200 
performance to degrade with the pump
running<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.280> full<00:01:29.430> speed<00:01:29.670> which<00:01:29.909> might<00:01:30.090> be

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
running at full speed which might be

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.179 
running at full speed which might be
part<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.509> why<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.840> got<00:01:31.049> our<00:01:31.290> best<00:01:31.590> results<00:01:32.009> when

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
part of why we got our best results when

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.130 
part of why we got our best results when
running<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.549> pump<00:01:32.759> at<00:01:32.909> half<00:01:33.299> speed<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.990> we're

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
running the pump at half speed so we're

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.030 
running the pump at half speed so we're
waiting<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:35.549> retail<00:01:36.450> unit<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.290> h2<00:01:37.710> 20

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
waiting for a retail unit of the h2 20

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.899 
waiting for a retail unit of the h2 20
and<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.540> actually<00:01:39.720> take<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.500> and

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
and so that we can actually take it and

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.460 
and so that we can actually take it and
retest<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.659> number<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.079> different

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
retest it in a number of different

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.590 
retest it in a number of different
configurations<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.670> we're<00:01:44.880> gonna<00:01:45.000> run<00:01:45.360> our

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
configurations so we're gonna run our

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.520 
configurations so we're gonna run our
noctua<00:01:46.380> fans<00:01:46.710> at<00:01:47.390> 600<00:01:48.390> rpm<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.350> how

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
noctua fans at 600 rpm to see how

added<00:02:24.310> something<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:25.150> our<00:02:25.270> test<00:02:25.510> bench<00:02:25.750> here

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
added something to our test bench here

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.900 
added something to our test bench here
that<00:02:26.110> we<00:02:26.200> didn't<00:02:26.530> have<00:02:26.650> before<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.610> check<00:02:27.820> it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
that we didn't have before so check it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.550 
that we didn't have before so check it
out<00:02:28.000> we<00:02:28.180> have<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.330> variable<00:02:28.930> fan<00:02:29.290> speed

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
out we have a variable fan speed

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.770 
out we have a variable fan speed
controller<00:02:30.040> in<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.340> front<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:31.060> we<00:02:31.270> can<00:02:31.630> use

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
controller in the front so we can use

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.530 
controller in the front so we can use

plug everything into the CPU fan header

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.350 
plug everything into the CPU fan header

that one we're gonna target 1100 rpm for
the<00:03:19.720> fans<00:03:19.990> so<00:03:20.260> this<00:03:20.620> should<00:03:20.830> give<00:03:20.980> us<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.160> most

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
the fans so this should give us the most

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.240 
the fans so this should give us the most
complete<00:03:22.210> and<00:03:22.390> clear<00:03:23.080> picture<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.680> how<00:03:24.190> the

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
Swift tech cooler performs now I'm just

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.440 
Swift tech cooler performs now I'm just
gonna<00:03:27.220> take<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.460> little<00:03:27.640> while<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.180> get<00:03:28.270> this

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
gonna take a little while to get this

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.760 
gonna take a little while to get this
done<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:28.870> that's<00:03:29.020> why<00:03:29.200> I'm<00:03:29.260> releasing<00:03:29.680> this

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
done so that's why I'm releasing this

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.710 
done so that's why I'm releasing this

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.200 
video so you guys know that it's coming
but<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.710> meantime<00:03:32.890> remember<00:03:33.550> guys<00:03:33.940> our

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
but in the meantime remember guys our

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.840 
but in the meantime remember guys our
result<00:03:35.140> with<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.830> performing<00:03:36.400> better<00:03:36.700> than

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
result with it performing better than

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.030 
result with it performing better than
everything<00:03:37.240> else<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:37.810> still<00:03:38.410> valid<00:03:38.680> because

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
everything else is still valid because

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.060 
everything else is still valid because
this<00:03:39.960> engineering<00:03:40.960> sample<00:03:41.440> unit<00:03:41.740> had

this engineering sample unit had
everything<00:03:42.340> going<00:03:42.640> against<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:43.660> with<00:03:44.410> the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
everything going against it and with the
