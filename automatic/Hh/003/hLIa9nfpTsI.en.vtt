00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
what we can do we can play it and where

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.910 
what we can do we can play it and where
we<00:02:36.850> feel<00:02:37.120> we<00:02:37.300> want<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.810> start<00:02:38.200> probably

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
we feel we want it to start probably

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.040 
we feel we want it to start probably
about<00:02:39.280> there<00:02:39.550> I<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.910> place<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.510> marker

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
about there I can place this marker

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.920 
about there I can place this marker
point<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.700> can<00:02:42.730> drag<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.210> along<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:43.600> fill

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
point and I can drag this along and fill

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.480 
point and I can drag this along and fill
yet<00:02:44.230> that's<00:02:44.470> long<00:02:44.680> enough<00:02:44.710> and<00:02:45.220> that's<00:02:45.340> where

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
yet that's long enough and that's where

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.350 
yet that's long enough and that's where
I<00:02:45.520> want<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.880> end

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
I want it to end

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.480 
I want it to end
so<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:46.900> gain<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.170> hit<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.560> market<00:02:47.860> point<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.310> say

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
so I gain I hit the market point and say

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.090 
so I gain I hit the market point and say
ok<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:49.690> that's<00:02:49.870> actually<00:02:50.050> made<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.800> video

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
ok so that's actually made that video

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.400 
ok so that's actually made that video
clip<00:02:51.340> shorter<00:02:51.850> let's<00:02:52.750> see<00:02:52.900> what<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.170> do

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
clip shorter let's see what I can do

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.940 
clip shorter let's see what I can do
with<00:02:53.560> this<00:02:53.650> one<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:56.340> play<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:58.950> that's

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
with this one I can play that that's

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.980 
with this one I can play that that's
probably<00:03:00.790> ok<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:03.970> this<00:03:04.150> one<00:03:04.450> then<00:03:04.750> I

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
probably ok it is and on this one then I

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.660 
probably ok it is and on this one then I
can<00:03:05.650> gain<00:03:06.340> trim<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:07.620> drag<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:09.010> probably

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
can gain trim it drag it to probably

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.699 
can gain trim it drag it to probably
want<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.000> start<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.420> about<00:03:10.630> there<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:13.530> end<00:03:14.530> it

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
want to start it about there and end it

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.560 
want to start it about there and end it
about<00:03:14.920> there<00:03:15.160> looks<00:03:15.910> fine<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.300> me

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
can just quickly play that so we start

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.600 
can just quickly play that so we start
with<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.130> an<00:03:21.610> image<00:03:23.160> we've<00:03:24.160> got<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.310> train
