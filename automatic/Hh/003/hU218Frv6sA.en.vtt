basically what this is doing is it's

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.990

seconds<00:00:21.539> or<00:00:21.689> three<00:00:21.960> seconds<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.560> turns<00:00:23.070> off

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.350 

so<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.010> took<00:03:25.099> the<00:03:25.370> rubber<00:03:25.579> piece<00:03:25.849> off<00:03:26.090> right

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.679 
so I took the rubber piece off right
here<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.769> can<00:03:27.920> see<00:03:28.189> that<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.970> wire<00:03:29.329> got

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
here and you can see that the wire got

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.039 
here and you can see that the wire got
burnt<00:03:30.650> off<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:31.310> this<00:03:32.269> is<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.480> common<00:03:32.870> problem

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
burnt off and this is a common problem

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:41.089 
burnt off and this is a common problem
with<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.409> HP<00:03:33.920> monitors<00:03:34.730> LCD<00:03:35.239> monitors

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:59.530 

so<00:03:41.879> you<00:03:41.969> just<00:03:42.120> solder<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.599> back<00:03:42.780> on

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.210 

now<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.569> hit<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.959> up<00:04:01.050> with<00:04:01.200> some<00:04:01.349> hot<00:04:01.530> glue<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:02.099> it

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
now I hit it up with some hot glue so it

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.650 
now I hit it up with some hot glue so it
doesn't<00:04:02.489> work<00:04:02.640> on<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:03.000> metal<00:04:03.150> right<00:04:03.420> there

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
doesn't work on the metal right there

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.110 
doesn't work on the metal right there
okay<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:05.040> let's<00:04:05.190> go<00:04:05.280> ahead<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.519> plug<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.970> in

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
okay so let's go ahead and plug it in

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.250 
okay so let's go ahead and plug it in
got<00:04:06.810> plugged<00:04:07.050> in<00:04:07.230> right<00:04:08.220> here<00:04:08.840> if<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:09.989> doesn't

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
got plugged in right here if it doesn't

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.920 
got plugged in right here if it doesn't
turn<00:04:10.349> off<00:04:10.530> after<00:04:10.739> two<00:04:11.069> seconds<00:04:11.580> then<00:04:12.540> we<00:04:12.750> know

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
turn off after two seconds then we know

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.350 
turn off after two seconds then we know
we're<00:04:13.170> in<00:04:13.260> good<00:04:13.440> shape<00:04:14.030> they're<00:04:15.030> gonna<00:04:15.120> bolt

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
we're in good shape they're gonna bolt

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.969 
we're in good shape they're gonna bolt
turning<00:04:15.690> on<00:04:16.370> one<00:04:17.419> two<00:04:18.500> three<00:04:19.609> four<00:04:20.609> five<00:04:21.590> six<00:04:22.590> I

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
turning on one two three four five six I

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.400 
turning on one two three four five six I
would<00:04:23.820> have<00:04:23.940> turned<00:04:24.030> off<00:04:24.210> by<00:04:24.419> now<00:04:24.570> so

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
would have turned off by now so

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.379 
would have turned off by now so
basically<00:04:25.889> this<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.250> common<00:04:26.580> fix<00:04:26.760> for<00:04:26.970> HP
