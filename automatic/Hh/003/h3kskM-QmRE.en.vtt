00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.309
 there must never give false images by the use of a catalog 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.140
 in which you import exported to rework your photos 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.969
 your trainer briefly belly commented on m to open a catalog that 

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:29.359
 is actually a file in the format a3 it is made 3 galette 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.430
 the growls and especially information and data to lay an ax at 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.520
 through so-called catalogs 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.920
 a catalog is a file in the format l m seat and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.719
 in other words, the big catalog 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.910
 which is therefore a format specific to the chronic 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.000
 and this through this file format you can handle all 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.440
 related havre post information when you would import them 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.480
 and I have here with me several photos so I bring romance soulac 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.210
 as we can see 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.090
 currently 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.750
 if I scroll here 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.460
 at the level of my movie fix 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.310
 and I can see that especially in the upper left corner the 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.770
 young people not from the catalog 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.790
 that I created 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.690
 and in this imported catalog account export different pictures catalog 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.100
 that I can as well as to the rich we specified 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.680
 but when you have hundreds or even thousands of pictures it is 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.790
 sometimes more convenient to organize 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.780
 in the form of several different catalogs and know that lightroom does 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.860
 covers only one catalog at a time in the case so you've arranged the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.860
 information and data that you will have to bring to your photos 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.740
 you explain how created were registered in the catalog just 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.520
 just go to the file 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.590
 you see that you have various options new catalog to the true the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.660
 catalog open recent files 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.390
 when I select new catalog simply a box of 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.750
 dialogue appears and I can come and create my own catalogs that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.790
 materialized by creating a folder I can enter a first name 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.180
 and lightroom actually revives with a catalog that is empty of image for 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.650
 Nothing 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.470
 and I see that in the upper left corner 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.880
 he has a character catalog gift that I created 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.960
 now just do not bring 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.100
 all the photographs that interest you 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.360
 i'm going to go up the aids level i'll why not selected a 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.389
 directory in its entirety by selecting this one 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.359
 and play click bring all the photos in the selected folder 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.139
 I will click on bring to validate 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.259
 and so I integrate my images inside this catalog 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.659
 in this catalog obviously people the opportunity 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.839
 to create collections arkoun records and so on 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.519
 and know so 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.719
 this catalog 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.930
 I can visualize in the central part I have to import any time to import 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.689
 or export different photos 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.019

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.439
