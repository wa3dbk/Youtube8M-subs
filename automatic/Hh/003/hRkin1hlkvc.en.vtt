00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 so hello everyone i'm sandy and 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.160
 today's topic of the video will be such 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.050
 concept as calibration that is who is not 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.090
 knows what calibration is 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.340
 passing 10 games 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.500
 ranking after you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.470
 the opportunity to play ranked and 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.240
 that is, it used to be so you type 13 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.789
 level then opportunity 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.830
 calibrated that is, you need to go there 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.140
 wounds of new games or solo or groups but 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.029
 here is clear solo dance party more precisely 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.770
 without party groups the party 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.440
 and then you get a rating 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.210
 held principle already everyone knows now 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.879
 this system was reworked in terms of 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.460
 no need to recruit 13 round and need to have 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.960
 forty fights that is my friend 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.930
 Caliber recently and he had to 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.670
 play 120 fights to score 13 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.800
 level that is an hour it's all a lot of other 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.920
 three times cut it means that 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.640
 there will be more reviews and it will cut 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.540
 life to those people who abuzz account 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.479
 Ie now in high skill rating 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.430
 to get a lot easier that you need to 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 hit high skill rating here at the very 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.860
 I don’t have much to do with my mind 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.990
 made sure step number one goes well 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.009
 losing these not losing we play 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.369
 games so that we have 40 games a step number 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.869
 two we open the calibration of 40 games 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.479
 and 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.939
 we are calibrated exclusively on such a hero 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.670
 how is zeus why will i tell zeus later 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.259
 step number three 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.590
 playing for zeus we always go mid 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.290
 get level faster and press bye 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.009
 before the ultimate in principle it sounds 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.409
 pretty funny if you say so 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.659
 have an experience of playing zeus and you know how 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.240
 Faster artifacts to faster 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.299
 collect aganim and refresher then of course 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.630
 until you have to press the ult at all 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.119
 principle than when you press Ultimate 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.500
 you cause damage to all enemy heroes 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.070
 principle captain obvious prompted 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.560
 and the more damage you do the higher 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.350
 again calibrates the system have now 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.680
 shafts has developed such a small aspect 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.900
 that whoever damages more and more 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.720
 skill let's say that so you 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.430
 hesitate on the rail and at the end 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.790
 calibration you will have haitham mayor 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.830
 How much petka this is definitely not long ago 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.770
 familiar and you still calibrated with arrows 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.780
 I bought aganim and refresher if I had time 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.940
 Refresh collect bad win 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.340
 win he had a win rate of 55 i.e. 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.530
 five won 5 lost and he still 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.650
 partly moved to skywrath'e neji and 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.959
 I will receive 5k mmr that is, if you want 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.020
 to contend with torches let's say 5k i 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.640
 also high skill but certainly not as 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.239
 will fall above while as a very high skill 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.720
 it's just high skill to want that 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.760
 shnyagu zeus and principle should ride 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.370
 in theory, but if not ride in 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.220
 comments write what's the problem but in 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.200
 principle, all this is to lead 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.260
 ks that we go through 40 battles no matter who 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.090
 then calibrate for the hearts of 10 games 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.890
 Ultimate through while applying how 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.450
 can be more damage why zeus exactly 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.170
 because it is a hero who deals 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.940
 most damage and it doesn't depend so much 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.100
 Strongly farm to hit this 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.489
 the most skill from take for example by 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.549
 Dotauff statistics and top 2 damager it 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.769
 spectrum because the cathedral in the mouth and 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.870
 hitting one button hound you put 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:51.250
 so much demage just wild 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.160
 support immediately begin to crumble here 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.590
 such weight just pressed this button all 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.720
 multilaterally one must have the same radiance 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:05.019
 the most silencer with aganim that is like u 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.250
 you don’t give you a coin 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.410
 global am damage 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.019
 only you appear aganim you 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.269
 start the course at the same level 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.720
 but how much will you ride on hawala from 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.790
 global principle here are such tricks and 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.789
 such secrets as calibrate well 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.639
 in principle, this is a system now let's say 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.919
 It is faltering in the sense that these are 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.719
 pass such situations that are calibrated 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.759
 very high about the heart 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:31.830
 Well, actually I wanted with you this 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.969
 share so that anyone interested 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.330
 get on 5k mm 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:40.389
 dare to go ahead what have you got 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.120
 or already buzili here recently we almost 682 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.240
 describe in the commentary what of this 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.629
 It turned out it was sandy and all the luck in 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.629
 dota 2
