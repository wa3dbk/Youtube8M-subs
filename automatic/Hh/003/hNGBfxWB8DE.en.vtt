00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
doesn't revolve any transcoding or

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.290 
doesn't revolve any transcoding or
anything<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.789> you're<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:50.969> gonna<00:00:51.090> be

and therefore you don't lose any quality
and<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> lot<00:00:55.620> faster<00:00:55.649> than<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.430> had<00:00:56.579> a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
oh my length I'm looking for here one

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.040 
oh my length I'm looking for here one
minute<00:02:16.770> 55<00:02:17.340> seconds<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.570> if<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.780> go<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.960> my

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
minute 55 seconds and if I go to my

minute 55 seconds and if I go to my

exactly<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.610> same<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:24.120> think<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.200> because

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
exactly the same I think this is because

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.230 
exactly the same I think this is because
I'm<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.740> recently<00:02:26.160> paid<00:02:26.580> user<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.030> I'm<00:02:27.090> using

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
I'm a recently paid user and I'm using

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.850 
I'm a recently paid user and I'm using
the<00:02:27.480> Game<00:02:27.660> Capture<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.290> I'm<00:02:28.440> playing<00:02:28.620> my<00:02:28.710> game

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the Game Capture and I'm playing my game

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.100 
the Game Capture and I'm playing my game
in<00:02:28.980> full-screen<00:02:29.400> when<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.270> start<00:02:30.570> recording

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
in full-screen when I start recording

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.260 
in full-screen when I start recording
the<00:02:31.470> game<00:02:31.620> closes<00:02:32.280> out<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.760> second<00:02:33.090> then<00:02:33.180> I

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
the game closes out for a second then I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.700 
the game closes out for a second then I
have<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.510> reopen<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.050> game<00:02:34.230> again

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
have to reopen the game again

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.180 
have to reopen the game again
so<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.250> lose<00:02:35.520> video<00:02:35.880> for<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.210> second<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.950> think

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
so I lose video for a second and I think

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.620 
so I lose video for a second and I think
that's<00:02:38.370> what's<00:02:38.520> causing<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.940> slight<00:02:39.300> change

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
that's what's causing that slight change

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.300 
that's what's causing that slight change
but<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:39.900> might<00:02:40.200> be<00:02:40.380> there<00:02:40.830> no<00:02:40.980> matter<00:02:41.100> what

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
but that might be there no matter what

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.530 
but that might be there no matter what
kind<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.520> recording<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:41.940> do<00:02:42.030> am<00:02:42.150> i<00:02:42.300> exactly

real<00:04:31.560> quick<00:04:31.710> I'll<00:04:31.830> let<00:04:31.950> you<00:04:32.010> know<00:04:32.160> just<00:04:32.520> an

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
real quick I'll let you know just an

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.370 
real quick I'll let you know just an
injection<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:34.730> xsplit<00:04:35.730> is<00:04:35.850> a<00:04:35.880> streaming

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
injection that xsplit is a streaming

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.690 
injection that xsplit is a streaming
program<00:04:37.380> that's<00:04:37.800> its<00:04:37.980> design<00:04:38.310> that's<00:04:38.550> its

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
program that's its design that's its

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.230 
program that's its design that's its
focus<00:04:39.080> not<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.440> reporting<00:04:41.280> program<00:04:41.640> it's

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
focus not a reporting program it's

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.370 
focus not a reporting program it's
recording<00:04:42.780> live<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.920> encoding<00:04:44.820> in<00:04:45.380> h.264

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
recording live and encoding in h.264

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.970 
recording live and encoding in h.264
which<00:04:46.410> is<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.710> lossy<00:04:47.100> codec<00:04:47.490> so<00:04:48.330> if<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.980> capture

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
which is a lossy codec so if you capture

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.420 
which is a lossy codec so if you capture
this<00:04:50.100> lossless<00:04:51.080> lossy<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.320> then<00:04:53.010> you<00:04:53.130> go<00:04:53.280> and

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
this lossless lossy and then you go and

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.150 
this lossless lossy and then you go and
edit<00:04:53.790> it<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.090> encode<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:54.960> again<00:04:55.290> that<00:04:56.040> means

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
edit it and encode it again that means

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.640 
edit it and encode it again that means
you're<00:04:56.340> losing<00:04:56.610> quality<00:04:56.820> twice<00:04:57.360> so<00:04:58.350> for<00:04:58.500> some

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
you're losing quality twice so for some

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.320 
you're losing quality twice so for some
people<00:04:58.680> that<00:04:58.980> may<00:04:59.280> not<00:04:59.460> matter<00:04:59.670> but<00:05:00.030> if<00:05:00.120> you're

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
people that may not matter but if you're

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.240 
people that may not matter but if you're
really<00:05:01.050> focused<00:05:01.470> on<00:05:01.560> producing<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.100> highest

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
really focused on producing the highest

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.640 
really focused on producing the highest
quality<00:05:02.430> content<00:05:03.270> then<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.110> want<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.320> use<00:05:04.380> a

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
quality content then you want to use a

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.020 
quality content then you want to use a
capture<00:05:05.130> program<00:05:05.730> like<00:05:06.390> maybe<00:05:06.930> craps

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
capture program like maybe craps

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.290 
capture program like maybe craps
ZD<00:05:09.030> soft<00:05:09.770> there's<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.700> many<00:05:11.850> of<00:05:12.060> them<00:05:12.090> out

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
ZD soft there's so many of them out

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.910 
ZD soft there's so many of them out
there<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:12.510> how<00:05:12.630> I<00:05:12.660> can<00:05:12.840> even<00:05:13.080> start<00:05:13.650> to<00:05:13.710> name

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
there and how I can even start to name

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.190 
there and how I can even start to name
them<00:05:14.070> all<00:05:14.190> I'm<00:05:14.610> actually<00:05:14.820> quite<00:05:15.150> fond<00:05:15.390> of<00:05:15.540> I

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
xsplit is a really great program but I

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.790 
xsplit is a really great program but I
just<00:05:24.570> kind<00:05:24.720> of<00:05:24.750> throw<00:05:24.870> in<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.050> not<00:05:25.200> me<00:05:25.350> for
