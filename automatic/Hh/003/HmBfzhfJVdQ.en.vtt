00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.590
 hi today we are going to see how to make the point 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.629
 of rice the point of rice is achieved 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.419
 making a point of the right and another of 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.330
 reverse but alternating is to say if in the 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:22.910
 previous turn we did reverse then in 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.369
 we are doing right so they are staying 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.669
 like these little dots that you see 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.219
 as always to facilitate sewing 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.010
 we are going to weave the first point we are going to 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.770
 leave without knitting and the last point what 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.129
 we will always do the right will 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.129
 do what 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.320
 the first one we passed without doing as 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.120
 you always see in this there is a kind of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.610
 bulge that is the point of the reverse then 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.580
 here we do right to the contrary 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.020
 we already started reverse like this until the end 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.020
 alternating right 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.439
 right backwards like that until the end 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.400
 right and we end up in reverse because the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.030
 last point I will knit always at 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.250
 it just right this setback as the 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.680
 always to sew what they fit 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.000
 the seams do not have the right but 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.000
 we have finished in reverse then 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.630
 here we will start also in reverse 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.270
 we always start at the same point in 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.219
 that we finished 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.219
 and so they will be contrary 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.540
 perhaps 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.380
 straight 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.380
 alves 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.060
 straight 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.020
 3 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.340
 straight 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.340
 reverse 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.019
 straight 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.019
 the last one we always protect the right 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.030
 you see and in the opposite turn 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.950
 which we have woven the penultimate that in 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.420
 that we have woven in law by the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.880
 Back turn will be reversed 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.480
 then we will start again here by 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.480
 straight 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.540
 It is worth looking at how it is 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.750
 see you later
