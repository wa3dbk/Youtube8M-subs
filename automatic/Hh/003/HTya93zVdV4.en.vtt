00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
every Windows and disk management I

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.160 
every Windows and disk management I
don't<00:00:26.039> know<00:00:26.189> about<00:00:26.340> Windows<00:00:26.880> XP<00:00:27.420> I'm<00:00:27.720> not<00:00:27.960> sure

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
don't know about Windows XP I'm not sure

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.279 
don't know about Windows XP I'm not sure
if<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.470> has<00:00:28.529> disk<00:00:28.980> management<00:00:29.630> but<00:00:30.630> anyway

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
if this has disk management but anyway

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.520 
if this has disk management but anyway
you<00:00:32.160> go<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.489> your<00:00:32.610> main<00:00:32.820> hard<00:00:33.239> drive<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.200> my

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
you go on your main hard drive and my

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.250 
you go on your main hard drive and my
main<00:00:34.800> hard<00:00:35.070> drive<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> windows<00:00:35.910> 7<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.230> you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
main hard drive is the windows 7 so you

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.360 
main hard drive is the windows 7 so you
right-click<00:00:38.239> shrink<00:00:39.239> volume<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:41.010> wait

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
right-click shrink volume and just wait

00:00:41.370 --> 00:01:08.130 
right-click shrink volume and just wait
a<00:00:41.399> minute<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.149> come<00:00:42.510> on

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.950 

so<00:01:08.590> then<00:01:08.800> basically<00:01:09.640> what<00:01:09.790> what<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.330> is<00:01:10.540> here

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
so then basically what what it is here

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.350 
so then basically what what it is here
is<00:01:11.110> how<00:01:11.530> many<00:01:11.740> thousands<00:01:12.490> in<00:01:12.700> megabyte<00:01:13.210> you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
is how many thousands in megabyte you

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.480 
is how many thousands in megabyte you
want<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.630> shrink<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.380> I'll<00:01:14.980> just<00:01:15.220> do<00:01:15.370> an

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
want to shrink so I'll just do an

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.610 
want to shrink so I'll just do an
example<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.060> ten<00:01:16.300> thousand<00:01:16.840> megabytes<00:01:17.110> which

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
example of ten thousand megabytes which

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.760 
example of ten thousand megabytes which
is<00:01:17.860> ten<00:01:18.430> gigabyte<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:20.170> then<00:01:20.320> you<00:01:20.440> won't<00:01:20.590> go<00:01:20.740> on

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
is ten gigabyte so then you won't go on

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.600 
is ten gigabyte so then you won't go on
shrink<00:01:21.600> okay<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.900> tells<00:01:23.230> you<00:01:23.470> what<00:01:24.340> your<00:01:24.460> hard

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
shrink okay it tells you what your hard

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.250 
shrink okay it tells you what your hard
drive<00:01:24.850> would<00:01:24.940> be<00:01:25.000> like<00:01:25.240> after<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.930> then<00:01:32.080> wait

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
drive would be like after so then wait

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:58.110 
drive would be like after so then wait
another<00:01:32.500> minute<00:01:32.710> for<00:01:33.010> that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.980 

so<00:01:59.120> then<00:01:59.300> it'll<00:01:59.780> come<00:01:59.960> off<00:02:00.110> here<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:01.660> black<00:02:02.660> box

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
so then it'll come off here a black box

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.550 
so then it'll come off here a black box
where<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:04.220> just<00:02:04.490> says<00:02:04.730> unallocated<00:02:05.410> so<00:02:06.410> then

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
where it just says unallocated so then

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.130 
where it just says unallocated so then
you<00:02:06.680> won't<00:02:06.860> go<00:02:07.040> on<00:02:07.070> right-click<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.119> again<00:02:08.420> new

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
you won't go on right-click it again new

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.100 
you won't go on right-click it again new
simple<00:02:09.649> volume<00:02:11.380> next<00:02:12.490> next<00:02:13.490> again<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.110> then

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
simple volume next next again and then

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.430 
simple volume next next again and then
you<00:02:15.830> won't<00:02:15.980> take<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.490> one<00:02:16.790> here<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.440> doesn't

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
you won't take this one here and doesn't

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.290 
you won't take this one here and doesn't
it<00:02:18.770> doesn't<00:02:19.010> matter<00:02:19.250> what<00:02:19.550> letter<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.150> want

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
it doesn't matter what letter you want

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.320 
it doesn't matter what letter you want
pick<00:02:20.570> as<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.750> drive<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.760> then<00:02:22.760> next<00:02:23.120> again

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
pick as the drive and then next again

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.890 
pick as the drive and then next again
and<00:02:24.080> then<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:26.030> want<00:02:26.210> this<00:02:26.420> one

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
and then you want this one

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.120 
and then you want this one
make<00:02:27.260> sure<00:02:27.470> it's<00:02:27.650> NTFS<00:02:28.370> cuz<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:29.240> how<00:02:29.660> you

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
make sure it's NTFS cuz that's how you

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.550 
make sure it's NTFS cuz that's how you
use<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.310> for<00:02:31.490> boot<00:02:31.640> up<00:02:31.820> windows<00:02:32.270> because<00:02:32.870> fat32

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
use it for boot up windows because fat32

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.650 
use it for boot up windows because fat32
is<00:02:33.910> for<00:02:35.230> us<00:02:36.230> it's<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.710> same<00:02:36.920> as<00:02:37.070> USB<00:02:37.430> drives<00:02:37.910> so

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
is for us it's the same as USB drives so

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.010 
is for us it's the same as USB drives so
live<00:02:39.260> on<00:02:39.380> that<00:02:39.560> one<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:41.600> put<00:02:41.840> those

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
live on that one you just put those

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.800 
live on that one you just put those
default<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.830> then<00:02:43.250> just<00:02:43.970> name<00:02:44.210> this<00:02:44.480> to

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
default and then just name this to

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.030 
default and then just name this to
whatever<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.260> want<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.650> doesn't<00:02:45.680> really

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
whatever you want it doesn't really

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
whatever you want it doesn't really
matter<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:48.470> then<00:02:48.650> when<00:02:48.830> you're<00:02:49.010> done<00:02:49.190> you

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
matter so and then when you're done you

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.960 
matter so and then when you're done you
go<00:02:50.240> on<00:02:50.860> y-you<00:02:51.860> don't<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.310> tick<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:52.730> one

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
go on y-you don't have to tick this one

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.000 
go on y-you don't have to tick this one
of<00:02:53.090> your<00:02:53.209> but<00:02:53.390> I'd<00:02:53.900> rather<00:02:54.260> anyway<00:02:54.800> because

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
of your but I'd rather anyway because

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.310 
of your but I'd rather anyway because
you<00:02:55.520> just<00:02:56.270> make<00:02:56.450> sure<00:02:56.600> you've<00:02:56.750> got<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.959> fresh

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
you just make sure you've got a fresh

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.100 
you just make sure you've got a fresh
drive<00:02:57.800> ready<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.400> use<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.390> then<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.600> go<00:02:59.720> next

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
drive ready to use so then you go next

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.140 
drive ready to use so then you go next
again<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.920> then<00:03:02.080> finish<00:03:03.100> what<00:03:04.100> I've<00:03:04.790> already

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
again and then finish what I've already

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.930 
again and then finish what I've already
got<00:03:05.480> four<00:03:05.810> partitions<00:03:06.470> already<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:07.760> won't

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
got four partitions already so it won't

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.110 
got four partitions already so it won't
let<00:03:08.120> me<00:03:08.270> have<00:03:08.360> another<00:03:08.390> one<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.820> basically<00:03:10.820> I

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
let me have another one so basically I
