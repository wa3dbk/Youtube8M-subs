is bigger than most Airfix tanks the
turret<00:03:10.739> can<00:03:11.099> swivel<00:03:11.400> but<00:03:11.669> I<00:03:11.760> glued<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.150> down

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
turret can swivel but I glued it down

steps<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.370> complete<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:21.000> model<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:28.590> it's<00:04:28.770> a

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
steps to complete this model so it's a

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.920 
steps to complete this model so it's a
fairly<00:04:29.190> easy<00:04:29.310> build<00:04:29.880> I<00:04:30.530> didn't<00:04:31.530> find<00:04:31.680> it<00:04:31.860> hard

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
fairly easy build I didn't find it hard

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.730 
fairly easy build I didn't find it hard
but<00:04:33.930> I<00:04:33.960> would<00:04:34.229> not<00:04:34.410> recommend<00:04:34.699> this<00:04:35.699> for<00:04:36.740> a

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
but I would not recommend this for a

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.170 
but I would not recommend this for a
first-time<00:04:38.610> ethics<00:04:39.150> person<00:04:39.810> if<00:04:40.470> they<00:04:41.430> want<00:04:41.820> if
