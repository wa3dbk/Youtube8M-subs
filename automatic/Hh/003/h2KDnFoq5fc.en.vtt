00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.969
 good morning dear subscribers and 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.429
 new visitors today I would like 

00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:14.089
 present you a case a case 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:17.030
 back for the lg 3 the case that I have 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.230
 in my hands a rin that slim in color 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.910
 black 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.730
 what I'm going to do is take a look 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.680
 first of all what is the housing 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.289
 itself and then what I'm going to do is 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.560
 attach it to the phone to see how 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.560
 remains 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.220
 the first conclusion that I can extract 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.980
 when grabbing this casing is that the 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.590
 surface is smooth and creates a good 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.040
 friction so that we're going to guarantee 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.670
 a good grip of the g3 when we have what 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.250
 we have attached to this housing 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.160
 remember that the back surface of the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.980
 g3 is plain plastic and pretty 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.680
 Sliding therefore with this housing 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.620
 let's win in what is stability 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.810
 by taking the terminal so that we do not get 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.509
 escape from the hands 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.070
 We will have the necessary coverages in 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.360
 the back area 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.360
 on the bottom side 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.150
 and also on the upper side 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.750
 let's take a closer look at this case 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.750
 in the inner zone of it 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.680
 and now what I'm going to do is dock the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.240
 g3 to the rim housing that from the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.240
 bottom end first 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.940
 and in a moment everything is fine 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.490
 coupled 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.280
 I have not had to make any effort and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.840
 the device seems to be very good 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.120
 subject to be able to remove lg 3 from the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.540
 case, it will really be very, very 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.180
 very easy 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.909
 and as you can see there is no 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.780
 exert any kind of pressure and no 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.630
 type of effort 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.030
 which is appreciated if we want in some 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.330
 moment leave the housing at home and 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.000
 simply use the g3 let's see how 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.640
 there are the connections and the overtures in 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.280
 the bottom margin the jack three and a half 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.620
 for headphones the microusb port and the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.370
 main microphone are perfectly 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.370
 aligned 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.959
 there is a small side opening 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.280
 here we see another lateral overture 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.190
 this tells us that we could use 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.040
 a lanier or a hand strap with this 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.290
 housing for the g3 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.480
 and in the upper margin we will see how the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.180
 Infrared port and microphone 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.180
 secondary are more or less aligned 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.629
 we take a look at the back area and 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.239
 The first thing we have to observe is 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:24.359
 that the speaker of the device the 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.450
 one watt speaker of the g3 is also 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.810
 perfectly aligned with the housing of 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.660
 rinker 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.349
 very important to be able to enjoy 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.720
 the sound quality of g3 and in the 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.480
 top margin we can see how it is 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.170
 everything perfectly aligned in the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.720
 surface 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.910
 photo camera the two led flash 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.270
 the buttons to control the volume 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.000
 of sound the central button and the system 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.950
 laser autofocus 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.380
 this accessory is also very good 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.510
 because it will provide protection 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.380
 extra of the elements of the area 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.450
 back the surface of the g3 is about 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.640
 millimeters below the surface 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.069
 of the rinker housing 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.250
 so even if we have the device 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.470
 on a flat surface we do not have 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.260
 danger of scratching the target of 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.790
 camera the led flash or damage the 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.840
 buttons to control volume of the 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.000
 sound and the middle button 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.430
 let's take a general look at how 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.430
 this case remains with the g3 attached 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.840
 you do not gain just thickness with this 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.390
 casing that is ultra thin and also 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.030
 very resistant and remember that the 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.400
 material of this casing is 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.920
 polycarbonate this rim shell that is 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.380
 link of black color you can find it 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.740
 in mobile fun point is at a price of 15 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.850
 with 49 euros you have a direct link in
