00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279

transforming<00:00:24.180> taupe<00:00:24.600> now<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> pencil

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
transforming taupe now this is a pencil

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
transforming taupe now this is a pencil
that<00:00:25.740> falls<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.699> thinner<00:00:27.029> end<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that falls on the thinner end of the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.960 
that falls on the thinner end of the
spectrum<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.019> has<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.500> harder<00:00:29.099> consistency

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
spectrum and it has a harder consistency

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.269 
spectrum and it has a harder consistency
so<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> find<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:30.869> best<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.170> use<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.590> define<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
so I find it's best to use to define the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.250 
so I find it's best to use to define the
brows<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.730> well<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.239> use<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.989> create

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
brows as well as use it to create

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560 
brows as well as use it to create
individual<00:00:34.860> hairs<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.579> particular<00:00:35.940> patches

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
individual hairs in particular patches

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.690 
individual hairs in particular patches
where<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.380> might<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.590> lacking<00:00:38.160> because<00:00:38.610> of

its thickness or lack thereof this is

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.020 
its thickness or lack thereof this is
not<00:00:40.860> something<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.579> would<00:00:41.760> personally

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
other brushes which is where I I think a

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.420 
other brushes which is where I I think a
lot<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> others<00:01:01.590> happen<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.070> store<00:01:02.280> them

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
lot of others happen to store them

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.189 
lot of others happen to store them
because<00:01:02.699> they<00:01:02.850> are<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.120> same<00:01:03.359> shape<00:01:03.690> but

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
because they are that same shape but

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.359 
because they are that same shape but
because<00:01:04.530> they<00:01:04.680> don't<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.979> brush<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
because they don't have a brush and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.010 
because they don't have a brush and
they're<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.030> difficult<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.450> find<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.810> little

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
filling in mass amounts of brow because

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.800 
filling in mass amounts of brow because
of<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> thickness<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.850> pencil<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.540> the

want to talk about felt tip pens which i

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.770 
want to talk about felt tip pens which i
think<00:02:55.190> is<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.340> delivery<00:02:55.850> method<00:02:56.239> that<00:02:56.630> is

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
think is a delivery method that is

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.810 
think is a delivery method that is
really<00:02:57.380> underutilized<00:02:57.709> but<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.370> personally

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
really underutilized but I personally

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.449 
really underutilized but I personally
find<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.690> be<00:02:59.810> super<00:03:00.230> easy<00:03:00.650> because<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.280> can

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
find to be super easy because you can

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.460 
find to be super easy because you can
not<00:03:01.640> only<00:03:01.970> really<00:03:02.660> sweep<00:03:02.930> through<00:03:03.110> your<00:03:03.260> brows

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
not only really sweep through your brows

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.810 
not only really sweep through your brows
and<00:03:03.709> fill<00:03:03.830> them<00:03:03.950> in<00:03:04.070> quickly<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.670> efficiently

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
and fill them in quickly and efficiently

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.060 
and fill them in quickly and efficiently
but<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.420> also<00:03:05.600> lends<00:03:06.050> itself<00:03:06.380> really<00:03:06.590> well<00:03:06.860> to

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
but it also lends itself really well to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.250 
but it also lends itself really well to
doing<00:03:07.760> those<00:03:07.910> individual<00:03:08.630> hairs<00:03:08.959> when<00:03:09.170> you

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
doing those individual hairs when you

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.960 
doing those individual hairs when you
just<00:03:09.440> need<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.830> fill<00:03:10.010> in<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.220> few<00:03:10.400> patches<00:03:10.670> so

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
just need to fill in a few patches so

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.759 
just need to fill in a few patches so
it's<00:03:11.090> very<00:03:11.239> versatile<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:11.959> sense<00:03:12.350> it's

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
it's very versatile in that sense it's

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.100 
it's very versatile in that sense it's
just<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.010> hard<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.250> find<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.850> my<00:03:14.390> pick<00:03:14.750> for<00:03:14.780> that

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
just so hard to find so my pick for that

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.500 
just so hard to find so my pick for that
is<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.440> Malati<00:03:15.739> brow<00:03:16.310> tint<00:03:16.370> pen<00:03:16.880> felt-tip
