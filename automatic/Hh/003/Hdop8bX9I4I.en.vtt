0.1<00:02:41.329> as<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:42.170> can<00:02:42.320> see<00:02:42.560> there's<00:02:43.370> not<00:02:43.549> much

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
0.1 as you can see there's not much

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.039 
0.1 as you can see there's not much
difference<00:02:43.970> there<00:02:44.420> but<00:02:44.630> it's<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.840> bit<00:02:45.019> more

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
difference there but it's a bit more

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
chance but now I'm gonna do ya point 2

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.509 
chance but now I'm gonna do ya point 2
now<00:02:48.799> it's<00:02:48.950> more<00:02:49.160> transparent<00:02:49.690> soup<00:02:50.690> on<00:02:51.519> 3G

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
now it's more transparent soup on 3G

00:02:52.519 --> 00:03:00.980 
now it's more transparent soup on 3G
open<00:02:52.760> for<00:02:53.829> 0.5<00:02:55.540> 0.6<00:02:57.310> 0.7

zero four nine and zero pine and two or
one<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:08.330> then<00:03:09.330> it's<00:03:09.540> completely<00:03:09.930> transparent

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
one and then it's completely transparent

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.130 
one and then it's completely transparent
now<00:03:12.030> we've<00:03:12.210> spawns<00:03:12.570> if<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.840> make<00:03:13.020> it

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
now we've spawns if you make it

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.500 
now we've spawns if you make it
transparent<00:03:13.350> they<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.160> also<00:03:15.200> go<00:03:16.200> in<00:03:16.350> there

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
transparent they can also go in there

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.630 
transparent they can also go in there
and<00:03:18.510> all<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:22.310> will<00:03:23.310> now<00:03:23.960> show<00:03:24.960> you<00:03:25.020> how
