00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.629
 let's put our chocolate in a bain-marie 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.480
 to melt it is necessary to avoid doing too much 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.070
 heat the chocolate we go 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.330
 to learn today how to make 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.750
 chocolate chips and small 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.969
 discs 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.880
 we 're not going to talk about the temperature of the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.410
 chocolate because chocolate is a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.390
 food that is quite difficult to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.769
 work we have the table and there 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 just the little exercise doing some 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.650
 small chips of chocolate first 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.250
 thing you melt chocolate 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.410
 water bath 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.119
 but above all do not do it too much 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.520
 too heated see I still have some 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.390
 little pieces I'll finish from there I 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 I'll finish high school simply 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:49.379
 I have a chocolate that heal then 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.640
 here I have a game own tree puts a little 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.360
 of chocolate on marble 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.690
 I'm just going to spread the most 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.690
 possible end 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.960
 thibault it's very interesting 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:22.450
 well done well remove the excess 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.020
 and I read this trip removes everything that 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.420
 is too much 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.320
 I just want a sub layer on 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.150
 my tree you can see that it is in 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.780
 harden 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.630
 that's why it's enough 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.910
 interesting there in exercise and ally of the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.450
 chocolate on montbard second small 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.040
 exercise 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.950
 we will take a sheet of paper 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:47.920
 greaseproof the identical 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.259
 I put some chocolate on top even 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.430
 thing I'm going to try to get off 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.430
 chocolate on my whole family 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.330
 people 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.329
 see it's a good I want some 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.329
 smooth thing 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.400
 not too fine either when 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.690
 even I am little thick 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.090
 now i'm going to leave it lightly 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.090
 slightly lightly 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.709
 here I 'm going to do little circles 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.780
 I cut and take off look well 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.970
 sees well the shape of the circle sees well 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.970
 what they want yes 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.469
 so you have to do it before the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.469
 chocolate take completely 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.140
 I could do more of an exercise 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.939
 so that the students is a sweet to them 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.920
 so we'll be back in five minutes 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.920
 when the chocolate is going to have taken well 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.599
 glitch we come back 20 minutes after 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.560
 we can see that chocolate has 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.720
 hardened on marble 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.280
 I simply take the spatula 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.720
 stainless steel and there I will make the copo of 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.720
 chocolate look there 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.340
 the rac 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.490
 you hit it for you see well 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.490
 Yes 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.909
 so I hear small pieces a 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.250
 little centimeter at a time I get to 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.969
 to make jars of chocolate and that's okay 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.840
 serve to decorate our black forest 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:52.219
 that we are doing 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.139
 finally it can serve as this dessert you 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.700
 see the result 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:58.010
 he tried to make a little 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.989
 demonstration to the other very right-handed 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.989
 reverse work here 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.690
 and it's a little bit 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.690
 that who will have to deal Thursday 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.340
 at a high price here go do not matter 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.090
 it's not very complicated but it's a 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.090
 little new for us 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.380
 very well you want me to try 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.270
 thank you dylan gentlemen for this 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.560
 demonstration 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.870
 we have our chocolate that has 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.350
 cooled and now delicately I 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:49.070
 will take off but record made on 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.070
 paper seen it comes off easily 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.630
 it's a simple way to work the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.630
