00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello everyone with you video-shoper.ru 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.519
 I recently tested the watch from 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.820
 companies asus and remained them completely 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.440
 happy and today we have one more so 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.139
 called smart watches 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.890
 name of this gadget sony smartwatch 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.650
 3 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.930
 let's see what this watch can do and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.359
 what are they to use and so 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.400
 equipment in the box in addition to the main 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.760
 the device namely the clock is located 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.189
 cable yusb and documentation enough with you 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.260
 apparently thought so in the company sony and 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.180
 even managed not to put in the kit 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.610
 charging unit oh well 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.160
 1 set boring can then watch 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.500
 glad as I just got the device out 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.739
 boxes then delight in appearance 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.320
 There was no design and color at all 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.510
 matter of taste but in my opinion watch me 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 seemed very boring and faded 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.309
 the material of the strap is soft and 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.920
 velvety silicone watches light weight them 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.680
 on the arm is almost not felt on the arm 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.019
 they sit very comfortably fasten here 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.810
 reliable and does not stretch for nothing 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.270
 the strap has several slots for 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.250
 adjustment and pick the desired girth 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.650
 the problem will not be but one minus 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.799
 the fact remains that this 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.240
 the material collects dust very well 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.180
 perhaps it is very visible on black 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.430
 color but fact remains a fact to choose 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.920
 There are several color options 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.229
 and considering the fact that the block itself 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.450
 hours can be removed from the case then this 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.939
 the spectrum can be extended by a few more 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.159
 color solutions also sony released 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.229
 exact same hours but only with 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.790
 metal strap that again on 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.729
 my mind looks more 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.610
 more attractive yes completely forgot to go 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.460
 on our website video-shoper.ru and get 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.460
 all sorts of sweets when buying gadgets in 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.960
 the gift on the side of the case is silver 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.630
 the button which is responsible for turning on 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.180
 turning off the device back 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.850
 the module is made of steel where it is located 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.090
 plug for microusb using 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.770
 which charges the clock 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.750
 the truth is to charge devices not 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.939
 very comfortable just like 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.800
 open the cap itself why it is impossible 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.349
 had to do elsewhere remains 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.250
 mystery like most devices from 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:18.650
 sony watch is protected by ip68 standard that 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.510
 guarantees their dust and moisture protection 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.760
 sort of like with a clock on your hands you can 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.160
 quietly take a shower and even swim 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.500
 watches must withstand immersion on 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.310
 depth to one and a half meters throughout 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.470
 30 minutes 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.110
 Of course, provided that the stub 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.940
 the connector will be tightly closed smart watch 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:41.780
 got a screen diagonal of 1.61 320 on 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.380
 320 points and matrix type tft lcd 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.970
 no tangible color failure 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.670
 the picture does not lose its quality even 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.079
 under wide viewing angles 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.049
 sunny day you can see everything well and 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.060
 There is no problem on its own screen 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.849
 bright enough in the dark 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.769
 its more than enough also note 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.200
 that there is an automatic 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.910
 brightness control is a function 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.489
 auto screen on 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.130
 gesture turn the clock to yourself and the screen 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.989
 also automatically unlocked if 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.810
 you want to put the clock into sleep mode 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.720
 just turn off the tap and it goes out 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.819
 In general, the screen does not shine with anything special 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.010
 no pictures in the end on it 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.099
 consider and for the most important tasks 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.609
 display time and notifications 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.700
 quite enough 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.980
 as for iron unfortunately of 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.480
 official sources failed exactly 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.519
 find out which chipset model 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.349
 manufacturer set per hour and 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.180
 official site does not give full 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.389
 information but shows that the device 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.609
 running on quad-core processor 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:46.370
 arm7 with a frequency of 1 2 gigahertz 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.030
 the amount of RAM is 512 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.799
 megabyte and internal memory 4 gigabytes 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.380
 watches do their job well 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.930
 tasks everything works well and smoothly 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.319
 sony smartwatch 4 watch runs under 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.329
 running android in 51 and sync 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.730
 done with android device 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.560

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.019
 to connect the watch to the phone 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.870
 just download the app in android 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.879
 using the play market after the construction 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.699
 smartphone with a clock and enjoy on

 same through this application you can 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.970

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.740
 hours change ban or adjust 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.820

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.680
 applications 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.080
 Navigating the clock menu is enough 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.180
 simple and intuitive 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.669
 deal with the settings will not make 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.280
 no difficulty in the settings menu 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.500
 set the screen brightness font size 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.150
 enable gestures flight mode 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.639

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.520
 templates can be downloaded if desired 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.220

 from the play market gadget management also 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.440
 possible using the voice menu 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.460
 Of course the clock has a built-in 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.590
 gps receiver what do it 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.870
 attractive to hobbyists 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.639
 sports it makes it easy 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.979
 track distance 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.919
 routes temp is very convenient 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:12.200
 of the smaller functions there is a flashlight again 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.360
 same conditional flashlight 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.729
 answers the screen and especially consider 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.250
 something will be a big problem also 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.139
 have a stopwatch timer and opportunity 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.080
 weather viewing is also a feature 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.120
 find a smartphone running these apps and 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.250
 the clock transmits a signal that you are 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.770
 will you search for your lost gadget 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.900
 If you look at the functionality itself with 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.510
 using the clock you can call the subscriber 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.919
 write text message dictated it also 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.830
 set reminders 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.200
 start the stopwatch timer and alarm clock 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.479
 also get directions to preset 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.060
 seats bell dynamics unfortunately 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.639
 missing when reminding or calling 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.800
 the clock will vibrate itself 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.770
 vibration is not to say that the hands 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.449
 shaking but everything is quite confident there 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.279
 user-friendly application for a 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.710
 the world and she speaks so to speak in 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:02.659
 as a control panel as soon as you 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.120
 launched the program on the clock on 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:07.610
 the smartphone turns on the camera click on 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.129
 the right button and the camera of the smartphone does 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.289
 photo or video recording unlike 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.419
 applications for watches from asus here from 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.419
 Capabilities only available 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:20.180
 turning off the flash and setting the timer to 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.099
 general functionality for sony smartwatch 3 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.529
 everything is normal for all necessary 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.409
 applications of functions more than 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:30.680
 Enough watch equipped with battery 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:32.870
 capacity of 400 20 milliampere hours to wait 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.909
 wonders from the clock is not worth it when the average 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.039
 load at maximum screen brightness 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.870
 with geo-location enabled by others 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.759
 connected applications clock 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.310
 worked a little more than a day 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:46.729
 the result is good in principle but charging 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.819
 better to have with you in general the result of sony 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:53.180
 smartwatch 3 turned out quite successful 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:55.819
 smart watches but with a faded design if 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.399
 compare them for example samsung elias 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:00.770
 I myself then probably the choice is obvious in 

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:02.870
 the rest of the functionality is all good 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.389
 level and all that is needed 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.849
 the device works they provide 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:10.219
 readability and reply to messages 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:12.499
 It works well as a reminder 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:14.930
 will also be useful to those people who 

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:17.360
 do sports watch calories and 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.789
 activity will also be noted here convenient 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.159
 The buckle which is perfectly adjustable and 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:24.620
 does not stretch the presence of trifles 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:26.870
 gps module and water protection 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.270
 if you take into account what could be 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:32.089
 add how the person who gave 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.020
 sport over 10 years old i would install here 

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:35.240
 heart rate monitor 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.599
 I 'll take the not very convenient connector to the minuses 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.830
 for charging and so choose you 

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:42.349
