proximity<00:00:57.000> Loren<00:00:57.390> alarm<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.050> they'll<00:00:58.379> they'll

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
proximity Loren alarm on they'll they'll

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.270 
proximity Loren alarm on they'll they'll
turn<00:00:59.100> red<00:00:59.399> when<00:00:59.579> somebody<00:00:59.910> comes<00:01:00.030> near<00:01:00.390> you

the<00:01:02.280> upgrade<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.609> increases<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> warning

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the upgrade to increases the warning

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.630 
the upgrade to increases the warning
frequency<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.290> they're<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.129> buy<00:01:05.250> an

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
frequency when they're and buy an

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.179 
frequency when they're and buy an
upgrade<00:01:06.180> 3<00:01:06.630> maximizes<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> warning<00:01:08.040> for

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
upgrade 3 maximizes the warning for

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.560 
upgrade 3 maximizes the warning for
expensive<00:01:08.549> good<00:01:08.670> enemies<00:01:08.939> are<00:01:09.090> nearby<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
expensive good enemies are nearby so I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.160 
expensive good enemies are nearby so I
guess<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.869> makes<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.140> more<00:01:10.320> noticeable<00:01:12.170> armor

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
guess it makes it more noticeable armor

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
guess it makes it more noticeable armor

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
use that one as well

on<00:04:14.440> enemy's<00:04:14.740> nano<00:04:14.980> vision<00:04:15.460> so<00:04:15.790> basically<00:04:16.090> your

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
on enemy's nano vision so basically your

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.990 
on enemy's nano vision so basically your
ghost<00:04:16.540> Burt<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:18.070> there's<00:04:18.400> trackers<00:04:18.790> and<00:04:18.880> what

directional arrow and highlight number

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.890 
directional arrow and highlight number
three<00:04:26.110> makes<00:04:26.410> it<00:04:26.590> bigger<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.100> range<00:04:27.310> bigger

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
three makes it bigger the range bigger

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.240 
three makes it bigger the range bigger
visor<00:04:28.900> at<00:04:29.170> hands<00:04:29.350> this<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:29.740> really<00:04:30.100> really

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
visor at hands this is really really

grenades it produces energy cost of Nano

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.470 
grenades it produces energy cost of Nano
vision<00:04:43.390> so<00:04:44.230> really<00:04:44.680> really<00:04:44.800> cool<00:04:45.240> side<00:04:46.240> pack

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
vision so really really cool side pack

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.180 
vision so really really cool side pack
which<00:04:46.690> is<00:04:46.840> basically<00:04:47.110> your<00:04:47.320> scavenger<00:04:47.590> allows

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
which is basically your scavenger allows

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.160 
which is basically your scavenger allows
additional<00:04:48.520> private<00:04:49.150> it<00:04:49.750> allows<00:04:49.930> additional

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
be carried so that's that and then we

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.520 
be carried so that's that and then we
have<00:05:03.790> the<00:05:03.910> slide<00:05:04.090> a<00:05:04.120> Hamburg<00:05:04.600> faster<00:05:05.170> weapon

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
have the slide a Hamburg faster weapon

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.560 
have the slide a Hamburg faster weapon
