are we're gaining ground of that very
rapidly<00:00:18.170> when<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.289> set<00:00:19.680> about<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.310> Sportbrake

car that up as amount of pragmatism in
it<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.460> functional<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.539> at<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> end<00:00:30.929> of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
it it is functional but at the end of

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.959 
it it is functional but at the end of
the<00:00:31.109> day<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.830> what<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.070> call<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> sport<00:00:32.700> break

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the day it is what we call a sport break

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.660 
the day it is what we call a sport break
it<00:00:33.149> has<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.480> look<00:00:33.630> sporty<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.290> feel<00:00:34.500> sporty

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.430 

we've<00:00:38.670> designed<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.540> still<00:00:39.960> looks<00:00:40.320> like

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
we've designed it so it still looks like

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.760 
we've designed it so it still looks like
an<00:00:40.969> exotic<00:00:41.969> car<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:44.239> functional<00:00:45.239> box

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
an exotic car it's not a functional box

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.290 
an exotic car it's not a functional box
it's<00:00:46.770> got<00:00:46.890> elegance<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.149> got

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it's got elegance about it it's got

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.580 
it's got elegance about it it's got
beautiful<00:00:48.450> lines<00:00:48.870> about<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.530> is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
beautiful lines about it and that is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.290 
beautiful lines about it and that is
very<00:00:49.890> much<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> our<00:00:50.520> objectives<00:00:51.090> when<00:00:51.210> we

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
very much one of our objectives when we

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.569 
very much one of our objectives when we
sit<00:00:51.480> about<00:00:51.750> designing<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.340> we've

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
sit about designing it and I think we've

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.069 
sit about designing it and I think we've
achieved<00:00:53.699> something<00:00:54.149> actually<00:00:54.510> quite<00:00:54.719> unique

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
achieved something actually quite unique

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.350 
achieved something actually quite unique
in<00:00:55.410> many<00:00:55.530> ways<00:00:55.680> there<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> lot<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.910> estate

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
in many ways there are a lot of estate

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.209 
in many ways there are a lot of estate
cars<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:58.320> which<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.710> sportiness

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
cars out there which have a sportiness

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.740 
cars out there which have a sportiness
about<00:00:59.579> them<00:00:59.760> but<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.030> think<00:01:00.090> we've<00:01:00.629> achieved

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
about them but I think we've achieved

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.510 
about them but I think we've achieved
something<00:01:01.199> which<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.500> even<00:01:01.680> more<00:01:01.710> sporty

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
something which is even more sporty

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.210 
something which is even more sporty
without<00:01:03.449> compromising<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.500> practicality<00:01:05.189> of

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
without compromising the practicality of

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.590 
without compromising the practicality of
the<00:01:05.369> car

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.000 

it<00:01:10.600> was<00:01:10.750> an<00:01:10.870> interesting<00:01:11.110> challenge<00:01:11.500> for<00:01:11.980> us

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
it was an interesting challenge for us

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.880 
it was an interesting challenge for us
because<00:01:12.550> we<00:01:13.540> wanted<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.260> car<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.500> be<00:01:14.710> very

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
because we wanted the car to be very

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.710 
because we wanted the car to be very
practical<00:01:15.160> and<00:01:15.490> usable<00:01:15.730> whilst<00:01:16.330> obviously

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
practical and usable whilst obviously

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.390 
practical and usable whilst obviously
having<00:01:16.960> all<00:01:17.080> of<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.320> aesthetic<00:01:17.800> ingredients

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
the vehicle gives the car drama and a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.380 
the vehicle gives the car drama and a
bit<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.040> wedge<00:02:30.250> attitude<00:02:30.760> too<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.239> feels

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
bit of a wedge attitude too so it feels

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.090 
bit of a wedge attitude too so it feels
like<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.630> cars<00:02:31.870> got<00:02:32.170> some<00:02:32.320> movement<00:02:32.560> even

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
like the cars got some movement even

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.410 
like the cars got some movement even
when<00:02:33.190> it's<00:02:33.310> standing<00:02:33.549> still

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
when it's standing still

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.570 
when it's standing still
I<00:02:40.420> think<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.900> rear<00:02:42.080> aspects<00:02:42.620> of<00:02:42.739> XF

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
I think the the rear aspects of XF

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.000 
I think the the rear aspects of XF
Sportbrake<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:44.180> particularly<00:02:44.569> strong<00:02:45.110> we<00:02:45.770> use

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
Sportbrake is particularly strong we use

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.710 
Sportbrake is particularly strong we use
the<00:02:46.160> graphics<00:02:46.550> on<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.730> car<00:02:47.030> again<00:02:47.510> to

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the graphics on the car again to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.630 
the graphics on the car again to
accentuate<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.530> visual<00:02:48.890> width<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.400> we<00:02:49.489> have

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
accentuate the visual width so we have

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.330 
accentuate the visual width so we have
this<00:02:49.880> signature<00:02:50.720> blade<00:02:51.050> which<00:02:51.530> extends<00:02:52.160> into

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
this signature blade which extends into

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.309 
was floating over the top of it and
that's<00:03:28.489> why<00:03:28.790> we<00:03:29.060> blacked<00:03:29.360> out<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.720> pillars<00:03:30.049> to

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
that's why we blacked out the pillars to

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.759 
that's why we blacked out the pillars to
give<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.489> lovely<00:03:31.970> floaty<00:03:32.269> roof<00:03:32.680> towards<00:03:33.680> the
