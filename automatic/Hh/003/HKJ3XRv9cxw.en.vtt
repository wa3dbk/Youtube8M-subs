00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:12.670 

I<00:00:10.120> think<00:00:11.120> a<00:00:11.180> lot<00:00:11.360> of<00:00:11.480> drummers<00:00:11.780> get<00:00:12.230> caught<00:00:12.500> up

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
I think a lot of drummers get caught up

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.830 
I think a lot of drummers get caught up
playing<00:00:12.950> beats<00:00:13.580> and<00:00:14.059> I<00:00:14.180> think<00:00:14.420> I<00:00:14.480> think<00:00:14.510> a

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
playing beats and I think I think a

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.169 
playing beats and I think I think a
drummer<00:00:15.139> plays<00:00:15.680> music<00:00:16.219> he<00:00:16.430> doesn't<00:00:16.460> play

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:17.179 
drummer plays music he doesn't play

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.020 
drummer plays music he doesn't play

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
beads you participate in the musical

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.050 
beads you participate in the musical
experience<00:00:23.440> beauty<00:00:24.440> of<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:24.980> mandalas<00:00:25.340> is<00:00:25.820> it

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
experience beauty of the mandalas is it

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.150 
experience beauty of the mandalas is it
knows<00:00:26.330> from<00:00:26.600> the<00:00:26.750> center<00:00:27.050> to<00:00:27.199> the<00:00:27.230> edge<00:00:27.500> where

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
knows from the center to the edge where

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.950 
knows from the center to the edge where
you're<00:00:28.430> heading<00:00:28.730> that<00:00:28.850> it<00:00:29.210> doesn't<00:00:29.630> create

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
you're heading that it doesn't create

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.960 
you're heading that it doesn't create
the<00:00:30.050> exact<00:00:30.560> same<00:00:30.800> sample<00:00:31.400> every<00:00:31.640> time<00:00:31.820> you

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
the exact same sample every time you

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.549 
the exact same sample every time you
hand<00:00:32.149> it<00:00:32.239> this<00:00:32.329> way<00:00:32.539> like<00:00:32.750> it<00:00:32.989> sounds<00:00:33.379> more

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
hand it this way like it sounds more

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.440 
hand it this way like it sounds more
natural<00:00:33.590> because<00:00:34.190> it's<00:00:34.460> not<00:00:34.640> a<00:00:34.910> consistent

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
natural because it's not a consistent

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.299 
natural because it's not a consistent
sample<00:00:36.320> we<00:00:36.649> don't<00:00:38.829> you<00:00:39.829> always<00:00:39.980> find

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
sample we don't you always find

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.049 
sample we don't you always find
something<00:00:40.370> new<00:00:40.610> with<00:00:40.910> it

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
something new with it

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.940 
something new with it
it's<00:00:41.210> never<00:00:41.510> getting<00:00:42.020> stale<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:42.800> always

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
it's never getting stale and I always

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.979 
it's never getting stale and I always
thought<00:00:43.250> I<00:00:43.489> wanted<00:00:43.760> that<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:44.420> know<00:00:44.540> that<00:00:44.840> was

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
thought I wanted that you know that was

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.810 
thought I wanted that you know that was
not<00:00:45.110> happening<00:00:45.680> these<00:00:46.100> other<00:00:46.280> controllers

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
not happening these other controllers

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.420 
not happening these other controllers
that<00:00:46.910> I<00:00:47.000> was<00:00:47.120> using<00:00:47.530> with<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.649> mandala<00:00:49.040> you've

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
that I was using with the mandala you've

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.299 
that I was using with the mandala you've
got<00:00:49.700> a<00:00:49.969> mere<00:00:50.450> infinite<00:00:50.989> amount<00:00:51.379> of<00:00:51.590> pretty

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
got a mere infinite amount of pretty

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.950 
got a mere infinite amount of pretty
much<00:00:52.489> every<00:00:52.760> parameter<00:00:53.210> of<00:00:53.270> every<00:00:53.480> effect<00:00:53.780> can

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
much every parameter of every effect can

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.930 
much every parameter of every effect can
be<00:00:54.050> controlled<00:00:54.500> you've<00:00:55.010> got<00:00:55.160> a<00:00:55.190> huge<00:00:55.370> menu<00:00:55.670> of

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
be controlled you've got a huge menu of

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.790 
be controlled you've got a huge menu of
sounds<00:00:56.510> waveforms<00:00:57.079> that<00:00:57.140> you<00:00:57.289> can<00:00:57.469> pick<00:00:57.770> from

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
sounds waveforms that you can pick from

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.889 
sounds waveforms that you can pick from
and<00:00:58.370> then<00:00:58.640> each<00:00:59.030> one<00:00:59.300> of<00:00:59.390> these<00:00:59.450> parameters

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
and then each one of these parameters

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.360 
and then each one of these parameters
can<00:01:00.020> also<00:01:00.170> be<00:01:00.350> controlled<00:01:00.649> by<00:01:00.829> position<00:01:01.340> and

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
can also be controlled by position and

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.600 
can also be controlled by position and
velocity<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.690> zone<00:01:03.469> information

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
velocity and zone information

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.720 
velocity and zone information
I<00:01:05.670> want<00:01:06.630> people<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.930> play<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.070> electronics

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
I want people to play the electronics

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.410 
I want people to play the electronics
not<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:10.080> occasionally<00:01:10.950> use<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> want<00:01:12.300> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
not just occasionally use that I want it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.470 
not just occasionally use that I want it
to<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.600> their<00:01:12.780> instrument<00:01:13.440> in<00:01:13.560> their<00:01:13.710> voice

one<00:01:15.480> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.690> great<00:01:15.870> things<00:01:16.080> about<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
one of the great things about the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.560 
one of the great things about the
bondola<00:01:17.010> drum<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.550> fact<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:18.120> you<00:01:18.360> have

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
bondola drum is the fact that you have

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.350 
bondola drum is the fact that you have
all<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> those<00:01:19.320> concentric<00:01:20.220> rings<00:01:20.550> and<00:01:20.880> you're

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
all of those concentric rings and you're

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.950 
all of those concentric rings and you're
able<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.990> recreate<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.030> acoustic<00:01:24.030> phenomena

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
able to recreate that acoustic phenomena

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.560 
able to recreate that acoustic phenomena
with<00:01:25.350> whatever<00:01:25.950> sound<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.760> would<00:01:27.180> put<00:01:27.390> into

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
with whatever sound you would put into

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.010 
with whatever sound you would put into
it<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.560> makes<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:29.330> somehow<00:01:30.330> exciting

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
it it really makes it somehow exciting
