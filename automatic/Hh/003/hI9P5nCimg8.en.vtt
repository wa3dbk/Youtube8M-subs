teams and brought them to their new team

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.120 
teams and brought them to their new team
so<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> new<00:01:07.530> teams<00:01:07.740> could<00:01:07.950> be

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
so that the new teams could be

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.280 
so that the new teams could be
essentially<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.390> wanted<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
essentially what they wanted to see the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
essentially what they wanted to see the
whole<00:01:10.439> team<00:01:10.710> ass<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.850> did<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
whole team ass and I did you a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.700 
whole team ass and I did you a
commentary<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.780> team<00:01:12.960> gamma<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.560> guess

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
commentary on team gamma and I guess

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.170 
commentary on team gamma and I guess
that's<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.040> cross<00:01:14.250> did<00:01:14.490> too<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:14.939> I'm<00:01:15.060> not

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that's what cross did too but I'm not

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.179 
that's what cross did too but I'm not
really<00:01:15.270> sure<00:01:15.470> everything<00:01:16.470> about<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.979> I

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
really sure everything about that as I

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.310 
really sure everything about that as I
said<00:01:17.400> there<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.790> questions<00:01:18.240> about<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.630> but

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
said there are questions about that but

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.719 
said there are questions about that but
I<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:19.830> an<00:01:19.920> awesome<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> think

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
I think that's an awesome and I think

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.999 
I think that's an awesome and I think
that<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.299> motivating<00:01:21.960> people<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.290> start<00:01:22.770> teams

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
