your tooth shade um I my teeth aren't so
bad<00:00:23.279> they're<00:00:23.670> probably<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.510> round<00:00:25.019> right

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
bad they're probably in this round right

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.740 
bad they're probably in this round right
here<00:00:25.949> like<00:00:26.490> I'm<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:26.760> super<00:00:27.119> white<00:00:27.359> but

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
here like I'm not super white but

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.950 
here like I'm not super white but
they're<00:00:27.869> not<00:00:27.990> yellow<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.789> we<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.119> two<00:00:30.779> mouths

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
they're not yellow so we have two mouths

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.620 
they're not yellow so we have two mouths
trays<00:00:31.489> obviously<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.759> bottom<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> top<00:00:33.300> I

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
trays obviously the bottom the top I

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.430 
trays obviously the bottom the top I
also<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.380> some<00:00:35.070> little<00:00:35.370> q-tip<00:00:36.180> situations<00:00:37.110> I

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
also have some little q-tip situations I

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.869 
also have some little q-tip situations I
guess<00:00:37.590> I'll<00:00:37.710> figure<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.070> more<00:00:38.399> about<00:00:38.730> those

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
guess I'll figure out more about those

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.080 
guess I'll figure out more about those
later<00:00:39.030> there<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> syringe<00:00:40.610> filled<00:00:41.610> with<00:00:41.850> I'm

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
later there is a syringe filled with I'm

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.940 
later there is a syringe filled with I'm
assuming<00:00:42.600> what's<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> make<00:00:43.379> my<00:00:43.770> teeth

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
assuming what's going to make my teeth

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.010 
assuming what's going to make my teeth
white<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.489> then<00:00:44.910> there<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> little<00:00:45.660> blue

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
white and then there is a little blue

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.229 
white and then there is a little blue
LED<00:00:46.950> light<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.399> I'm<00:00:47.550> supposed<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> fold<00:00:48.030> up

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
LED light that I'm supposed to fold up

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.889 
LED light that I'm supposed to fold up
so<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.230> looks<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.770> little<00:00:50.670> intimidating<00:00:51.420> but

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
so it looks a little intimidating but

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.750 
so it looks a little intimidating but
easy<00:00:52.289> enough<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.739> we're<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.309> go<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
easy enough so we're going to go and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.340 
easy enough so we're going to go and
we're<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.120> boil<00:00:54.360> everything<00:00:54.690> so

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
we're going to go boil everything so

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.430 
we're going to go boil everything so
step<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.739> was<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.340> bring<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:57.030> pot<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.360> water<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
step one was to bring a pot of water to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.110 
step one was to bring a pot of water to
a<00:00:58.469> boil<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.520> turn<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.730> heat<00:00:59.910> off

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
a boil and then we turn the heat off

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.540 
a boil and then we turn the heat off
and<00:01:00.359> we're<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> let<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.050> sit<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.550> six

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and we're going to let that sit for six

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.280 
and we're going to let that sit for six
minutes<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.300> tells<00:01:03.480> me<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.719> cool<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.049> six

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
minutes it tells me to cool for six

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.810 
minutes it tells me to cool for six
minutes<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.799> then<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> put<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
minutes and then I'm going to put the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.760 
minutes and then I'm going to put the
mouth<00:01:05.939> trays<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.630> step<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.439> take<00:01:07.619> the

in<00:01:38.810> there<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.110> grab<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.380> out<00:01:39.440> but<00:01:39.620> there<00:01:39.770> is

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
in there and grab it out but there is

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
like a little tab on the end of it and

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.540 
like a little tab on the end of it and
then<00:01:45.620> I<00:01:45.650> put<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:45.980> in<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.100> cold<00:01:46.520> water<00:01:47.500> boom

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
expecting at all I was like something's

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.760 
expecting at all I was like something's
gonna<00:02:49.580> take<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:50.120> bunch<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.570> time<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.050> do<00:02:51.200> it

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
gonna take a bunch of time is to do it

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.810 
gonna take a bunch of time is to do it
it<00:02:51.830> doesn't<00:02:51.860> say<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.250> directions<00:02:52.459> like

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
it doesn't say in the directions like

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.070 
it doesn't say in the directions like
how<00:02:52.940> often<00:02:53.120> you're<00:02:53.360> supposed<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.660> do<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:53.959> I

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
how often you're supposed to do it I

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.140 
how often you're supposed to do it I
doubt<00:02:54.440> it's<00:02:54.650> like<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.800> daily<00:02:55.220> thing<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.670> think

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
doubt it's like a daily thing I think

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.300 
doubt it's like a daily thing I think
it's<00:02:56.239> just<00:02:56.390> like<00:02:56.510> every<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:57.530> often<00:02:57.770> so<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:58.220> is

it's just like every so often so this is

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.610 
it's just like every so often so this is
something<00:02:58.520> I'd<00:02:58.610> probably<00:02:58.820> do<00:02:59.120> once<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.170> week<00:03:00.200> I

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
something I'd probably do once a week I

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.650 
something I'd probably do once a week I
don't<00:03:01.160> know<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.550> think<00:03:01.670> they<00:03:01.910> look<00:03:02.090> whiter<00:03:02.450> you
