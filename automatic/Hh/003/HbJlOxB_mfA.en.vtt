00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
maybe not in that instant maybe there

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.990 
maybe not in that instant maybe there
was<00:03:16.530> time<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:16.890> celebrate<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.550> moment<00:03:17.940> to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
was time to celebrate a moment to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.690 
was time to celebrate a moment to
reflect<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.570> celebration<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:20.310> certainly

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
reflect on celebration but certainly

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.310 
reflect on celebration but certainly
pretty<00:03:20.940> quickly<00:03:21.270> would<00:03:21.600> shift<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:22.020> from

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
pretty quickly would shift on from

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.320 
pretty quickly would shift on from
defeat<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.800> from<00:03:23.040> victory<00:03:23.430> he<00:03:23.820> would<00:03:23.970> move<00:03:24.120> on

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
defeat and from victory he would move on

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.300 
defeat and from victory he would move on
and<00:03:24.540> make<00:03:24.660> sure<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:24.900> say<00:03:25.410> that's<00:03:25.950> where<00:03:26.190> the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
and make sure I say that's where the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.560 
and make sure I say that's where the
longevity<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.850> coming<00:03:27.060> from<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.330> fact<00:03:27.540> that

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
longevity is coming from the fact that

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.210 
longevity is coming from the fact that
he's<00:03:27.750> been<00:03:27.840> able<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:28.410> jobs<00:03:28.620> never<00:03:28.800> complete

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
he's been able the jobs never complete

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.400 
he's been able the jobs never complete
the<00:03:29.910> job<00:03:30.120> was<00:03:30.239> never<00:03:30.420> completed<00:03:30.900> as<00:03:31.140> always

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
the job was never completed as always

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.500 
the job was never completed as always
the<00:03:31.500> next<00:03:31.800> shell<00:03:32.010> as<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.160> next<00:03:32.489> phase<00:03:32.670> I'd<00:03:33.330> like

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
the next shell as a next phase I'd like

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.729 
the next shell as a next phase I'd like
to<00:03:33.630> say<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.810> think<00:03:33.900> he<00:03:34.110> said<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.410> his<00:03:34.470> statement
