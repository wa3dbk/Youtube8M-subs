pretty<00:02:40.709> crazy<00:02:40.859> if<00:02:41.069> it's<00:02:41.189> a<00:02:41.219> really<00:02:41.489> big<00:02:41.670> class

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
pretty crazy if it's a really big class

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.280 
pretty crazy if it's a really big class
and<00:02:42.269> if<00:02:42.329> they<00:02:42.420> give<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.569> really<00:02:42.719> small<00:02:43.049> class

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and if they give a really small class

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.559 
and if they give a really small class
might<00:02:43.650> not<00:02:43.769> be<00:02:43.920> as<00:02:44.010> good<00:02:44.189> but<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:45.209> know<00:02:45.329> if<00:02:45.450> you

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
might not be as good but you know if you

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.420 
might not be as good but you know if you
have<00:02:45.689> over<00:02:45.840> twenty<00:02:46.260> students<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.889> think<00:02:47.010> that'd

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
have over twenty students I think that'd

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.670

work<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.760> fine<00:02:48.409> trying<00:02:49.409> to<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:49.620> of

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
work just fine trying to think of

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.170 
work just fine trying to think of
anything<00:02:49.859> tell<00:02:50.159> seems<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.489> be<00:02:50.549> careful<00:02:50.970> you

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
anything tell seems to be careful you

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.250 
anything tell seems to be careful you
know<00:02:51.299> every<00:02:51.450> now<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:51.659> then<00:02:51.720> some<00:02:51.930> kids<00:02:52.109> might

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
know every now and then some kids might

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.809 
know every now and then some kids might
knock<00:02:52.439> each<00:02:52.470> other<00:02:52.769> over<00:02:53.099> because<00:02:53.700> they

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
knock each other over because they

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.309 
knock each other over because they
really<00:02:54.060> want<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.239> get<00:02:54.359> in<00:02:54.750> their<00:02:54.900> seats<00:02:55.169> and

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
really want to get in their seats and

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.199 
really want to get in their seats and
sit<00:02:55.560> down<00:02:55.769> if<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.489> don't<00:02:56.639> have<00:02:56.909> a<00:02:56.939> class

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
sit down if you don't have a class

sit down if you don't have a class
that's<00:02:57.510> doesn't<00:02:58.469> work<00:02:58.560> really<00:02:58.739> well<00:02:58.889> together

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that's doesn't work really well together

that's doesn't work really well together
enough<00:02:59.519> this<00:02:59.669> game<00:02:59.819> was<00:02:59.939> work<00:03:00.060> for<00:03:00.239> them<00:03:00.530> but

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
enough this game was work for them but

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.929 
enough this game was work for them but
they<00:03:01.889> typically<00:03:02.219> have<00:03:02.340> fun<00:03:02.519> like<00:03:02.700> going

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
they typically have fun like going

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.270 
they typically have fun like going
outside<00:03:03.090> obviously<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:04.650> could<00:03:04.799> do<00:03:04.919> inside

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
outside obviously you could do inside

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.830 
outside obviously you could do inside
potentially<00:03:05.760> be<00:03:05.879> enough<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.299> probably

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
potentially be enough to probably

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.209 
potentially be enough to probably
rearrange<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.439> classroom<00:03:07.829> a<00:03:07.919> little<00:03:08.010> bit
