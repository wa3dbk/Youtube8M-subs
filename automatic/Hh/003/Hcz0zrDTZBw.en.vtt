00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.020 
times I've had an opportunity to see
killer<00:02:19.670> whales<00:02:19.880> hunting<00:02:20.360> together<00:02:20.690> as<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> team

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
killer whales hunting together as a team

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.640 
killer whales hunting together as a team
it's<00:02:23.030> very<00:02:23.330> rare<00:02:23.660> because<00:02:23.990> what<00:02:24.170> Monterey<00:02:24.530> is

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
it's very rare because what Monterey is

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.350 
it's very rare because what Monterey is
one<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.010> few<00:02:25.190> places<00:02:25.490> in<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.910> world<00:02:26.120> we

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
one of the few places in the world we

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.480 
one of the few places in the world we
have<00:02:26.390> an<00:02:26.690> opportunity<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.350> see<00:02:28.070> something

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
have an opportunity to see something

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.460 
have an opportunity to see something
like<00:02:28.610> this

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.010 

we'll<00:02:34.710> circle<00:02:35.190> mother<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:36.120> try<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.390> separate

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
we'll circle mother and try to separate

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.430 
we'll circle mother and try to separate
her<00:02:37.140> from

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
her from

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.040 
her from
can

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.480 

the<00:02:42.320> distressed<00:02:42.770> youngster<00:02:43.310> struggles<00:02:43.850> to

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:03:05.210 

to<00:02:46.850> give<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.150> baby<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.480> better<00:02:47.720> life

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.650 

the<00:03:06.220> mother<00:03:06.400> rolled<00:03:06.700> on<00:03:06.910> her<00:03:07.000> back<00:03:07.240> and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
the mother rolled on her back and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.620 
the mother rolled on her back and
actually<00:03:08.530> swam<00:03:09.010> belly-up<00:03:09.520> for<00:03:10.090> quite<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.390> while

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
actually swam belly-up for quite a while

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.220 
actually swam belly-up for quite a while
and<00:03:11.080> that's<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.740> way<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:12.780> probably<00:03:13.780> keep<00:03:14.020> the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
and that's a way to probably keep the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.400 
and that's a way to probably keep the
calf<00:03:14.440> on<00:03:14.800> her<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.280> little<00:03:15.550> bit<00:03:15.700> better

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:28.490 

but<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> killer<00:03:19.800> wave

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.830 

one<00:03:28.980> orchid<00:03:29.280> moves<00:03:29.730> alone<00:03:30.090> against<00:03:30.570> a<00:03:30.630> whale

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
one orchid moves alone against a whale

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.290 
one orchid moves alone against a whale
six<00:03:31.320> times<00:03:31.710> her<00:03:31.920> size<00:03:31.950> as<00:03:32.670> she<00:03:33.000> tries<00:03:33.270> to

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
six times her size as she tries to

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.270 
six times her size as she tries to
separate<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.080> cab<00:03:34.290> from<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:35.070> 30-ton<00:03:35.610> mother

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.369 

if<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.580> killer<00:03:40.909> whale<00:03:41.090> got<00:03:41.360> hit<00:03:41.690> or<00:03:41.930> squished

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
if that killer whale got hit or squished

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.170 
if that killer whale got hit or squished
in<00:03:42.620> between<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:43.099> the<00:03:43.340> gray<00:03:43.549> well<00:03:43.760> she<00:03:44.030> could

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
in between the the gray well she could

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.089 
in between the the gray well she could
be<00:03:44.209> injured<00:03:44.629> so<00:03:44.659> I<00:03:44.870> was<00:03:45.080> really<00:03:45.290> surprised<00:03:45.709> to

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
be injured so I was really surprised to

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.640 
be injured so I was really surprised to
see<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.459> it<00:03:46.819> was<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.180> same<00:03:47.390> female<00:03:47.750> in<00:03:48.170> that

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
see that it was the same female in that

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.699 
see that it was the same female in that
position<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.549> entire<00:03:49.670> time<00:03:50.239> and<00:03:50.629> this<00:03:51.409> killer

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
position the entire time and this killer

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.949 
position the entire time and this killer
whale<00:03:51.860> actually<00:03:52.310> did<00:03:52.640> have<00:03:52.819> its<00:03:53.030> pin<00:03:53.360> ripped<00:03:53.810> a

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
whale actually did have its pin ripped a

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:05.630 
whale actually did have its pin ripped a
little<00:03:54.200> bit

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.339 

but<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.760> bond<00:04:06.970> between<00:04:07.239> mother<00:04:07.659> and<00:04:07.750> baby<00:04:07.930> is

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
but the bond between mother and baby is

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.229 
but the bond between mother and baby is
strong

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
strong

the Cape's spent a lot of time rolling

its mother - and that rolling behavior

its mother - and that rolling behavior
seemed<00:04:17.139> to<00:04:17.229> prevent<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.709> killer<00:04:17.949> whales<00:04:18.220> from
