hey<00:00:00.630> guys<00:00:00.840> my<00:00:01.469> bearings<00:00:01.949> have<00:00:02.159> been<00:00:02.399> shaken

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hey guys my bearings have been shaken

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.510 
hey guys my bearings have been shaken
and<00:00:03.659> clean<00:00:04.230> so<00:00:04.799> it's<00:00:04.950> been<00:00:05.069> about<00:00:05.160> five

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
and clean so it's been about five

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.220 
and clean so it's been about five
minutes<00:00:05.910> so<00:00:06.029> I've<00:00:06.180> started<00:00:06.509> taking<00:00:06.810> my

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
minutes so I've started taking my

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.160 
minutes so I've started taking my
bearings<00:00:07.589> off<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.250> little<00:00:08.400> rack<00:00:09.050> take<00:00:10.050> the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
bearings off of the little rack take the

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.140 
bearings off of the little rack take the
band's<00:00:10.469> off<00:00:10.620> or<00:00:11.040> take<00:00:11.340> them<00:00:11.460> out<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.790> lay<00:00:11.910> them

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
band's off or take them out and lay them

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.490 
band's off or take them out and lay them
bearings<00:00:13.049> down<00:00:13.469> or<00:00:13.799> bearing<00:00:14.160> chilling<00:00:14.730> down

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
bearings down or bearing chilling down

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.830 
bearings down or bearing chilling down
so<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.010> Rings<00:00:17.190> are<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:17.609> like<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.690> they

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
so the Rings are up like this so they

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.230 
so the Rings are up like this so they
can<00:00:18.990> start<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> solutions<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.939> start

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
can start to so the solutions can start

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:32.200 
can start to so the solutions can start
to<00:00:21.300> come<00:00:21.449> out<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.779> them<00:00:23.600> one<00:00:24.600> more<00:00:27.710> all<00:00:28.710> right

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.100 

all<00:00:33.210> right<00:00:33.270> now<00:00:34.020> all<00:00:34.350> my<00:00:34.530> bearings<00:00:34.890> are<00:00:34.980> out

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
all right now all my bearings are out

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.630 
all right now all my bearings are out
and<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.710> gonna<00:00:37.890> stick<00:00:38.129> them<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> middle

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and just gonna stick them in the middle

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:53.799 
and just gonna stick them in the middle
of<00:00:38.730> my<00:00:38.940> towel<00:00:39.180> here<00:00:50.390> flip<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.539> over<00:00:51.629> other<00:00:52.530> way

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
of my towel here flip it over other way

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.000 
of my towel here flip it over other way
all<00:00:54.809> right<00:00:55.170> some<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.039> solution<00:00:56.789> came<00:00:56.940> out

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
all right some of the solution came out

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.979 
all right some of the solution came out
there<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> couple<00:00:59.309> times<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.750> get

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
there and a couple times so you can get

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.560 
there and a couple times so you can get
some<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> excess<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.239> that's<00:01:03.359> just

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
some of the excess out so that's just

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.260 
some of the excess out so that's just
sitting<00:01:03.960> around<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.409> there<00:01:08.240> okay<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:11.270> got

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
