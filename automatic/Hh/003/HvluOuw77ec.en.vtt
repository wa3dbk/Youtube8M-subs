00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.000
 &gt;&gt; See how we can make a nice toy, such as a sopper doll, out of such items that we throw out on a daily basis. What do you say, do we make a doll like that? 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.200
 &gt;&gt; (Children) Yes (Babysitter) Well, it's great to get to work 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.200
 &gt;&gt; To make an eco-friendly doll we will need: 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.000
 &gt;&gt; A piece of square material. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.100
 &gt;&gt; A small towel or cloth. 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 &gt;&gt; Ping-pong balls or other balls. If you do not have it, we can make it from paper. 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.000
 &gt;&gt; Rubber bands. 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.500
 &gt;&gt; Some bows or pieces of colored material. 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.000
 &gt;&gt; Poster paints or crayons. 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.000
 &gt;&gt; From the material we cut four squares on each corner. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.000
 &gt;&gt; On the material, we cut a dozen or so of the same length strips, because we will make the legs of an octopus. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.500
 &gt;&gt; In the material, place the ball and wrap the material under it. 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 &gt;&gt; We put the rubber band on the formula so that the ball does not fall out. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.300
 &gt;&gt; Weave the straps of the octopus limbs and at the ends we tie bow bows. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.900
 &gt;&gt; Then we paint the octopus mouth and eyes, and decorate it according to our own invention. 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.600
 &gt;&gt; Toys are ready. Remember that after each game we have to clean up after each other, 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 &gt;&gt; and above all you have to remember that you dump garbage into appropriate containers. 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.000
 &gt;&gt; Have fun
