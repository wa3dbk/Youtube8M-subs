00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.749
 so the shoulder 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:18.560
 during the race half time right times like a video report you actually 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.820
 normal media so far as Cruz demonstrate it 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 around 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.220
 I've got myself and beat like him so far Riess in Zempow 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.589
 Installed 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.140
 around 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.870
 yes and now i just wanted to keep making my own show death 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.020
 continue to need more says again 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.160
 you can write the crowd yourself 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
 I just started to get a bit pop for that 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
 and I find that it pleases a light so I like 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.220
 I'll show you the video above 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.010
 and if it wanted to have it I can tell the dead BMW is the best 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.990
 download 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.300
 and 13 does not like the misery if I still afterwards 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.150
 give the link to the Patrol 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.030
 but now you can start tackling my Cruz now 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.570
 so dead 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.210
 so 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.580
 either way now you know how my putts look like 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.580
 I think they have become so pretty 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.320
 So I do not like it when it's so overkill but look at it 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.490
 See Kollmeier clearly 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.569
 Gruber Techt and then the saturation Isler have screwed around the cars 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.540
 that means the colors are a bit nicer 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.400
 to ... more 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.530
 So I think the asset is beautiful and who 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.980
 in so far you do not know 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.420
 Now you can also click the area July 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.009
 explainable as each installed 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.009
 and who's got the hook now? 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.790
 l the report just explained how to insert a crotch 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.199
 So, um 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.879
 so that you do not look like him so far as I also the unity of 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.359
 Community big 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.339
 the 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.339
 we are here in the video description under to download 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:33.410
 I would have to download it for years 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.549
 I have failure here no matter if car loaded 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.199
 so if you guys have taken it the more it's intact and they have in it 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.370
 you just have to 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.389
 Workplace in the programs 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.099
 Rock Star Games 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.340
 so with me is that the programs probably I need target point 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.619
 come 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:53.399
 Error EA program Rockstar Games Convention and it goes for Andreas 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:54.269
 give 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.269
 where you have installed them so far 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:02.089
 that's what you miss the most 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.329
 and the abuses Apple would now have to replace a roof 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.159
 "Get in on it alone 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.229
 and I know that it is not enough 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.229
 AR around for the 4 my crew in it 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.069
 that's the whole cost 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.219
 There you can also have to try a bit to pay yourself 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:25.129
 change even if you are not probably there what that changed 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.129
 but no matter 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.639
 then common would have to be short-lived 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.239
 and every year everything else would not have been installed so so will one 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.419
 explained another video 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.859
 So good that tutorials walk again after a long time 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:45.739
 I hope you enjoyed it and failed the Cruz 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.909
 yes and Sons make shipping for the first time
