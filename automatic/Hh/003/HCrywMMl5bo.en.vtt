the key differences between universities
especially<00:02:54.019> as<00:02:54.590> we<00:02:54.709> start<00:02:55.010> doing<00:02:55.310> some<00:02:55.549> of

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
especially as we start doing some of

especially as we start doing some of
this<00:02:55.730> globalizing<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.720> institution<00:02:57.440> we<00:02:57.859> have

this globalizing the institution we have

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.860 
this globalizing the institution we have
to<00:02:58.400> make<00:02:58.549> better<00:02:58.700> use<00:02:58.849> of<00:02:59.030> collaborative

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
to make better use of collaborative

to make better use of collaborative
technology<00:03:00.530> because<00:03:00.739> we<00:03:00.829> can't<00:03:01.069> just<00:03:01.220> walk

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
technology because we can't just walk

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.879 
technology because we can't just walk
down<00:03:01.609> the<00:03:01.730> hall<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.060> talk<00:03:02.239> to<00:03:02.450> somebody

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
down the hall to talk to somebody

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.170 
down the hall to talk to somebody
language<00:03:03.889> is<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.220> principal<00:03:04.700> tool<00:03:04.910> we<00:03:05.150> have

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
language is the principal tool we have

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.690 
language is the principal tool we have
for<00:03:05.840> bringing<00:03:06.169> lines<00:03:06.410> together<00:03:06.709> but<00:03:07.459> now<00:03:07.579> it

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
for bringing lines together but now it

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.949 
for bringing lines together but now it
turns<00:03:07.940> out<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.090> other<00:03:08.269> forms<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.750> technology

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
turns out that other forms of technology

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.319 
turns out that other forms of technology
