00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.309
 wrote fish do not have to buy 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.130

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.260
 frozen in vacuum I bought 300 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.390
 a gram of red frozen fish just 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.910
 for 2 servings 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.689
 fish must be cleaned of bones and washed 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.279
 running water remnants of scales 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:35.329
 carefully cut with a sharp knife 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.329
 skin and cut the fillet into cubes 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.460
 further prepare the marinade for this 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.519
 squeeze the juice of one lemon into a deep 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.019
 bowl and add to it two three 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.019
 tablespoons of soy sauce 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.790
 put the fish in the marinade and leave on 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:18.130

 fire quickly turn them over 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.850
 the whole procedure should not take more 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.450
 five minutes because the fish is very fast 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.370
