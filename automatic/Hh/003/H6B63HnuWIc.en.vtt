00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.500 

I<00:00:10.310> sort<00:00:11.310> of<00:00:11.370> midway<00:00:11.670> through<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.970> year<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.300> was

I sort of midway through the year I was

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.290 
I sort of midway through the year I was
16<00:00:13.050> at<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.230> time<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.800> I<00:00:14.220> started<00:00:14.940> getting<00:00:15.120> a

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
16 at the time and I started getting a

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.200 
16 at the time and I started getting a
rash<00:00:15.540> from<00:00:16.190> what<00:00:17.190> during<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.790> cricket<00:00:17.970> season

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
I thought it was just um

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.760

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.510 

because<00:00:56.500> it<00:00:56.620> clearly<00:00:56.770> with<00:00:56.980> times<00:00:57.190> where<00:00:57.490> I

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
because it clearly with times where I

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.450 
because it clearly with times where I
couldn't<00:00:57.730> get<00:00:57.850> out<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.090> bed<00:00:58.210> without<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.780> help

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
couldn't get out of bed without the help

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.910 
couldn't get out of bed without the help
had<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.610> be<00:01:01.290> had<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.350> be<00:01:02.440> carried<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.770> the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
had to be had to be carried to the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.180 
had to be had to be carried to the
toilet<00:01:03.310> things<00:01:04.000> like<00:01:04.180> that<00:01:04.360> showered<00:01:05.190> bathed

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
toilet things like that showered bathed

toilet things like that showered bathed
so<00:01:06.730> it<00:01:07.540> was<00:01:07.660> tough<00:01:07.870> but<00:01:08.200> I<00:01:08.470> think<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.400> was<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.520> lot

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790

harder<00:01:09.820> on<00:01:10.180> my<00:01:10.270> family<00:01:10.660> more<00:01:10.780> than<00:01:10.840> anything

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
harder on my family more than anything

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.440 
harder on my family more than anything

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
was coming you can either take a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.809 
was coming you can either take a
backwards<00:02:18.980> step<00:02:19.220> or<00:02:19.579> you<00:02:19.670> can<00:02:19.819> step<00:02:20.360> into<00:02:20.569> it

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
backwards step or you can step into it

can you believe it

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.940 
can you believe it
the<00:02:55.840> Malta<00:02:56.110> culture<00:02:56.380> does<00:02:56.530> play<00:02:56.710> a<00:02:56.740> big<00:02:56.770> part

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
the Malta culture does play a big part

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.610 
the Malta culture does play a big part
here<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:58.320> guess<00:02:59.320> it<00:02:59.500> has<00:02:59.890> a<00:02:59.920> bigger<00:03:00.310> emphasis<00:03:00.610> on

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
here I guess it has a bigger emphasis on

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:09.500 
here I guess it has a bigger emphasis on
on<00:03:02.620> how<00:03:02.980> we<00:03:03.040> approach<00:03:03.430> these<00:03:07.710> if<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:08.860> think<00:03:09.130> of

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
on how we approach these if you think of

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.390 
on how we approach these if you think of
the<00:03:10.510> Mahdi<00:03:10.720> becoming<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.140> go<00:03:11.260> for<00:03:11.500> war

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
the Mahdi becoming a go for war

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.150 
the Mahdi becoming a go for war
they're<00:03:13.180> big<00:03:13.390> they're<00:03:13.600> strong<00:03:13.900> they<00:03:14.500> stand<00:03:15.010> up

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
they're big they're strong they stand up

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.470 
they're big they're strong they stand up
to<00:03:15.280> anyone<00:03:15.490> they<00:03:15.730> don't<00:03:15.880> take<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.090> backward

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
to anyone they don't take a backward

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.300 
to anyone they don't take a backward
step<00:03:16.600> and<00:03:16.900> it's<00:03:17.020> something<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.350> we<00:03:17.530> are<00:03:17.740> in<00:03:18.100> a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
step and it's something that we are in a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.190 
step and it's something that we are in a
way<00:03:18.460> of<00:03:18.580> tried<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.820> implement<00:03:19.210> but<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:19.990> saying

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
way of tried to implement but in saying

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.340 
way of tried to implement but in saying
that<00:03:20.410> we're<00:03:20.560> we're<00:03:20.890> very<00:03:21.130> respectful<00:03:21.460> as<00:03:21.940> well

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
that we're we're very respectful as well

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.670 
that we're we're very respectful as well
so<00:03:23.350> yeah<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.650> got<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.390> guess<00:03:25.390> be<00:03:25.840> brutal<00:03:26.530> and

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
so yeah you got to I guess be brutal and
