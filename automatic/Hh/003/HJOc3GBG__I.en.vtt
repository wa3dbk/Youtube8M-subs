00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.610
 and there, folks, fine, I 'm supposed to be dry 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.920
 I gave a fuck I've known for a long time. 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.840
 I do not video anything or play 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.370
 No, but it's that I 'm very 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.390
 college staff so wanted to ask 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:22.800
 Sorry for you 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.910
 Anyway, I 'm even training to talk. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.710
 like this 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.890
 Guys, I'm playing a game here for 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.239
 phone or smartphone that is real and without 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.750
 3g is very good and free is so rich and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.380
 Download 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.020
 store 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.390
 I think on google android too 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.399
 It must be very good, I want to show a 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.899
 A little of it for you today is a game. 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.550
 What I 'm playing and I'm enjoying it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.039
 enough 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.539
 so today is not mick is an analysis of 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.309
 a different game on your phone 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.050
 I want to bring this video to mark the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.440
 back the channel is coming back 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.160
 so nothing better than show a game 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.680
 For you, I'll show you that I 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.540
 I'll start by talking about how 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.670
 works the game scheme is as follows 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.240
 personal is a racing game in 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.360
 road tracks right then and there are not 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.220
 illegal races 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.159
 so there's nothing police or anything 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.350
 But you have to work on the car. 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.229
 You can handle the suspension transmission. 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:31.229
 and engine among other things is very 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.720
 because as you go knocking the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.939
 car trying to get a legal position 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.560
 here guys to get better for you 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.490
 be able to see the screen of the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.610
 cell phone is so much depends on whether 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.310
 you buy a car you buy the car 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.869
 it's the carrion it's a car on the road and you 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.070
 will improve his actions 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.500
 As you earn more money 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.740
 you will installing it is said that you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.030
 transmission and engine and everything else 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.450
 I'll stop talking I'll give a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.450
 player 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.530
 and there is the following person as you 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.479
 Evolving, you obviously are going. 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.060
 buying new cars you will have 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.440
 new offers have cars that cost 200 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.660
 one thousand reais 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.540
 It's a bmw. 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.640
 two thousand reais so I'm with 15,000 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.040
 so far is that there is very little 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.880
 plus 15 is a little more 15 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.860
 So it's okay with 18,000 people. 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.990
 more personal is a very good game 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.450
 It's a really cool game, I highly recommend it. 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.450
 What are you, young man and I? 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.120
 Let's race here to show you 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.010
 you 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.290
 it is a very good graphics game in 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.260
 another game on iphone 4 so if you 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.630
 have an iphone 4s or an iphone 5 that 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.050
 game will get much better if you 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.370
 suddenly see a galaxy s 3 will stay 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.250
 even better 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.710
 so depending on the game is improving 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.870
 every step looks at the image of him that 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.910
 cool the folks i'm sorry amateur 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.050
 of the video you know I used to film the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.940
 xbox 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.320
 so there's no way there's no way 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.090
 another way to show that other to 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.900
 you except one year like this 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:23.490
 even if the focus works 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.510
 I thank you, you have several types and you. 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.920
 you can choose whether you want a 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.510
 whether or not annual acceleration is 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:37.160
 accelerated automatically or I 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:40.160
 I'm controlling it only by turning the brake 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
 copper 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.170
 there the personal license I want to pass 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.090
 staff is in addition he has a 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.340
 diversity of 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.189
 game you have a cup mode 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.939
 you have a way is is drag is that they 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.030
 they speak 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.930
 André f andrés says that you 're going to be so 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.760
 understood 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.829
 You have this way, you have one 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.109
 in the same way as time goes 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.180
 passing is who comes back but 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.430
 being eliminated 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.139
 you have several Pope 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.209
 you have different game modes and 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:17.169
 also liu camera has other types of 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:31.360
 camera for you to play also wanted 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:34.270
 show the camera to you but the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.190
 staff is a very good performance game 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.380
 your car breaks you have to 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.479
 fix him or her fender on 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.009
 beat light break you have to pay the 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.320
 I repaired it from there with your money 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.320
 so in other words you can hit the cars 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.909
 but the consequence is that it will cost a 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.159
 buck later to fix it 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:53.199
 you have many game modes you have 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:54.849
 the series as you earn more 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.430
 money you can join series 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.949
 better as much better cars then 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:11.560
 It's a game that's worth it because 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:14.680
 first you again on facebook 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.710
 share your results with the guys 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.440
 your friends playing the game you go 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.210
 level up also a very 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.190
 good I recommend the best connect to 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.620
 facebook did not connect not because I did not 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.380
 I care a lot for this but for anyone 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.419
 There you have to repair where you go. 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.340
 to notice that you will fix what 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.259
 damaged the car O look here 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.520
 leak in the radiator 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:43.360
 So I 'm going to fix it and I 'll stay here. 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:46.229
 to fix it to focus the 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.229
 camera is a bet 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.710
 so it's a very good game at all 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:56.710
 repaired saw everything repaired and then you 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.880
 improves your performance too. 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.560
 here is a picture of the performance 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.300
 transmission brakes and etc. 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.490
 This is what I show personal I hope 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.240
 You have enjoyed a big hug and 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.240
