this<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.400> future-proof<00:00:12.059> pc<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:12.840> means<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.219> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
this is a future-proof pc so means so it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.240 
this is a future-proof pc so means so it
means<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.519> can<00:00:14.670> run<00:00:15.350> Ultra<00:00:16.350> settings<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.980> any

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
means you can run Ultra settings on any

let's<00:00:20.670> jump<00:00:20.939> right<00:00:21.029> into<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.449> put<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> cpu<00:00:22.320> side

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
let's jump right into it put a cpu side

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.670 
let's jump right into it put a cpu side
which<00:00:22.859> will<00:00:22.949> be<00:00:23.039> using<00:00:23.220> an<00:00:23.400> intel<00:00:23.760> core<00:00:23.789> i7

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
which will be using an intel core i7

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.160 
which will be using an intel core i7
4770k<00:00:25.680> now<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.880> has<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> base<00:00:27.359> clock<00:00:27.660> speed<00:00:28.019> of

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
4770k now it has a base clock speed of

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.279 
4770k now it has a base clock speed of
7.5<00:00:28.920> gigahertz<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.119> has<00:00:30.269> k<00:00:30.539> symbol<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
7.5 gigahertz but it has k symbol in the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.010 
7.5 gigahertz but it has k symbol in the
end<00:00:31.529> minsk<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.189> very<00:00:32.460> overclockable<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.750> it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
end minsk is very overclockable if it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.350 
end minsk is very overclockable if it
can<00:00:34.140> look<00:00:34.380> up<00:00:34.559> maybe<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.430> 20<00:00:35.850> point<00:00:36.120> 4

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
can look up maybe up 20 point 4

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.020 
can look up maybe up 20 point 4
gigahertz<00:00:36.660> yeah<00:00:37.530> that's<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.070> 4.4

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
gigahertz yeah that's right 4.4

simply<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:42.090> mainly<00:00:42.390> about<00:00:42.570> power<00:00:42.809> it's

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
simply is not mainly about power it's

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.560 
simply is not mainly about power it's
about<00:00:43.140> power<00:00:44.100> consumption<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> party

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
about power consumption it's not a party

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.110 
about power consumption it's not a party
it's<00:00:46.289> about<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> efficiency<00:00:47.340> now<00:00:47.850> this

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
it's about the efficiency now this
