the bike ready so the training the

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.069 
the bike ready so the training the
testing<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:49.829> then<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:51.090> know<00:02:51.239> as<00:02:51.540> everyone

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
testing and then you know as everyone

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.690 
testing and then you know as everyone
sees<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.319> race<00:02:52.620> time<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.310> could<00:02:53.519> argue

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
sees the race time so you could argue

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.339 
sees the race time so you could argue
you've<00:02:54.150> achieved<00:02:54.329> more<00:02:54.720> as<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.870> disabled

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349

an able-bodied person it's definitely

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.729 
an able-bodied person it's definitely
yeah<00:02:59.370> I'd<00:02:59.700> say<00:02:59.760> so<00:02:59.970> really<00:03:00.959> probably<00:03:01.260> unfair

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
yeah I'd say so really probably unfair

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.759
