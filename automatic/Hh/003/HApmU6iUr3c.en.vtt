00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.230
 Good morning, folks, we're here in a 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.820
 guava orchard of the city of pirangi in the 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.829
 interior of the state of sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.329
 we will present a result of a 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.900
 work being done there 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.759
 about a year already and guava 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.059
 I've made a guava plantation to 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.280
 variety calls pedro knows is a plant 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.379
 which is approximately 15 years 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.870
 age is already an area already in production 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.579
 Quite the work we are doing. 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.399
 developing here approximately one 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.160
 year of work is already the product that the 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.800
 people are showing it is what walked or 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.500
 which is neither a new product of the family 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.109
 of products of the ballagro directed to 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.289
 overcoming problems in areas with 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.539
 nematodes as we know gobybal 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.500
 the plant quite susceptible to attack 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.000
 of nematodes 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.190
 where the nematode usually has 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.080
 guava demands a lot of vigor suffer a lot 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.530
 with this kind of problem 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.240
 infestation with nematodes and the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.860
 that as the production of guava is 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.729
 constant the guava race is 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.979
 constant 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.770
 Do you have a very serious problem to use? 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.869
 and you have residue in the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.709
 fruit is a challenge for the producer 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.649
 keep your polar fruit producing the 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:30.229
 healthy plants without using any 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.940
 product to favor the plant 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.099
 in our case for everything it calls who does not 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.390
 nor here I'm going to start with an area 

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:44.840
 witness is flying to road people 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.550
 standard developed is an area that follows 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.039
 in production 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.599
 you can see under the trees 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:55.129
 the application the handling ends with 15 per 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.560
 having a little leaf is quite an effect 

00:01:55.129 --> 00:02:00.080
 of the attack of nematode and guava 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.399
 it is the lack of the flamento the plant stands for 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.379
 few leaves 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.750
 this greatly favors the growth of 

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:07.160
 I usually kill you then you see that even 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.039
 with the control 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.140
 you have a weed infestation 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.629
 under the canopy of trees enough 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.810
 in areas with nematode because 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.269
 you have a weaker foundation 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.069
 This is a very serious problem too. 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.470
 here what has gone, nor is it applied to 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.130
 soil okay this is an important detail 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.260
 it is applied to the ground via verte verte 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.440
 via drip that has a mix of people 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.140
 which makes application as here a plot 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.030
 where we did a test evaluation 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.670
 the work was still done on the basis of 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.610
 but we are already leaving in this 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.120
 I work in areas where the 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.190
 application via ferti-irrigation via 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.410
 people are referring here to 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.720
 People still witness everything is here. 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.270
 testimony we will be opening the 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.190
 area with our treatment that was the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.190
 treatment that gave the best result in the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.590
 case of the guava that will be right there in the 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.980
 in front of us are walking here 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.080
 arriving in the area still see only the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.540
 difference we have come in a 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.900
 witness area and arrived here at 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.459
 first plant of the lake treatment with 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.180
 product that goes well 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.820
 if you look closely it 's a plant 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.490
 much larger than the formation of cup 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.680
 much greater much more stringent 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.360
 you have a sheet tint too 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.880
 much stronger 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.400
 all this this part of vegetative rigor 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.180
 nor much of what is provided by 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.269
 who does not read 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.459
 he works both solo level creating 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.130
 a resistance to infestation of 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.430
 button while giving the effect of matos 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.820
 tactic you reduce activity 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.209
 this effect still has an activator 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.739
 small law gives all this activity 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.500
 leaf development 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.660
 vegetative and productive vigor 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.269
 okay so this here is a tree that 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.180
 received this from here a portion that 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.370
 received the product if we can 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.310
 probably observe in video that 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.590
 will also be appearing for you 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.260
 the crown feature is very good 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.209
 close to the one we had and the level 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.030
 of infestation I have of grass 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.070
 under the plant below the 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.990
 cup is much smaller 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.540
 Can you see that you had a 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.300
 shaded the problems with weed 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.880
 under the canopy are much smaller 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.099
 this is another fact that we associate 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.560
 and the producer here in the region also 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.820
 associates the intention to kill size as 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.790
 nematode 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.400
 no yara folhar gets more light in the glass 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.590
 there's more weed under the water 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.080
 It's not all very well leafed here. 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.700
 light entrance is reduced little bush 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.070
 underwater 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.200
 it's a benefit plan it eases a lot 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.150
 the day to day of the producer 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.150
 this area here it has already gone into production 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.280
 has already been made productive analysis of her 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.290
 we had a pretty big win 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.540
 also significant in production not only 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.980
 glass of information because it is no use just 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.860
 We can, the leaf has to give. 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.690
 productivity in this case here the gain of 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.830
 productivity was also very good 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.370
 they are jobs we will be working on 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.210
 making the producer of 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.770
 guava 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.720
 as we have been developing the 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.240
 work today here we are already 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.540
 coming out of this plot showed 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.490
 area where the commercial work is done 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.220
 the product is already a commercial product here 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.860
 in Brazil and here is the case of producers 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.530
 of pirangi is no longer a product of 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.600
 for evaluation is already something of the day to day of the 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:43.130
 with the growth of areas 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.050
 treated is that one more product 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.480
 technology word but the result 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.640
 field and stored here in the 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.380
 movie recorded in this movie to be 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.780
 shared with everyone 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.390
 regions where the producer also has 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.790
 the nematode challenge production profit 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.790
 of the guava talon thank you very much
