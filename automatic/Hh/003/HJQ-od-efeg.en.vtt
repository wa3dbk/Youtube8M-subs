00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.360
 a welcome presentation to another 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.360
 minecraft video because said we 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.750
 let's minecraft edition and well let's go 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.779
 to prove this control issue in the 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.220
 tomás twitter or you can take it as 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.650
 you want to call this one of him 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.779
 posted a moment ago is not a moment 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.460
 at the time of fact 15 others of none 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.949
 and have some time I do not know how long but 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.290
 is posted on your twitter that 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.100
 you can and that is testing the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.050
 interface of minecraft interface 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.610
 minecraft to use a support 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.220
 controls is testing the button by 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.680
 button says he and says this one 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.110
 fortunately we are going to wipe out all 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.720
 the interface 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:57.340
 it says so that we will be 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:01:00.160
 able to use controls our port 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.840
 for controls among other things 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.580
 minecraft because I was devastating 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.590
 according to is devastating with 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.360
 with this from the interface or it is 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.770
 changing the interface according to what can 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.770
 have with this that says it's 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.630
 rampaging soil interface and 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.130
 that practically what you are doing to 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.980
 what it means is that it will change 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.660
 the edition minecraft interface maybe 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.230
 no way 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.350
 version 0.12 will change it because the 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.830
 version 0 point of 11.0 put the interface 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.140
 of the boat then you will have to 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.670
 change it all complete for the second 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.880
 next update that could be 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.070
 0.12 and good will allow us to use 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.550
 a control with which we can 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.290
 manipulate minecraft much better like this 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.840
 as we can see it is much easier 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.110
 manipulate it and much more enjoyable and more 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.970
 quick to place blocks and be able to mine and 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.700
 everything we need to do in 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.710
 minecraft ok good edition so that 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.890
 can see the news on twitter 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.979
 of tomaso is the information there is what 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.450
 public and in list there's exactly we're going 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.760
 to ride a few zombies made more 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.740
 fast kill enemies with such control 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.290
 as a livestock with this test 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.840
 and we're going to check that because it's not 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.710
 bothering a clip we are going to assemble the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.780
 ice cream is killing a kripper with 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.920
 a diamond sword we use a control 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.840
 and the truth is great because it's a lot 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.000
 better but good the next interface 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.000
 of minecraft occasion for android for 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.700
 mobile devices like this ios 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.700
 or devices like iPad will change the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.150
 interface according to what this tomás says or 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.860
 on twitter and then we will have 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.900
 I imagine that we will do controls or 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.490
 they will use controls 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.940
 maybe wireless or this will be used 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.110
 or will add an option that you can 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.420
 identify a wireless control 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.560
 and then we could use it but that 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.930
 know maybe we use usb usb or 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.470
 who knows but you can be that 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.050
 power 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.390
 you had from one control and had 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.410
 a usb entry for tablet and it 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.560
 I could emulate the control to play 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.620
 in the table with a control this the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.240
 360 box or playstation in this case 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.940
 Well, I'm using a control 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.950
 wireless that is much better 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.040
 that looks a lot like xbox control 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.560
 one and in fact it is similarly practically 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.770
 they have identical buttons 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.230
 but good we found here this this 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.320
 this minecraft 3 - options that the 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.690
 minecraft for android and this one is a lot 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.030
 better because it's more optimized in the 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.250
 bio distance we can observe a little bit 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.959
 more distant than normal if we go for 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.480
 up we're going to go up and we're going to observe 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.720
 much more distant has a use 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.970
 at 1080 pixels that allows us then 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.130
 just do 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.650
 is that the game is more enjoyable and 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:07.200
 much better quality and all up from 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.270
 the heavens from above rather because 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.400
 you can not and this englishtown and the 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.890
 3.10 update they cut it but the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.560
 distance is much longer and more 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.910
 distant than what is shown in this 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.530
 thing in fact it looks great to the 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.760
 far away this one that rays looks 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.130
 interesting all this this from minecraft 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:37.890
 so with the control this is manipulated 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.840
 much easier and everything else good 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.670
 for those who ask me what I'm in 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.040
 the box by facebook that I'm in a 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.520
 minecraft version that allows me 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.870
 use wireless control and then the 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.200
 people sometimes even get upset and I 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.790
 insults because they say I'm lying 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.530
 and I'm using this from minecraft 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.720
 for xbox but you can see he knows it 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.260
 minecraft box because it's totally 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.010
 different 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:06.490
 and well that's all just girl in 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.560
 the twitter retakes its public is very 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.930
 early this matter in fact put a 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.790
 image of a dog that is burning its 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.400
 house and sits south facing her 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.550
 table drinking your coffee I do not know what it is 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.770
 but it's a kind of sarcasm or 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.870
 something similar as typically what 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.600
 we act as moyano of 44 studies that is 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.670
 the sarcasm but well this desire all the 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.670
 people see you later I hope that 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.500
 the news of this pleases them as much as 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.960
 it pleases me to use a control 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.240
 to manipulate minecraft because said 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.790
 be from the experience of minecraft 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.360
 because they are a little bit nicer like that 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.360
 see you
