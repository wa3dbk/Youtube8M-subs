00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.790
 and also Oscar de Marcos said that the 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.210
 open door is with us every 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.189
 frames 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.429
 ramón has the microphone that is 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.429
 we started 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.430
 11 11 and it's not going to be that I do not 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.230
 I recorded the good ending here 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.630
 well friend I have not commented this 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.070
 last week get a little bit of air 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.780
 after so much activity in 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.330
 preseason until the moment of the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.440
 stopped us to the truth that we had 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.570
 all eyes on the preview 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.180
 of champions and therefore we did not have 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.610
 no rest then we focus 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.550
 in the game the very important command 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.220
 get the three points and good now 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.010
 we have to think a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.980
 a series of very tough matches are 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.990
 seven parties in 20 days and we must 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.820
 be prepared for it and the first 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.570
 of them is against Barcelona in the camp 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.430
 nou you can think that the athletics already 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.480
 has reached a level where this 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.860
 type of matches 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.930
 as it said caparrós that is like going to 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.240
 dentist you have to leave that aside 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.540
 for a team like your one I believe 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.480
 that every time 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.790
 we trust more in ourselves we are going to 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.220
 all parties to win it yes that is 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.130
 true that is never good is one of the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.280
 most difficult fields of the entire league but 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.040
 but we have taken very good matches 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.080
 difficult and very important and let's go 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.820
 to try real and also a match 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.940
 these in which it gives you a lot in case of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.070
 to get something out I do not know of course 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.710
 final all matches are worth the same 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.280
 but it is true that almost rivals 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.030
 of greater entity then good the victory 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.400
 You tastes better in the good personal level 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.459
 you are entering the team 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.540
 almost skillfully 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.390
 you're still in that alternation with 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.670
 andoni iraola how are you in that in 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.690
 that double function of when you play you do not 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.760
 I take iraola or vice versa then in the end 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.870
 of football you have to fight for a position 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.760
 I'm not fighting right now 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.570
 andoni iraola what good we all know what 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.040
 that what is and therefore is very 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.760
 complicated but that suits us well 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.120
 two for 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.909
 good day to day to get to play 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.680
 this titular variant and I think that 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.030
 comes well to the team also in this 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.560
 week that you are going to play at 4 o'clock 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.079
 late what kind of routine are you going to 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.540
 alter to get used to that schedule 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.250
 for example with good foods I 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.159
 I think we are already used to 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.360
 any time at the end we eat or 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:05.730
 We usually eat 3 hours before the game 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.470
 Well then it is true that perhaps 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.900
 The only thing that takes away from us is a little 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.200
 nap that there are some that we like 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.150
 a lot but good you have to adapt and go 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.440
 to be very hot but but here 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.090
 he is also doing while 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.450
 we train if we stick to the best 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.450
 possible 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.239
 normally with two you face or you 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.129
 faces a big team like the 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.659
 barça-madrid is usually topical to say yes 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.010
 you prefer to take that hour than to be a 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.879
 little in that phase of shooting also with a 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.639
 coach does not care 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:44.599
 in the last year we had to go to bernabéu 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:46.459
 on day 3 so this is going to 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.010
 play before or after you never know 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.959
 when when is it better but but good 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.340
 we know that this is our turn 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.340
 Saturday and we joined 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.610
 in that aspect of the barca used to come 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.470
 wrong in the last years after the 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.900
 words of the election said no 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.880
 came very very well but this year to 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.800
 you are also almost in box 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.480
 but we have several casualties of those 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.420
 aspects or equal to one that now of 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.010
 moment we are missing enough players 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.380
 but that's a good sign 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.390
 It's also because the team is 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.870
 doing things well in their 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.390
 players in special and good that I 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.980
 I think it's not a bad thing, on the contrary 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.160
 are there is why because it is very 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.160
 all right 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.699
 if the afternoons won us 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:46.339
 differentials between this barca we talk 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.199
 of the use enrique with the irruption of bonn 

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:50.090
 and other young cadres regarding 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:54.199
 last year 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.960
 and still is not that they carry many 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.199
 matches yes it is true that it is 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.110
 having several changes at the end it 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:06.229
 they start to enter younger that's not 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.060
 the normal there are players what good 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.150
 that maybe they are not counting so much 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.810
 but they are not still there and they have very 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:18.230
 good team this what this one have 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.580
 a team to fight for everything and now 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.280
 we have to think more about 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.960
 we 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.030
 As for you I guess you do not 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.590
 used to the right side is 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.350
 consent since you can position 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.830
 of the function of your future 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.260
 you think that as a footballer or eye you think 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.810
 that you can go to another position is 16 years 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.060
 going around that so I do not have 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.160
 no idea if in the future I will continue there is or not 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.650
 so it 's true that right now with 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.930
 ernesto then good seems more or less 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.580
 clear that that is the position that in the 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.900
 who loves me and not in the future maybe 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.270
 I go to the other side of the right now 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.270
 center there and try to improve every day i 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.289
 we talk about the marathon of matches that 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.300
 comes then I guess you feel like a lot 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.659
 that does not enter into that routine dynamics 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.490
 Wednesday weekend if what you 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.530
 like in the end is to play the game 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.740
 party yes that's true it's a lot 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.849
 more demanding but but good 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.319
 practically when you finish a match 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.819
 you 're already focused on the next and 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:21.819
 that's always good and nice 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.370
 so if you think it's better to play 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.379
 play against the barça hour before 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.419
 start what's coming to be the champions of 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:34.099
 the group stage or do it against another 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.159
 rival of lesser entity I do not know if it is better 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:41.060
 play against a rival of such quality 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:43.159
 at the end it's good because because you 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.669
 gets really tested Barca eventually you 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:48.770
 It demands a lot and good if the 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.629
 things well is because because the team 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.419
 is doing well and if they are committed 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:55.069
 many failures as it is good for 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:58.090
 see them and correct them for the following 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.090
 parties that are also very important 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:10.280
 if nothing else this one has given them that risk 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.280
 my art
