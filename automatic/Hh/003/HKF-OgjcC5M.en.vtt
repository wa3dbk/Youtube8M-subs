programs<00:00:31.199> abroad<00:00:31.500> draw<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.340> considerable

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
programs abroad draw a considerable

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.490 
programs abroad draw a considerable
number<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.390> our<00:00:33.510> students<00:00:33.840> away<00:00:34.079> at<00:00:34.230> any<00:00:34.350> time

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
number of our students away at any time

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.600 
number of our students away at any time
so<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:37.050> about<00:00:37.260> 2,500<00:00:38.129> students<00:00:38.489> on

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
so that we have about 2,500 students on

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.670 
so that we have about 2,500 students on
campus<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.210> any<00:00:39.360> time<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.989> those<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.559> all

campus at any time and those are all
undergraduate<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.610> would<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
undergraduate and that would be the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.850 
undergraduate and that would be the
first<00:00:42.090> thing<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.420> would<00:00:42.480> point<00:00:42.809> out<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
first thing I would point out is the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.619 
first thing I would point out is the
opportunity<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> campus<00:00:45.420> where

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
opportunity to be on a campus where

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.420 
opportunity to be on a campus where
everything<00:00:46.260> there<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.739> focused<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
everything there is focused on the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.119 
everything there is focused on the
undergraduate<00:00:47.879> student<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:49.559> develops<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
undergraduate student it develops the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.680 
undergraduate student it develops the
thinking<00:00:50.489> skills<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.059> work<00:00:51.210> closely<00:00:51.480> with

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
thinking skills you work closely with

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.660

faculty<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.410> with<00:00:52.469> students<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.640> is

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
faculty and with students and that is

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.240 
faculty and with students and that is
really<00:00:54.149> why<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> student<00:00:55.680> should<00:00:55.860> choose<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
really why a student should choose the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
really why a student should choose the
