 I'm going to be a little natural 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.579

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.380

 extraordinary has a very physical 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.740
 interesting for female texts

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.400
 lower selections of 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.320
 that year that is 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.330
 a player called to do things 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.260
 important good we already know our

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.720
 showtime 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.230
 happy with the x-ray with the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.629
 definition of álex 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.670
 and good as you go to experience there 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.940
 for the USA it was 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.790
 is that at the moment very well I 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.099
 I had 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.730
 they gave me I had a little respect for that 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.920
 milk 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.920
 and from here for the subject of English 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.660
 and how was the dentist experience and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.410
 but the truth is that people are 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.700
 very nice 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.410
 before 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.000
 understand me understand them 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.040
 you take a week or so over there 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.870
 you are doing the training camps of 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.540
 minnesota no 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.129
 and as it is a habitual journey I suppose 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.090
 that you work hard the physicist does not over 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.980
 everything there in general the game 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.709
 the players waiting for a physical 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.300
 spectacular are very strong very 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.270
 athletic but 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.190
 in subject weights and that many do not 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.700
 the truth for example my day to day here 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.950
 is to train in the morning only for the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.660
 tomorrow but 44 hours in a row 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.180
 plus one hour of shooting so we're 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.410
 five hours there on track and then nothing 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.290
 then we have our greens 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.540
 to visit the city to know a 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.770
 little minnesota soak you suppose 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.650
 everything is going very fast not that it was the 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.860
 training is team knowledge 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.590
 really what is your goal these days 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.660
 I already said it before 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.220
 to enjoy the experience not 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.220
 I could live every day I am 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.680
 and me 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.319
 and they called me no I did not think twice 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.120
 times but that's why 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.920
 because at an opportunity like that you can not 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.590
 say you do not know if you have to come and 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.310
 enjoy this good much train 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.650
 a lot of training 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.450
 queralt there is also desire to play I think 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.829
 that the first preseason game is 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.829
 the day 10 against connecticut 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.750
 exact 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.410
 to see how I suppose that there is already 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.240
 you do not want 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.240
 and I also what he said 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.440
 and also a little bit of 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.510
 of variety not always the same 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.320
 routine 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.320
 I believe that for 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.520
 to show to be more more comfortable 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.889
 on track I also need a little bit of 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.810
 matches a bit of 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.810
 the party rhythm the truth is 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.969
 to the great difference here appear 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.830
 Tendered and the rhythm is spectacular as 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.440
 but it 's the speed 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.060
 before you spoke of the language I think that in 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.650
 that has helped you ricky did not match 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.150
 with the train and if I think that also 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.380
 they play in the same place as 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.540
 timberwolves no 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.820
 we are in the c 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.110
 the one of the pavilion the how is here with the 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.150
 recovery for knee 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.450
 there next to my track do 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.750
 Weights and good as I was out there 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.840
 our group 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.000
 the coach very well I help you 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.800
 álex let's see soon now just 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.930
 I ask her but we're going to see her 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.129
 soon to be in the senior team 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.630
 or not 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:24.180
 Well, we do not expect everyone to 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.460
 well to do it also in the 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.350
 different lower categories with the 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.020
 selection now the time has come 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.840
 to make the jump to absolute 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.300
 in the elections is in a moment of 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.849
 transition where obviously there is a 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.590
 series of players who have already given 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.349
 better of themselves and you have to go 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.509
 preparing the relief can not be a 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:49.060
 sudden change you have to make a 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:52.300
 logical transition but there is a series of 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.069
 players and create fairgrounds on 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.030
 example number one they are calling 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:06:00.129
 the doors of this absolute selection 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.009
 above all and there is one thing that you love 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:05.529
 that is a player that covers you a bit 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.689
 two posts a little 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:10.239
 a style similar to laia palau that 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.889
 you can make it play base but 

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:14.499
 also escort and that in 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.569
 competitions like those played by 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:19.149
 selection is always very useful to have the 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:21.399
 joker of people capable of performing in the 

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:24.689
 final posts you have some input you have 

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:27.840
 you have already been called for the absolute 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:30.600
 no no tomorrow me for now 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.340
 I have to think when I get there thinking about the 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.350
 side 20 that is the one that touches me because it was and 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.060
 I know 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.490
 Then yes they will call me 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.950
 obviously it would be for me 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.530
 It would be wonderful not but 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.440
 I understand I do not know very well what was 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.990
 we wanted to call you to know how 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.970
