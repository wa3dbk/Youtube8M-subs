00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
the blog post dlb 1752 TV I walk through

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.360 
the blog post dlb 1752 TV I walk through
step-by-step<00:03:48.720> how<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.379> do<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.799> it's<00:03:50.099> very

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
step-by-step how to do that it's very

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.990 
step-by-step how to do that it's very
easy<00:03:50.609> basically<00:03:51.359> um<00:03:51.859> you<00:03:52.859> go<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.430> top<00:03:53.669> part

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
easy basically um you go to the top part

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.180 
easy basically um you go to the top part
of<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.209> HTML<00:03:54.840> code<00:03:54.870> you'll<00:03:55.620> see<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.979> long

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
of the HTML code you'll see the long

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.530 
of the HTML code you'll see the long
link<00:03:56.549> where<00:03:56.819> they're<00:03:56.940> going<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.150> direct<00:03:57.359> you

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
link where they're going to direct you

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.080 
link where they're going to direct you
to<00:03:57.629> go<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.109> then<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.859> change<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.370> part<00:03:59.879> of

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
to go and then you change that part of

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.839 
to go and then you change that part of
that<00:04:00.239> HTML<00:04:01.019> code<00:04:01.229> take<00:04:01.470> out<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.859> link<00:04:02.099> put<00:04:02.760> in

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
that HTML code take out that link put in

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.250 
that HTML code take out that link put in
the<00:04:02.940> link<00:04:03.180> where<00:04:03.389> you<00:04:03.419> where<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:03.720> want<00:04:04.139> it<00:04:04.199> to

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
the link where you where you want it to

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.890 
the link where you where you want it to
go<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.459> end<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.699> have<00:04:05.729> HTML<00:04:06.389> code<00:04:06.720> that

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
go so in the end you have HTML code that

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.960 
go so in the end you have HTML code that
has<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.260> link<00:04:07.500> where<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.739> want<00:04:07.949> it<00:04:07.979> to<00:04:08.040> go<00:04:08.310> the

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
has the link where you want it to go the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.659 
has the link where you want it to go the
HTML<00:04:09.449> code<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:10.049> directs<00:04:10.530> your<00:04:11.190> blog<00:04:11.489> or
