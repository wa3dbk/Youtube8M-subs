00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello i'm luís sousa from the video 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.430
 spectacular and in the viola of today I go 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.700
 teach making a power supply 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.590
 the most basic type possible this video 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.179
 is being done in response to the request for 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.400
 a person watching a video of mine 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.010
 channel and asked to demonstrate how 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.380
 mounts a power supply as well as 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.850
 simple as possible then it is 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.980
 that we will use few 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.019
 components I'm using here a 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.680
 plaque coming from electronics stores 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.560
 array matrix type 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.630
 I'm using two gold 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.000
 justification is you can ask 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.890
 anyone is in the electronics store 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.870
 taking into account the characteristics of the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.809
 transformer you are going to use 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.210
 It's the other equipment we're going to 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.950
 need a zin transformer of these 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.100
 where it converts to 12 volts with 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.110
 central derivation is may be from the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.730
 also if it is the ordinary you need only 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.320
 of a gold 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.250
 and we will also use a 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.829
 Electrolytic capacitor is recommended 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.830
 something around two thousand and 200 micro 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.420
 to a stable source of a 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.600
 procedure is fairly simple. 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.360
 let's first drop the 2 diamonds with 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.119
 the exit from the positive forwards or 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.729
 student will be where you will connect the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.970
 transformer yellow wires and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.009
 cathodes will be the positive output of the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.549
 power source you go after 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.820
 connect these two connectors and connect 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.280
 the capacitor is then and after 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.140
 welding of the components is the two 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 terminals in front of us will cut 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.430
 to be finished a little bit 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.470
 better and the other two terminals 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.840
 people will leave whole even to 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.450
 the transformer outputs 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.430
 which in the case will be the yellow wires 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.140
 one aspect will stay and if that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.899
 electrolytic capacitor you have to 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.549
 back to that is polarized so you 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.189
 you have to do the correct installation 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.100
 because if it is turned on it inverted it 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.770
 can even explode 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.650
 It's dangerous and that's what we're going to do. 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.210
 We're going to turn on the terminal. 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.840
 electrolytic capacitance is the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.989
 His positive between the two of diamonds in 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.900
 positive outings are and we are going 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.300
 connect these three terminals to form 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.690
 only one output that in this case will be the output 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.260
 positive then that's where you see 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.560
 welding the capacitor and note that in this 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.680
 moment I joined the three terminals 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.290
 then these three terminals together are 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.970
 equivalent to positive output and 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.340
 negative terminal of the capacitor 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.340
 electrolytic is where we'll turn on the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.010
 black wire that will be in case the series 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.630
 source negative 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.519
 it is important to note that this source of 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.680
 power supply is the simplest type of 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.680
 has not adjusted it is not regulated 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.519
 she will simply take the exit from the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.470
 that you have there about 12 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.600
 normally non- volt 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.830
 it will charge with peak attention of the 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.900
 transformer 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.680
 at the end of the video I will show the measurement 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.760
 her 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.070
 then you may notice that this 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.530
 transformer it has three outputs are 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.180
 two children black is from the yellow sons 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.459
 in rio negro 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.310
 We're going to miss those threads for 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.470
 they can stay is easier to 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.230
 weld there on the diode terminals and 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.540
 terminal of the capacitor this procedure 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.430
 It's very simple, you just put a 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.350
 weld on the tip of the iron and 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.890
 just give him a wire. 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.840
 little welder 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.150
 if you have any questions regarding 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.860
 This is just you do a test before or 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.860
 give because it has no mystery 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.100
 then there already confused stranger we go 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.350
 connects them to these terminals 2 of diamonds is 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.910
 important to note that it made yellow 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.490
 can not stay in touch with the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.260
 another because otherwise will give short will 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.900
 damage the transformer and may 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.280
 cause it's dangerous to leave you 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.319
 So this is the procedure, folks. 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.090
 turn the yellows on each 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:08.209
 every game is and the black wire we go 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.890
 release the negative terminal of the capacitor 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.769
 electrolytic he will already be there 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.660
 also isolated from the rest of the circuit at 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.000
 final appearance was more or less this 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.769
 that 's if you do not have the plaquinha 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.480
 you can drop a component in the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.120
 another that will also have the same effect 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.040
 will not work the same way 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.169
 and here I did not have a really cool wire 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.210
 to be able to exit it then 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.470
 started to show I'll even use a wire 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.020
 very thin 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.120
 It is important to note that the 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.180
 transformer can be bi volt or 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.540
 monovolt in case of my processed 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.940
 here he accepts both the 110 220 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.160
 I took a standard take money made 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.470
 the son's claim né 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.010
 and then I called to output 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.050
 source is a black movie to be 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.970
 negative is going to be turned on 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.250
 directly on the negative terrain of the 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.169
 electrolytic capacitor finally the 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.840
 orange that I had here I used 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.419
 How positive, that 's what you 're going to call 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.690
 at the positive terminal of the capacitor 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.790
 which is also connected 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.640
 positive outputs of those of other 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.590
 I recommend that you check and exit 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.479
 be thicker here as it was a 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.760
 pre- demonstration video to meet a 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.940
 the person requesting the video from the 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.380
 channel I rode with himself to stay 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.360
 like this 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.490
 At this moment I 'm doing now. 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.720
 here plug connection going on the net 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.340
 electrical 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.650
 it is important to note that when 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.630
 people mess with the electricity 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.250
 people have to be careful so take 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.590
 must be properly disconnected to 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.020
 You're in no danger of being shocked. 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.020
 I put a drop of solder and just to 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.700
 prevent this connection from loosening and 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.230
 agent isolates around with a tape 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.720
 normal 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.820
 it is important that this is well insulated 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.030
 because at that point you will have the 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:59.390
 power supply voltage and can be 110 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:01.490
 127 220 volts out there and that's a danger 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.310
 caused even life threatening 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.770
 and then to finish the video I'll make the 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.260
 measurement of the source it will be noted that 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.170
 even though it has been sold as 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.960
 12 volts actually it will deliver you 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:19.240
 in the end there is something close to 18 flights that is 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.240
 the attention of peak capacitor to charge
