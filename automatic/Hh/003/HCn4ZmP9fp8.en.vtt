00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
all clipped into place then with these

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.330 
all clipped into place then with these
seats<00:02:58.050> here<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.350> can<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.680> pull<00:02:58.920> them<00:02:59.070> in

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
seats here you can just pull them in

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.210 
seats here you can just pull them in
like<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.180> hold<00:03:00.540> them<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.840> keep<00:03:01.470> them<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:01.860> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
back here for now the same with the with

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.910 
back here for now the same with the with
the<00:03:06.060> missile<00:03:06.390> atcha<00:03:06.510> if<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.110> don't<00:03:07.290> want<00:03:07.470> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
the missile atcha if you don't want the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.100 
the missile atcha if you don't want the
mallet<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.520> gives<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.820> more<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.360> know<00:03:09.480> non

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
mallet so it gives it more you know non

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.620 
mallet so it gives it more you know non
missile<00:03:10.740> launcher<00:03:11.130> look<00:03:11.310> make<00:03:12.030> sure<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.330> arms

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
missile launcher look make sure the arms

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.410 
missile launcher look make sure the arms
are<00:03:12.810> now<00:03:12.959> rotated<00:03:13.740> right<00:03:14.400> way<00:03:14.580> here<00:03:14.910> make<00:03:15.209> sure

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
are now rotated right way here make sure

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.060 
are now rotated right way here make sure
they're<00:03:15.739> rotated<00:03:16.739> right<00:03:17.550> way<00:03:17.790> here<00:03:19.070> separate

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
they're rotated right way here separate

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.670 
they're rotated right way here separate
all<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.459> back<00:03:20.730> card<00:03:21.060> right<00:03:21.239> here<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:22.530> got

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
all this back card right here you got

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.670 
all this back card right here you got
fold<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.310> front<00:03:23.610> grille<00:03:24.000> right<00:03:24.440> in<00:03:25.440> here<00:03:25.650> I

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
fold in the front grille right in here I

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.320 
fold in the front grille right in here I
guess<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.250> want<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.580> make<00:03:26.670> sure<00:03:26.700> it's<00:03:27.090> all

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
guess so you want to make sure it's all

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330 
guess so you want to make sure it's all
locked<00:03:27.840> into<00:03:28.080> place<00:03:28.380> like<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.890> makes<00:03:29.190> you

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
locked into place like that makes you

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.310 
locked into place like that makes you
want<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.580> separate<00:03:30.030> them<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.780> want<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.050> extend

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
want to separate them you want to extend

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.650 
want to separate them you want to extend
them<00:03:31.530> out<00:03:31.680> then<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.640> want<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:32.970> rotate<00:03:33.269> this

part out like that this is very much
like<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.269> look<00:03:36.450> sideswipes<00:03:36.989> legs<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.530> then

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
like to look sideswipes legs and then

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.720 
like to look sideswipes legs and then
bring<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.580> two<00:03:39.450> out<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:41.190> then<00:03:41.340> bring<00:03:41.459> this

here<00:05:05.810> as<00:05:05.990> a<00:05:06.590> lot<00:05:06.889> of<00:05:06.979> hydraulic<00:05:07.370> parts<00:05:07.880> on<00:05:08.320> he

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
here as a lot of hydraulic parts on he

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.350 
here as a lot of hydraulic parts on he
does<00:05:09.530> kind<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:09.919> rotate<00:05:10.280> at<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.699> leg<00:05:10.910> a<00:05:11.180> little

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
does kind of rotate at the leg a little

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.159 
does kind of rotate at the leg a little
bit<00:05:11.690> not<00:05:12.260> damaged<00:05:12.710> and<00:05:12.919> this<00:05:13.460> feed<00:05:13.820> a<00:05:14.090> kind<00:05:15.050> of

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
bit not damaged and this feed a kind of

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.960 
bit not damaged and this feed a kind of
pivot<00:05:15.590> that's<00:05:15.889> why<00:05:16.010> I<00:05:16.039> does<00:05:16.310> have<00:05:16.639> some

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
pivot that's why I does have some

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.029 
pivot that's why I does have some
spinning<00:05:17.419> arm<00:05:17.690> blades<00:05:18.229> which<00:05:18.530> if<00:05:18.710> you<00:05:18.860> roll

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
spinning arm blades which if you roll

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.219 
spinning arm blades which if you roll
the<00:05:19.190> wheel<00:05:19.400> will<00:05:20.090> spin<00:05:20.120> on<00:05:20.599> there<00:05:20.810> it's<00:05:21.080> like

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
the wheel will spin on there it's like

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.440 
the wheel will spin on there it's like
so<00:05:21.650> if<00:05:21.830> he<00:05:22.010> really<00:05:22.039> is<00:05:22.550> hungry<00:05:22.940> for<00:05:23.120> some<00:05:23.270> pizza

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
so if he really is hungry for some pizza

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.900 
so if he really is hungry for some pizza
