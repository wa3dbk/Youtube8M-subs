in<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.470> sort<00:01:37.680> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
in this is because you have sort of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.069 
in this is because you have sort of
different<00:01:38.100> varieties<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.689> setups<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:39.900> this

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
different varieties of setups for this

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.719 
different varieties of setups for this
what<00:01:40.619> we'll<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.920> we'll<00:01:41.009> put<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.369> this

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729

what we'll do is we'll put this this
piece<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.720> side<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.290> second<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
piece just to one side for a second and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.069 
piece just to one side for a second and
what<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> main<00:01:45.630> piece<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
what you have the main piece is

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.690 
what you have the main piece is
obviously<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.530> suction<00:01:46.770> cup<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.280> has<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
obviously this suction cup which has a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.569 
obviously this suction cup which has a
little<00:01:48.119> cover<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.570> which<00:01:48.689> will<00:01:48.869> take<00:01:49.049> off<00:01:49.259> and

sort of ratchet system is good because
it<00:03:05.599> means<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:05.959> can<00:03:06.110> sort<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.349> use<00:03:06.530> any

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
it means that you can sort of use any

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.130 
it means that you can sort of use any
size<00:03:07.040> device<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:07.760> it's<00:03:07.880> not<00:03:08.030> limited<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.450> so

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
size device and it's not limited to so

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.410 
size device and it's not limited to so
anything<00:03:09.560> in<00:03:09.650> particular<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:11.000> what<00:03:11.120> we'll<00:03:11.239> do

anything in particular so what we'll do

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.180 
anything in particular so what we'll do
is<00:03:11.450> we'll<00:03:11.750> just<00:03:12.019> unclip<00:03:12.590> this<00:03:12.769> so<00:03:12.950> we'll<00:03:13.069> just

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
is we'll just unclip this so we'll just

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.190 
is we'll just unclip this so we'll just
press<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.549> release<00:03:13.700> which<00:03:14.060> off<00:03:14.239> C<00:03:14.420> releases

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
press the release which off C releases

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.720 
press the release which off C releases
the<00:03:15.349> phone<00:03:15.560> from<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.040> head<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.489> actual

the phone from the head of the actual
class<00:03:16.970> bear<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:18.139> what<00:03:18.290> we'll<00:03:18.410> do<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.650> we'll

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
class bear and what we'll do is we'll

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.099 
class bear and what we'll do is we'll
just<00:03:19.069> off<00:03:19.250> take<00:03:19.850> this<00:03:20.000> apart<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:20.480> then<00:03:20.660> add

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
just off take this apart and then add

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.559 
just off take this apart and then add
the<00:03:21.380> sort<00:03:21.889> of<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.040> second<00:03:22.430> second<00:03:23.209> set<00:03:23.389> up

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
the sort of the second second set up

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.170 
the sort of the second second set up
which<00:03:23.780> is<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.500> just<00:03:25.220> took<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.730> piece<00:03:25.880> upper

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
which is a and just took the piece upper

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.150 
which is a and just took the piece upper
to<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.359> side<00:03:26.569> here<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.590> we<00:03:27.739> just<00:03:27.889> put<00:03:28.040> this

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
to the side here so and we just put this

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.699 
to the side here so and we just put this
one<00:03:28.220> back<00:03:28.549> on<00:03:28.730> slightly<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.420> what<00:03:30.410> we'll<00:03:30.560> do

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
one back on slightly and what we'll do

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.009 
one back on slightly and what we'll do
now<00:03:30.980> is<00:03:31.010> we<00:03:31.700> have<00:03:31.850> this<00:03:32.000> off<00:03:32.239> long<00:03:32.510> arm<00:03:32.780> which

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
now is we have this off long arm which

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.470 
now is we have this off long arm which
actually<00:03:33.650> clips<00:03:33.889> down<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.489> into<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:35.150> piece

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
actually clips down and into this piece

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.020 
actually clips down and into this piece
so<00:03:36.230> we'll<00:03:36.769> take<00:03:37.010> all<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:37.340> apart<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:37.910> we'll

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
so we'll take all this apart and we'll

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.640 
so we'll take all this apart and we'll
take<00:03:38.239> this<00:03:38.389> set<00:03:38.660> actually<00:03:39.019> off<00:03:39.139> the<00:03:39.170> table

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
take this set actually off the table

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.460 
take this set actually off the table
here<00:03:39.859> and<00:03:40.540> what<00:03:41.540> we'll<00:03:41.690> do<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:41.989> another

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
here and what we'll do is another

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.190 
here and what we'll do is another
release<00:03:42.799> clip<00:03:43.130> on<00:03:43.370> on<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.880> back<00:03:44.060> here<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:44.329> kind

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
release clip on on the back here so kind

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.319 
release clip on on the back here so kind
of<00:03:45.319> it<00:03:45.440> is<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.560> little<00:03:45.829> bit<00:03:45.920> complicated<00:03:46.190> if<00:03:46.760> you

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
of it is a little bit complicated if you

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.490 
of it is a little bit complicated if you
know<00:03:47.450> who<00:03:47.600> you're<00:03:47.750> swapping<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.139> around<00:03:48.319> quite

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
know who you're swapping it around quite

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.470 
know who you're swapping it around quite
a<00:03:48.530> bit<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:49.250> what<00:03:49.310> we'll<00:03:49.489> do<00:03:49.579> is<00:03:49.730> this<00:03:50.120> bit<00:03:50.299> then

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
a bit so what we'll do is this bit then

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.449 
a bit so what we'll do is this bit then
clips<00:03:50.780> in<00:03:51.019> here<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:51.799> this<00:03:51.950> is<00:03:52.100> what<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:52.250> mean

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
clips in here and this is what I mean

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.129 
clips in here and this is what I mean
you<00:03:52.819> sort<00:03:53.060> of<00:03:53.090> have<00:03:53.239> this<00:03:53.420> arm<00:03:53.720> which<00:03:53.930> sort<00:03:54.109> of

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
you sort of have this arm which sort of

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.750 
you sort of have this arm which sort of
leave<00:03:54.319> us<00:03:54.500> down<00:03:54.709> so<00:03:55.010> what<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.280> would<00:03:55.370> do<00:03:55.579> is

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
leave us down so what you would do is

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.490 
leave us down so what you would do is
you'd<00:03:55.910> have<00:03:56.090> obviously<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:56.450> suction<00:03:56.900> cup<00:03:57.109> you

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
you'd have obviously the suction cup you

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.870 
you'd have obviously the suction cup you
know<00:03:57.620> on<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.920> top<00:03:58.130> of<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.370> dashboard<00:03:58.579> for

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
know on the top of the dashboard for

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.309 
know on the top of the dashboard for
example<00:03:59.329> and<00:03:59.420> then<00:03:59.510> this<00:03:59.660> bit<00:03:59.870> would<00:03:59.989> kind<00:04:00.230> of

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
example and then this bit would kind of

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.039 
example and then this bit would kind of
reach<00:04:00.920> down<00:04:01.250> over<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.910> sort<00:04:02.269> of<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.540> way<00:04:02.780> your

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
reach down over the sort of the way your

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.440 
reach down over the sort of the way your
a<00:04:03.079> your<00:04:03.470> radio<00:04:03.799> stereo<00:04:04.130> would<00:04:04.430> be<00:04:04.609> and<00:04:05.150> what

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
a your radio stereo would be and what

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.789 
a your radio stereo would be and what
you<00:04:05.540> actually<00:04:05.599> have<00:04:05.840> here<00:04:05.959> as<00:04:06.230> well<00:04:06.410> is<00:04:06.590> this

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
you actually have here as well is this

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.830 
you actually have here as well is this
board<00:04:07.400> piece<00:04:07.609> has<00:04:07.849> three<00:04:08.150> separate<00:04:08.480> holes<00:04:08.690> you

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
board piece has three separate holes you

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.569 
board piece has three separate holes you
can<00:04:08.989> actually<00:04:09.139> put<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:09.799> into<00:04:09.950> all<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.459> would

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
can actually put it into all you would

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.699 
can actually put it into all you would
do<00:04:10.760> is<00:04:10.940> just<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.720> just<00:04:11.930> sort<00:04:12.109> of<00:04:12.139> squeeze<00:04:12.380> this

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
do is just you just sort of squeeze this

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.530 
do is just you just sort of squeeze this
little<00:04:13.519> piece<00:04:13.700> behind<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.269> then<00:04:14.359> that

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
little piece behind and then that

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.330 
little piece behind and then that
releases<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:15.019> ball<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.799> then<00:04:15.919> you<00:04:16.039> can<00:04:16.190> move

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
releases the ball and then you can move

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.640 
releases the ball and then you can move
it<00:04:16.489> around<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.329> know<00:04:17.539> up<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.780> whatever

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
it around and you know up to whatever

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.920 
it around and you know up to whatever
sort<00:04:19.099> of<00:04:19.160> not<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:19.549> want<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.789> have<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.000> on<00:04:20.090> -<00:04:20.329> and

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
sort of not you want to have it on - and

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.149 
sort of not you want to have it on - and
then<00:04:21.019> what<00:04:21.139> would<00:04:21.289> do<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.560> we're<00:04:21.739> just<00:04:21.769> of

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
then what would do is we're just of

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.850 
then what would do is we're just of
unscrewing<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.180> little<00:04:23.390> bit<00:04:23.570> again<00:04:23.860> this

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
unscrewing it a little bit again this

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.280 
unscrewing it a little bit again this
will<00:04:25.070> obviously<00:04:25.159> clip<00:04:25.849> onto<00:04:26.090> this<00:04:26.360> ball<00:04:26.599> and

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
will obviously clip onto this ball and

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.080 
will obviously clip onto this ball and
the<00:04:27.350> same<00:04:27.590> way<00:04:27.770> as<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.950> last<00:04:28.100> one<00:04:28.370> did<00:04:28.550> will

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
the same way as the last one did will

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.030 
the same way as the last one did will
tighten<00:04:29.390> up<00:04:29.570> again<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.140> then<00:04:30.620> you're<00:04:30.860> good<00:04:31.010> to

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
tighten up again and then you're good to
