letting<00:02:01.710> them<00:02:01.920> go<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.880> came<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.720> this

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
guard off but it's really taught me to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.390 
guard off but it's really taught me to
let<00:02:08.670> go<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.450> hope<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.140> show<00:02:10.380> has<00:02:10.710> given<00:02:11.250> me
