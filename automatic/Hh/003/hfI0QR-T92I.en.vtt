that<00:00:37.100> we<00:00:37.309> need<00:00:37.580> so<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.120> body<00:00:38.300> can<00:00:38.450> simply<00:00:38.870> do

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
that we need so the body can simply do

that we need so the body can simply do
its<00:00:39.140> job<00:00:39.910> clearly<00:00:40.910> science<00:00:41.510> tells<00:00:41.780> us<00:00:41.960> that<00:00:42.170> we

its job clearly science tells us that we
have<00:00:42.379> specific<00:00:42.920> nutritional<00:00:43.400> requirements

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059

for<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.480> form<00:00:44.720> and<00:00:44.960> function<00:00:45.199> of<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.559> body

therefore<00:00:47.449> it<00:00:47.720> seems<00:00:47.930> reasonable<00:00:48.559> to<00:00:48.589> assume

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
therefore it seems reasonable to assume

therefore it seems reasonable to assume
that<00:00:49.100> we<00:00:49.400> need<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.790> acquire<00:00:50.059> our<00:00:50.360> baseline

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
that we need to acquire our baseline

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.329 
that we need to acquire our baseline
nutrition<00:00:51.290> from<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.530> food<00:00:51.620> we<00:00:51.800> eat<00:00:51.949> and

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
nutrition from the food we eat and

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.360 
nutrition from the food we eat and
everything<00:00:52.489> will<00:00:52.909> be<00:00:53.000> okay<00:00:53.330> I<00:00:53.949> honestly<00:00:54.949> wish

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
everything will be okay I honestly wish
