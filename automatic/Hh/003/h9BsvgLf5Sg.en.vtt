00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
read them the real problem the real

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.900 
read them the real problem the real
problem<00:03:32.170> for<00:03:32.740> this<00:03:33.960> problem<00:03:35.460> does<00:03:36.460> that<00:03:36.730> even

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
problem for this problem does that even

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.100 
problem for this problem does that even
make<00:03:37.150> sense<00:03:37.210> okay<00:03:37.630> never<00:03:37.810> mind

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
not a problem so because I have utorrent

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.150 
not a problem so because I have utorrent
everything<00:03:48.850> so<00:03:49.120> uh<00:03:49.150> there's<00:03:50.140> a<00:03:50.410> it's<00:03:50.860> not<00:03:50.980> good
