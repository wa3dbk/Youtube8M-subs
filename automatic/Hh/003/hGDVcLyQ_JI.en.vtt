back<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.959> the<00:00:16.080> robotics<00:00:16.500> tutorials<00:00:17.040> and<00:00:17.250> in

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
back to the robotics tutorials and in

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.589 
back to the robotics tutorials and in
this<00:00:18.180> video<00:00:18.450> we'll<00:00:18.750> be

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
this video we'll be

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.009 
this video we'll be
an<00:00:21.230> electrical<00:00:21.800> robot<00:00:22.339> yeah<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:23.539> what<00:00:23.779> are<00:00:23.929> the

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
an electrical robot yeah so what are the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.419 
an electrical robot yeah so what are the
things<00:00:24.230> that<00:00:24.320> you<00:00:24.560> should<00:00:24.739> be<00:00:24.769> having<00:00:25.279> with

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
things that you should be having with

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.009 
things that you should be having with
you<00:00:25.759> the<00:00:26.390> hardware<00:00:26.899> part<00:00:27.169> to<00:00:27.679> make<00:00:27.890> a<00:00:27.919> basic

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
you the hardware part to make a basic

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.430 
you the hardware part to make a basic
robot<00:00:30.019> okay<00:00:30.439> so<00:00:30.949> let's<00:00:31.219> see<00:00:31.429> one<00:00:31.640> by<00:00:31.789> one

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.440 
robot okay so let's see one by one

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:39.250 
robot okay so let's see one by one
briefly<00:00:33.440> okay<00:00:33.769> so<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.850> component<00:00:38.260> required

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
briefly okay so the component required

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.639 
briefly okay so the component required
okay<00:00:39.890> as<00:00:40.280> I've<00:00:40.729> already<00:00:40.940> told<00:00:41.300> in<00:00:41.600> in<00:00:42.350> the

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
okay as I've already told in in the

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.860 
okay as I've already told in in the
beginning<00:00:42.979> of<00:00:43.129> offs<00:00:43.820> of<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.479> other<00:00:44.629> video

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
beginning of offs of the other video

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.889 
beginning of offs of the other video
that<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:46.430> robotics<00:00:46.940> that<00:00:47.479> we<00:00:47.629> are<00:00:47.690> going<00:00:47.839> to

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
that the robotics that we are going to

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.810 
that the robotics that we are going to
deal<00:00:48.199> with<00:00:48.229> is<00:00:48.979> going<00:00:49.250> to<00:00:49.339> work<00:00:49.489> with<00:00:49.699> the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
deal with is going to work with the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.090 
deal with is going to work with the
principle<00:00:50.269> of<00:00:50.360> stimulus<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:50.989> response<00:00:51.100> right

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
principle of stimulus and response right

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.450 
principle of stimulus and response right
so<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:54.110> one<00:00:54.320> of<00:00:54.439> the<00:00:54.559> things<00:00:54.739> that<00:00:54.949> we<00:00:55.280> need

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
so the one of the things that we need

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.750 
so the one of the things that we need
for

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.970 

Korea<00:00:58.360> implemented<00:00:59.200> in<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.380> hardware<00:00:59.740> form

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
Korea implemented in a hardware form

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.880 
Korea implemented in a hardware form
right<00:01:00.280> so<00:01:01.090> first<00:01:01.450> of<00:01:01.660> all<00:01:01.840> we<00:01:02.230> need<00:01:02.410> a<00:01:02.590> set<00:01:02.860> of

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
right so first of all we need a set of

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.150 
right so first of all we need a set of
sensors<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.510> these<00:01:04.720> sensors<00:01:05.290> what<00:01:05.680> they<00:01:05.800> do<00:01:05.950> is

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
sensors so these sensors what they do is

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.890 
sensors so these sensors what they do is
they<00:01:06.370> catch<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.880> stimulus<00:01:07.390> from<00:01:07.810> the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
they catch the stimulus from the

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.190 
they catch the stimulus from the
environment<00:01:08.560> okay<00:01:08.800> so<00:01:09.520> let's<00:01:10.480> say<00:01:10.690> I'm<00:01:11.020> going

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
environment okay so let's say I'm going

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.800 
environment okay so let's say I'm going
to<00:01:11.530> talk<00:01:11.710> in<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:13.000> respect<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.450> our<00:01:13.600> line

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
to talk in with respect to our line

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.290 
to talk in with respect to our line
basic<00:01:14.410> line<00:01:14.620> following<00:01:15.040> robot<00:01:15.190> okay<00:01:16.060> a<00:01:16.090> line

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
basic line following robot okay a line

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.730 
basic line following robot okay a line
following<00:01:16.450> robot<00:01:16.630> is<00:01:17.050> nothing<00:01:17.350> but<00:01:17.470> our<00:01:17.710> own

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
following robot is nothing but our own

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.340 
following robot is nothing but our own
autonomous<00:01:18.610> bar<00:01:18.910> you<00:01:19.479> know<00:01:19.570> robot<00:01:20.020> that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
autonomous bar you know robot that

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.740 
autonomous bar you know robot that
detects<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.130> followers<00:01:21.610> are<00:01:21.760> lying<00:01:21.970> on<00:01:22.210> the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
detects and followers are lying on the

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.620 
detects and followers are lying on the
floor<00:01:23.020> okay<00:01:23.410> so<00:01:24.340> what<00:01:24.729> are<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.940> senses<00:01:25.420> that

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
floor okay so what are the senses that

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.810 
floor okay so what are the senses that
does<00:01:25.990> these<00:01:26.260> are<00:01:26.530> do<00:01:27.190> these<00:01:27.340> line<00:01:27.550> for<00:01:27.760> no

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
does these are do these line for no

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.150 
does these are do these line for no
robot<00:01:28.090> senses<00:01:28.420> so<00:01:28.600> first<00:01:29.320> of<00:01:29.440> all<00:01:29.620> so<00:01:29.920> the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
robot senses so first of all so the

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.710 
robot senses so first of all so the
components<00:01:30.880> will<00:01:31.000> be<00:01:31.150> sensors<00:01:33.330> so<00:01:34.330> what<00:01:34.690> I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
components will be sensors so what I

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.810 
components will be sensors so what I
mean<00:01:34.960> by<00:01:35.140> sensors<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:35.650> these<00:01:36.220> are<00:01:36.369> electrical

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
mean by sensors is these are electrical

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.590 
mean by sensors is these are electrical
components<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.570> are<00:01:37.750> made

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
components that are made

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.250 
components that are made
right<00:01:40.170> okay<00:01:40.590> I'll<00:01:41.070> show<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.760> sensor<00:01:42.260> like

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
right okay I'll show you one sensor like

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.370 
right okay I'll show you one sensor like
that<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.550> this<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.810> thing<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.170> see

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that you see this this thing you see

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.370 
that you see this this thing you see
here<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.370> line<00:01:48.090> following<00:01:48.380> infrared

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
here it is a line following infrared

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.609 
here it is a line following infrared
sensor<00:01:49.979> okay<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.910> this<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:52.260> of<00:01:52.440> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
sensor okay so this is one of the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.160 
sensor okay so this is one of the
sensors<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.940> using<00:01:54.150> later<00:01:54.300> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
sensors that we will be using later the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.570 
sensors that we will be using later the
and<00:01:55.740> now<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.810> next<00:01:57.960> part<00:01:58.260> would<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.619> after<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
and now the next part would be after the

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.790 
and now the next part would be after the
sensor<00:01:59.940> has<00:02:00.180> catch<00:02:00.570> something<00:02:01.050> so<00:02:01.259> need<00:02:01.410> we

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
sensor has catch something so need we

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.040 
sensor has catch something so need we
need<00:02:01.950> some<00:02:02.280> processing<00:02:02.820> power<00:02:03.060> right<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.900> our

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
need some processing power right for our

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.200 
need some processing power right for our
robot<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.830> process<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.520> actual<00:02:05.970> information

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
robot to process the actual information

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.350 
robot to process the actual information
cache<00:02:06.720> by<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.320> sensors<00:02:07.830> right<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.789> for<00:02:09.240> that

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
cache by the sensors right so for that

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.420 
cache by the sensors right so for that
we<00:02:09.630> will<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:10.020> building<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.830> processing

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
we will be building the processing

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.100 
we will be building the processing
processing<00:02:11.910> part<00:02:12.270> okay

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
processing part okay

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.180 
processing part okay
the<00:02:13.709> processing<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.720> will<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.980> this

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
the processing so I will be in this

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.860 
the processing so I will be in this
series<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.790> tutorial

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870

the domes mean here don't worry about it
we'll<00:02:26.590> explain<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.160> later<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:28.080> first<00:02:29.080> thing

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
we'll explain it later so first thing

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.770 
we'll explain it later so first thing
the<00:02:29.590> processing<00:02:30.129> part<00:02:30.370> we<00:02:30.819> have<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.420> times

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.770 

then<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.930> have<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.379> CPU<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.280> is<00:02:37.120> using<00:02:37.660> the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
then you have the CPU that is using the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.199 
then you have the CPU that is using the
micro<00:02:38.140> controller<00:02:38.500> or<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.830> microprocessor

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
micro controller or a microprocessor

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.190 
micro controller or a microprocessor
okay<00:02:40.799> so<00:02:42.150> I'll<00:02:43.150> show<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.450> how<00:02:43.569> these<00:02:43.930> things

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
okay so I'll show you how these things

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.619 
okay so I'll show you how these things
look<00:02:44.349> so<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:44.920> will<00:02:45.310> be<00:02:45.459> after<00:02:45.879> though<00:02:46.060> after

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
look so you will be after though after

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.839 
look so you will be after though after
having<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.140> sensors<00:02:47.680> part<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.519> will<00:02:48.670> be

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
having the sensors part you will be

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.990 
having the sensors part you will be
having<00:02:49.239> something<00:02:49.720> like<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.080> this<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.739> a

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
having something like this this is a

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.890 
having something like this this is a
motherboard<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.299> is<00:02:52.420> called<00:02:52.599> a<00:02:52.660> motherboard

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
motherboard this is called a motherboard

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.339 
motherboard this is called a motherboard
you<00:02:53.230> have<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> processing<00:02:54.310> unit<00:02:54.459> here<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.480> don't

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
you have a processing unit here so don't

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.660 
you have a processing unit here so don't
worry<00:02:56.410> about<00:02:56.590> all<00:02:56.890> this<00:02:57.069> we'll<00:02:57.340> explain

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
worry about all this we'll explain

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.880 
worry about all this we'll explain
everything<00:02:57.880> in<00:02:58.510> detail<00:02:58.989> about<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.380> later<00:02:59.590> so

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
everything in detail about it later so

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.479 
everything in detail about it later so
your<00:03:00.489> part<00:03:00.819> now<00:03:01.150> has<00:03:01.420> yeah<00:03:01.900> our<00:03:02.489> processing

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
your part now has yeah our processing

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.119 
your part now has yeah our processing
unit<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:04.110> motherboard<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.319> mean<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.769> motherboard

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
unit a motherboard I mean a motherboard

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.569 
unit a motherboard I mean a motherboard
of<00:03:06.489> Rawson<00:03:06.790> unit<00:03:07.030> sensors<00:03:07.660> okay<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.549> coming<00:03:09.549> to

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
of Rawson unit sensors okay so coming to

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.699 
of Rawson unit sensors okay so coming to
third<00:03:09.940> part<00:03:10.299> what<00:03:10.930> your<00:03:11.079> robot<00:03:11.319> consists

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
third part what your robot consists

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.949 
third part what your robot consists
office<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.250> actuators<00:03:12.849> right<00:03:13.090> something

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
office the actuators right something

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.539 
office the actuators right something
that<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:16.410> processing<00:03:17.410> unit<00:03:17.680> signals<00:03:18.310> and

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
that the processing unit signals and

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.289 
that the processing unit signals and
this<00:03:19.349> actuators<00:03:20.349> actually<00:03:21.129> you<00:03:21.700> know<00:03:21.819> perform

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
this actuators actually you know perform

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.770 
this actuators actually you know perform
the<00:03:23.130> mechanical<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.639> know<00:03:24.760> stuff<00:03:25.420> that<00:03:25.450> is

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
the mechanical you know stuff that is

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.289 
the mechanical you know stuff that is
moving<00:03:26.139> some<00:03:26.769> somewhere<00:03:27.310> or<00:03:27.519> rotating<00:03:28.150> the

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
moving some somewhere or rotating the

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.030 
moving some somewhere or rotating the
wheels<00:03:28.600> or<00:03:28.780> something<00:03:29.079> like<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.260> so<00:03:29.889> the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
wheels or something like that so the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.910 
wheels or something like that so the
actuators<00:03:30.609> are<00:03:30.790> nothing<00:03:31.090> but<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.739> let's<00:03:32.739> say

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
actuators are nothing but of let's say

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.440 
actuators are nothing but of let's say
in<00:03:33.069> a<00:03:33.160> basic<00:03:33.489> robot<00:03:33.760> you'll<00:03:33.910> be<00:03:34.030> using

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
in a basic robot you'll be using

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.000 
in a basic robot you'll be using
actuators<00:03:35.049> like<00:03:35.260> these<00:03:35.470> ones<00:03:35.739> these<00:03:35.950> are

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
actuators like these ones these are

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.640 
actuators like these ones these are
nothing<00:03:36.519> but<00:03:36.670> a<00:03:36.819> 12<00:03:37.090> volt<00:03:37.420> or<00:03:37.690> DC<00:03:38.260> electric

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
nothing but a 12 volt or DC electric

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.759 
nothing but a 12 volt or DC electric
motors<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.519> these<00:03:39.670> are<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.030> actuators<00:03:40.510> here

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
motors so these are the actuators here

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.770 
motors so these are the actuators here
okay<00:03:41.769> so<00:03:42.040> these<00:03:42.400> are<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.730> main<00:03:42.940> three<00:03:43.389> parts

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
okay so these are the main three parts

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.620 
okay so these are the main three parts
of<00:03:43.900> our<00:03:44.260> row<00:03:44.769> LX<00:03:45.130> electronic<00:03:45.819> robot<00:03:46.150> okay

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
of our row LX electronic robot okay

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.140 
of our row LX electronic robot okay
so<00:03:47.170> let's<00:03:47.590> see<00:03:47.769> all<00:03:48.099> the<00:03:48.400> other<00:03:48.549> components

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
so let's see all the other components

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.819 
so let's see all the other components
that<00:03:49.269> we<00:03:49.480> will<00:03:49.599> be<00:03:49.750> actually<00:03:50.260> needing<00:03:50.560> to

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
that we will be actually needing to

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.159 
that we will be actually needing to
build<00:03:51.280> your<00:03:51.489> own<00:03:51.609> robot<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:52.239> am<00:03:52.660> talking<00:03:53.079> about

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
build your own robot I am talking about

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.349 
build your own robot I am talking about
custom<00:03:53.889> robot<00:03:54.250> okay<00:03:54.519> now<00:03:54.700> if<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.060> are<00:03:55.150> going

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
custom robot okay now if you are going

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.900 
custom robot okay now if you are going
to<00:03:55.450> take<00:03:56.380> an<00:03:56.500> option<00:03:56.829> of<00:03:56.950> getting<00:03:57.220> on<00:03:57.609> a

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
to take an option of getting on a

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.120 
to take an option of getting on a
prebuilt<00:03:58.480> robotic<00:03:58.959> kit<00:03:59.200> then<00:03:59.739> you<00:03:59.859> won't<00:04:00.069> be

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
prebuilt robotic kit then you won't be

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.550 
prebuilt robotic kit then you won't be
needing<00:04:00.220> all<00:04:00.639> this<00:04:00.849> this<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.630> only<00:04:01.870> for<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:02.380> you

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
needing all this this is only for if you

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.839 
needing all this this is only for if you
have<00:04:02.769> if<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.160> want<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.400> build<00:04:03.579> your<00:04:03.669> own

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
have if you want to build your own

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.640 
have if you want to build your own
custom<00:04:04.090> robot<00:04:04.630> using<00:04:04.930> your<00:04:05.079> own<00:04:05.200> PCB

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
custom robot using your own PCB

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.809 
custom robot using your own PCB
soldering<00:04:06.130> them<00:04:06.849> you<00:04:07.239> know<00:04:07.359> etc<00:04:07.750> so

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
soldering them you know etc so

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.550 
soldering them you know etc so
the<00:04:10.209> first<00:04:10.629> thing<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.900> should<00:04:11.049> be<00:04:11.260> knowing

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
the first thing you should be knowing

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.789 
the first thing you should be knowing
about<00:04:11.739> is<00:04:12.569> this<00:04:13.569> is<00:04:13.750> something<00:04:13.959> called<00:04:14.349> as<00:04:14.530> the

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
about is this is something called as the

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.740 
about is this is something called as the
general<00:04:15.159> purpose<00:04:15.609> board<00:04:15.939> okay<00:04:16.449> this<00:04:16.630> is

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
general purpose board okay this is

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.520 
general purpose board okay this is
called<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.139> GPB<00:04:17.620> so<00:04:18.609> this<00:04:19.359> is<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.600> nothing<00:04:20.380> but

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
called the GPB so this is a nothing but

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.249 
called the GPB so this is a nothing but
a<00:04:20.560> board<00:04:20.859> with<00:04:21.160> copper<00:04:21.759> holes<00:04:22.720> here<00:04:22.960> with<00:04:23.229> a

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
a board with copper holes here with a

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.879 
a board with copper holes here with a
copper<00:04:23.639> cladded<00:04:24.639> holes<00:04:25.150> here<00:04:25.509> so<00:04:25.690> that<00:04:26.350> you

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
copper cladded holes here so that you

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.920 
copper cladded holes here so that you
will<00:04:26.979> be<00:04:27.160> able<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.580> mount<00:04:27.850> your<00:04:28.120> sensors<00:04:28.690> or

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
will be able to mount your sensors or

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.230 
will be able to mount your sensors or
wrong<00:04:29.199> other<00:04:29.560> electronic<00:04:30.160> stuff<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:31.060> can

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
wrong other electronic stuff and you can

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.600 
wrong other electronic stuff and you can
solder<00:04:31.479> them<00:04:31.870> in<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.620> fashion<00:04:33.009> that<00:04:33.130> you<00:04:33.310> need

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
solder them in the fashion that you need

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.790 
solder them in the fashion that you need
to<00:04:33.789> make<00:04:33.970> your<00:04:34.150> circuit<00:04:34.570> work<00:04:34.750> right<00:04:35.139> so<00:04:35.320> this

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
to make your circuit work right so this

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.210 
to make your circuit work right so this
is<00:04:35.949> called<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.250> GPB<00:04:36.729> and<00:04:36.940> maybe<00:04:37.810> if<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.259> up<00:04:38.830> for

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
is called a GPB and maybe if you up for

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.140 
is called a GPB and maybe if you up for
a<00:04:39.630> much<00:04:40.630> neater<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.590> know<00:04:41.680> thing<00:04:42.430> then<00:04:42.910> this

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
a much neater you know thing then this

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.909 
a much neater you know thing then this
is<00:04:43.270> called<00:04:43.509> a<00:04:43.599> PCB<00:04:44.139> which<00:04:44.349> is<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:44.500> printed

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
is called a PCB which is a printed

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.100 
is called a PCB which is a printed
circuit<00:04:45.070> board<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.630> printed<00:04:46.960> circuit

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
circuit board so the printed circuit

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.640 
circuit board so the printed circuit
board<00:04:47.289> is<00:04:47.710> like<00:04:47.919> um<00:04:48.190> you<00:04:48.970> have<00:04:49.150> copper<00:04:49.650> first

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
board is like um you have copper first

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.320 
board is like um you have copper first
you<00:04:50.830> have<00:04:51.009> copper<00:04:51.340> in<00:04:51.550> this<00:04:51.699> whole<00:04:51.880> area<00:04:52.210> and

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
you have copper in this whole area and

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.330 
you have copper in this whole area and
then<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:53.050> actually<00:04:53.530> make<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.800> design<00:04:54.160> of<00:04:54.310> your

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
then you actually make a design of your

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.420 
then you actually make a design of your
own<00:04:54.520> for<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.180> connections<00:04:55.860> and/or<00:04:56.860> then<00:04:57.130> you

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
own for the connections and/or then you

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.980 
own for the connections and/or then you
etch<00:04:57.699> it<00:04:57.729> there<00:04:58.300> is<00:04:58.360> something<00:04:58.630> called<00:04:58.720> as<00:04:58.870> the

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
etch it there is something called as the

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.140 
etch it there is something called as the
etching<00:04:59.380> of<00:04:59.560> copper<00:05:00.039> so<00:05:00.460> using<00:05:00.729> that

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
etching of copper so using that

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.999 
etching of copper so using that
principle<00:05:01.330> you<00:05:01.690> will<00:05:01.810> etch<00:05:01.990> this<00:05:02.259> and<00:05:02.440> make<00:05:02.979> a

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
principle you will etch this and make a

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.650 
principle you will etch this and make a
printed<00:05:03.430> circuit<00:05:03.729> board<00:05:03.940> so<00:05:04.300> that<00:05:04.509> you<00:05:04.599> will

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
printed circuit board so that you will

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.659 
printed circuit board so that you will
fit<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.139> electronic<00:05:05.830> components<00:05:06.340> here<00:05:06.490> and

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
fit the electronic components here and

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.930 
fit the electronic components here and
you'll<00:05:06.849> have<00:05:07.440> with<00:05:08.440> proper<00:05:09.400> connections<00:05:09.820> on

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
you'll have with proper connections on

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.860 
you'll have with proper connections on
the<00:05:10.000> other<00:05:10.360> side

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
the other side

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.920 
the other side
okay<00:05:11.590> that<00:05:12.009> was<00:05:12.310> about<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.849> PCB<00:05:13.449> and<00:05:13.720> the

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
okay that was about the PCB and the

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.040 
okay that was about the PCB and the
connections<00:05:14.380> now<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:16.090> will<00:05:16.270> also<00:05:16.389> you<00:05:16.690> have

the<00:06:25.729> custom<00:06:26.030> robot<00:06:26.330> you<00:06:26.449> will<00:06:26.599> absolutely

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
the custom robot you will absolutely

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.809 
the custom robot you will absolutely
leading<00:06:27.979> this<00:06:28.130> this<00:06:28.370> is<00:06:28.490> called<00:06:28.639> as<00:06:28.789> the

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819 
leading this this is called as the

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:29.770 
leading this this is called as the
multimeter

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
multimeter

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.290 
multimeter
so<00:06:30.289> the<00:06:30.410> multimeter<00:06:30.919> is<00:06:31.220> used<00:06:31.490> to<00:06:31.729> measure<00:06:32.180> the

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
so the multimeter is used to measure the

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.050 
so the multimeter is used to measure the
voltages<00:06:32.990> the<00:06:33.199> current<00:06:33.560> etc<00:06:34.160> in<00:06:34.430> your<00:06:34.699> circuit

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
voltages the current etc in your circuit

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.270 
voltages the current etc in your circuit

robot and this these are the components

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.219 
robot and this these are the components
that<00:06:46.039> are<00:06:46.190> basic<00:06:46.580> robot<00:06:46.970> will<00:06:47.539> consist<00:06:47.990> off

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
that are basic robot will consist off

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:51.490
