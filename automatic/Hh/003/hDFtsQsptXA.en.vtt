the buttons on the steering wheel dig

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.830 
the buttons on the steering wheel dig
into<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.790> setup<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.090> sound<00:01:36.330> system<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
into this setup for the sound system and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.940 
into this setup for the sound system and
you'll<00:01:36.990> also<00:01:37.080> find<00:01:37.410> control<00:01:38.280> over<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> audio

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
wipe

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.040 
wipe
so<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.980> automatic<00:03:10.599> rain<00:03:11.599> sensing<00:03:11.989> wipers

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
so the automatic rain sensing wipers

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.020 
so the automatic rain sensing wipers
system<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:12.950> intermittent<00:03:13.520> system<00:03:13.880> you

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
system and the intermittent system you

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.150 
system and the intermittent system you
can<00:03:14.180> kind<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.720> control<00:03:15.020> independently<00:03:15.920> there

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
can kind of control independently there

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.130 
can kind of control independently there
so<00:03:17.090> it's<00:03:17.209> quite<00:03:17.330> a<00:03:17.390> lot<00:03:17.569> of<00:03:17.720> different

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
so it's quite a lot of different

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.449 
so it's quite a lot of different
functionality<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.069> have<00:03:19.220> there

functionality that you have there

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.580
