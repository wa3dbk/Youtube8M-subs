00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
it's talking about right here but oh my

it's talking about right here but oh my
gosh<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.880> gave<00:03:06.030> me<00:03:06.150> such<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> hard<00:03:06.750> time<00:03:07.010> last

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
gosh it gave me such a hard time last

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.560 
gosh it gave me such a hard time last
night<00:03:08.340> because<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:08.730> don't<00:03:08.880> like<00:03:09.030> extremely

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
night because I don't like extremely

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.080 
night because I don't like extremely
long<00:03:09.900> hair<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.310> gets<00:03:11.460> caught<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:11.820> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
long hair and so it gets caught in the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.080 
long hair and so it gets caught in the
seat<00:03:12.360> bill<00:03:12.630> gets<00:03:13.110> caught<00:03:13.350> when<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.650> sit<00:03:13.950> down

seat bill gets caught when you sit down
so<00:03:15.090> yeah<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.540> think<00:03:15.660> could<00:03:16.500> knit<00:03:16.830> would<00:03:17.280> be<00:03:17.430> good

longer<00:04:02.220> than<00:04:02.250> what<00:04:02.850> was<00:04:03.030> mentioned<00:04:03.270> so<00:04:03.870> that's

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
longer than what was mentioned so that's

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.600 
longer than what was mentioned so that's
the<00:04:04.140> only<00:04:04.170> negative<00:04:04.920> thing<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:05.220> would<00:04:05.340> have<00:04:05.459> to

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
the only negative thing I would have to

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.360 
the only negative thing I would have to
say<00:04:05.640> about<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.900> didn't<00:04:07.350> quite<00:04:07.620> match

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
say about it is it didn't quite match

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.300 
say about it is it didn't quite match

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
celo it out now that I have it I see why

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.170 
celo it out now that I have it I see why
I<00:04:25.810> typically<00:04:26.199> stick<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.889> black<00:04:27.370> hair<00:04:27.729> or

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
I typically stick to the black hair or

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.140 
I typically stick to the black hair or
the<00:04:28.240> because<00:04:29.199> I<00:04:29.440> just<00:04:29.860> can't<00:04:30.430> get<00:04:30.669> into<00:04:30.970> this

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
the because I just can't get into this

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.760 
the because I just can't get into this
color<00:04:31.539> or<00:04:31.780> something<00:04:32.169> I<00:04:32.229> don't<00:04:32.289> know<00:04:32.440> what<00:04:32.650> it

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
color or something I don't know what it

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.129 
color or something I don't know what it
is<00:04:32.889> about<00:04:32.949> it<00:04:33.340> if<00:04:33.639> it's<00:04:33.879> the<00:04:34.000> length<00:04:34.240> is<00:04:34.659> it<00:04:34.900> if

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
is about it if it's the length is it if

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.140 
is about it if it's the length is it if
it's<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.560> color<00:04:35.860> but<00:04:36.220> that's<00:04:36.819> not<00:04:36.970> the

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
website by at all well I guess the

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.309 
website by at all well I guess the
county<00:04:39.069> is<00:04:39.220> because<00:04:39.669> like<00:04:40.270> I<00:04:40.419> said<00:04:40.479> I<00:04:40.930> showed

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
county is because like I said I showed

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.749 
county is because like I said I showed
you<00:04:41.470> guys<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.650> picture<00:04:42.069> of<00:04:42.159> havoc<00:04:42.520> on<00:04:42.639> the

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
you guys the picture of havoc on the

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.760 
you guys the picture of havoc on the
site<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.240> this<00:04:43.690> part<00:04:44.020> was<00:04:44.199> more<00:04:44.409> of<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.560> like<00:04:44.740> a

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
site and this part was more of a like a

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.999 
site and this part was more of a like a
honey<00:04:45.129> blonde<00:04:45.460> not<00:04:45.699> this<00:04:45.970> Barbie<00:04:46.539> line<00:04:46.780> and<00:04:47.199> it

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
honey blonde not this Barbie line and it

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.029 
honey blonde not this Barbie line and it
did<00:04:48.370> not<00:04:48.550> look<00:04:48.789> this<00:04:49.000> long<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.169> just<00:04:50.800> did<00:04:51.009> a

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
did not look this long so I just did a

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.520 
did not look this long so I just did a
really<00:04:51.340> messy<00:04:51.699> messy<00:04:52.240> one<00:04:52.449> curl<00:04:52.900> thing<00:04:53.229> with

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
really messy messy one curl thing with

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.040 
really messy messy one curl thing with
it<00:04:53.770> to<00:04:54.280> try<00:04:54.430> to<00:04:54.490> look<00:04:54.699> presentable<00:04:54.970> I<00:04:55.599> even

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
it to try to look presentable I even

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.020 
it to try to look presentable I even
think<00:04:56.319> that<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:56.710> probably<00:04:56.740> would<00:04:57.460> look<00:04:57.669> better

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
think that it probably would look better

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.740 
think that it probably would look better
to<00:04:58.419> me<00:04:58.449> if<00:04:59.199> I<00:05:00.240> move<00:05:01.240> my<00:05:01.479> part<00:05:02.130> let's<00:05:03.130> try<00:05:03.280> that

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
to me if I move my part let's try that

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.740 
to me if I move my part let's try that
maybe<00:05:04.750> it's<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.110> center<00:05:05.560> part<00:05:06.270> gotta<00:05:07.270> hang

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
maybe it's the center part gotta hang

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.529 
maybe it's the center part gotta hang
with<00:05:08.229> these<00:05:08.380> combs<00:05:08.800> okay<00:05:09.490> it<00:05:09.940> does<00:05:10.150> have<00:05:10.330> two

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
with these combs okay it does have two

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.480 
with these combs okay it does have two
comes<00:05:10.780> right<00:05:11.020> here<00:05:11.319> and<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:11.650> adjustable<00:05:12.099> strap

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
comes right here and it adjustable strap

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.879 
comes right here and it adjustable strap
in<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:12.669> back<00:05:12.819> so<00:05:13.300> maybe<00:05:14.110> that's<00:05:14.530> what<00:05:14.740> it<00:05:14.770> is

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
in the back so maybe that's what it is

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.779 
in the back so maybe that's what it is
I'm<00:05:15.550> not<00:05:15.819> used<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.419> whole<00:05:17.759> middle<00:05:18.759> part

I'm not used to the whole middle part
things<00:05:19.449> so<00:05:21.750> maybe<00:05:22.750> this<00:05:23.050> is<00:05:23.259> what<00:05:23.500> it<00:05:23.620> is<00:05:24.030> so

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
things so maybe this is what it is so

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.589 
things so maybe this is what it is so
