00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 I'm in a carcavilla, one of my classmates 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.180
 of Carlos Soria in his 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.890
 expeditions to the Himalayas has had to 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.260
 live from Madrid the attempt to 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.880
 parasite the summit of Annapurna 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.620
 Carlos's decision could not be more 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.089
 successful taking into account the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.830
 conditions faced by the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.000
 abulense to be able to climb a mountain of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.560
 this needs two situations first 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.119
 good weather and second that the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.500
 Mountain after the last snowfall 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.869
 that I had had is in good 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.640
 conditions and in this case what 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.140
 It seemed like the weather was good but 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 the conditions that there was especially in 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489
 snow between fields 2 3 3 and 4 of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.200
 all and 3 well not enough 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.270
 good then you take much longer 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.410
 it needs much more effort and consumes 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.700
 much more energy than I had 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.360
 planned in one of those fields 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.360
 intermediates 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.530
 security has returned to be the line 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.539
 red that Carlos Soria has never wanted 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.059
 to transfer and for which it has become 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.280
 likewise in the legend of mountaineering 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.440
 that is the main peculiarity of 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.510
 carlos clarifying and it is the way that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.920
 has to understand it and to read it and I 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.390
 I always tell him jokingly that he is 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.359
 the smartest school playground 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.559
 because there are a lot of people start to 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.210
 make good another world goes crazy 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.280
 where do you want to go 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.920
 but let's wait two or three days or 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.560
 does not say now is the time it reads very well 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.800
 the mountain and the weather it does and I 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.320
 I fully trust that 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.120
 The decisions you have made have 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.410
 proved that they have been successful 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.420
 even the first time I was not 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.550
 unconvinced because then time will 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.590
 He gave the reason that it was not the best time 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.480
 to see his life this we know this 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.360
 of climbing mountains in himalayas is not and the 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.430
 you go up and that's it, but the normal thing is 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.730
 raise an eight-thousandth of every three or four 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.770
 attempts that is good as sometimes sometimes 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.630
 get and sometimes not the important thing is 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.670
 that get back home all 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.220
 Carlos is precisely characterized by 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.950
 his way of thinking by his way of seeing 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.960
 the mountains and for their patience and the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.090
 himalayism is a game many times of 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.220
 patience you have to wait for the moment 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.080
 and others with which I believe that no other 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.310
 thing is that at the time, yes, it 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.110
 I was disappointed because it was a very 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.870
 good opportunity and now the things every 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.100
 Once time goes against but 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.840
 I believe that it will not be affected 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.700
 psychologically everyone recognizes 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.790
 his experience and his way of seeing the 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.830
 things then it is a reference to his 73 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.900
 years Carlos Soria has once again demonstrated 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.180
 that the years do not go through it and it has 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.690
 elbowed once again with the elite of 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.750
 mountaineering world times so come on me 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.240
 in fact 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.460
 like here 25 times with the 5 traditions 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.990
 with him and the first the second one 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.560
 I was I was 34 and 68 was twice as 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.880
 my age 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.560
 we laughed we said we were a 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.520
 expedition of three people of thirty 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.140
 years and I and he was worth two never 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.760
 note any difference with respect to 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.160
 other partners when I was happy 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.620
 with other friends 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.810
 we forget that she is that age and 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.970
 true is that a climber as a gift 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.220
 Bowie is so impressed by Carlos 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.920
 that's a sign that it's not only 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.270
 spectacular for people on foot not 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.010
 that we are not putting this world but 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.200
 that the professionals are also 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.630
 conscious of the stratospheric ones that 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.580
 is a person 73 years this is for 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.580
 there and in that way
