00:00:01.279 --> 00:00:05.430
 Good evening, Roni. Behind me is the school of Rantisi. 

00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:08.303
 Hamas Martyrs High School 

00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:11.560
 This school is considered the Cambridge Shahid 

00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:14.829
 students are trained and receive the required qualifications 

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:17.557
 We joined them in order 

00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:19.077
 to spend a day shahid life 

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:19.795
 - Greetings 

00:00:21.043 --> 00:00:22.161
 -Why do you want to be a shahid? 

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:26.491
 All my friends were shahids. Because of this, I have no friends left 

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:28.347
 in the end how much can you stay at home 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.282
 I want to go out 

00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:32.284
 -And in general, I have never been in Tel Aviv 

00:00:32.827 --> 00:00:33.583
 - passed 

00:00:34.193 --> 00:00:35.648
 Everyone is sleeping now 

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:38.584
 Rise Alla Rise! 

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:42.868
 run faster! 

00:00:44.707 --> 00:00:45.796
 - I haven't had my morning coffee yet 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.375
 The course is divided into two parts, theory and practice. 

00:00:54.864 --> 00:00:57.440
 course discipline is one of strict 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:58.504
 -Jabar 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:59.223
 -there 

00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:00.838
 -Muhamad 

00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:01.613
 -there 

00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:03.338
 -Muhamad 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:03.898
 -there 

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:05.343
 -Muhamad 

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:06.304
 -there 

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:09.711
 -Why there is no Muhammad? 

00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:12.229
 -Where is Muhamad? Muhamad did not come today 

00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:15.606
 Welcome to AAADDD 

00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:17.287
 -How what the hell? Did you say paradise 

00:01:17.422 --> 00:01:20.279
 -Quiet! You do not speak when I speak, it is clear! 

00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:20.916
 -Yes 

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:21.504
 -What "yes? 

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:23.078
 -Yes a bird 

00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:31.100
 To be effective, you must understand 

00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:34.141
 that there are several types of residents in Israel 

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:39.188
 Russian, they are the most useless, but it is preferable to guest workers 

00:01:39.705 --> 00:01:41.987
 But the most useless are the Jewish settlers. 

00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:44.561
 no sense explode next to them 

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:47.214
 because they will never remove the transmission to Dudu Topaz to tell about it 

00:01:47.853 --> 00:01:49.127
 We now turn to the places of terrorist attacks. 

00:01:49.782 --> 00:01:50.704
 What places do you know? 

00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:52.151
 Yes, Jamal 

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:52.835
 -Buses 

00:01:52.977 --> 00:01:53.865
 - Great, what else? 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.103
 -Cafe 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.661
 -Very good jabar 

00:01:56.837 --> 00:01:57.412
 OK, what else? 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.808
 -Buses 

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:00.576
 -It was already. What else? 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.853
 -Cafe 

00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:04.076
 -Good. What else? 

00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:04.993
 -Buses 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.993
 -! "â„–;%:? *: *% :) 

00:02:08.992 --> 00:02:09.868
 -Buses 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.014
 -A beautiful academy you opened 

00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:13.382
 Yes, we work hard 

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:21.413
 Jabar is not an excellent student. I assume if we had a class for the difficult 

00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:23.619
 then Jabar would have merged well in him 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.527
 But he is procreative 

00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:28.538
 his father was a shahid, his grandfather was a shahid 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.191
 and great-grandfather was also a shahid 

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:35.727
 The academy conducts simulations to rehearse real situations. 

00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:38.694
 We have to go through security. What to do? 

00:02:39.148 --> 00:02:40.780
 Suppose I will be a guard 

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:43.452
 Jabar, let's try to pass the guard 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:45.339
 -Let me enter 

00:02:45.474 --> 00:02:47.025
 -You don't come in, nothing interests me, get out of here 

00:02:47.193 --> 00:02:49.719
 -Please let me go -No -But I have a seal 

00:02:50.886 --> 00:02:51.479
 -Call Alechko 

00:02:51.783 --> 00:02:51.934
 Not 

00:02:52.421 --> 00:02:53.205
 Sandra how are you? 

00:02:55.118 --> 00:02:56.068
 -I'm with her 

00:02:56.925 --> 00:02:57.533
 -Come on 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:00.557
 "Muhamad" 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.706
 Another way to detonate a bomb 

00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:05.168
 this, attach it to a mobile phone 

00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:08.316
 we wrote you a short song to make it easy to remember 

00:03:08.317 --> 00:03:10.549
 number where you should call 

00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:11.893
 and it sounds like that 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.935
 and all together 

00:03:34.598 --> 00:03:35.310
 -Buses 

00:03:39.868 --> 00:03:42.228
 I'll let you go last night with families 

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:46.852
 Do me a favor. Do not use travel 

00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:49.978
 There is zved data that the Israeli security forces want to capture shahids 

00:03:50.507 --> 00:03:52.297
 Can I find out why you draw it when I speak? 

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:54.487
 What? it is related to the topic 

00:03:55.615 --> 00:03:56.751
 How does this relate to the topic? 

00:03:57.758 --> 00:03:58.567
 She's virgin 

00:04:01.013 --> 00:04:03.507
