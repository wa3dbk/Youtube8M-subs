00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and actually I've heard that am-3

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600 
and actually I've heard that am-3
sockets<00:01:07.229> or<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> exact<00:01:07.799> same<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> am<00:01:08.369> to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
sockets or the exact same as I am to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.390 
sockets or the exact same as I am to
just<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.420> actual<00:01:09.570> pin<00:01:10.110> designs<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
just it's the actual pin designs for the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.940 
just it's the actual pin designs for the
processors<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.360> different<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.260> this

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
processors that are different so this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.630 
processors that are different so this
will<00:01:14.280> fit<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.549> an<00:01:14.820> am3<00:01:15.180> socket<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.640> let's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
will fit on an am3 socket as well let's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
will fit on an am3 socket as well let's
go<00:01:18.000> ahead<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.299> read<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> couple<00:01:19.259> more<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the compatibility brackets in sockets I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.200 
the compatibility brackets in sockets I
just<00:01:24.600> listed<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:26.430> made<00:01:27.090> of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
it weighs 500 45 grams now let's go

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.530 
it weighs 500 45 grams now let's go
ahead<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.579> open<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.299> what's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
ahead and open it up and see what's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.469 
ahead and open it up and see what's
inside<00:01:40.130> for<00:01:41.130> most<00:01:41.280> part<00:01:41.400> it's<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
inside for most part it's just like I

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.359 
inside for most part it's just like I
said<00:01:42.720> design<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:43.979> peel<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.250> apart

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
said design so you just peel it apart

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.899 
said design so you just peel it apart
here<00:01:45.409> we<00:01:46.409> got<00:01:46.530> our<00:01:46.649> little<00:01:46.680> tools<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
here we got our little tools and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.910 
here we got our little tools and
accessories<00:01:48.119> box<00:01:48.899> there<00:01:49.259> we'll<00:01:49.439> look<00:01:49.740> into

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
accessories box there we'll look into

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.600 
accessories box there we'll look into
their<00:01:50.100> later<00:01:51.560> when<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.950> actual<00:01:53.130> orb

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
their later when we have the actual orb

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.569 
their later when we have the actual orb
itself<00:01:54.350> it's<00:01:55.350> kind<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.280> more<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
itself it's kind of like it's more of a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.660 
itself it's kind of like it's more of a
pinkish<00:01:57.119> kind<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> color<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.670> bearing

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.589 
there on your motherboard
it's<00:02:12.829> that<00:02:12.950> two<00:02:13.220> screws<00:02:13.579> that<00:02:13.610> mounted<00:02:14.450> onto

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
it's that two screws that mounted onto

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.530 
it's that two screws that mounted onto
your<00:02:15.019> motherboard<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.579> it<00:02:16.909> just<00:02:17.180> got<00:02:17.299> some

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
your motherboard and it just got some

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.720 
your motherboard and it just got some
plastic<00:02:18.019> covering<00:02:18.379> the<00:02:18.530> actual<00:02:18.920> contact<00:02:19.370> base

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
plastic covering the actual contact base

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.179 
plastic covering the actual contact base
there<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.500> mirrored<00:02:21.849> finished<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.890> pretty

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
there is mirrored finished it's pretty

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.910 
there is mirrored finished it's pretty
heavy<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.760> it's<00:02:26.689> pretty<00:02:26.959> big<00:02:27.200> too<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.860> hopefully

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
heavy I it's pretty big too so hopefully

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.059 
heavy I it's pretty big too so hopefully
that's<00:02:28.280> good<00:02:28.519> for<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.970> surface<00:02:29.959> area<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.439> cool

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
that's good for the surface area to cool

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.929 
that's good for the surface area to cool
it<00:02:31.159> off<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.519> dissipate<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.540> heat<00:02:33.939> there's

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
it off and dissipate the heat there's

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.110 
it off and dissipate the heat there's
not<00:02:35.060> much<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.390> be<00:02:35.420> said<00:02:35.510> about<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:36.109> it's<00:02:37.120> pretty

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
not much to be said about it it's pretty

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.520 
not much to be said about it it's pretty
much<00:02:38.299> what<00:02:38.359> you're<00:02:38.659> seeing<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.170> what<00:02:39.349> you're

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
much what you're seeing is what you're

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.770 
much what you're seeing is what you're
getting<00:02:39.799> with<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.129> it<00:02:41.060> does<00:02:41.239> have<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.569> crotch

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
getting with it it does have the crotch
