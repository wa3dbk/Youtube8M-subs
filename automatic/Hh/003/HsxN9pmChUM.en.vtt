00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.450
 maybe a video from the Turkish guys 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.160
 tutorial on how to pair the trucks 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.279
 in everything that serves plan or any 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.980
 other material but wood revenge 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:25.789
 wait for the wooden door 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:30.420
 being the city I know the fastest 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:33.690
 in q2 for too long you know late port 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.380
 more like when from any shown 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.930
 kit kat 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.930
 coat turned and face new 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.820
 then 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.450
 then we make another layer of two like this 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 then let's get a bbc pin 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:18.880
 now let's put the door in this way more 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:26.220
 at 345 until here is another up here ok 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.220
 now so-so 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.820
 perhaps 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.719
 then you have to do all the rows not 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.439
 never put someone in it ur and not 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.740
 I did it on purpose 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.500
 ok wait for a place too i like 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.100
 Segrino 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:53.810
 bellini jail for the uninitiated 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:58.250
 minecraft been updated indeed it is 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:04.420
 all the tax is that to taste to 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.420
 June is known as one of the versions 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.829
 capital however 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.780
 for those who did n't understand it, I could 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.780
 never a curry four 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.430
 then 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.680
 it's done 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.820
 123456789 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.820
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.530
 then 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:59.219
 as always the second layer is now the 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:03.239
 door however I repeat you don't put them 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:05.540
 never so if I have not already copy from that 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.540
 what do I know? 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:19.460
 always two sons of doors especially from the 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.710
 evening this May block for 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:30.130
 all sides must not not exceed 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:36.020
 then in fact then I don't know you here 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:39.430
 second layer often with only though 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:44.650
 we can also play on our trucks 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:54.410
 In the meantime, let us leave this alone 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:56.810
 we ask a little with the end how 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.700
 matter to see here from the small one is 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.180
 grown up 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:07.820
 this is where we did it 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:10.290
 now they grow as fast as you have 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:15.209
 could see 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.900
 I believe this video tutorial will be there 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.900
 was useful 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.590
 I greet you bye
