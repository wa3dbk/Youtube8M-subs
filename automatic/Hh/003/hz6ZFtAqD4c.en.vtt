00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.460
 my dear minimarkets this about me 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.290
 I know she looks very ridiculous but 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.780
 I assure you eight years ago you too 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.269
 you looked ridiculous and that time is 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.820
 so eight years can change so many 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.830
 things and eight years is precisely the 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.830
 time of life that today fulfills my channel 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.790
 8 years ago when youtube was a baby 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.170
 of just 4 months of life, leisure and 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.240
 boredom they took me to open a 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.940
 account in that interesting site 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.950
 full of videos chats in that 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.570
 so I did not know how to edit the cameras 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.790
 they were not so accessible and to tell the truth 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.650
 It made me very nervous to stand in front of 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.780
 but still I started to upload my 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.309
 terrible videos to share with 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.480
 my friends in that legendary site 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.370
 called high five 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.320
 my first videos were very simple 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.390
 playing pancras covers of franco de vita 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.129
 and ricky martin saying nonsense in 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.840
 drunk or showing my love to 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.850
 aviation and among those few 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.949
 videos was the first video of 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.870
 trips I went up where I shared the 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.430
 experiences from my first trips to 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.290
 Backpack sleeping in the streets 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.059
 walking on roads and doing 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.250
 new friends 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.590
 a couple of years passed and in 2008 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.689
 youtube officially entered Mexico and 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.700
 to promote he launched a contest the 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.340
 which won and became the first 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.740
 contest that I won in my life one year 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.960
 later in 2009 I won with you fly my 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.179
 second contest in which he had to 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.890
 write a creative story the jury 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.360
 he chose it and gave him my prize 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.520
 name a plane and they let me travel 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.770
 free to any of your destinations 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.869
 all the times you would like during a 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.600
 year obviously I took them at their word and 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.920
 during that year I traveled in more than 250 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.750
 flights throughout Mexico 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.460
 During this year several 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.590
 big brand competitions to do 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.000
 commercials and creative videos and although 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.430
 at that time my knowledge of 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.770
 edition were very poor I brought several 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.689
 ideas in the head so I decided auto 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.690
 didactically learn about animation 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.299
 production editing and almost everything 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.369
 I finished in sion I made my videos and I won 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.649
 10 of the 12 contests that enter 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.299
 that caught the attention of the director of 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.009
 marketing in volaris who 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.950
 offered to present a proposal for 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.319
 some campaign and that's how he was born 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.870
 traveling a series of trips that I produced 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.580
 between 2010 and 2011 promoting several 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.530
 Destinations of Mexico and the USA 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.660
 the years passed and like everything that goes up 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.269
 has to go down to me I started going very 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.670
 wrong to every contest that went lost 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.769
 he had no work or money and in exchange for 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.420
 food and an armchair to sleep in 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.549
 helped a friend promote her company 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.290
 of tourism in cancÃºn through videos 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.989
 but thanks to the support of friends like 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.720

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.700

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.290

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.650

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.270

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.880

 these eight years that my channel meets 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.150
 I should ask for many gifts as a 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.860

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.140
