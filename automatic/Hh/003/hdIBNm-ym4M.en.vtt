I'm<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.100> person<00:01:08.520> who<00:01:08.580> thought<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:08.970> idea

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
I'm the person who thought of this idea

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.940 
I'm the person who thought of this idea
I<00:01:09.510> said<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.439> can't<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.799> any

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
I said you know what we can't get any

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.149 
I said you know what we can't get any
jalapeno<00:01:11.430> salt<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.820> can't<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.119> any<00:01:12.299> young<00:01:12.450> hot

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
jalapeno salt we can't get any young hot

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.800 
jalapeno salt we can't get any young hot
flaming<00:01:14.159> hot<00:01:14.310> cheetos<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.180> instead<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.540> doing

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
flaming hot cheetos so instead of doing

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.840 
flaming hot cheetos so instead of doing
that<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.049> should<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.290> jalapeno<00:01:17.009> chips<00:01:17.310> with

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
that we should get jalapeno chips with

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.240 
that we should get jalapeno chips with
hot<00:01:18.000> sauce<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> Blaziken<00:01:18.750> looks<00:01:18.900> means<00:01:19.110> like

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
hot sauce the Blaziken looks means like

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.010 
hot sauce the Blaziken looks means like
sensor<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> great<00:01:20.909> idea<00:01:21.150> I'm<00:01:21.780> thinking

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
sensor that is a great idea I'm thinking

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.240 
sensor that is a great idea I'm thinking
in<00:01:22.080> my<00:01:22.110> head<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.320> yeah<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.100> wasn't
