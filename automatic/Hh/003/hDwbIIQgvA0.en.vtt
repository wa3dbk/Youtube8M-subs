00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:08.702
Okay, look at the camera. This is exactly where you can make your moderation to ;)

00:00:08.702 --> 00:00:12.766
Well, do you know how high our balloon flies?

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.787
Up to 20 miles!

00:00:14.787 --> 00:00:17.959
This is 3 times higher than the flight altitude of an airliner.

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:22.309
What I ask myself: Are we allowed to do that?!

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:30.228
Yes, you are. But you have to get a permission by the air traffic control.
You give them some important data and then it works. But how exactly?

00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:43.360
You can simply write an email with information like: Where do I start the balloon? When? Total weight of the construction? And similar stuff. That's it!

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.373
But how much is it?

00:00:49.199 --> 00:01:03.911
Another important idea: The capsule can damage things when falling down. It could land on a roof or on a highway. We always thought: Is there any special insurance?

00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:10.110
But we found out: No. Usually it should be covered by the general liability insurance. (Germany). But better ask your insurance and ask for clarification.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.513
And without extra charge.

00:01:11.513 --> 00:01:15.786
Oh yes, of course! No extra charge!

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:26.062
