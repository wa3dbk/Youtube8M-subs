adventures into advent calendar City
speaking<00:05:36.060> of<00:05:36.150> cities<00:05:36.570> we've<00:05:36.930> got<00:05:37.080> ourselves

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
speaking of cities we've got ourselves

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.610 
speaking of cities we've got ourselves
some<00:05:37.470> sort<00:05:37.770> of<00:05:37.800> building<00:05:38.310> my<00:05:39.000> in<00:05:39.060> town<00:05:39.620> some

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
some sort of building my in town some

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.290 
some sort of building my in town some
construction<00:05:41.220> is<00:05:41.280> going<00:05:41.490> on<00:05:41.580> there<00:05:41.790> oh<00:05:41.850> it's<00:05:42.210> a

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
construction is going on there oh it's a

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.510 
construction is going on there oh it's a
gold<00:05:42.510> mined<00:05:42.750> right<00:05:43.320> there<00:05:43.530> this<00:05:44.190> is<00:05:44.340> right

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
gold mined right there this is right

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.100 
gold mined right there this is right
there<00:05:44.669> anything<00:05:45.090> on<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.300> back<00:05:45.419> no<00:05:45.780> choking

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
there anything on the back no choking

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.230 
there anything on the back no choking
hazard<00:05:46.590> what<00:05:47.580> was<00:05:47.700> something<00:05:47.970> that<00:05:48.090> you<00:05:48.150> have

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
hazard what was something that you have

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.810 
hazard what was something that you have
to<00:05:48.300> be<00:05:48.419> careful<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.870> choking<00:05:49.230> hazards<00:05:49.820> we

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
to be careful of choking hazards we

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.360 
to be careful of choking hazards we
can't<00:05:51.060> pan<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.480> camera<00:05:51.510> down<00:05:51.870> on<00:05:52.680> the<00:05:53.130> side

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
can't pan the camera down on the side

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.100 
can't pan the camera down on the side
will<00:05:53.610> actually<00:05:53.880> tell<00:05:54.000> us<00:05:54.180> how<00:05:54.540> to<00:05:54.570> build<00:05:54.930> them

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
will actually tell us how to build them

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.570 
will actually tell us how to build them
that<00:05:55.230> in<00:05:55.320> this<00:05:55.410> case<00:05:55.590> he's<00:05:55.860> a<00:05:55.890> minifigure<00:05:56.310> so

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
that in this case he's a minifigure so

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.360 
that in this case he's a minifigure so
he<00:05:56.820> involves<00:05:57.240> no<00:05:57.870> real<00:05:58.110> instructions<00:05:58.560> I<00:05:58.950> think

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
he involves no real instructions I think

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.920 
he involves no real instructions I think
by<00:05:59.490> now<00:05:59.610> we<00:05:59.669> all<00:05:59.790> kind<00:06:00.090> of<00:06:00.180> figure<00:06:00.570> out<00:06:00.600> how<00:06:00.870> to

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
by now we all kind of figure out how to

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.610 
by now we all kind of figure out how to
build<00:06:01.620> a<00:06:01.770> Lego<00:06:01.980> figure<00:06:03.080> and<00:06:04.080> let's<00:06:04.380> get<00:06:04.530> this

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
build a Lego figure and let's get this

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.430 
build a Lego figure and let's get this
opened<00:06:05.070> up<00:06:05.330> I'm<00:06:06.330> hoping<00:06:06.630> that<00:06:06.690> my<00:06:06.930> lighting<00:06:07.320> is

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
opened up I'm hoping that my lighting is

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.790 
opened up I'm hoping that my lighting is
going<00:06:07.650> to<00:06:07.710> be<00:06:08.000> appropriate<00:06:09.200> lit<00:06:10.200> well<00:06:10.500> enough

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
going to be appropriate lit well enough

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.710 
going to be appropriate lit well enough
