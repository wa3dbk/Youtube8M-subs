realize this here at Hopkins and we

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.210 
realize this here at Hopkins and we
understand<00:04:48.300> that<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.960> disease<00:04:49.290> is<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.770> also<00:04:50.040> a

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
understand that the disease is a also a

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.780 
understand that the disease is a also a
marker<00:04:50.820> for<00:04:51.030> coronary<00:04:51.870> artery<00:04:52.320> disease<00:04:52.640> so<00:04:53.640> we
