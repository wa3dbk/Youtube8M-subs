00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.799
 but what about fire protection 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.900
 of a straw bale house at last and 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.360
 out the straw is a material easily 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.210
 flammable do not present a special 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.760
 danger of fire straw houses 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.199
 to get an answer to this question 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.689
 We visited the analysis laboratory 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.939
 materials in brunswick here are made 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.349
 fire behavior tests with 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.900
 Many types of materials 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.030
 construction today plays a rehearsal of 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.070
 fire commissioned by the architect of 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.440
 sama president of the association 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.890
 professional construction with bullets 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.360
 straw this straw bale wall 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.960
 plastered with clay is the test piece 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.960
 test 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.930
 this test simulates a fire the 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.360
 laboratory has studied after 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.400
 many years of experience what are 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.199
 the conditions of a typical fire in 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.809
 a house and based on it has 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.400
 developed an essay that is to say that 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.920
 has built a combustion chamber 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.259
 closed with the material to be tested in 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.300
 our case the wall of straw bales and 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.940
 this wall is exposed to the flames of 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.590
 two large gas oil burners 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.600
 heating the surface gradually 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.630
 until you reach approximately 1,000 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.580
 degrees as time goes by 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.289
 observe what happens as the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.570
 wall temperature by the face 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.240
 outside if the wall is standing 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.520
 and if it stays watertight it means that it does not 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.789
 leave neither flame nor excessive amount of 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.789
 smoke 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.550
 the responsible technician observes with 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.350
 detail the development of the trial by 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.450
 example if the earth plaster already 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.450
 presents cracking on the inside 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.940
 on the other side are the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.220
 thermometers here records how much 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.290
 heat from the inside reaches the face 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.890
 outside through the thick wall of 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.450
 straw on the outer face has not 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.640
 produced no variation of the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.800
 temperature this construction has very 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.780
 good insulation capacity in the 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.090
 inside the camera we have after 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.490
 about 30 minutes a temperature of at 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.930
 minus 800 degrees and we see that in the face 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.930
 not exposed to fire there is nothing 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.790
 After 30 minutes , the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.310
 first milestone for 30 minutes the wall 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.040
 resists fire without problems 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.550
 the essay continues the next goal 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.590
 it's 90 minutes 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.050
 although the straw wall already made smoke 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.070
 it's still a long way until I get to 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.990
 burn the reason lack of oxygen the 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.090
 Ground plaster and strong compression 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.100
 of the straw bales ensures that no 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.050
 between enough oxygen to 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.860
 inside of the bullets like so that 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.620
 can burn 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.920
 it's as if we tried to burn a guide 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.920
 telephone 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.750
 after 90 minutes it has been achieved 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.120
 Bielsa Ama is happy at last and 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.160
 he and his association have invested 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.160
 several thousand euros in this essay 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.960
 we have achieved 90 minutes of 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.630
 resistance to fire this is a 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.180
 very good result and we only needed 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.770
 a rf 30 is to say 30 minutes of 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.350
 resistance for the work in which 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.810
 we want to use this system but with 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.400
 90 minutes we are more flexible because 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.200
 will allow us to build housing 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.200
 multi - storey multifamily 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.570
 So far most houses have been 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.460
 built with an individual permit the 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.650
 German legislation for construction 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.840
 it is one of the most severe in the world 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.420
 many trials that had already 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.580
 done successfully in other countries 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.320
 should be done here again the 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.780
 professional construction association 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.000
 with straw bales they invest a lot of money 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.890
 and energy in these trials for 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.770
 simplify the management of permits 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.500
 in germany now has requested a 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.810
 official official approval once 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.820
 is granted it will be so easy to get a 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.770
 permission for a construction with bullets 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.100
 of straw as for any work 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.890
 conventional 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.870
 US existing regulations on 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.390
 construction with straw on which 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.760
 define the density size and placement 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.100
 appropriate these first guidelines 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.320
 they were defined by ember debits 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.050
 architect and pioneer in construction 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.910
 with straw he considers of importance 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.830
 the collaboration with the 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.720
 construction authorities and 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.720
 organizes periodic informative talks 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.420
 at the bottom of our objectives are 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.580
 very similar to those of the authorities 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.590
 of the construction of course 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.290
 we also want the houses 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.960
 be safe but we want a security 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.550
 global is to say not only a good 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.860
 structure and good outputs 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.980
 emergency but also it's about that 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.350
 people can live in a healthy house and 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.110
 we want these safe houses to be 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.360
 find on a safe planet with a 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.830
 healthy environment 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.830
 it's like that
