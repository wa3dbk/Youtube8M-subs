00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.400
 Welcome to the canal here 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.980
 is your maximus welcome you 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.020
 grid 2 the multiplayer part which one yes 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.350
 Everything can be done on the vehicles 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.169
 tuning and optics of the other are yes 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.029
 equal to the release 3 new dcs appeared 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.249
 and I want you once briefly 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.089
 Just give it to the 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.590
 vehicles 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.570
 I first goes to the showroom the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.220
 first vehicle what we get is the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.530
 alfa romeo or let's go now 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.829
 let's just show you what 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.620
 you can tune here and you can 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.510
 here motor drive rod and handling 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.809
 that's all you can do here 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.719
 and you can see the first level is 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.300
 but quite cheap it will be more expensive 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.219
 Here you can see the small parameters 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.640
 so handling changes now looks 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.320
 here as a parameter it is really 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.879
 not much 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.130
 that is probably the case with the 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.710
 bigger cars more noticeable all the more 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.020
 higher cars you take the higher 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.420
 the more expensive it becomes 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.869
 Now you can adjust patterns here 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.310
 and yes I have now select and 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.290
 the one turns on gradually the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.710
 slowly free here there is still 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.170
 Preorder pattern or even the packages 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.430
 yes you can get everything into here 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.189
 install car if you want it 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.960
 but well , it's just really small 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.329
 tuning possibilities that way in the end 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.270
 that you make your car completely high 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.640
 knew so the common stage 2 there 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.130
 I have the dodge challenger here and 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.070
 I have already adjusted a bit 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.630
 because that would be the same for us 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.030
 I look at the vehicle got the yes to 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.590
 follow gossip with any advertising the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.329
 I've found that now 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.369
 possibilities that I have until now I have 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.680
 I still have problems with that 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:05.300
 multiplayer that is after two or 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.520
 three sessions complete then begins massively 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.680
 Jerkiness but I have already 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.890
 times a video makes so looks quite 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.020
 mostly from the choice so those 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.210
 but really want to do a lot 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.640
 There you are here at this game 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:25.760
 out of place yes well then we give 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.270
 I will continue now 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.610
 Still draw water to the 3ds 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.350
 have come and that is the first one 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:42.470
 There is a racing pack here 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:45.170
 Landis you can not june 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.040
 a bit of a shame here is not 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.610
 adjust 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.500
 he has to stay out of gray and on the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.010
 You can not get power output either 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.360
 do 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.750
 that 's the vehicle you get 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.280
 and you get five years to stretch 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.530
 stretch sections are so different 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.840
 drive like the usual stretch so yes 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.420
 not great and it costs 390 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.110
 So who is on the car, of course 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.320
 It is not a question if you buy this 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.590
 but in the end 390 for the first dlc 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.840
 but quite happily good then there 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.140
 it still the next dlc then we go 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.520
 to the doctor to the next car a god 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.900
 messed up here and therefore the whole 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.250
 control come clearly and there you get 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.100
 here is this mclaren mp4 12c I have 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.950
 already a little rebuilt so now 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.140
 are just the optics and yes it really 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.980
 a really nice car and you get 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:49.310
 two routes in brain chat he is 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.580
 English route and this dlc hold 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.040
 through fixed costs 599 he is already 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.630
 cheeky for years stretch the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.790
 already are a game 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:07.650
 So two sections and then a car 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:09.690
 590 that can be expected to evil 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.420
 the nÃ¼rburgring wants to go there 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.130
 probably also a dlc 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.970
 rumored yes and then there is one more 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:23.310
 dlc is going to go into the k package 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:25.830
 Let's equal to talk back and forth on 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.950
 and then you get this vehicle here 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:32.100
 such a honda indy car very popular in 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.730
 america the indycar series yes there you can 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.130
 here almost in the napoli speedway 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.210
 So drive two different routes 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:48.210
 then there are four years 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:51.000
 chevrolet c6 and the camaro ss are still available 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.240
 Here are these indycars going say now 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.170
 times so yes that his car is different 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.990
 can take off 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.090
 They do not do that to the people 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.140
 have bought package and this package 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:07.920
 costs to 95 that's pretty much yes 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.960
 violently and actually already so naughty 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.210
 what to do but that he the 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.330
 policy of all manufacturers that the 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.360
 any dcs purely knock and the 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.680
 people the purchase or indeed would not 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.480
 buys that has just bad luck that was 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.100
 actually only the little info video 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:32.040
 about the tuning possibilities are very 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.570
 lean and ii is the politics it is 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.970
 but very questionable 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.460
 I hope that, however 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.960
 maybe some dcs 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.260
 offer for free 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.390
 and yes for each country separate which 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.170
 the cs a car and maybe the only one 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.360
 fight 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.160
 let's wait and see it was newer 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.800
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.830
 made a little insight here 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.890
 the menu and the possibilities of this 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.430
 it will be enough to see a match now 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.200
 First I'll contact you if it is 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.540
 finally my multiplayer works 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.669
 and then come the first place like that 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.270
 that's about it only once haut rein my 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.430
 friends 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.610
 until next time your maximus at 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.610
 buy
