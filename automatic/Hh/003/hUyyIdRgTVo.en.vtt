00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.309
 hello everyone so we start 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.080
 directly on a good tool for you 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.500
 show the progress of the competition 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.020
 so I have 2400 points so it's very 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.480
 little in fact it is enormously involved 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.470
 but almost nobody to click on the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.899
 link in the description 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.320
 so the competition does not move forward 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:29.559
 all in all I've got six 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.040
 people who clicked so I you 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:34.840
 therefore reminds of course carbonite y 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.610
 is also very useful for you no 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.500
 only he will allow me to 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.670
 launch the contest but in addition to 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.160
 you it will allow you to win 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.460
 points allowing you to have 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.949
 gems 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.600
 in the end so I ask you suddenly 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.329
 today by the way so I 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.679
 Successful blow the g100 healing wave 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.929
 whereas before I had to 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.210
 but on the other hand I am obliged to put 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:58.420
 bombs why because in fact my 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.960
 heroes do not have it finally start and zero 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.309
 energy 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.199
 So the problem is that the 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.879
 first wave that happens to me directly 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.080
 above 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.180
 ben my roles and jewelry show 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.520
 besides a level of my heroes beats 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.430
 my heroes of the blow he taps when coublanc 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.110
 he types that in bass attack and that's 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.450
 really elites especially ten 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.490
 mortals and the thunder god who make 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.560
 all the difference 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.520
 so there we see suddenly the interest 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.610
 so the banks that exploded that made 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.110
 it does damage to the mega man 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.350
 ask myself suddenly the more problems 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.700
 that they are very resistant so there by 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.860
 against the inconvenience it is like we have 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.350
 seen there and the dark gray that my bases 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.090
 heroes are not evolved enough of a sudden 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.680
 This table in the corner where I have no 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.120
 defense apart from my towers which 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.220
 shoot them and luckily 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.880
 that my thunder launched his attack 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.520
 supposed to have missed 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.500
 and that's all the little wave g that's 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.869
 quietly finish so a victory 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.670
 at only 97 miles the maximum 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.310
 that we can have that I already had his 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.960
 210 miles so that's really it's 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.429
 really a lot and then that's 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.920
 Suddenly you can see at once that the wave 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.080
 I succeeded without sense of warrant and everything 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.930
 is the next hero I want 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.690
 increase it will be my immortal what 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.269
 helps me a lot in when we do the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.790
 boss every night at 9:15 pm with the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.950
 abyss guide it's really him who 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.420
 serves me a lot and as soon as I get them 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.840
 increased I could do a lot more 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.700
 damage 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.700
 that's all for this video
