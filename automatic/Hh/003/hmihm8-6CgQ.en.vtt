00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.249
 Hello, good afternoon, here I bring you a 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.560
 tutorial of a small bug is 

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:10.510
 welcome to the next day download the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.860
 sniper elipe 373 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:19.700
 when walking the one to play 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:25.480
 who will apply to play I left 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.480
 this failure pointed 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:40.140
 would not have visitor domain if what 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.810
 is our little window here 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:50.010
 but not 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:52.910
 the month of May 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.700
 we have to go to 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.700
 here is the link that I will leave below 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:08.909
 and we would come to this page no 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.049
 let's see if I have a bit slow 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.049
 we would come to the end 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.130
 and well we download here a file 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.690
 through torrent 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.760
 and we will discover it in these 4 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.580
 in our folder our three 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.820
 files once we had this we would go 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.280
 here in the library we would open 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.450
 to us and the thinnest of the trend 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.930
 here in program files 86 if I 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.950
 I have here 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.369
 then I was going 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.450
 because I have a separate hard drive and 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.789
 we would go to Christians in my case more 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.070
 12 have nothing to go to the 2 and I 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.860
 saying 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.259
 86 time blatter body although we carry 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.750
 the folder and we only had to 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.090
 have these files replaced by 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.780
 then good agreement these that the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.560
 they sold out here what it is to copy and 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.299
 paste cut and paste and when I put you 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.459
 replace now is relocation plan 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.319
 if we replace and here the same thing 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.050
 place and we love that folder for this 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.630
 other 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.319
 and the next thing would be to reapply 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.680
 here of the play and there will be no 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.120
 problem 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.390
 and always be good all so 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.420
 nothing to tell you that 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.670
 if you like the game in pieces and 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.480
 Place of the game if you liked the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.830
 video that you will like since it has 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.830
 served of course 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.000
 and nothing if you have any doubt about 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.290
 some other game that is what you put me 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.140
 some private message and where the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.390
 downloads 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.870
 one 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.300
 If I could solve the game, let's go 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.430
 ask to make a video 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.790
 solving the problem goes looking for 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.049
 any solution 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.069
 and nothing to boots to 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.609
 next 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.609
 goodbye
