00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.210 

actually<00:03:09.550> I'll<00:03:09.820> make<00:03:09.880> value<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:13.530> 296<00:03:14.530> because

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
actually I'll make value to 296 because

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.830 
actually I'll make value to 296 because
PHX<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:18.450> little<00:03:19.450> bit<00:03:19.540> difficult<00:03:19.750> sometimes

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
PHX is a little bit difficult sometimes

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.760 
PHX is a little bit difficult sometimes
anyway<00:03:23.520> so<00:03:24.520> got<00:03:25.270> value<00:03:25.630> 1<00:03:25.780> at<00:03:25.959> 0<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.380> melly<00:03:26.530> -

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
anyway so got value 1 at 0 and melly -

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.790 
anyway so got value 1 at 0 and melly -
at<00:03:26.860> 296<00:03:27.580> their<00:03:28.000> second<00:03:28.870> value<00:03:29.080> is<00:03:31.470> how<00:03:32.470> long

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
at 296 their second value is how long

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.870 
at 296 their second value is how long
the<00:03:33.070> length<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.580> hydraulic<00:03:33.760> will<00:03:34.270> be<00:03:34.480> when

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
the length of the hydraulic will be when

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.610 
the length of the hydraulic will be when
it<00:03:36.880> is<00:03:37.030> extended<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:38.080> bottom<00:03:38.380> floor

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
it is extended to the bottom floor

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.170 
it is extended to the bottom floor
depending<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:39.370> how<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:39.550> have<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:39.730> hydraulic

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
depending on how you have that hydraulic

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.540 
depending on how you have that hydraulic
I've<00:03:40.390> got<00:03:40.510> mine<00:03:40.690> at<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.900> top<00:03:41.280> if<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.370> have<00:03:42.400> it

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
I've got mine at the top if you have it

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.930 
I've got mine at the top if you have it
at<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.730> bottom<00:03:42.959> 296<00:03:43.959> will<00:03:44.110> be<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.260> top<00:03:44.500> value

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
at the bottom 296 will be the top value

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.400 
at the bottom 296 will be the top value
so<00:03:45.940> just<00:03:46.209> place<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.420> under<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.410> toggle<00:03:48.190> gate

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
so just place that under the toggle gate

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.870 
so just place that under the toggle gate
we<00:03:50.410> need<00:03:50.560> some<00:03:50.709> buttons<00:03:51.100> make<00:03:51.430> sure<00:03:51.580> tolls

the top which it does and if we push
this<00:05:37.190> button<00:05:37.450> should<00:05:38.450> come<00:05:38.720> down<00:05:38.900> nice<00:05:39.080> and

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
this button should come down nice and
