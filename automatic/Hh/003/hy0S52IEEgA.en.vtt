00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:21.750
 Here is such a height somewhere four with 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.529
 half a centimeter get a disk 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.529
 here it works 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:38.340
 but peak 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.199
 engineering thought this is miter so here it is 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:51.260
 party people inserted like this so that 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:52.489
 what to show the river is inserted 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.059
 attach themselves 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.059
 for example 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:14.819
 it turns out 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.789
 the main thing is to press tight anywhere 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.929
 I went then well, plus or minus a millimeter for 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.479
 I'm fine 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:30.090
 Of course, so maybe not worth it but the fact 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:33.420
 so here it is as if I have to clamp 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.869
 frames here is a reel here I pull 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.700
 wire so well here is the last 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.329
 trap which i do it somewhere 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.409
 liters to 50 it turns out here intermeddle 10 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.599
 frames just like that 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.920
 such a trap I think will be fine then 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:53.819
 there is plywood on the sides 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.039
 sound such double hardboard well, that's it 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.909
 DVP is not from the kitchen from some old 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.920
 on trash there found 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.229
 im already about 30 years old i think there 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.979
 no formaldehyde remained 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.259
 what i think 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.709
 bees will not pay attention to this 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.519
 so hive and so on so well here it is 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:16.150
 Now I want to say the biggest 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:21.180
 the most healthy she is of some kind of liters 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.599
 probably on the 8011 framework here has got here 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.739
 single slip 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.599
 with frames that i made it width 35 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.250
 counted on the internet that many do and 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.560
 three or four millimeters had 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.790
 still the case up to 30 m okay already all 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.209
 equal to no other option we'll see 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.420
 I think is not critical not deadly 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:50.019
 will look well, this is now 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:56.920
 hive such here 6 corps of points 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:03:00.489
 what is plywood board three 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.810
 Well, the board is not a whole 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:09.819
 bar and 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:12.099
 2 cubes and here emptiness inside chipboard 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.389
 but the thing is, what if you do 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:20.919
 all three boards or plywood in general so 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:26.079
 violently minister angle jointer nope here 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:29.099
 such here it turns out 6 cases 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:33.130
 here here is the entry point it will leave for 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.989
 that it was convenient to clean there and with 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.299
 back side there is still this too we 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.459
 there is a twist in order to 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.709
 could unscrew see what 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.599
 make such bottom it will order 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.450
 eight centimeters but here it is 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:50.450
 small traps something for 30 liters 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:55.260
 ingenious roof here 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.750
 I found such a metal for the fence but I 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.440
 did here on the sides did as if 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.050
 close up 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.860
 but the front and rear will be such to 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.200
 Earring, I think it will not be worse than the roof 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.390
 I have two vents here 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:16.890
 It turns out so here it is I think that 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.650
 twenty two layers and these are the visors 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.870
 they will not give or rain to us and what tulle 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.870
 strong and how would shade at least
