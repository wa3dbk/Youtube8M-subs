00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.859
 for the first time cooked it from these 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.650
 constituent products I generally do not 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.920
 thought it would turn out even edible 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.760
 more or less because here lentils 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.460

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.740

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.810

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.810
 I'll show it now and lay it 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:51.670

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.270
 the dishes you will be cooking in 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.270
 one row 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.510
 so that not in layers she lay in one row 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.130
 just put the cubes so let's go 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:07.619

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:10.060

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.740
 well, something like this 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:44.499
 such large pieces turned out visible 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:50.740
 here she is well laid out now 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:53.770
 each layer must salt pepper but 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.460
 not much of a way to be two quite 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.319
 pinches 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.319

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.500

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.930

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.870
 200-gram buttons 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.780

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.250
 salted onions also here differently evenly 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.130
 distribute salt with onion enough 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.360
 will and so onions we already have in place and 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:55.790
 now here comes risk me rice 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:03:00.340

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.700
 little pot there was rice 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.510

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:28.600
 need less such a distribution and there 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:32.420
 On this and some water I turn on 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.780
 cooking all close the lid and 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.270
 before cooking there is already a pair of soup 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.690
 lentils you can watch preparing it 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.060
 very fast in general should be able to 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.340
 such a pillow start texture still 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.530
