00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.689

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.390
 what a coincidence in a moment what 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.180
 I wanted to say is yes 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.000
 we are not together but 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.400
 it happens many times and it's something that I feel and 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.560
 what I wanted to say so when 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.270
 we sing and when we are together I do not leave 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.270
 to feel a very strong connection 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.710
 when when we watched the video 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:50.300
 I felt very close to you we were 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.300
 close because we are that is art 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:59.140
 it's something that felt a good life 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.120
 that's why the same thing happens to me 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.470
 and what are we going to do with what 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:15.170
 we feel 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:18.700
 denying it we see clearly wrong what is 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.700

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.130
 as friends and we have friendship that 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.880
 we have 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.880
 so 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.660
 you know the time time the time if you 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.190

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.610
 fix things so that we 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.610
 let's get used 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.780
 we are not going to deny what we feel because 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.260
 we are sorry because we feel that we take 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.260
 the right decision 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.330

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.120
