I really like their design maybe idea
behind<00:00:46.910> this<00:00:47.120> one<00:00:47.269> is<00:00:47.300> that<00:00:47.420> but<00:00:47.839> it<00:00:48.019> comes

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
behind this one is that but it comes

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.360 
behind this one is that but it comes
with<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.440> hanging<00:00:48.620> unit<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.219> should

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
with a hanging unit so you should

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.389 
with a hanging unit so you should
actually<00:00:49.489> be<00:00:49.670> able<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.850> hang<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.980> the

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
actually be able to hang it and the

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.560 
actually be able to hang it and the
reason<00:00:52.640> they've<00:00:52.760> got<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:52.969> spike<00:00:53.269> here<00:00:53.449> was

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
reason they've got the spike here was

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.150 
reason they've got the spike here was
partly<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.109> finish<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.499> look<00:00:54.649> but<00:00:54.890> partly

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
partly to finish the look but partly

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.439 
partly to finish the look but partly
because<00:00:55.309> they're<00:00:55.489> hoping<00:00:55.789> in<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:55.969> future<00:00:55.999> to

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
because they're hoping in the future to

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.509 
because they're hoping in the future to
make<00:00:56.719> completely<00:00:57.079> wireless<00:00:57.469> systems<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.339> this

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
make completely wireless systems so this

00:00:58.519 --> 00:00:59.619 
make completely wireless systems so this
will<00:00:58.699> eventually<00:00:58.850> take<00:00:59.210> on<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.480> role<00:00:59.600> of

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
will eventually take on the role of

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.110 
will eventually take on the role of
smoothly<00:00:59.960> aerial<00:01:00.679> Oh

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
smoothly aerial Oh

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.970 
smoothly aerial Oh

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
but for the moment is just decorative

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.229 
but for the moment is just decorative
and<00:01:04.100> underneath<00:01:04.430> there<00:01:04.640> are<00:01:04.730> some<00:01:04.820> hooks<00:01:05.000> but

bought<00:01:45.380> as<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.530> separate<00:01:45.920> entity<00:01:46.009> or<00:01:46.909> combined

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
bought as a separate entity or combined

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.690 
bought as a separate entity or combined
with<00:01:47.450> these<00:01:47.780> which<00:01:48.110> are<00:01:48.289> micro<00:01:48.920> pods<00:01:49.159> and

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
with these which are micro pods and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.029 
with these which are micro pods and
later<00:01:50.030> on<00:01:50.299> now<00:01:50.420> have<00:01:50.630> mini<00:01:51.380> ports<00:01:51.710> with<00:01:51.890> the

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
later on now have mini ports with the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.580 
later on now have mini ports with the
dock<00:01:52.189> as<00:01:52.520> this<00:01:52.640> revelation<00:01:53.240> system<00:01:53.869> but<00:01:54.500> you

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
dock as this revelation system but you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.719 
dock as this revelation system but you
can't<00:01:54.799> get<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.950> dock<00:01:55.070> on<00:01:55.189> its<00:01:55.310> own<00:01:55.399> it's<00:01:55.700> a

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
can't get the dock on its own it's a

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.279 
can't get the dock on its own it's a
hundred<00:01:55.969> and<00:01:56.119> fifty<00:01:56.390> pounds<00:01:56.570> but<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.020> reason

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
hundred and fifty pounds but the reason

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.510 
hundred and fifty pounds but the reason
for<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.409> is<00:01:57.590> because<00:01:57.680> it's<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.039> dock<00:01:58.280> and

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
for that is because it's a dock and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.580 
for that is because it's a dock and
amplifier<00:01:59.090> but<00:01:59.359> really<00:01:59.930> another<00:02:00.200> fare<00:02:00.500> as

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
amplifier but really another fare as

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.210 
amplifier but really another fare as
well

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
well

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.980 
well
the<00:02:01.400> only<00:02:01.850> unusual<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.330> actually<00:02:02.570> don't<00:02:02.810> work

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
the only unusual and actually don't work

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.860 
the only unusual and actually don't work
I've<00:02:03.140> seen<00:02:03.170> yet<00:02:03.590> dot<00:02:04.040> before<00:02:04.460> make<00:02:04.940> me<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.480> can't

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
I've seen yet dot before make me I can't

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.469 
I've seen yet dot before make me I can't
think<00:02:05.930> of<00:02:06.170> one<00:02:06.320> guy<00:02:06.440> I've<00:02:06.530> actually<00:02:07.210> tried<00:02:08.210> out

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
think of one guy I've actually tried out

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.730 
think of one guy I've actually tried out
so<00:02:09.290> that's<00:02:09.740> it's<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.399> 4<00:02:11.030> times<00:02:11.330> 15<00:02:11.900> what<00:02:12.200> or<00:02:12.710> a

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
so that's it's it 4 times 15 what or a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.920 
so that's it's it 4 times 15 what or a
mess<00:02:12.950> after<00:02:13.100> clarify<00:02:13.610> means<00:02:13.820> every<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.270> 2

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
mess after clarify means every to 2

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.830 
mess after clarify means every to 2
times<00:02:15.140> 15<00:02:15.500> what<00:02:16.150> I'm<00:02:17.150> going<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.420> pretend<00:02:17.720> like

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
times 15 what I'm going to pretend like

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.960 
times 15 what I'm going to pretend like
I<00:02:18.080> know<00:02:18.140> yeah<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.890> know<00:02:18.920> know<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.250> sagely

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
I know yeah you know know that sagely

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.320 
I know yeah you know know that sagely
here<00:02:20.360> at<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.670> speakers<00:02:23.150> are<00:02:23.270> designed

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
here at that the speakers are designed

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.640 
here at that the speakers are designed
second<00:02:23.870> from<00:02:23.990> 10<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.440> 100<00:02:24.620> watt<00:02:25.040> amplifiers<00:02:26.650> in

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
second from 10 to 100 watt amplifiers in

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.020 
second from 10 to 100 watt amplifiers in
both<00:02:27.830> cases<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.340> mean<00:02:28.460> I<00:02:28.580> think<00:02:28.820> these<00:02:28.910> are

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
both cases I mean I think these are

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.000 
both cases I mean I think these are
actually<00:02:29.240> that<00:02:29.420> much<00:02:29.570> more<00:02:29.750> powerful<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.830> mean

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
actually that much more powerful I mean

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.650 
actually that much more powerful I mean
these<00:02:31.340> are<00:02:31.520> obviously<00:02:31.850> designed<00:02:32.270> for<00:02:32.390> mp3

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
these are obviously designed for mp3

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.960 
these are obviously designed for mp3
players<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.410> probably<00:02:33.770> obviously<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.550> iPod

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
players and probably obviously the iPod

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.090 
players and probably obviously the iPod
and<00:02:35.150> also<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.750> connect<00:02:36.200> up<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.350> their<00:02:36.560> computer

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
and also to connect up to their computer

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.570 
and also to connect up to their computer
so<00:02:37.400> not<00:02:38.360> what<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.870> would<00:02:39.350> suggest<00:02:39.920> for<00:02:40.190> the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
so not what I would suggest for the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.580 
so not what I would suggest for the
audio<00:02:40.880> files<00:02:41.240> amongst<00:02:41.810> us<00:02:41.930> who<00:02:42.170> really<00:02:42.440> want

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
audio files amongst us who really want

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.890 
audio files amongst us who really want
high<00:02:42.830> quality<00:02:43.070> sounding<00:02:43.850> music<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.780> their

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
high quality sounding music in their

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.720 
high quality sounding music in their
household<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:45.560> perfect<00:02:46.250> for<00:02:46.430> just<00:02:46.550> you<00:02:46.700> know

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
household but perfect for just you know

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.730 
household but perfect for just you know
you've<00:02:47.060> got<00:02:47.270> relatively<00:02:47.930> small<00:02:48.200> lounge<00:02:48.500> you

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
you've got relatively small lounge you

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.470 
you've got relatively small lounge you
might<00:02:48.920> say<00:02:49.190> exactly<00:02:49.700> but<00:02:50.120> they're<00:02:50.300> quite

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
might say exactly but they're quite

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.210 
might say exactly but they're quite
inexpensive<00:02:51.110> too<00:02:51.230> aren't<00:02:51.410> they<00:02:51.530> yeah<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:51.980> mean

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
inexpensive too aren't they yeah I mean

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.560 
inexpensive too aren't they yeah I mean
no<00:02:52.310> no<00:02:52.370> if<00:02:52.670> you're<00:02:52.820> if<00:02:52.970> you're<00:02:53.000> not<00:02:53.150> sort<00:02:53.510> of

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
no no if you're if you're not sort of

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.240 
no no if you're if you're not sort of
full<00:02:53.810> an<00:02:53.959> audiophile<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.650> might<00:02:55.130> be

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
full an audiophile but you might be

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.010 
full an audiophile but you might be
better<00:02:55.430> quality<00:02:56.240> than<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.510> might<00:02:56.660> get<00:02:56.840> from

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
better quality than you might get from

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.390 
better quality than you might get from
whether<00:02:57.170> it's<00:02:57.320> gonna<00:02:57.470> combine<00:02:57.680> dogs<00:02:58.070> they're

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
whether it's gonna combine dogs they're

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.970 
whether it's gonna combine dogs they're
probably<00:02:59.120> gonna<00:02:59.300> go<00:03:00.140> that's<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:00.530> think<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.860> be

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
probably gonna go that's I think to be

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.080 
probably gonna go that's I think to be
honest<00:03:01.160> if<00:03:01.310> you're<00:03:01.400> going<00:03:01.550> for<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.790> scammer<00:03:02.000> I

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
honest if you're going for a scammer I

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.550 
honest if you're going for a scammer I
think<00:03:02.360> it's<00:03:02.450> because<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:02.690> looks<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.080> damn<00:03:03.260> good

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
think it's because it looks so damn good

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.770 
think it's because it looks so damn good
yeah<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:04.160> can't<00:03:04.520> imagine<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.940> better<00:03:05.300> reason<00:03:05.750> to

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
yeah I can't imagine a better reason to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.560 
yeah I can't imagine a better reason to
go<00:03:05.959> through<00:03:06.200> because<00:03:09.580> that's<00:03:10.580> designed<00:03:11.390> to

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
go through because that's designed to

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.479 
go through because that's designed to
appeal<00:03:11.840> for<00:03:12.019> someone<00:03:12.230> like<00:03:12.320> me<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:13.220> they<00:03:13.340> not

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
appeal for someone like me so they not

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.310 
appeal for someone like me so they not
only<00:03:13.550> look<00:03:13.940> good<00:03:14.150> but<00:03:14.209> they<00:03:14.420> do<00:03:14.480> sound<00:03:14.870> fairly

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
only look good but they do sound fairly

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.990 
only look good but they do sound fairly
good<00:03:15.470> tuned<00:03:15.739> in<00:03:15.890> they<00:03:16.340> do<00:03:16.400> we've<00:03:16.640> been<00:03:16.760> trying

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
good tuned in they do we've been trying

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.190 
good tuned in they do we've been trying
these<00:03:17.180> out<00:03:17.330> with<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.540> variety<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.019> different

flashback<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:23.989> eighties

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.630 

there<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:28.489> a<00:03:28.610> remote<00:03:28.849> control<00:03:29.470> right<00:03:30.640> control

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
there is a remote control right control

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:43.760 
there is a remote control right control
valve<00:03:31.879> is<00:03:33.310> about<00:03:34.310> try

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.850 

my<00:03:44.770> good<00:03:44.950> clarity<00:03:45.400> sound<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.600> I<00:03:46.660> think<00:03:46.900> anyone

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
my good clarity sound so I think anyone

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.410 
my good clarity sound so I think anyone
who<00:03:48.040> buys<00:03:48.220> these<00:03:48.430> they're<00:03:48.670> probably<00:03:49.030> more

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
who buys these they're probably more

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.350 
who buys these they're probably more
concerned<00:03:49.570> with<00:03:50.170> style<00:03:50.560> over<00:03:50.860> function

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
concerned with style over function

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.390 
concerned with style over function
they're<00:03:52.360> not<00:03:52.510> too<00:03:52.720> concerned<00:03:53.110> over

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
they're not too concerned over

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.100 
they're not too concerned over
high-quality<00:03:54.400> sounding<00:03:54.940> music<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.600> they're

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
high-quality sounding music and they're

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.330 
high-quality sounding music and they're
probably<00:03:56.260> more<00:03:56.530> interested<00:03:57.010> in<00:03:57.160> getting

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
probably more interested in getting

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.860 
probably more interested in getting
these<00:03:57.640> speakers<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.240> match<00:03:58.450> their<00:03:58.720> nice

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
these speakers to match their nice

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.040 
these speakers to match their nice
pretty<00:03:59.350> much<00:04:03.060> took<00:04:04.060> a<00:04:04.150> bet<00:04:04.330> I<00:04:04.450> don't<00:04:04.510> think<00:04:04.960> I

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
pretty much took a bet I don't think I

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.600 
pretty much took a bet I don't think I
have<00:04:05.200> any<00:04:05.320> uncompressed<00:04:05.830> mp3<00:04:06.280> files<00:04:06.490> and

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
have any uncompressed mp3 files and

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
have any uncompressed mp3 files and
that'd<00:04:06.700> be<00:04:06.730> really<00:04:07.000> interesting<00:04:07.390> to<00:04:07.480> do<00:04:07.600> a

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
that'd be really interesting to do a

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.840 
that'd be really interesting to do a
comparison<00:04:08.110> between<00:04:08.730> compressed<00:04:09.730> and

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
comparison between compressed and

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.040 
comparison between compressed and
compressed<00:04:10.240> oh<00:04:10.360> yes<00:04:10.570> if<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.810> can<00:04:10.900> actually

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
compressed oh yes if you can actually

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.720 
compressed oh yes if you can actually
hear<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.350> difference<00:04:11.800> so<00:04:12.340> that's<00:04:12.550> something

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
hear the difference so that's something

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.670 
hear the difference so that's something
we<00:04:12.910> might<00:04:12.940> wanna<00:04:13.300> try<00:04:13.810> as<00:04:13.930> well<00:04:16.530> wanted<00:04:17.530> to

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680
