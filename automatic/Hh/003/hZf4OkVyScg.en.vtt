00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.900
 greenhouses

 Sergey Grinkova is a collector 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.220
 tropical plants 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.369

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.930
 Pro videos we will be ordered by pro hua 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.239

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:38.820
 extraordinary beauty 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.430
 rare in general enough in nature 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.710
 lilac lilac and us now 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.950
 Sergey will tell that this plant as 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.739
 it can grow a plant called 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.620
 bronchioles to write new grandiflora or 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:58.620
 cup on another this plant 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:03.600
 Solanaceae of South America 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:08.130
 a relative of a tomato let's say then this 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.530
 potato family is very extensive 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.840
 result is presented 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.399
 many plants ranging from fruiting 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.030
 the body is not benefiting the people and 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.729
 ending so beautiful 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.189
 ornamental plants seems to me 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.829
 the benefits of such plants are not at all 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.069
 less than fruit because not in vain 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:33.009
 say and bread alone 100 people here 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:35.560
 you will see such beauty and life as afraid 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.590
 want to be at home very beautiful blooms for a long time 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.500
 very 21 ceasing month and a half 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.540
 maybe 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.010
 here all this constantly go down 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.870
 new-new words 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.420
 a little bit when fading off to change color 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.979
 this she blooms so dark here 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.160
 little burgundy on a date she 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.320
 almost blue will be established 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.640
 this here but in the middle, and it is necessary to 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.539
 midway here is such a middle 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.270
 Park, please tell me which ones 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.500
 conditions need such beauty so she 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:19.520
 grew it say crane queens she is very 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.410
 capricious not really she it if 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.620
 there is something wrong she immediately start 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.170
 leaves do not turn yellow start like this 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.390
 as such it stands especially this 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.900
 It happens when a lot of light here 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:38.239
 it is this kind of r3 that does not like it 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:41.060
 bright illumination of south america under 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.950
 the forest canopy here and so 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.590
 this straight bright sunlight 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:50.060
 fatal for her is understandable that's why you 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.770
 here and cause standing in the bright sun 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.140
 it was scary 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.380
 then I put the shadow of other plants 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.800
 it has become such a one as this 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.780
 stretch blooming 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:11.750
 you know probably already a lot of 10 exactly 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.640
 There is with good she lives and here is pruning 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.450
 after all, maybe you are doing something 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.380
 she slowly still slow but trim 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.890
 I cut off of course cut off long branches 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.650
 and plus to that it is undermined by 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.400
 pruned release awake kidneys 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.830
 the side of her and each pack ends 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.510
 check out the inflorescences 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.819
 it is clear so please tell me with 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:43.910
 which grows stretch to seed or 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:49.209
 stalk stalk stalk is where you're at it 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.209
 Kira bought went on a business trip when 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.810
 increases in our how many five-liter 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.599
 the bucket 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.239
 loves very much 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.300
 nutrient soil must be fertilized 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.959
 nitrogen fertilizer and chewable and no 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.670
 military 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:14.910
 and petty neutral and ammoniac for 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.620
 our listeners that this is urea and 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.070
 ammonium nitrate 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:25.500
 can be there when to attach this 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:29.050
 once give it because it does not like 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.040
 slightly acidic soil but still 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.610
 periodically need to give another 8 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.470
 then maybe think of some 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:43.120
 there's just here on the terrain and the wind 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:48.610
 acidify the solution and with you something urea 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:53.220
 yes he is resting but I jump back and forth 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:57.300
 she is so good then what else 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:04.500
 I replace the upper kidney with 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:07.750
 rotted horse manure and already humus 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:12.940
 the first top layer is shooting code every 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.070
 year and here if our reader wants 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.020
 you can buy such a plant somewhere 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.580
 get the seeds and here 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.990
 villagers ask yourself grow not 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.950

 seed in different programs queen dimensional 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:39.220
 About 15 species are offered but I think 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:41.650
 this there are more profiles and others they 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.850

 proboscis 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.930

 attracting hawk moths like hawk mounts 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.289
 which pollinate the moth 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:06.960
