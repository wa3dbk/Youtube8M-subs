 on sber series such a first tournament 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.510
 seriously there was a feeling like 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.040
 as if they got there so much 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.229
 talents to the nation they have 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.229
 you even channel with one of them however mother 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.409

 just saying what's more there 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.320
 technicians played with you Ilya Spryzgalov 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.659

 Moscow such are our cities more 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.740
 such regions 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.990
 I do not know on the contrary seemed well not 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.780
 to play against if anything in Russia 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.920
 lighted the fact they where in Livonian 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.050

 and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.310
 against pittsburgh it's so pretty 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.150
 principal rival 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.470
 these lebanese derby are few there and 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.410
 told that the philadelphia 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.739
 crazy guys stood popcorn throwing 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.720
 something else guys sense in speech yes then 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.590
 there is so much hatred for the penguin 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.530
 something but in principle also the same with 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.610

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.459

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.769

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.900
 some kind of steppe from laziness and 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.790
 Swedish hockey in this team yes no i 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.150
 more focus again 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.340
 I repeat on my game I cook myself 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.519
 they are above it despite the rival then 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.519
