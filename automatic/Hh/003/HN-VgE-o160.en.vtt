the beginning of the trip we had the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.880 
the beginning of the trip we had the
Queen<00:00:15.559> Elizabeth<00:00:16.330> qe2<00:00:17.330> and<00:00:17.570> if<00:00:18.349> you<00:00:18.470> look<00:00:18.650> very

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
Queen Elizabeth qe2 and if you look very

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.329 
Queen Elizabeth qe2 and if you look very
closely<00:00:19.579> next<00:00:20.269> door<00:00:20.599> can<00:00:21.470> you<00:00:21.769> see<00:00:22.070> what<00:00:22.310> we

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:22.339 
closely next door can you see what we

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:31.389 
closely next door can you see what we
can<00:00:22.820> see<00:00:24.009> it's<00:00:25.009> the<00:00:25.249> Queen<00:00:25.609> Victoria<00:00:27.579> I<00:00:30.399> think

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
can see it's the Queen Victoria I think

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.650 
can see it's the Queen Victoria I think
I<00:00:32.079> don't<00:00:33.079> think<00:00:33.260> it's<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.500> Queen<00:00:33.739> Mary

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
I don't think it's the Queen Mary

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.910 
I don't think it's the Queen Mary
because<00:00:35.660> we<00:00:35.809> would<00:00:35.989> know<00:00:36.170> if<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.440> Queen<00:00:36.680> Mary

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
because we would know if the Queen Mary

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.759 
because we would know if the Queen Mary
was<00:00:37.129> here<00:00:37.550> we<00:00:37.910> checked<00:00:38.149> her<00:00:38.420> I<00:00:38.690> think<00:00:39.680> you'll

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
was here we checked her I think you'll

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.680 
was here we checked her I think you'll
find<00:00:39.890> that's<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.190> Queen<00:00:40.399> Victoria<00:00:40.690> anyway

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
find that's the Queen Victoria anyway

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.660 
find that's the Queen Victoria anyway
we'll<00:00:41.840> know<00:00:42.019> when<00:00:42.199> we<00:00:42.230> get<00:00:42.469> closer<00:00:42.859> the<00:00:43.489> only

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
we'll know when we get closer the only

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.639 
we'll know when we get closer the only
problem<00:00:43.879> is<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.449> captain<00:00:44.690> has<00:00:45.019> told<00:00:45.289> us<00:00:45.440> that

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
problem is the captain has told us that

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.340 
problem is the captain has told us that
one<00:00:45.859> of<00:00:45.890> these<00:00:46.129> ships<00:00:46.489> is<00:00:47.239> in<00:00:47.510> our<00:00:47.690> birth<00:00:47.989> and

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
one of these ships is in our birth and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.410 
one of these ships is in our birth and
we<00:00:48.859> have<00:00:49.039> to<00:00:49.190> wait<00:00:49.309> till<00:00:49.460> it<00:00:49.550> leaves<00:00:49.789> and<00:00:50.000> if

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
we have to wait till it leaves and if

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.150 
we have to wait till it leaves and if
you<00:00:50.539> remember<00:00:51.019> we<00:00:51.260> were<00:00:51.379> sitting<00:00:51.620> right<00:00:51.949> next

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
you remember we were sitting right next

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.819 
you remember we were sitting right next
to<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.429> Queen<00:00:52.640> Elizabeth<00:00:53.379> so<00:00:54.379> it<00:00:54.559> could<00:00:54.800> be

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
to the Queen Elizabeth so it could be

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.759 
to the Queen Elizabeth so it could be
that<00:00:55.129> this<00:00:55.309> one<00:00:55.660> that<00:00:56.660> we<00:00:56.809> think<00:00:57.109> I<00:00:57.260> think<00:00:57.620> it's

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
that this one that we think I think it's

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.430 
that this one that we think I think it's
the<00:00:57.890> Queen<00:00:58.129> Victoria<00:00:58.809> Rob<00:00:59.809> thinks<00:01:00.109> it's<00:01:00.320> the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
the Queen Victoria Rob thinks it's the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.849 
the Queen Victoria Rob thinks it's the
Queen<00:01:00.679> Mary<00:01:01.539> but<00:01:02.539> one<00:01:02.719> of<00:01:02.749> them<00:01:02.960> will<00:01:03.199> ECI<00:01:03.530> that

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
Queen Mary but one of them will ECI that

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.380 
Queen Mary but one of them will ECI that
you<00:01:03.920> see<00:01:04.040> if<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.280> look<00:01:04.400> at<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.519> back<00:01:04.820> end<00:01:05.120> of

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
you see if you look at the back end of

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.110 
you see if you look at the back end of
the<00:01:05.690> ship<00:01:05.930> I<00:01:06.310> don't<00:01:07.310> think<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.580> Queen<00:01:07.790> Mary

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
the ship I don't think the Queen Mary

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:19.640 
the ship I don't think the Queen Mary
was<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:10.420> so<00:01:11.420> rounded

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.789 

you

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.210 

but<00:01:23.799> you've<00:01:23.920> also<00:01:24.070> got<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.429> piano

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
but you've also got the piano

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.730 
but you've also got the piano
which<00:01:27.220> i<00:01:27.340> think<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.409> Aurora

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
which i think is the is it the Aurora

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.940 
which i think is the is it the Aurora
that's<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.580> cost<00:01:30.760> to<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.360> co<00:01:31.630> sir<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.260> I

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
that's the cost to the co sir and I

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.770 
that's the cost to the co sir and I
think<00:01:33.159> that's<00:01:33.340> one<00:01:33.549> of<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.729> piano<00:01:34.180> shift<00:01:34.240> and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
think that's one of the piano shift and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.149 
think that's one of the piano shift and
where<00:01:35.259> we're<00:01:35.380> going<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.560> go<00:01:35.680> towards<00:01:36.100> the
