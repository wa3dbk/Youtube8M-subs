00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.609
 well i am dico couples with 18 years 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.269
 game and the arena 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.649
 I am in his legs the chance to play a tear defends but also left back 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.849
 i could harm out of the extra 44 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:19.949
 a 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.630
 nice club coach 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.550
 I started here the d3 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.550
 doing serge as a trainer 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.490
 birthday boy 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.960
 by a man who, unfortunately, died last year 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.190
 was allowed to train a few times with the final 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.820
 yes I did an internship and that is how I am at ajax 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.330
 have you always been a defender? 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.200
 I was for big left winger 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.870
 I fall quickly and from one go I came straight into midfield and now 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.270
 in the back 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.750
 I don't feel you in the picture after a real defender, but you have to check if 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.679
 the urge forwards 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.999
 but I still have my for a bit off but I can be wiped away 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.420
 what are your strong points 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.360
 I think speed 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.040
 but overview in sight 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.000
 and I have a good seat 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.870
 all that and make sure you have contact you may have signed how it feels 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.390
 Which 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.390
 how many very good yes very good 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.960
 I really operated this so then you are 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.900
 was still happy with that 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.380
 and with that critics really deserved 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.200
 I am standing in the A2 where I am actually immediately transferred to one 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.310
 and then of course I could play football very well 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.900
 that's how I deserve it 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.120
 and what is here to do next 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.250
 why 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.050
 in the next goal 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.560
 I am becoming a champion with Ajax and keep the problem in place boss 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.870
 and just as well as possible just keep developing myself 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.800
 important 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.630
 I understand you 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.210
 last Sunday it was yes it is not to bother me at all 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.850
 most know the board
