00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.430 
the Sprint version with me and they are
nearly<00:02:20.250> identical<00:02:20.400> now<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.930> able<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.260> get

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
nearly identical now I was able to get

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.350 
nearly identical now I was able to get
the<00:02:22.590> Sprint<00:02:22.890> version<00:02:23.250> without<00:02:23.370> any<00:02:23.760> graphics

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
the Sprint version without any graphics

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.210 
the Sprint version without any graphics
on<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.570> normally<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.200> would<00:02:25.320> say<00:02:25.470> Samsung<00:02:26.040> and

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
on it normally it would say Samsung and

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.000 
on it normally it would say Samsung and
Sprint<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.930> really<00:02:28.380> like<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.800> all

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010

blacked<00:02:29.370> out<00:02:29.640> now<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.890> foam<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.130> I

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
blacked out now this is a foam that I

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.100 
blacked out now this is a foam that I
happen<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.880> get<00:02:33.090> it's<00:02:33.330> not<00:02:33.540> how<00:02:33.750> they<00:02:33.900> actually

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
happen to get it's not how they actually

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.270 
happen to get it's not how they actually
come<00:02:34.530> from<00:02:34.560> Sprint

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
come from Sprint

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.120 
come from Sprint
so<00:02:35.730> like<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.600> see<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.930> t-mobile<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.680> how

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
so like you see this t-mobile is how

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.100 
so like you see this t-mobile is how
they<00:02:38.310> actually<00:02:38.550> come<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.450> if<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.810> look<00:02:39.990> at

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
they actually come and if you look at

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.930 
they actually come and if you look at
the<00:02:40.230> two<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.500> them<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:41.070> can<00:02:41.250> see<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
the two of them you can see that the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.190 
the two of them you can see that the
Android<00:02:42.720> buttons<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:44.209> camera<00:02:45.209> are<00:02:45.510> all<00:02:45.840> in

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
Android buttons the camera are all in

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.280 
Android buttons the camera are all in
the<00:02:46.380> same<00:02:46.590> location<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.790> ear<00:02:48.120> slot<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:48.959> for

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
the same location the ear slot here for

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.680 
the same location the ear slot here for
the<00:02:49.590> earpiece<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.280> slightly<00:02:50.640> different<00:02:51.000> but

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
the earpiece is slightly different but

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.890 
the earpiece is slightly different but
that's<00:02:51.840> really<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.709> flipping<00:02:53.700> them<00:02:53.820> over<00:02:53.970> very

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
that's really it flipping them over very

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.570 
that's really it flipping them over very
similar<00:02:55.350> on<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.560> back<00:02:55.830> as<00:02:56.040> well<00:02:56.250> there's<00:02:56.520> a

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
similar on the back as well there's a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.610 
similar on the back as well there's a
hump<00:02:56.850> here<00:02:57.090> at<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.330> bottom<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:58.170> see<00:02:58.200> there's

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
hump here at the bottom you see there's

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.830 
hump here at the bottom you see there's
the<00:02:58.830> speaker<00:02:59.220> slot<00:02:59.489> there<00:02:59.820> they<00:03:00.390> both<00:03:00.600> have

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
the speaker slot there they both have

the speaker slot there they both have
the<00:03:01.050> cameras<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:01.890> forth<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.370> same

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550

location<00:03:03.120> although<00:03:03.660> there's<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.959> slightly

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
location although there's a slightly
