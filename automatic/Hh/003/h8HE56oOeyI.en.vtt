with him with a vacuum cleaner and I
thought<00:04:33.380> that<00:04:33.530> would<00:04:33.650> be<00:04:33.680> kind<00:04:33.889> of<00:04:34.010> hysterical

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
thought that would be kind of hysterical

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.189 
thought that would be kind of hysterical
because<00:04:34.699> I<00:04:34.880> thought<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:35.300> know<00:04:35.389> for<00:04:35.660> sure<00:04:35.690> he

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
because I thought you know for sure he

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.360 
because I thought you know for sure he
would<00:04:36.350> freak<00:04:36.530> out<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.800> first<00:04:37.010> time<00:04:37.190> he<00:04:37.340> ever

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
would freak out the first time he ever

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.040 
would freak out the first time he ever
saw<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.699> vacuum<00:04:38.150> but<00:04:38.419> then<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:38.600> thought<00:04:38.810> about<00:04:38.840> it

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
saw a vacuum but then I thought about it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.260 
saw a vacuum but then I thought about it
a<00:04:39.229> little<00:04:39.350> bit<00:04:39.500> more<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:39.949> actually<00:04:40.270> you

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
a little bit more and I actually you

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.900 
a little bit more and I actually you
know<00:04:41.389> figured<00:04:42.080> I<00:04:42.260> shouldn't<00:04:42.650> make<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.639> game

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
know figured I shouldn't make it a game

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.700 
know figured I shouldn't make it a game
I<00:04:44.270> didn't<00:04:44.630> want<00:04:44.750> him<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:45.050> be<00:04:45.139> afraid<00:04:45.320> of<00:04:45.530> the

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
I didn't want him to be afraid of the

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.830 
I didn't want him to be afraid of the
vacuum<00:04:45.800> so<00:04:46.460> I<00:04:46.490> actually<00:04:46.699> never<00:04:46.940> did<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.330> and<00:04:47.600> I

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
vacuum so I actually never did it and I

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.779 
vacuum so I actually never did it and I
sort<00:04:48.199> of<00:04:48.289> showed<00:04:48.530> him<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.830> vacuum<00:04:49.130> first<00:04:49.430> and

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
sort of showed him the vacuum first and

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.520 
sort of showed him the vacuum first and
I<00:04:49.940> turned<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.300> on<00:04:50.360> and<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:50.630> let<00:04:50.840> him<00:04:51.020> smell<00:04:51.320> it

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
I turned it on and I let him smell it

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.080 
I turned it on and I let him smell it
and<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.800> would<00:04:51.950> sit<00:04:52.160> by<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.700> kind<00:04:52.880> of<00:04:52.940> show
