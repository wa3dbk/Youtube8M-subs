00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello all very good I hope that what 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.950
 are having a great time in the video 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.080
 exposé up today I think it's the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.050
 fourth or fifth I do not remember very well 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.090
 and I will teach you about how to change the 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.800
 color of your status bar what is this 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.070
 from up here 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.769
 by different ones in each application 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.509
 also with this module exposed the bar 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.669
 of status will change us automatically 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.009
 the color according to the application in the 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.259
 that we are like for example if we open 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.690
 the superuser application as you see 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.059
 now my bar is transparent 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.760
 and if we open superuser change the 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.800
 color to the gray color that would be 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.140
 the one of the application 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.290
 this can serve those who 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.219
 have this transparent status bar 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.070
 since sometimes the bar becomes white and 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.769
 like you do not see the icons work 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.550
 in almost all applications and also 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:03.129
 we can choose the color we want in 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.100
 any application we go to the review of 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.350
 is this great module that obviously 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.259
 they need to have an expósito framework 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.409
 installed on your mobile in addition to having 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:18.079
 Android 4.0 and root on your mobile 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.689
 if you do not know what is ex post framework you 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.619
 I'll leave my video here to get it 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.740
 click and it will open my video where 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.170
 He explained that it is exposito framework and how 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.569
 install a good module let's open 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.299
 expósito framework to show you how 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:38.030
 it's called the application they would have to 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.899
 open the installer eject and go to 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.310
 Download section and write the name 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.619
 of the application that would leave it 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.619
 written on one side is called 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.290
 feel status bar 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.799
 that's how it was called dyes status bar 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.219
 and here is how you see is in beta 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.000
 and good will give you the download and then 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:17.030
 the application installer will appear 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.700
 they go to modules and activate the popcorn 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.550
 of ink status bar once the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.670
 application dyes status bar have to 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.050
 Activate 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.880
 the box to activate the module a 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.640
 once done this restarts in its 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.770
 device for applying all 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.040
 changes I have already done so 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.630
 I will open the application directly 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.150
 once we open it it will take us a little 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.200
 download all applications but 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.640
 as has so many have seen are all 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.360
 the applications both the applications 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.370
 of the system like user apps like this 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.959
 that they can configure any app to their 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.910
 First of all, I recommend that you 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.330
 press the minus button of your android and 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.750
 go to settings now we 're going to 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.769
 default kings and in the first option that 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.210
 says default status bar ink color 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:16.350
 select and put 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.930
 the saturation at the beginning the minimum goes 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.170
 then where they want and opacity to the minimum 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.260
 with this we will have a bar 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.440
 transparent state by default good you 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.010
 they give to apply and well these are the 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.040
 can go reading are the dye of 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.600
 those of the icons and here in default 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.860
 navigation bar team color that you 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.040
 I recommend that they also put it 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.840
 transparent although I do not have 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.390
 navigation bar so do not configure it 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.940
 and we go back the icons as the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.780
 color that you want and good 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.380
 adjustments nothing more now in chair the 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.380
 application 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.760
 already in case this comes with auto 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.710
 detect the color of the application and the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.770
 color that the application has in the 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.990
 top part will change the color of the 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.200
 status bar as you see that is something very 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.959
 Useful 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.940
 since good is something quite 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.320
 customizable thing that I had not seen 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.060
 before before without any android that the 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.600
 work I liked a lot for example 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.420
 well, I recommend you 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.570
 go ship in your launcher in my case my 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.300
 launcher innovates select it the same in 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.639
 the activities 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.020
 and the status Martin put him in the bar in 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.840
 transparent or saturation to a minimum 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.389
 opacity of the minimum and return where 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.280
 they want it and they give it extended what 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.250
 same with the life of chamartin if it is 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.110
 they have or want and the icons good in 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.870
 the color that you want in my case 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.669
 I put it to the icon in white and 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.620
 with this we will achieve that when we are 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.200
 in our launcher our bar status 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.240
 Become transparent as you can see 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.670
 well I also recommend you do 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.560
 this in your screen application 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.140
 blocking if they have to remove the 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.990
 mine lock screen or activity 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.090
 is football ink and the base in 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.310
 transparency and saturation 0 Yes 0 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.639
 and between the medium where they want to give 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.219
 apply 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:31.650
 and they would also have a status bar 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:31.650
 transparent in its 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.040
 on your lock screen as they can 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.040
 watch 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.710
 we go back to the application we go back from 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.300
 shit let's go back and now I'm going to try 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.160
 another application as is the case of 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.400
 google play to see that I do not 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.900
 configure anything this already in case the 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.090
 memory of the application will change the 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.800
 color of the bar status according to 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.889
 application where they are 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.810
 I was not play store and it's good now 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.259
 no longer has internet but as you can see 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.370
 bar becomes gray like the part of 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.370
 is above the lawsuit 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.560
 well that seems to me to be the most 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.690
 important of the application that 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.190
 configure in transparency in your 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.430
 launcher and on your lock screen 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.990
 because that's how much better it is 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.720
 it seems that if they do not configure good it 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.720
 You will see the 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.940
 the black bar in your launcher and 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.760
 there are applications with which it does not work 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.010
 as is the case with facebook 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.800
 good now I changed the color a 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.500
 little blue how can you see that blue by 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.100
 defect the bar becomes black or white 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.610
 but I tried to put the blue so that 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.370
 I asked for a bit with the application 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:54.020
 and well that would be the only bus that I noticed 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:56.270
 that does not work with all of them but if 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.550
 does not work with any application can 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.680
 change the color of the bar in that 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.750
 application and put it to your liking 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.940
 good friends, it seems to me that up here 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.180
 would be the review of this module dyes 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.880
 status bar no doubt highly recommended more 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.710
 that nothing for what you like to have 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.180
 customization on your android if you 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.100
