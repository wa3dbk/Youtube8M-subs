00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 skyrim that great game where you can 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.570
 be from a cat to a child or even 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.400
 It can be a 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.400
 skyrim in two minutes 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.650
 What is cool about this game is that there 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.160
 variety can be an archer a magician or 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.350
 a murderer but of course you like 90% of 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.740
 the players are going to catch a point 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.110
 nordic and this one has to be blond from 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.939
 blue eyes you already know to put the 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.140
 typical viking helmet and go pulling 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.140
 full rodas everywhere 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.100
 [Music] 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.110
 enough and now that you tell me about the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.130
 dragons because there seems to be more 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.340
 dragons in the game that bandits 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.680
 and that's saying a lot 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.960
 you'll find in the tundra above the 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.570
 magicians school and they will even come from 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.640
 two in two but beware this is not the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.850
 strongest enemy of the game but for 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.740
 nothing 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:11.970
 [Music] 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.640
 then it's not going for 20,000 seventh you're 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.450
 prepared for the next question by 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.220
 Of course, well, let's go, who is it? 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.409
 the strongest enemy of skating a 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.700
 mammoth a giant 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.700
 an ice troll or maybe a vampire 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.850
 is option b 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.330
 we mark option b it will be this the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.330
 correct 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.750
 all right 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.820
 the 102 was the troll of frost since 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.350
 has an abusive regeneration of life and 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.800
 It has a high speed of movement 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.530
 in combat but do not worry you've 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.670
 step left to take the boat to a 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.130
 giant step ha ha 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.360
 my song is your dead I'm going to blow you 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.360
 the head for it puts 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.889
