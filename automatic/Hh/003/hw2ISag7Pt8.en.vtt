this is a regular circle you can find

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.790 
this is a regular circle you can find
that<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.960> page<00:00:22.170> 1<00:00:23.210> shrink<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.390> down<00:00:24.800> too

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
that on page 1 shrink that down too

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.670 
that on page 1 shrink that down too
pretty<00:00:26.279> pretty<00:00:26.789> small<00:00:27.029> size<00:00:27.270> and<00:00:27.300> then<00:00:27.840> kind

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
pretty pretty small size and then kind

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.470 
pretty pretty small size and then kind
of<00:00:28.800> put<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.160> towards<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.490> top<00:00:29.550> middle<00:00:30.029> but

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
of put it up towards the top middle but

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.120 
of put it up towards the top middle but
kinda<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.020> the<00:00:31.140> right<00:00:32.060> right<00:00:33.060> about<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.630> here

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
kinda to the right right about in here

vertical sort of like that but kind of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799 
vertical sort of like that but kind of
at<00:00:49.680> an<00:00:49.800> angle<00:00:50.480> then<00:00:51.480> you're<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
at an angle then you're going to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.080 
at an angle then you're going to
duplicate<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.829> circle<00:00:53.190> at<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.610> had<00:00:53.790> or

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
duplicate the circle at you just had or

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.459 
duplicate the circle at you just had or
just<00:00:54.329> get<00:00:54.480> another<00:00:54.629> circle<00:00:55.140> whatever<00:00:55.350> is

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
just get another circle whatever is

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.670 
just get another circle whatever is
easier<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.840> right<00:00:58.350> about

put<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:52.509> in<00:01:52.600> an<00:01:52.750> angle<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.850> they're<00:01:55.030> kind<00:01:55.119> of

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
put it in an angle so they're kind of

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.450 
put it in an angle so they're kind of
spread<00:01:55.570> out<00:01:55.600> wide<00:01:55.929> duplicate<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.920> or<00:01:57.100> just<00:01:57.280> get

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
spread out wide duplicate it or just get

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.669 
spread out wide duplicate it or just get
another<00:01:57.670> one<00:01:57.960> whatever<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.049> easier<00:01:59.469> and

you're going to put that on the other

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.240 
you're going to put that on the other
side<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.960> this

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.380 

then<00:02:07.820> you're<00:02:07.970> going<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.300> get<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.229> boot<00:02:10.390> which

then you're going to get the boot which
is<00:02:11.600> on<00:02:11.810> page<00:02:12.610> 11<00:02:14.140> shrink<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.350> down<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:16.100> it

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
is on page 11 shrink that down so it

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.670 
is on page 11 shrink that down so it
forms<00:02:16.490> this<00:02:16.700> foot<00:02:17.200> make<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.380> white<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:21.110> put<00:02:21.530> it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
forms this foot make it white and put it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.040 
forms this foot make it white and put it
like<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:22.100> then<00:02:23.060> you're<00:02:23.690> going<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.870> go<00:02:24.020> to
