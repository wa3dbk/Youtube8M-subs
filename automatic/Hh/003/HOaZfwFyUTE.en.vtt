cut the pipes and then we use what's

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.850 
cut the pipes and then we use what's
called<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.300> sharkbite<00:02:27.690> fitting<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.740> the

are there's a certain method to put them

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.990 
are there's a certain method to put them
on<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.720> have<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.400> ream<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.850> end

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
on you have to you have to ream the end

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.220 
on you have to you have to ream the end
of<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.390> clean<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.690> end<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.080> with<00:02:37.200> a

shower and the old tub locations have

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.100 
shower and the old tub locations have
changed<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.820> we<00:03:17.850> have<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.209> rework<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.810> drain

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110

it's really our best choice so let's

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.740 
it's really our best choice so let's
take<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.519> look<00:04:11.700> at<00:04:11.850> some<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.090> these<00:04:12.209> things<00:04:12.269> here

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
take a look at some of these things here

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.440 
take a look at some of these things here
and<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:13.010> little<00:04:14.010> bit<00:04:14.130> closer<00:04:14.400> part<00:04:15.239> of<00:04:15.330> any

the<00:04:19.169> room<00:04:19.350> is<00:04:19.470> gutted<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:19.919> have<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.220> make<00:04:20.370> sure

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
the room is gutted you have to make sure

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.210 
the room is gutted you have to make sure
that<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.850> structural<00:04:21.390> framing<00:04:21.959> is<00:04:22.320> strong

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
that the structural framing is strong

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.580 
that the structural framing is strong
and<00:04:23.460> secure<00:04:23.940> before<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.930> plumber<00:04:25.169> comes<00:04:25.440> in

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
and secure before the plumber comes in

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.830 
and secure before the plumber comes in
before<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.010> electrician<00:04:26.550> it's<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.270> lot<00:04:27.450> harder

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
before the electrician it's a lot harder

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.170 
before the electrician it's a lot harder
to<00:04:28.590> do<00:04:28.710> framing<00:04:29.250> when<00:04:29.460> there's<00:04:29.640> pipes<00:04:29.880> in<00:04:30.090> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
to do framing when there's pipes in the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.909 
to do framing when there's pipes in the
way<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:30.360> this<00:04:30.690> is<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.960> time<00:04:31.290> to<00:04:31.620> make<00:04:31.770> sure

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
way so this is the time to make sure

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.800 
way so this is the time to make sure

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
structural issues here at all but there

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.560 
structural issues here at all but there
are<00:04:41.370> some<00:04:41.580> things<00:04:41.730> that<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:41.910> have<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.180> deal<00:04:42.360> with

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
are some things that I have to deal with

are some things that I have to deal with
for<00:04:42.870> instance<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:44.640> new<00:04:44.820> shower<00:04:45.090> -<00:04:45.540> used<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.780> be

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
for instance the new shower - used to be

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.020 
for instance the new shower - used to be
an<00:04:45.990> emil<00:04:46.290> angle<00:04:46.740> shower<00:04:47.070> in<00:04:47.370> this<00:04:47.520> corner<00:04:47.940> was

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
an emil angle shower in this corner was

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.880 
an emil angle shower in this corner was
a<00:04:48.090> corner<00:04:48.480> shower<00:04:48.690> now<00:04:49.380> it's<00:04:49.590> going<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.740> be<00:04:49.830> a

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
a corner shower now it's going to be a

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.180 
a corner shower now it's going to be a
big<00:04:50.190> rectangular<00:04:50.880> shower<00:04:51.330> five<00:04:52.290> feet<00:04:52.590> by<00:04:52.800> four

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.770 
feet maybe five and a half feet by four
feet<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.680> had<00:04:55.920> to<00:04:56.010> build<00:04:56.160> a<00:04:56.310> pocket<00:04:56.820> here<00:04:57.300> to

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
feet so I had to build a pocket here to

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.320 
feet so I had to build a pocket here to
accept<00:04:58.170> a<00:04:58.290> half<00:04:58.530> wall<00:04:59.030> because<00:05:00.030> there'll<00:05:00.210> be<00:05:00.240> a

accept a half wall because there'll be a

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.760 
accept a half wall because there'll be a

framing<00:05:16.920> underneath<00:05:17.340> there<00:05:17.550> so<00:05:17.700> I'll<00:05:17.820> put

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
framing underneath there so I'll put

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.720 
framing underneath there so I'll put
some<00:05:18.210> framing<00:05:18.540> underneath<00:05:19.170> this<00:05:19.890> in<00:05:20.190> line

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
some framing underneath this in line

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.060 
some framing underneath this in line
with<00:05:20.970> this<00:05:21.150> wall<00:05:21.480> here<00:05:21.900> was<00:05:22.140> connection<00:05:22.710> and

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
with this wall here was connection and

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.560 
with this wall here was connection and
I'll<00:05:23.340> run<00:05:23.520> it<00:05:23.610> all<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:23.790> way<00:05:23.880> over<00:05:24.090> so<00:05:24.240> my<00:05:24.360> half

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
I'll run it all the way over so my half

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.870 
I'll run it all the way over so my half
wall<00:05:24.810> can<00:05:25.020> connect<00:05:25.320> to<00:05:25.410> that<00:05:25.470> I'm<00:05:26.310> also<00:05:26.370> going

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
wall can connect to that I'm also going

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.210 
wall can connect to that I'm also going
to<00:05:26.970> run<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.420> threaded<00:05:28.020> rod<00:05:28.050> at<00:05:28.500> some<00:05:28.710> Simpson

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
to run a threaded rod at some Simpson

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.040 
to run a threaded rod at some Simpson
connectors<00:05:29.730> I'm<00:05:30.210> going<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.510> do<00:05:30.570> a<00:05:30.600> separate

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
connectors I'm going to do a separate

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.150 
connectors I'm going to do a separate
video<00:05:31.230> on<00:05:31.380> this<00:05:31.560> because<00:05:31.770> it's<00:05:32.100> really

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
video on this because it's really

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.610 
video on this because it's really
important<00:05:32.940> it<00:05:33.270> really<00:05:33.390> gives<00:05:33.960> that<00:05:34.170> half<00:05:34.380> wall

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
important it really gives that half wall

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.710 
important it really gives that half wall
rigidity<00:05:35.220> because<00:05:35.880> this<00:05:36.030> whole<00:05:36.270> shower<00:05:36.510> is

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
rigidity because this whole shower is

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.570 
rigidity because this whole shower is
going<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:36.930> be<00:05:37.020> collapse<00:05:37.290> except<00:05:38.190> for<00:05:38.340> a<00:05:38.370> little

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
going to be collapse except for a little

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.130 
going to be collapse except for a little
wall<00:05:38.910> right<00:05:39.180> here<00:05:39.210> it's<00:05:39.750> going<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:39.900> be<00:05:39.990> all

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
wall right here it's going to be all

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.440 
wall right here it's going to be all
glass<00:05:40.470> and<00:05:40.770> an<00:05:40.950> all<00:05:41.040> glass<00:05:41.250> front<00:05:41.760> so<00:05:42.300> it's

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
glass and an all glass front so it's

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.690 
glass and an all glass front so it's
important<00:05:43.080> that<00:05:43.290> we<00:05:43.770> do<00:05:44.280> our<00:05:44.310> framing

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
important that we do our framing

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.790 
important that we do our framing
properly<00:05:45.270> I'll<00:05:45.630> have<00:05:45.810> to<00:05:45.960> put<00:05:46.140> blocking<00:05:46.680> in

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
properly I'll have to put blocking in

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.250 
properly I'll have to put blocking in
the<00:05:46.920> wall<00:05:47.160> to<00:05:47.550> accept<00:05:47.940> the<00:05:48.090> glass<00:05:48.390> doors<00:05:48.930> as

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
the wall to accept the glass doors as

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.800 
the wall to accept the glass doors as
well<00:05:49.500> wherever<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.340> glass<00:05:50.580> attaches<00:05:51.210> I<00:05:51.390> need

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
well wherever the glass attaches I need

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.740 
well wherever the glass attaches I need
solid<00:05:52.050> blocking<00:05:52.730> so<00:05:53.730> once<00:05:53.970> all<00:05:54.150> this<00:05:54.300> stuff<00:05:54.600> is

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
solid blocking so once all this stuff is

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.300 
solid blocking so once all this stuff is
done<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:55.050> all<00:05:55.230> the<00:05:55.290> structural<00:05:55.950> work<00:05:56.010> is

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
done and all the structural work is

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.370 
done and all the structural work is
complete<00:05:56.760> then<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.390> plumbers<00:05:57.810> come<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.200> and

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
complete then the plumbers come in and

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.470 
complete then the plumbers come in and
they<00:05:58.800> start<00:05:58.860> doing<00:05:59.400> their<00:05:59.580> rework<00:06:00.150> on<00:06:00.360> their

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
they start doing their rework on their

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.570 
they start doing their rework on their
drains<00:06:00.780> and<00:06:01.020> their<00:06:01.140> water<00:06:01.380> lines<00:06:01.710> when<00:06:02.400> that

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
drains and their water lines when that

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.900 
drains and their water lines when that
is<00:06:02.760> complete<00:06:03.150> we'll<00:06:03.420> put<00:06:03.750> back<00:06:04.080> down<00:06:04.470> our<00:06:04.950> 3/4

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
is complete we'll put back down our 3/4

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.190 
is complete we'll put back down our 3/4
subfloor<00:06:06.360> will<00:06:06.510> glue<00:06:06.720> and<00:06:06.870> screw<00:06:07.050> it<00:06:07.170> back

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
subfloor will glue and screw it back

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.160 
subfloor will glue and screw it back
down<00:06:07.560> and<00:06:07.800> frankly<00:06:08.550> I'll<00:06:08.700> rescrew<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.810> entire

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
down and frankly I'll rescrew the entire

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.200 
down and frankly I'll rescrew the entire
floor<00:06:10.500> it'll<00:06:10.710> eliminate<00:06:10.860> any<00:06:11.280> squeaks<00:06:11.850> and

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
floor it'll eliminate any squeaks and

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.960 
floor it'll eliminate any squeaks and
then<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:13.200> electrician<00:06:13.770> comes<00:06:13.980> in<00:06:14.160> after<00:06:14.820> the

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
then the electrician comes in after the

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.360 
then the electrician comes in after the
plumber<00:06:15.240> wires<00:06:16.080> are<00:06:16.380> a<00:06:16.410> lot<00:06:16.620> more<00:06:16.830> resilient

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
plumber wires are a lot more resilient

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.550 
plumber wires are a lot more resilient
and<00:06:17.550> bendable<00:06:18.210> than<00:06:18.510> pllump<00:06:18.840> plumbing<00:06:19.320> pipes

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
and bendable than pllump plumbing pipes

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.030 
and bendable than pllump plumbing pipes
so<00:06:20.190> the<00:06:20.850> order<00:06:21.300> of<00:06:21.420> business<00:06:21.570> is<00:06:22.040> gutting

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
so the order of business is gutting

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.360 
so the order of business is gutting
rough<00:06:23.820> framing<00:06:24.500> plumbing<00:06:25.500> and<00:06:25.710> then

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
rough framing plumbing and then

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.730 
rough framing plumbing and then
electrical<00:06:26.970> and<00:06:27.180> then<00:06:27.840> we<00:06:27.990> can<00:06:28.140> insulate<00:06:28.500> them

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
electrical and then we can insulate them

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.190 
electrical and then we can insulate them
fill<00:06:29.070> in<00:06:29.220> stuff<00:06:29.430> later<00:06:29.730> from<00:06:29.970> there<00:06:30.180> so<00:06:30.420> let's

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
fill in stuff later from there so let's

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:57.710 
fill in stuff later from there so let's
get<00:06:31.380> started<00:06:31.770> on<00:06:31.860> the<00:06:31.980> plumbing

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.060 

that's<00:06:58.720> it<00:06:58.900> for<00:06:59.080> the<00:06:59.140> rough<00:06:59.290> plumbing<00:06:59.530> here<00:06:59.980> is

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
that's it for the rough plumbing here is

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.250 
that's it for the rough plumbing here is
a<00:07:00.160> new<00:07:00.310> tub<00:07:00.550> location<00:07:01.120> water<00:07:01.480> lines<00:07:01.750> and<00:07:01.960> drain

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
a new tub location water lines and drain

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.610 
a new tub location water lines and drain
shower<00:07:02.980> drain<00:07:03.370> and<00:07:03.670> valve<00:07:04.020> not<00:07:05.020> much<00:07:05.200> more<00:07:05.500> to

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
shower drain and valve not much more to

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.200 
shower drain and valve not much more to
really<00:07:05.860> show<00:07:06.040> you<00:07:06.070> for<00:07:06.400> electrical<00:07:06.790> is<00:07:06.910> a<00:07:06.940> few

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
really show you for electrical is a few

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.820 
really show you for electrical is a few
wires<00:07:07.420> and<00:07:07.780> one<00:07:08.020> light<00:07:08.230> that<00:07:08.260> we<00:07:08.560> have<00:07:08.710> to

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
wires and one light that we have to

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.770 
wires and one light that we have to
relocate<00:07:09.160> on<00:07:09.580> the<00:07:09.850> next<00:07:10.090> video<00:07:10.360> we'll<00:07:10.600> talk
