one and he puts it at the bottom of the
pile<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.300> say<00:03:18.200> easy<00:03:18.470> enough<00:03:18.830> that<00:03:19.190> cards<00:03:19.519> in<00:03:19.610> the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
pile I say easy enough that cards in the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.780 
pile I say easy enough that cards in the
bottom<00:03:20.000> because<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:20.870> did<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.050> double<00:03:21.350> take

bottom because you did a double take

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.720 
bottom because you did a double take
this<00:03:22.930> ends<00:03:23.930> up<00:03:24.019> in<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.170> bottom<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.910> now<00:03:27.730> you

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
this ends up in the bottom so now you

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.520 
this ends up in the bottom so now you
push<00:03:29.030> forward<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.870> pushed<00:03:30.080> two<00:03:30.230> cards
