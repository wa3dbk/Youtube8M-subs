00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.299
 assists 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.970
 The first style trash is a kind of 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.350
 a kind of fountain a kind of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.259
 blitz star just a little more 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.680
 her active time makes you 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.070
 Pull your enemies for 1.5 seconds to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.259
 its direction each year magical and also 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 has a passive that while you do not 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.860
 attack builds up and then you can use you 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.900
 can attack your enemy for damage 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.549
 but additional to the second skill of the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.159
 thrash makes him not get one 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.899
 flashlight an indication if we look 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.070
 to explain this flashlight the technician 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.009
 different 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.350
 the stretch will pull the flashlight and wet 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.009
 in your direction and will give a shield to 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.170
 the two saints both 3 against the ally 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.100
 lantana is a good excuse to run away 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.810
 because if you want to win with her but 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.399
 when it 's just the opposite you do not 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.459
 nothing is worth staying in the flashlight and he 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.730
 will simply vote in your days until 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.440
 being skill of the trash is the theme of mobility 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.080
 has a 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.350
 a very interesting concept because 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.710
 it's an area attack that maybe you 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.440
 will use more here to say that the 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.050
 use it 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.690
 the front makes you pull the 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.340
 Alessi enemies push enemies in 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.340
 back pulls from there 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.110
 the back was pulled to my side 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.300
 and the front was pushed in 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.490
 few words one can say that he 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:55.820
 simply by everyone towards you and the 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.790
 last skill in trash is 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.060
 box it creates a drop around it and 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.710
 everyone to go through the wall 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.600
 destroys that part of the wall and gives a 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.460
 damage 400 hours later and 99% download with 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.250
 two seconds or so it is 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.520
 simply stopped for two seconds 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.739
 It's just not going to press that's it. 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.280
 stretch is being recommended as 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.620
 support is both for them and tank 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.130
 You need to confirm that you have or have 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.959
 Is someone talking to your side? 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.440
 also you can be stand a solo 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.180
 top or only but that 's it guys 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.820
 this was a test available to play 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.070
 no pv if you do not have a bb account 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.489
 people on uol's site 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.980
 and maybe you can sign up 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.150
 because the second requires a good 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.100
 make a registration but it's been a while 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.769
 I do not see their hypothesis but that's it 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.920
 there guys and we talked to everyone I 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.920
