it's<00:02:43.230> pretty<00:02:43.410> good<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:44.490> gives<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.880> good

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
it's pretty good it gives you a good

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.090 
it's pretty good it gives you a good
perspective<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.140> gameplay<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:46.890> you're

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
perspective of the gameplay if you're

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.450 
perspective of the gameplay if you're
sitting<00:02:47.430> behind<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.000> goals<00:02:48.270> or<00:02:48.480> something

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
sitting behind the goals or something

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.550 
sitting behind the goals or something
but<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.760> other<00:02:50.880> thing<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.120> does<00:02:51.810> annoy<00:02:52.320> me<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
but the other thing that does annoy me a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.670 
but the other thing that does annoy me a
bit<00:02:52.770> about<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.810> whenever<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.200> ball<00:02:55.380> switch

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
bit about it is whenever the ball switch

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.010 
bit about it is whenever the ball switch
is<00:02:55.830> over<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.640> our<00:02:56.990> position<00:02:57.990> that

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
is over to like our position that

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.340 
is over to like our position that
changes<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.800> Cameron<00:02:59.190> flicks<00:02:59.520> around<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.350> it

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
changes the Cameron flicks around and it

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.440 
changes the Cameron flicks around and it
gets<00:03:01.800> really<00:03:02.280> irritating<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.240> if<00:03:03.330> you're

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
gets really irritating so if you're

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.600 
gets really irritating so if you're
trying<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.690> get<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.840> quick<00:03:04.440> kick<00:03:04.710> off<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.100> it

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
trying to get a quick kick off and it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.970 
trying to get a quick kick off and it
changes<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.120> camera<00:03:06.510> around<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:07.260> direction<00:03:07.770> of

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980

I<00:04:11.650> thought<00:04:12.489> I<00:04:12.730> was<00:04:13.000> doing<00:04:13.150> quite<00:04:13.480> well<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.989> think

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
I thought I was doing quite well I think

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.229 
I thought I was doing quite well I think
up<00:04:14.860> until<00:04:14.950> halftime<00:04:15.370> was<00:04:16.000> pretty<00:04:16.269> close<00:04:16.829> and

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
up until halftime was pretty close and

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.310 
up until halftime was pretty close and
and<00:04:20.669> after<00:04:21.669> halftime<00:04:21.880> he<00:04:22.450> sort<00:04:22.690> of<00:04:22.750> just<00:04:22.930> blew

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
and after halftime he sort of just blew

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.390 
and after halftime he sort of just blew
it<00:04:23.470> out<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:25.080> my<00:04:26.080> place<00:04:26.350> sort<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:26.889> didn't<00:04:27.250> do

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
it out and my place sort of didn't do

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.950 
it out and my place sort of didn't do
much<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:29.100> when<00:04:30.100> I'm<00:04:30.250> just<00:04:30.550> about<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:30.910> get<00:04:31.210> like

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
much so when I'm just about to get like

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.690 
much so when I'm just about to get like
good<00:04:31.990> possession<00:04:32.470> of<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.710> ball<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:33.430> always

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
good possession of the ball it always

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.430 
good possession of the ball it always
seemed<00:04:33.940> be<00:04:34.120> free<00:04:34.780> kick<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.110> elevator

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
something anyway can't really dwell on

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.390 
something anyway can't really dwell on
the<00:04:38.800> umpires<00:04:39.130> too<00:04:39.370> much<00:04:39.610> it's<00:04:40.270> all<00:04:40.450> skill<00:04:41.400> you

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
can't say of winning by a hundred thirty

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.300 
can't say of winning by a hundred thirty
points<00:04:46.000> it's<00:04:46.150> luck<00:04:46.450> because<00:04:47.440> it's<00:04:47.620> not<00:04:47.830> you

single point that he beat me by i'm
pretty<00:04:59.260> sure<00:04:59.380> if<00:04:59.560> i<00:04:59.740> did<00:04:59.950> play<00:05:00.160> bit<00:05:00.400> better

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
pretty sure if i did play bit better

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.680 
pretty sure if i did play bit better
would<00:05:00.970> have<00:05:01.060> been<00:05:01.090> a<00:05:01.210> lot<00:05:01.240> closer<00:05:01.630> but

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
would have been a lot closer but

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.730 
would have been a lot closer but
unfortunately<00:05:04.690> i<00:05:05.190> didn't<00:05:06.190> sir<00:05:07.200> yeah<00:05:08.200> see<00:05:08.560> once

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
unfortunately i didn't sir yeah see once

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.659 
unfortunately i didn't sir yeah see once
again<00:05:09.660> just<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:10.930> don't<00:05:11.320> know<00:05:11.530> how<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.860> stop

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
again just I don't know how to stop

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.070 
again just I don't know how to stop
giving<00:05:12.850> away<00:05:13.150> free<00:05:13.450> keeps<00:05:13.630> on<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.870> tackle

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
giving away free keeps on the tackle

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.380 
giving away free keeps on the tackle
because<00:05:14.410> I<00:05:14.440> send<00:05:14.710> it<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:14.919> lot<00:05:15.250> I<00:05:15.520> think<00:05:16.270> that's

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
because I send it a lot I think that's

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.120 
because I send it a lot I think that's
if<00:05:16.510> you're<00:05:16.660> holding<00:05:16.960> sprint<00:05:17.410> and<00:05:17.560> tackle<00:05:18.039> at

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
if you're holding sprint and tackle at

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.670 
if you're holding sprint and tackle at
the<00:05:18.250> same<00:05:18.430> time<00:05:18.700> it<00:05:18.910> tends<00:05:19.120> to<00:05:19.210> do<00:05:19.479> that<00:05:19.510> and<00:05:19.870> it

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
the same time it tends to do that and it

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.990 
the same time it tends to do that and it
tends<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:20.979> give<00:05:21.100> away<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.340> free<00:05:21.430> kick<00:05:21.760> for<00:05:21.880> the

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
tends to give away a free kick for the

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.680 
tends to give away a free kick for the
opposition<00:05:22.350> but<00:05:23.350> anyway<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:25.360> I've<00:05:25.419> also<00:05:25.510> been
