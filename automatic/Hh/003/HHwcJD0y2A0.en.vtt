blending everything together then I am

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.820 
blending everything together then I am
adding<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.180> little<00:02:11.330> bit<00:02:11.450> more<00:02:11.570> fresco<00:02:12.440> shade

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
adding a little bit more fresco shade

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.000 
adding a little bit more fresco shade
onto<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.490> lid<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.760> into<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.360> crease<00:02:14.660> just

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
onto the lid and into the crease just

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.680 
onto the lid and into the crease just
because<00:02:16.010> when<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.310> get<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.490> blending<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.120> it

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
because when you get to blending it it

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.890 
because when you get to blending it it
can<00:02:17.900> kind<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.170> blend<00:02:18.440> away<00:02:18.680> some<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.280> color

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
can kind of blend away some of the color

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.900 
can kind of blend away some of the color
and<00:02:20.900> then<00:02:21.110> just<00:02:21.380> blending<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:21.830> out<00:02:22.130> again

applying wet and wild spirit all ours

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.300 
applying wet and wild spirit all ours
and<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.870> reason<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.320> chose<00:04:14.380> this<00:04:14.830> is<00:04:15.100> that

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
and the reason that I chose this is that

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.340 
and the reason that I chose this is that
in<00:04:15.459> most<00:04:15.700> of<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.940> pictures<00:04:16.329> that<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:16.570> saw<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:17.140> me

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
in most of the pictures that I saw of me

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.580 
in most of the pictures that I saw of me
less<00:04:17.560> she<00:04:17.769> is<00:04:17.919> wearing<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.340> nude<00:04:18.579> lip<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.840> this

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
less she is wearing a nude lip so this

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.260 
less she is wearing a nude lip so this
one<00:04:20.859> is<00:04:21.040> pretty<00:04:21.280> similar<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.760> what<00:04:21.970> she

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
one is pretty similar to what she

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.330 
one is pretty similar to what she
usually<00:04:22.480> wears<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.410> then<00:04:23.590> I'm<00:04:23.740> going<00:04:23.950> over

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
usually wears and then I'm going over

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.760 
usually wears and then I'm going over
the<00:04:24.610> lip<00:04:24.820> with<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.270> translucent<00:04:25.780> powder<00:04:26.140> and<00:04:26.440> a
