do<00:00:06.690> not<00:00:06.839> try<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.020> at<00:00:07.259> home<00:00:07.580> so<00:00:08.580> we<00:00:08.849> have<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
do not try this at home so we have the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.209 
do not try this at home so we have the
fuel<00:00:09.660> sitting<00:00:10.050> here<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.469> then<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:10.889> just

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
fuel sitting here and then this is just

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.820 
fuel sitting here and then this is just
a<00:00:11.340> like<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.030> lazy<00:00:12.269> susan<00:00:12.570> okay<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.620> goes

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
a like a lazy susan okay so this goes

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.099 
a like a lazy susan okay so this goes
here<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.250> as<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:14.490> light<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:15.599> spin<00:00:15.929> if

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
here and as we light it and we spin if

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.420 
here and as we light it and we spin if
you<00:00:16.230> take<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> look<00:00:16.650> at<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:17.100> like<00:00:17.220> this

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
you take a look at it here like this

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.099 
you take a look at it here like this
nothing<00:00:17.970> really<00:00:18.119> happens<00:00:18.570> yeah<00:00:18.779> alright<00:00:19.080> so

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
nothing really happens yeah alright so

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.140 
nothing really happens yeah alright so
just<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.890> spinning<00:00:20.279> doesn't<00:00:20.670> do<00:00:20.760> anything<00:00:21.000> at

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
just the spinning doesn't do anything at

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.910 
just the spinning doesn't do anything at
all<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.810> here<00:00:22.080> let<00:00:22.199> me<00:00:22.230> extinguish<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
all so here let me extinguish it and

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.500 
all so here let me extinguish it and
show<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.039> what<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.279> next<00:00:23.400> piece<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.210> is

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
show you what the next piece is this is

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.200 
show you what the next piece is this is
a<00:00:24.810> piece<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.140> screen<00:00:25.670> so<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:26.970> see<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.150> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
a piece of screen so you can see it's a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.310 
a piece of screen so you can see it's a
little<00:00:27.269> black<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> outside<00:00:27.990> because<00:00:28.289> we

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
little black on the outside because we

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.660 
little black on the outside because we
might<00:00:28.590> have<00:00:28.710> done<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.250> couple<00:00:29.460> times

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
might have done this just a couple times

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.269 
might have done this just a couple times
so<00:00:30.570> here's<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> screen<00:00:31.320> that's<00:00:31.590> here<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.160> now

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
so here's the screen that's here so now

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.560 
so here's the screen that's here so now
here's<00:00:32.520> what's<00:00:32.700> gonna<00:00:32.790> happen<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.450> gonna

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
here's what's gonna happen this is gonna

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.510 
here's what's gonna happen this is gonna
simulate<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.469> wind<00:00:34.739> whipping<00:00:35.219> through<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
simulate the wind whipping through the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.209 
simulate the wind whipping through the
trees<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.390> they<00:00:36.540> start<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.079> form<00:00:37.559> as<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> wind

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
trees so they start to form as the wind

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.740 
trees so they start to form as the wind
whips<00:00:38.520> through<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> trees<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:39.510> relate

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
whips through the trees so here relate

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.560 
whips through the trees so here relate
this<00:00:39.960> got<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.579> now<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:42.420> like

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this got it so now this is here like

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
this got it so now this is here like
this<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.320> wind<00:00:43.680> begins<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.100> whip

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this and as the wind begins to whip

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.010 
this and as the wind begins to whip
through<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> trees<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.120> start<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.780> this

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
through the trees you start to see this

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.130 
through the trees you start to see this
amazing<00:00:46.320> vortex<00:00:47.070> kind<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.399> take<00:00:47.550> place<00:00:47.789> Oh

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
amazing vortex kind of take place Oh

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.510 
amazing vortex kind of take place Oh
centripetal<00:00:49.140> force<00:00:49.530> isn't<00:00:49.649> amazing<00:00:49.980> it's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
centripetal force isn't amazing it's

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.889 
centripetal force isn't amazing it's
just<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> centripetal<00:00:51.270> force<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.870> that

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
just like a centripetal force so that

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.060 
just like a centripetal force so that
centripetal<00:00:52.379> action<00:00:54.320> see<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.469> pretty<00:00:55.800> fast

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
centripetal action see it's pretty fast

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.040 
centripetal action see it's pretty fast
and<00:00:56.430> depending<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:56.910> how<00:00:57.149> oh<00:00:57.329> that's<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.899> good

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and depending on how oh that's a good

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.330 
and depending on how oh that's a good
one<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.199> kind<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.500> pops<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> top<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
one that kind of pops to the top is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.369 
one that kind of pops to the top is
amazing<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.570> that's<00:01:00.690> exactly<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.170> we're

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
amazing so that's exactly what we're

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.720 
amazing so that's exactly what we're
seeing<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.770> they're<00:01:01.920> actually<00:01:02.039> burning<00:01:02.579> from

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
seeing so they're actually burning from

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.600 
seeing so they're actually burning from
treetop<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.390> treetop<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> fire<00:01:05.339> can

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
treetop to treetop and so a fire can

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.830 
treetop to treetop and so a fire can
kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> come<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.240> let<00:01:06.330> me<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
kind of come up here let me do this a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.570 
kind of come up here let me do this a
fire<00:01:07.140> will<00:01:07.380> come<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.860> actually<00:01:08.070> start

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
fire will come up and actually start

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.490 
fire will come up and actually start
from<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.820> bottom<00:01:09.270> work<00:01:09.930> its<00:01:10.080> way<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> very

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
from the bottom work its way to the very

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.679 
from the bottom work its way to the very
top<00:01:10.590> catch<00:01:11.100> another<00:01:11.369> treetop<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.240> fire<00:01:12.479> in

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
top catch another treetop on fire in

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.480 
top catch another treetop on fire in
their<00:01:12.840> jumps<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.830> see<00:01:13.979> how<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
their jumps so you can see how can it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.890 
their jumps so you can see how can it
just<00:01:14.760> totally<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.390> control

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
just totally out of control

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.660 
just totally out of control
yeah<00:01:16.020> absolutely<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.130> here's<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.490> wanted

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
yeah absolutely so here's what I wanted

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.010 
yeah absolutely so here's what I wanted
to<00:01:17.759> show<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.509> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.659> thinking<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
to show you I was kind of thinking to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.140 
to show you I was kind of thinking to
show<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> pops<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> top<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.909> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
show you that it pops to the top so it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.460 
show you that it pops to the top so it
would<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.299> good<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.720> way<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:21.960> here<00:01:22.229> let's<00:01:22.380> see

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
would be good this way so here let's see

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.380 
would be good this way so here let's see
if<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> good<00:01:23.040> vortex<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.850> all<00:01:24.299> right

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
if we get a good vortex going all right

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.690 
if we get a good vortex going all right
so<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.409> fine<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
so it's fine so you just have to get a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.940 
so it's fine so you just have to get a
good<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.299> going<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:28.560> right<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.799> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
good one kind of going all right so that
