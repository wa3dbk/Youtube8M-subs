00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.360
 Hey guys 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.040
 the company is already starting to exist in the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.650
 bringing another commented video to 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.920
 I hope you bring a game player 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.420
 for 84 playing boat type and 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.920
 guys, I fucked gameplay to give a 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.470
 very important message but many 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.910
 things for you, for the teacher, let's go 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.980
 have to follow another channel that 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.619
 You know that I have a clan that I smoked a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.330
 clan and that it is growing a lot is a 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.769
 very important message to the people 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.030
 But to pass the message, people are talking 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.750
 little about these new boats 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.460
 patrol 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.050
 these new patrol boats galley 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.059
 They are very strong and very cool. 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 play with them however have some things 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.600
 What do you have to know before you go running? 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.649
 a day so some things that you 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.210
 have to get used 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.739
 first that they are not like 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.600
 tanks let's say so you do not have 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.489
 how much catch talk with him 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.920
 this is sometimes annoying because a 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.199
 it has to become a side-only hit since 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.600
 Disable you already lose mobility it 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.460
 quickly kills and another boring thing 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.399
 are also the guys that comes puts a c4 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.760
 That's right, by swimming and putting c4 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.080
 on the boat then there are many things that 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.180
 You gotta get the hang of it. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.369
 get used to being able to survive 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.299
 able to play well with these new 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.860
 vehicles 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.299
 one thing I have done enough guys 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.100
 It is not stand fiddled one 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.509
 little bit back 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.540
 something else that I do move 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.070
 enough for other places like here 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.700
 I'm not going to talk back there to the other. 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.290
 flag 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.460
 then I 'm going to the other side of the project 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.350
 from another flag is a movement 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.479
 enough by map changing place 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.009
 quite something else I 've done 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.329
 It's pretty clear when I go in for 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.189
 example a very enclosed place that does not 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.869
 There's a lot of space in the narrow 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.210
 I come back because why then 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.860
 money it goes slower though 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.720
 if I need to get out of the guinea quickly 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.180
 Do you have any problems, need to be fast? 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.399
 there I tighten shift in the practice of that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.649
 After bathing and I'm going to be a president. 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.780
 because it accelerated to escape from making 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.549
 The faster the rest, then let's go. 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.350
 position in front of and at the right time 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.409
 getting out of the way will take too long 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.939
 too slow to leave and you're done 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.710
 dying because of that then when 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.020
 You'll enter the strait, it's good for you. 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.850
 go backwards so far not realized but 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.950
 many things like that on this boat was 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.319
 I really liked him but not much. 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.850
 I played with him so much to know 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.470
 more details about it 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.700
 so beauty now let's get one 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.020
 very important message is that I have 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.570
 to talk about the plan 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.670
 first guys I'm going to leave them all 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.410
 the clan cans here in the description of this 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.510
 video or said he did not know if 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.000
 has three divisions that he is in peace 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.100
 again on for beginners 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.440
 sniper elite fall m is pro 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.210
 elite intermediate snipers staff 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.560
 that the most advanced person 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.080
 Now you sit wondering Thai. 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.690
 why the japan about this I go 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.040
 stay is as follows the clan tag is up to one 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.610
 name you are a match that puts 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.280
 before tempers are so is r 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.020
 respectively the snp he knows not 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.200
 will hold we need you is now 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.060
 is this pro he said that this fall of 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.490
 The way it looks now is pro. 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.140
 elite snipers now the gang the greatest 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.290
 problem is that until we 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.010
 we use name and unfortunately neither any 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.720
 one can wear a bikini and a lot of people 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.100
 Now you've done it, you bastard. 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.580
 by means of a call of what they 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.900
 cool 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.640
 there are people who are putting the tag 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.290
 clan is using the chip through the servers 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.270
 making fool like the clan hitherto 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.340
 Pimentel is another look at the guy there 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.350
 from club jb is using the chip but 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.320
 And that's why I'm leaving the 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.940
 official links of the bosses because it was 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.560
 because you always have a guy 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.240
 making a mess of the server and he 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.310
 have even been using guys if you guys 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.530
 they wanted to be sure it would be the clan 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.590
 take a look at the audience because the guy 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.050
 sits the clan he has to be in the audience 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.300
 if you see the guy with nick s / n you go 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.550
 look at everything he knows if he will not 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.230
 It will look there to see if it's there 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.060
 if he is there he really belongs to the clan and 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.680
 if you have ever done have 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.640
 something wrong you can talk 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.100
 Can you talk to me with me? 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.300
 mentioning that we will solve 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.470
 independent can even banish the guy 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.970
 Can the clan's face stay? 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.800
 depending on what you are doing 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.050
 thing gravity if the guy for example 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.480
 nike faith you will look platon 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.420
 illness that causes the disease to fall and 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.340
 reveal whether the guy's clan or not and 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.350
 same thing for 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.590
 the clan is not easy to enter guys we 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.300
 we have very strict rules to enter the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.640
 corner in various types of procedures 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.640
 so a lot of people sometimes try little 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.560
 Can not get there, get upset, put it there. 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.940
 to double yet the boot here than 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.889
 there is still one year servers 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.120
 we curse another wave rules our clan 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.469
 you can not be getting the 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.629
 servers have to respect everyone 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:32.300
 not practicing game respect the rules 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.560
 and respect everyone is at last our 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.060
 contains several rules can also 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.189
 check throwing away will leave the forum 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.960
 and also a teacher living in the rules 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.520
 if any member I learn 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.560
 some of these rules can enter into 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.969
 contact with me is with a 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.479
 climate also has the administrators of 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.849
 clan 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.710
 there also have the official members and 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.479
 official clan recruits 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.999
 so guys this is a warning if you guys 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.189
 to see any member doing nonsense 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:57.229
 cursing the other and using the technique you 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:59.060
 you can be sure that he is not a member 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.219
 of the clan and if it is what I doubt 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.139
 much that a member of our field does 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.539
 This will do it if it really is 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.400
 you can be sure that it will be 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.050
 cute will be clicked from the clan with 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.389
 certain lack of respect is one thing 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.729
 that we do not admit, however, yet 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.080
 the message given unfortunately I had to 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.210
 To pass this message I do not like much 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.169
 relate the clan to the channel because the 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.229
 channel is a totally different thing. 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.539
 of kleber but how can I say like here 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.889
 it's easier but the staff see it 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.620
 the message we want to spend here 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.360
 so it's better that it's here we go 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.860
 tell yourself that you are already aware of 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.839
 these guys 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.610
 these guys depending on the type of 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.650
 It's not the plan, it's just you. 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.659
 will get platoon beauty now in bs-4 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.310
 we are going to expand the field for vehicles 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.599
 that is who plays the vehicle will also 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.939
 to be part of the clan not only 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.189
 snippers and more ahead maybe 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:47.599
 Let's open the infantry. 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:48.979
 so this is it was the message that I 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.270
 had to pass on to you 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.759
 and thank you all very much 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.300
 resisted this rough video here 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.300
 that hug
