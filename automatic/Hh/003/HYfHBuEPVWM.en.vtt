00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.210
 help with something today imagine such a game 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 12 came out 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.560

 SPOX supplies formula1 fans praised LÃ¶w 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:46.310
 Thiriet 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.990
 What this brings with it is now to be considered 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.010
 Bonn the STA innovation 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.630
 read 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.949
 there is no addition 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.850
 the line is needed in the house itself is Vivi industries 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.220
 Rostock 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.290
 um and Zorc 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.320
 that fits 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.850
 with the backing Bremen Avia us Abel 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.070
 Lehmann 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.720
 also hoped my 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.490
 a ca 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.490
 at the beginning of these 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.409
 to a so-called Bioware move 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.310
 put 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.840
 install 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.090
 and 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.440
 This is what one says Fall Peter did 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.560
 and what this is for Babelsberg is fantastic 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.120
 I say you are also early 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.960
 so Dirks you could, among other things 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.290
 movements 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.970
 one 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.460
 I was heading north 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.540
 Sensitech 08 Formulas and decelerates 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.760
 To make Ralph 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.760
 after which the atomic bomb but a 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.000
 when could no 3d were moved 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.570
 so could not do that 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.190
 Warhol for example 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.190
 concerned tripartite 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.270
 We succeeded in bringing the pilgrims were additions to this kilowatt instead 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.730
 another senseo will make the controls even more rock 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.469
 Brussels 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.469
 until 10 this game is now the game 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.409
 Euro +2 percent come 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:32.139
 that should everyone pay for demonstrators what this 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.030
 Do not take the game so seriously if it is bread 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.300
 It's not hard at all, we want my favorite game 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.410
 from these he summoned 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.619
 There are twelve players in total 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:43.729
 the games 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:44.739
 the West 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.739
 not Box Passion the spots are shaking 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:50.569
 around and 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.559
 new files were improved with the new control 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:03:00.189
 SPOX Linz wants to do some of the tires 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.959
 and so much fun you had powers like that 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.009
 it would come on 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.199
 m a sports car 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:14.419
 and one of those points before project show it to them 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.969
 as the place is welcome 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.969
 not that she lived that far until now 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.269
 one way or the other 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.449
 Percent 2 put an end to it 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.129
 rhine-main the speech 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.279
 here drove playtime 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.029
 my movements 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:34.129
 as hot as I sweat it is 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.129
 sometimes that's how it is 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.639
 so can 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.200
 secondly, that more recruits now 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.569
 two percent is directly 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.439
 why so much 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.089
 pay off 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:56.119
 lowered it while what was actually 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.259
 what they are here 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:03.539
 in the process, the movements have been taken over exactly Chr 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.309
 Kandahar around their apartments 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:08.359
 and when she got him 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.690
 Ã¶zil's goals are very good 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.039
 we can 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.509
 a pop star 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.699
 Jackpot so can play 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.699
 Roy start 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.819
 Altena she could bloom down percent east 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.729
 we'll get ready again 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.370
 but still pretty good, so to speak 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.240
 by one percent 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.819
 the place is there 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.610
 played in "ER" against an opponent 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.819
 to dispose 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:02.449
 Playing at a high level, automobile titles could get into the subscription points and he 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.089
 gets ball against Yapi too value is 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:08.089
 on 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.520
 So Bob Dylan too 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.639
 only at some 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.330
 still here could be one 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.960
 we want to be the body 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.050
 cut 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.680
 we go 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.360
 Cutting down to fame alone gives 3 percent bio 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.439
 They are so open that practically everything is possible 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.800
 the throb 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.749
 like no other 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.919
 up there I do not see games he still sees very few 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.779
 but what 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.460
 round

 HK 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.889
 from 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.889
 before that much is clear 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:04.629
 Koepke 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:05.919
 Besides

 Of course you can not Rheine 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:29.119
 and another problem 

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:32.119
 and point we want to do 

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:35.930
 Dirk Helbing
