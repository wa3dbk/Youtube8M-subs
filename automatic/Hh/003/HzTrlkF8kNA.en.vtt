00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
right thing is but on the phone it's

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.550 
right thing is but on the phone it's
really<00:05:11.180> hard<00:05:11.360> it's<00:05:11.600> it's<00:05:12.080> weird<00:05:12.350> it's

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
really hard it's it's weird it's

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.780 
really hard it's it's weird it's
something<00:05:12.800> that<00:05:12.950> you<00:05:13.160> think<00:05:13.310> would<00:05:13.460> be<00:05:13.610> so

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
something that you think would be so

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.250 
something that you think would be so
simple<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.330> yet<00:05:14.390> when<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.690> put<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.080> in<00:05:15.140> a

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
simple and yet when you put it in a

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.750 
simple and yet when you put it in a
touchscreen<00:05:15.650> environment<00:05:16.280> on<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.430> small

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
touchscreen environment on a small

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.860 
touchscreen environment on a small
screen<00:05:16.970> it's<00:05:17.300> actually<00:05:17.420> a<00:05:17.600> lot<00:05:17.720> more

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
screen it's actually a lot more

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.270 
screen it's actually a lot more
difficult<00:05:18.200> i<00:05:18.350> personally<00:05:18.740> think<00:05:18.830> that<00:05:18.920> apple

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
difficult i personally think that apple

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.670 
difficult i personally think that apple
does<00:05:19.400> it<00:05:19.520> better<00:05:19.610> than<00:05:19.700> anyone<00:05:19.910> else<00:05:20.440> but<00:05:21.440> go

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
does it better than anyone else but go

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.680 
does it better than anyone else but go
to<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.890> dark<00:05:22.070> spot<00:05:22.370> no<00:05:22.670> but<00:05:23.120> it<00:05:23.210> took<00:05:23.360> them<00:05:23.510> two

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
to the dark spot no but it took them two

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.200 
to the dark spot no but it took them two
years<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:23.960> get<00:05:24.140> there<00:05:24.290> yeah<00:05:24.850> but<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:25.970> main

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
years to get there yeah but the main

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.030 
years to get there yeah but the main
perk<00:05:26.540> of<00:05:26.750> this<00:05:26.870> device<00:05:27.140> is<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:27.410> it<00:05:27.530> is<00:05:27.800> the

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
perk of this device is that it is the

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.550 
perk of this device is that it is the
official<00:05:28.580> new<00:05:28.880> google<00:05:29.420> phone<00:05:29.530> meaning<00:05:30.530> that
