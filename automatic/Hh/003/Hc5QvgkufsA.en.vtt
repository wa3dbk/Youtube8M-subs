 2006 is like this 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 think 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.730
 the decision of music music court 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.730
 basically ashore is this you know if 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.920
 on the rope if you know the beat style can 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.570
 have variations in the middle of the song you 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.119
 can lead to internal 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.720
 the only assessment it has of 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.840
 the chords of the song without being 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.520
 the smaller the synop there will have a 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.130
 part of the song in the second part 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.430
 Are you going to make a better movie? 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.640
