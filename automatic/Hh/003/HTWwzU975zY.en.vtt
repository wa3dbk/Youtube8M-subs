00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.940

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.609
 well t3 what is the backpack and what 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.429
 I still have not got the book because 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.619
 Well, they still have not given it to me because 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.230
 I did not start the course but what I'm going 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.710
 to teach is what is the material the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.710
 notebooks 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.910
 the bolis and may be some can 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.770
 to be foolish but 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.200
 but well I did a year ago 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.150
 video as well as this back to school 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.860
 of shopping around the school and os 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.410
 he liked it quite so well then this 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.480
 to do the same thing I went to the same 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.010
 and materials tell you that I have 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.220
 bought in the eroski soil go we wanted 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.590
 go to a warehouse where we knew that what 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.900
 they sold everything cheaper but I was 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.880
 closed and good I went yesterday in August 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.800
 because you know that in September they go up 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.940
 up and good to save us a little 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.119
 of money because we went in August like this 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.940
 that nothing what the backpack is still not 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.310
 I have it or I have it off but I 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.320
 they have to get it okay because I was not 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.630
 in store from the streets of the mouth and 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.570
 Well, I've been with the old one for two years 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.200
 I was from converse and I needed 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.289
 change 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 Well okay then I'll start 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.509
 for the notebook that 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.219
 you know that I always said it 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:50.210
 last year I always buy oxford 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:52.909
 they can be masks like that but it's 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.920
 must have pasta 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.979
 it's hard because the ipad is already talking 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.229
 the cartonboard ends this bad or 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.780
 they end up breaking and wrinkling 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.659
 get expert so hard 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.269
 either forum cost us at least 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.780
 three euros and these are the ones that I 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:15.170
 I'm buying 390 1 euro better than 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.829
 They are more expensive but they last me a lot 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.930
 the leaves are broken and it is not 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:25.069
 they have this margin here 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.709
 they have this margin here 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.019
 that makes everything look cleaner 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.120
 I know there are people who have the gift this 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:36.260
 he does everything very clean he has the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.849
 very nice letter but I'm not worth me 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.239
 I've always been like that from there and good and 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:47.319
 I do not use a file cabinet because I am 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.000
 very messy and ended up losing everything 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.040
 I believe that the filing cabinet for people 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.530
 who really know how to maintain order 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.090
 throughout the course because to see me 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.560
 I say come I'm going to do this year can 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.380
 be ordered because I have file cabinets 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.990
 no ma'am no when but I start well and 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.700
 it ended badly 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.600
 is that I know the story so 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.660
 notebooks 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.290
 and well of all colors it is worth 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.290
 is for 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.550
 maths 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:23.450
 history and geography 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.450
 biology english ib 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:34.060
 physics biology physical biology 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:39.540
 chemistry and chemistry in french 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.540
 the language and this and the abode 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.720
 so good and then for the typical 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.880
 the subjects of these that do not 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.610
 we need to write a lot of religion 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.260
 physical education or a workshop that 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.180
 have an elective or something because I've 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.480
 bought these little ones from some of 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.790
 these of paper bast this is the cardboard 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.160
 the cartonboard to which I refer that is 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.040
 very in the rough but as I'm not going to 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.780
 give a lot of use because they did not cost me either 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.080
 one euro 25 cents other stadiums and the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.080
 other 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:23.560
 in my agenda of war because I love them 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.560
 it attracts them in a lot of things 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.919
 three maps and then the 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.780
 what is the space for the day because I 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:37.099
 perfect, everything is over and I do not know 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.680
 the schedules also come 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.599
 inside they are super well me 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.080
 collected and basic because I'm going to 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.400
 sheathe do not know what I'll put a 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.370
 ok I want it to be from a topic to 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.069
 best of actresses steps because always 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.979
 I do the same and of singers and all that 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:05:00.710
 so I want to put something more original 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:04.289
 but ok I bought this too 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.420
 how good is like a lining folder 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:11.920
 bring 20 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:14.230
 20 cases and take the cheapest one I think 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.380
 it was 12 euros out there and well this 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.920
 is for the chips for 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.430
 I dont know 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:26.360
 for the notes this is very useful and the 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.150
 from last year that I have lost it more 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.430

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:36.470
 after volley of the ones I use are 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:38.180
 These are the ones that welcome me. 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.210
 always for the bolis I usually go to the 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.509
 my town's stationery 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.610
 with any bank or something but this time 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:50.060
 you do not buy eroski because they came in the 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.639
 package and there was an offer and good if 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.180
 these cost 3 euros all euros and 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:59.750
 medium and I use these because they are 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:04.169

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.510

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.170
 the ipex and I have taken these devices from the 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.170
 eroski brand 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.880
 when they have another brand 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:28.470
