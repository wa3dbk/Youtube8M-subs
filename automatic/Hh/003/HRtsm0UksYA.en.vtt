 heating should still be stronger 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.650
 on account of the approximation of the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.710
 cold front beyond the critical mass is 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.869

 where you have more heating 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.390
 intense even because the wind when it 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.250
 comes down the mountain range 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.780
 it goes down very warmed it causes 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.270

 cloudiness the displacement of the front 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.480
 cold the temperature should not rise so much 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.310
 Merry port that has been experiencing days 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.440

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.400
 the sensation of heat should no longer be so 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.810
