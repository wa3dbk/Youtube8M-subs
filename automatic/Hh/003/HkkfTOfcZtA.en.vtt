00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
with a serious problem the problem is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.270 
with a serious problem the problem is
from<00:01:18.900> here<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.650> those<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.009> home<00:01:20.040> were

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
from here for those of you at home were

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.770 
from here for those of you at home were
thinking<00:01:20.610> about<00:01:20.670> maybe<00:01:20.909> striking<00:01:21.479> him<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
thinking about maybe striking him in the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.870 
thinking about maybe striking him in the
face<00:01:22.020> if<00:01:22.619> he<00:01:22.799> tries<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> strike<00:01:23.369> me<00:01:23.430> here<00:01:23.790> he

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
face if he tries to strike me here he

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.719 
face if he tries to strike me here he
can't<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.600> easily<00:01:24.930> reach<00:01:25.320> his<00:01:25.530> face<00:01:25.770> so

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
can't but I can easily reach his face so

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.390 
can't but I can easily reach his face so
trying<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.330> strike<00:01:27.659> them<00:01:27.900> not<00:01:28.439> only<00:01:28.650> will<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
trying to strike them not only will it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.249 
trying to strike them not only will it
not<00:01:29.579> solve<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> problem<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> might

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
not solve the problem but it might

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.719 
not solve the problem but it might
actually<00:01:31.409> make<00:01:31.710> things<00:01:31.979> worse<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.460> if<00:01:32.610> he

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
actually make things worse because if he

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.609 
actually make things worse because if he
tries<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.180> hit<00:01:33.360> me<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.049> makes<00:01:34.229> me<00:01:34.409> mad

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.390 
top okay so when I was laying down
however<00:03:00.540> instead<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.470> me<00:03:01.739> grabbing<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.310> the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
however instead of me grabbing on the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.310 
however instead of me grabbing on the
joy<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.580> throwing<00:03:03.060> him<00:03:03.180> off<00:03:03.270> aimlessly<00:03:03.989> I

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
joy and throwing him off aimlessly I

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.860 
joy and throwing him off aimlessly I
chose<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.220> bring<00:03:05.340> my<00:03:05.459> arm<00:03:05.670> underneath<00:03:05.940> secure

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
chose to bring my arm underneath secure

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.380 
chose to bring my arm underneath secure
his<00:03:07.020> wrist<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:08.280> hand<00:03:08.520> secures<00:03:09.239> his

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
elbow and my foot over here traps on to

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.630 
elbow and my foot over here traps on to
his<00:03:14.730> foot<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:15.959> I'm<00:03:16.050> trapping<00:03:16.440> his<00:03:16.620> arm<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.250> his

their strength my positioning is what

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.150 
their strength my positioning is what
makes<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.780> technique<00:03:40.110> strong<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.920> with<00:03:41.070> the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
makes the technique strong so with the
