good first year for a head coach Sean

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.620 
good first year for a head coach Sean
Payton<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.759> would<00:01:38.910> say<00:01:39.090> they're<00:01:39.300> not<00:01:39.360> used<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
Payton I would say they're not used to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.420 
Payton I would say they're not used to
the<00:01:39.810> Saints<00:01:40.110> picking<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.740> spot<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.369> I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the Saints picking in this spot and I

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.650 
the Saints picking in this spot and I
think<00:01:41.610> Sean<00:01:41.790> Payton<00:01:42.060> wants<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> make<00:01:42.390> sure<00:01:42.420> he

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
think Sean Payton wants to make sure he

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.660 
think Sean Payton wants to make sure he
stays<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.320> spot<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> first<00:01:44.430> round

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
stays in this spot in the first round

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.490 
stays in this spot in the first round
and<00:01:44.759> doesn't<00:01:45.060> drop<00:01:45.210> next<00:01:45.509> year<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.290> pick

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.020 
and doesn't drop next year so this pick
very<00:01:46.740> important<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.340> do<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.550> they're

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030

Olson they had Eric Johnson to a
one-year<00:02:07.470> deal<00:02:07.650> I<00:02:07.800> think<00:02:08.010> you<00:02:08.100> look<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
one-year deal I think you look at the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.100 
one-year deal I think you look at the
tight<00:02:08.640> end<00:02:08.850> spot<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.390> also<00:02:09.570> look<00:02:09.899> at<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110

would be 4 to 13 points but they take a
guy<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:26.760> Ben<00:02:27.450> Grubb<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.989> had<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.260> your

already<00:02:33.959> is<00:02:34.110> because<00:02:34.200> he's<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> pure<00:02:34.739> guard<00:02:35.040> he

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
already is because he's a pure guard he

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.380 
already is because he's a pure guard he
doesn't<00:02:35.400> have<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.580> versatility<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.150> play

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
of productivity because the quarterback

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.840 
of productivity because the quarterback
situation<00:05:13.110> at<00:05:13.620> Tennessee<00:05:14.070> was<00:05:14.430> just<00:05:14.640> not<00:05:14.820> very

situation at Tennessee was just not very

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.500 
situation at Tennessee was just not very
good

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
good

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.210 
good

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
they got to the point where Erik Ainge

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.800 
they got to the point where Erik Ainge
was<00:05:17.430> in<00:05:17.580> there<00:05:17.760> solidly<00:05:18.210> at<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.360> quarterback

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
was in there solidly at the quarterback

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.130 
was in there solidly at the quarterback
spot

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
spot

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.110 
spot
Robert<00:05:19.680> Beach<00:05:19.830> should<00:05:19.950> be<00:05:20.040> merged<00:05:20.280> as<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.610> big<00:05:20.880> 5

Robert Beach should be merged as a big 5
player<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.840> certainly<00:05:22.140> a<00:05:22.169> prospect<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.710> lot<00:05:22.919> of

player and certainly a prospect a lot of

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.500 
player and certainly a prospect a lot of
teams<00:05:23.250> in<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.760> middle<00:05:23.970> of<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.090> first<00:05:24.240> round

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
teams in the middle of the first round

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.840 
teams in the middle of the first round
on<00:05:24.720> I've<00:05:25.110> had<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.410> Island<00:05:25.830> you<00:05:26.460> know<00:05:26.580> it<00:05:26.729> in

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
on I've had to Island you know it in

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.439 
on I've had to Island you know it in
this<00:05:26.940> division<00:05:27.330> I<00:05:27.780> think<00:05:28.260> that

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
this division I think that

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:30.909 
this division I think that
think<00:05:29.569> about<00:05:29.659> offensively<00:05:30.199> they're<00:05:30.710> going<00:05:30.860> to

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
think about offensively they're going to

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.499 
think about offensively they're going to
put<00:05:31.129> some<00:05:31.340> points<00:05:31.520> up<00:05:31.789> and<00:05:31.999> in<00:05:32.090> this<00:05:32.240> division

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
put some points up and in this division

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.869 
put some points up and in this division
if<00:05:32.960> we<00:05:33.139> scored<00:05:33.409> 28<00:05:33.710> points<00:05:33.800> you're<00:05:34.580> going<00:05:34.819> to

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:34.879 
if we scored 28 points you're going to

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.580 
if we scored 28 points you're going to
go<00:05:34.969> into<00:05:35.090> PT<00:05:35.330> to<00:05:35.479> the<00:05:35.569> division<00:05:36.020> and<00:05:36.349> in<00:05:36.469> many

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
go into PT to the division and in many

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.989 
go into PT to the division and in many
cases<00:05:36.889> so<00:05:37.249> I<00:05:37.279> think<00:05:37.550> that<00:05:37.669> you're<00:05:37.789> they're

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:37.999 
cases so I think that you're they're

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.420 
cases so I think that you're they're
saying<00:05:38.270> themselves<00:05:39.009> they<00:05:40.009> didn't<00:05:40.219> they<00:05:40.279> could

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
saying themselves they didn't they could

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.709 
saying themselves they didn't they could
go<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:40.580> lot<00:05:40.759> of<00:05:40.789> different<00:05:40.879> ways<00:05:41.240> here<00:05:41.449> but<00:05:41.599> this

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
go a lot of different ways here but this

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.299 
go a lot of different ways here but this
guarantees<00:05:42.289> them<00:05:42.499> they're<00:05:42.949> gonna<00:05:43.069> be<00:05:43.219> the

00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:43.309 
guarantees them they're gonna be the

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.249 
guarantees them they're gonna be the
more<00:05:43.430> of<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:43.639> more<00:05:43.759> dynamic<00:05:43.909> top<00:05:44.419> 5<00:05:44.719> offenses

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
more of the more dynamic top 5 offenses
