00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.689
 i 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.370
 yes 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.670
 to the girl as they are here in the country 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.920
 where I live and start feeling 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.539
 quite hot then in this video 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.520
 I wanted to give them some options that we 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.169
 allow to be a little cool I wanted to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.669
 give them a choice with all hair 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.500
 picked up in a chongo so that we 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.910
 let it be so super cool and like 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.470
 I know some of you also them 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.029
 like it more like that the more 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.619
 female with hair a little bit more 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.570
 loose I also wanted to give them a choice 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.489
 where we had the hair loose and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.230
 just a little touch out there special 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.850

 forget to subscribe so you do not get 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.780
 miss the following videos we are going to 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.400
 see these hairstyles as first step I 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.869
 I'm going to add a little protector of 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.850
 heat in my hair especially in the 

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:49.979
 part of the front because I want to create 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.960
 some gentle waves for him to mark my 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.790
 face and so create some texture for 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.650
 my hairstyle of course this step is 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.390
 completely optional I'm taking 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.369
 million only from the part of 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.449
 in front and I'm messing about 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.449
 dog back 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.610
 once chilled step hair 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.860
 gently my fingers to undo a 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.720
 little bit of the definition for the first 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.030
 hairstyle I will use an accessory like 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.670
 these is a headband that in the part 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.530
 from behind brings as a league the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.150
 we will place on the crown of this 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.740
 way and if you want we can win a 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.810
 little hair so that it stays 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.700
 as more relaxed the hairstyle once 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.860
 placed the headband we're just going to 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.660
 go taking strands and we will go 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.350
 entangling around the league of 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.350
 our headband 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.700
 surely this hairstyle already have 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.740
 seen several times but seriously that to 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.780
 I like it a lot because I feel that 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.830
 It gives a look so super relaxed and is very 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.830
 very easy to get 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.340
 once you've messed up all the 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.230
 hair around other stuff what 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.060
 we have to climb here 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.640
 there to give it that touch more 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.980
 relaxed to the hairstyle when in networks you 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.900
 hair if you have very short layers is 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.000
 very likely that these escape your 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.470
 headband and what I recommend is that 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.510
 Hold is this type of hair more 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.130
 shorts with the help of some pins 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.080
 so you do not walk around struggling 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.450
 of your day if you look here I tried 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.710
 leave some strands at the sides so that 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.390
 I gave it a little touch as well as more 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.310
 special but I 'm not sure that I 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.570
 I would have liked it so much because in the end 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.280
 I felt like I brought the chongo 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.960
 quinceanera and like I'm not sure 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.100
 that I like that effect like 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.690
 I said like I did not finish 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.760
 convince still this of the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.760
 milloncitos on the sides so I decided 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.350
 for entangling them also in my league if you 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.910
 you do not have a league of this type to the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.770
 hand do not worry because also 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.830
 You can get a very similar effect 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.230
 doing some little braids we are going to 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.480
 make some braids of 3 segments and 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.670
 basically what is happening is and 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.920
 the segment of each end towards the 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.590
 in the middle we will hold each of 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.450
 these braids with a little league and a 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.200
 Once our transit list is ready we will go 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.239
 pulling 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.989
 because we want again that is given as 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.989
 super chubby 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.280
 and we do the same thing on the other side of 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.500
 our head 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.510
 when we have ready both braids the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.340
 we are going to hold with a new league of 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.140
 preference that this league is thicker 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.390
 so that we will not burst 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.860
 throughout our day and basically it's the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.080
 same procedure of being entangled 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.740
 the strands of your hair around 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.740
 two braids 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:04.550
 and what we want to do is a first 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.560
 pigtail on one of the sides of our 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.360
 hair this way once ready the 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.220
 pigtail let's introduce our fingers 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.270
 this way because there we go to 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.270
 pass all the lock 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.150
 then we will take more hair from the 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.919
 section below and we will incorporate 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.720
 the previous lock and we will hold it 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.610
 in a new tagline of this three 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.410
 times and with that I thought it looked 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.060
 very nice but of course you 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.230
 you can choose as well as the number of 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.230
 collectives you want to do 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.000
 ah 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.220
 ah 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.569
 I hope you had liked it and for 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.220
 please, if that's the case, do not forget 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.080
 give me a like also in the 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.370
 comments please talk to me which one 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.110
 of these two options has been his 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.610
 favorite if the option with which there was 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.110
 picked up the option that there was a 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.969
 little bit more loose I remind you that 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.289
 We were new videos on Tuesdays and 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.939
