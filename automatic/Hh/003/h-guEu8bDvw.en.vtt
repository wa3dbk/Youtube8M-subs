so<00:02:05.090> compared<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:05.960> n97<00:02:06.380> for<00:02:06.800> example<00:02:07.220> you

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
so compared to the n97 for example you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.550 
so compared to the n97 for example you
have<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.520> youtube<00:02:08.000> there<00:02:08.330> which<00:02:08.780> opens<00:02:09.229> here
