welcome<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.380> final<00:00:01.709> part<00:00:01.829> of<00:00:01.949> my<00:00:02.010> tutorial

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
welcome to the final part of my tutorial

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.940 
welcome to the final part of my tutorial
on<00:00:02.580> how<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.120> solve<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.570> 4x4<00:00:04.259> or<00:00:04.529> which<00:00:04.650> avenge

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
on how to solve a 4x4 or which avenge

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.830 
on how to solve a 4x4 or which avenge
cube<00:00:06.379> at<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:07.620> point<00:00:08.179> you<00:00:09.179> are<00:00:09.210> going<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.809> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
cube at this point you are going to a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.770 
cube at this point you are going to a
car<00:00:10.110> with<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.349> parity<00:00:10.800> error<00:00:11.300> and<00:00:12.300> now<00:00:12.509> I'm

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
car with a parity error and now I'm

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.259 
car with a parity error and now I'm
going<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.200> show<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.620> my<00:00:14.370> last<00:00:14.549> step<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.880> didn't

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
going to show you my last step I didn't

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.019 
going to show you my last step I didn't
the<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.350> like<00:00:16.500> normal<00:00:16.770> 3x3<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.609> didn't<00:00:17.820> do<00:00:17.910> it

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the in like normal 3x3 you didn't do it

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.179 
the in like normal 3x3 you didn't do it
on<00:00:18.119> camera<00:00:18.420> because<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> think<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:20.160> should

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
on camera because I think you should

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.590 
on camera because I think you should
already<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.640> able<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.029> put<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.240> end<00:00:21.420> look

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
already be able to put the end look

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.189 
already be able to put the end look
normal<00:00:21.900> for<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.050> by<00:00:22.170> three<00:00:25.430> so<00:00:26.869> what<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.990> do

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
normal for you by three so what you do

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.749 
normal for you by three so what you do
is<00:00:29.269> you<00:00:30.269> use<00:00:30.300> these<00:00:30.689> two<00:00:31.109> long<00:00:31.710> algorithms<00:00:32.279> for

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
is you use these two long algorithms for

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.569 
is you use these two long algorithms for
these<00:00:32.910> two<00:00:33.120> priority<00:00:33.540> cases<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.309> here<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
these two priority cases and here is the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.450 
these two priority cases and here is the
first<00:00:35.790> priority<00:00:36.120> case<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.630> will<00:00:36.750> occur<00:00:37.460> so

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
first priority case that will occur so

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.700 
first priority case that will occur so
this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> algorithm<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.870> use<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.469> fix

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
this is the algorithm you use to fix

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.729 
this is the algorithm you use to fix
this<00:00:40.860> priority<00:00:41.250> case<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.899> algorithm<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
this priority case the algorithm is to

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:57.830 
this priority case the algorithm is to

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.499 

all<00:01:45.950> right<00:01:46.040> here<00:01:46.280> is<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.820> second<00:01:47.240> priority

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
all right here is the second priority

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.010 
all right here is the second priority
case<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:48.110> is<00:01:48.350> most<00:01:48.680> likely<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.890> occur<00:01:50.020> it's

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
case that is most likely to occur it's

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.499 
case that is most likely to occur it's
when<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:52.009> rest<00:01:52.189> of<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.340> cube<00:01:52.580> is<00:01:52.700> solved<00:01:53.149> just

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
when the rest of the cube is solved just

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.590 
when the rest of the cube is solved just
these<00:01:53.720> two<00:01:54.490> edges<00:01:55.490> here<00:01:55.759> need<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.270> be<00:01:56.360> flipped

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
these two edges here need to be flipped

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.960 
these two edges here need to be flipped
now<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.619> algorithm<00:01:58.009> for<00:01:58.340> this<00:01:58.520> one<00:01:58.759> is<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:01.759> our

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
now the algorithm for this one is to our

now the algorithm for this one is to our

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
to fill it in like normal after that

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.510 
to fill it in like normal after that
some<00:03:02.650> students<00:03:02.920> want<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.160> fill<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:03.490> with

some students want to fill it in with
normal

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
all right again like normal just fill it

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:37.870 
all right again like normal just fill it
in<00:03:30.110> like<00:03:30.320> a<00:03:30.880> 3x3<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:37.400> will<00:03:37.580> solve<00:03:37.760> your

in like a 3x3 and that will solve your

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.110 
in like a 3x3 and that will solve your
parity<00:03:38.330> cases<00:03:38.890> now<00:03:39.890> I've<00:03:40.070> covered<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.640> parity

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
parity cases now I've covered to parity

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.840 
parity cases now I've covered to parity
cases<00:03:41.480> there<00:03:41.660> dan<00:03:42.140> Brown<00:03:42.470> is<00:03:43.190> using<00:03:43.460> his<00:03:43.640> Pole

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
cases there dan Brown is using his Pole

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.760 
cases there dan Brown is using his Pole
go<00:03:43.970> back<00:03:44.150> he<00:03:44.720> will<00:03:44.840> cover<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.350> remaining

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
go back he will cover the remaining

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.790 
go back he will cover the remaining
parity<00:03:46.400> cases<00:03:46.990> becomes<00:03:47.990> easy<00:03:48.170> only<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.620> got<00:03:48.770> a

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
parity cases becomes easy only to got a

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.740 
parity cases becomes easy only to got a
car<00:03:49.100> with<00:03:49.250> me<00:03:49.420> so<00:03:50.420> I<00:03:50.450> hope<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:51.020> helped<00:03:51.320> you<00:03:51.500> in
