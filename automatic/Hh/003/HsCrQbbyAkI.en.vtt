00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
what about halfway in should be good for

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.370 
what about halfway in should be good for
starting<00:00:28.680> promotores<00:00:29.640> halfway<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.570> give

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
starting promotores halfway in I give

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.000 
starting promotores halfway in I give
the<00:00:31.529> fuel<00:00:31.800> ball<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.510> few<00:00:33.510> good<00:00:34.010> squeezes

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the fuel ball a few good squeezes

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.510 
the fuel ball a few good squeezes
probably<00:00:35.730> about<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.270> don't<00:00:36.899> know<00:00:37.219> four<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.340> five

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
probably about I don't know four to five

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.910 
probably about I don't know four to five
you'll<00:00:39.059> feel<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.480> gets<00:00:39.660> real<00:00:39.840> hard<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
you'll feel it gets real hard in the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.410 
you'll feel it gets real hard in the
throttle<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.610> know<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> black

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
throttle you know this is the black

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.240 
throttle you know this is the black
button<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> bottom<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.530> when<00:00:44.160> you

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
button on the bottom here when you

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.959 
button on the bottom here when you
depress<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.789> button<00:00:46.190> it<00:00:47.190> releases<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
depress the button it releases the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.049 
depress the button it releases the
throttle<00:00:48.860> which<00:00:49.860> means<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.489> won't<00:00:50.640> go<00:00:50.879> into

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
throttle which means it won't go into

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.040 
throttle which means it won't go into
forward<00:00:51.600> or<00:00:51.780> reverse<00:00:52.050> it'll<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:53.899> pump<00:00:54.899> up

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
forward or reverse it'll just pump up

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.799 
forward or reverse it'll just pump up
the<00:00:55.230> RPMs<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.610> go<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.059> start<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.629> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the RPMs so when you go to start it I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.779 
the RPMs so when you go to start it I
usually<00:00:58.500> put<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> little<00:00:58.980> bit<00:00:59.129> forward

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
usually put a little bit forward

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.270 
usually put a little bit forward
they<00:01:00.510> take<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> key<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.530> as<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.010> turn<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
they take the key and as you turn the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.840 
they take the key and as you turn the
key

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
key

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.399 
key
if<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.030> push<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:05.060> turn<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:07.200> for

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
if you push in and turn it that's for

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.490 
if you push in and turn it that's for
choking<00:01:07.650> Memphis<00:01:08.510> now

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
choking Memphis now

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.060 
choking Memphis now
with<00:01:12.370> the<00:01:12.520> throttle<00:01:13.350> power<00:01:14.350> for<00:01:14.770> where<00:01:14.950> you

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
with the throttle power for where you

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.550 
with the throttle power for where you
put<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.460> forward<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.960> bumps<00:01:17.260> up<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.410> RPM

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
put it forward it bumps up the RPM

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.680 
put it forward it bumps up the RPM
that's<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:21.030> keep<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.330> forward<00:01:21.540> a

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
that's what I do just keep it forward a

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:31.410 
that's what I do just keep it forward a
little<00:01:21.840> bit<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.580> warm<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:24.950> per<00:01:25.950> minute<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.400> so

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.260 

when<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.020> put<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.290> back<00:01:32.320> in<00:01:32.440> a<00:01:32.620> neutral<00:01:33.270> button

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
when I put it back in a neutral button

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.750 
when I put it back in a neutral button
pops<00:01:34.600> out<00:01:34.950> you're<00:01:35.950> back<00:01:36.160> in<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.400> normal

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
pops out you're back in the normal

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.180 
pops out you're back in the normal
operating<00:01:37.180> position<00:01:37.420> for<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.560> know<00:01:38.650> forward

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
operating position for you know forward

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.430 
operating position for you know forward
being<00:01:39.550> forward<00:01:40.090> reversing<00:01:40.690> for<00:01:40.900> for<00:01:41.200> back

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
being forward reversing for for back

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.980 
being forward reversing for for back
being<00:01:41.740> reversed<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:43.390> you're<00:01:43.540> good<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.810> go

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
being reversed and you're good to go

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.160 
being reversed and you're good to go

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
with the power tilt button all the way

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.050 
with the power tilt button all the way
in<00:01:56.979> completely<00:01:57.430> down<00:01:57.760> and<00:01:58.120> you're<00:01:58.360> good<00:01:58.510> to<00:01:58.630> go
