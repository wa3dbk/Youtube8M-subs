really<00:01:16.320> ugly<00:01:16.439> joints<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.070> makes<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
really ugly joints and it makes them a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.789 
really ugly joints and it makes them a
little<00:01:17.580> less<00:01:17.700> stable<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> got<00:01:18.390> rid<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.659> that

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.490 
little less stable so I got rid of that
but<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.020> motifs<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.140> probably<00:01:22.380> my

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
but this is the motifs is probably my

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.200 
but this is the motifs is probably my
15th<00:01:22.890> Hulk<00:01:23.130> figure<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.640> don't<00:01:23.880> know<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:23.970> made<00:01:24.180> a

15th Hulk figure I don't know I made a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
15th Hulk figure I don't know I made a
lot<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.479> Hulk's<00:01:24.840> which<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.950> funny<00:01:26.189> because

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
lot of Hulk's which is funny because

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.980 
lot of Hulk's which is funny because
people<00:01:26.790> always<00:01:26.909> tease<00:01:27.240> me<00:01:27.270> about<00:01:27.570> making<00:01:27.869> too

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
people always tease me about making too

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.789

many<00:01:28.110> Deadpool's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
many Deadpool's

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.440 
many Deadpool's
but<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> made<00:01:29.340> more<00:01:29.490> Hulk's<00:01:29.790> than<00:01:29.970> Deadpool's<00:01:30.329> I

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
but I made more Hulk's than Deadpool's I

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.080 
but I made more Hulk's than Deadpool's I
think<00:01:30.780> anyway<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.130> green<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.820> couple

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
think anyway for the green it's a couple

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.640 
think anyway for the green it's a couple
different<00:01:33.360> shades<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.750> green<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.229> top<00:01:34.500> of

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
different shades of green on top of

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.710 
different shades of green on top of
black<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.220> all<00:01:35.400> dry<00:01:35.579> brushing<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.329> give<00:01:36.630> it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
black it was all dry brushing to give it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.170 
black it was all dry brushing to give it
a<00:01:36.810> real<00:01:37.049> nice<00:01:37.229> texture<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.939> this

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
a real nice texture I really like this

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.039

color<00:01:39.390> green<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.960> might<00:01:40.320> use<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> again<00:01:41.930> it's<00:01:42.930> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
color green I might use it again it's a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
color green I might use it again it's a
little<00:01:43.290> bit<00:01:43.409> darker<00:01:43.860> than<00:01:44.100> your<00:01:44.250> average<00:01:44.430> Hulk
