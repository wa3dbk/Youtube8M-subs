not an electronics company so they

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.820

case they change their vendor and it's a

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.720 
case they change their vendor and it's a
much<00:02:50.110> nicer<00:02:50.350> much<00:02:50.860> different<00:02:51.280> keyboard<00:02:51.610> than

can actually pull the keyboard out I
tried<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.709> wouldn't<00:02:56.950> recommend<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.370> because

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
tried it I wouldn't recommend it because

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.380 
tried it I wouldn't recommend it because
actually<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.420> keys<00:02:58.690> are<00:02:59.340> just<00:03:00.340> soft<00:03:01.090> enough

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
it creates a nice stand now with that we

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.949 
it creates a nice stand now with that we
run<00:03:41.470> into<00:03:41.650> our<00:03:41.890> first<00:03:42.130> problem<00:03:42.370> with<00:03:42.700> this

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
run into our first problem with this

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.170 
run into our first problem with this
that<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:45.250> flap<00:03:45.489> keeps<00:03:45.790> getting<00:03:46.090> in<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
that is this flap keeps getting in the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.240 
that is this flap keeps getting in the
way<00:03:46.269> so<00:03:46.390> you've<00:03:46.750> got<00:03:46.780> at<00:03:47.170> gotta<00:03:47.530> actually<00:03:47.769> take

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
way so you've got at gotta actually take

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.400 
way so you've got at gotta actually take
it<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.579> find<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.150> way<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.359> get<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.109> out<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.260> the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
it and find a way to get it out of the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.930 
it and find a way to get it out of the
way<00:03:50.530> like<00:03:50.739> that<00:03:51.130> you<00:03:51.310> have<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.519> tuck<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.820> in

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
way like that you have to tuck it in

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.229 
way like that you have to tuck it in
we're<00:03:52.480> not<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.980> problem<00:03:53.980> real<00:03:54.160> problem<00:03:54.579> but<00:03:54.730> not

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
we're not a problem real problem but not

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.270 
we're not a problem real problem but not
I'm<00:03:55.630> not<00:03:55.690> ideal<00:03:56.260> not<00:03:56.620> by<00:03:56.769> any<00:03:56.950> stretch<00:03:57.100> of<00:03:57.190> the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
I'm not ideal not by any stretch of the

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.759 
I'm not ideal not by any stretch of the
imagination<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:58.480> let's<00:03:59.049> angle<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.530> screen

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
imagination so let's angle the screen

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.699 
imagination so let's angle the screen
down<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.100> we<00:04:00.160> can<00:04:00.250> actually<00:04:00.370> see<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:01.470> will<00:04:02.470> turn

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
down so we can actually see it will turn

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.410 
down so we can actually see it will turn
on<00:04:02.859> this<00:04:03.359> will<00:04:04.359> go<00:04:04.480> over<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:04.750> settings<00:04:06.239> will<00:04:07.239> go

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
on this will go over to settings will go

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.660

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
comes so what I'm already finding is the

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.659 
comes so what I'm already finding is the
keyboard<00:04:57.880> is<00:04:58.000> actually<00:04:58.300> better<00:04:58.510> than<00:04:59.669> what

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
keyboard is actually better than what

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.850 
keyboard is actually better than what
came<00:05:01.030> with<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.479> last<00:05:01.720> generation<00:05:02.229> which<00:05:02.560> was

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
came with the last generation which was

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.140 
came with the last generation which was
basically<00:05:03.340> just<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:03.970> sheet<00:05:04.750> of<00:05:04.930> rubber<00:05:05.650> and

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
basically just a sheet of rubber and

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.900 
basically just a sheet of rubber and
these<00:05:07.150> are<00:05:07.300> individual<00:05:07.840> keys<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:09.310> that's

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
these are individual keys and that's

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.969 
these are individual keys and that's
really<00:05:10.030> nice<00:05:10.360> what<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.720> will<00:05:10.960> note<00:05:11.260> is<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.770> fact

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
really nice what I will note is the fact

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.600 
really nice what I will note is the fact
that<00:05:13.229> when<00:05:14.229> I<00:05:14.260> was<00:05:14.470> pulling<00:05:14.680> it<00:05:14.889> out<00:05:14.979> and<00:05:15.280> one

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
that when I was pulling it out and one

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.990 
that when I was pulling it out and one
of<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.760> keys<00:05:15.940> got<00:05:16.120> snagged<00:05:16.419> just<00:05:16.720> a<00:05:16.960> tiny<00:05:17.620> bit

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
of the keys got snagged just a tiny bit

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.520 
of the keys got snagged just a tiny bit
the<00:05:19.000> key<00:05:19.210> already<00:05:19.450> now<00:05:19.840> it's<00:05:20.020> at<00:05:20.140> an<00:05:20.260> angle

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
the key already now it's at an angle

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.230 
the key already now it's at an angle
already<00:05:20.650> now<00:05:20.979> it<00:05:21.190> still<00:05:21.460> works<00:05:21.669> however<00:05:21.940> you

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
already now it still works however you

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.670 
already now it still works however you
can<00:05:22.360> see<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.810> it's<00:05:23.140> going<00:05:23.380> on<00:05:23.470> and<00:05:23.620> off

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.070 
can see that the it's going on and off
that's<00:05:23.919> fine<00:05:24.160> but<00:05:24.669> I<00:05:24.729> really<00:05:24.850> it's<00:05:25.780> not<00:05:26.050> a

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
that's fine but I really it's not a

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.620
