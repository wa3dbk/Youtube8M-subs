00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.530
 so we have a diesel locomotive 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.360
 397 that just arrived with 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.880
 overhaul with locomotive risk 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.310
 repair depot and tinkling locomotive 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.730
 repair factory native depo new 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.750
 chara 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.919
 auction what to say fresh locomotive 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.270
 just something kapitalki not driving 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.800
 painted in corporate colors 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.760
 beautiful or not so 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.980
 everyone has an opinion I like 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.200
 in any case, for the fact that he even 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:51.220
 clean it nice to see them then on 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:52.600
 than we often have to ride on 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.360
 because I think everyone will like 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:12.759
 until he not calculations made will begin 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:15.759
 I do not know the dirty plate 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.719
 you can have no engines for 89 years 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.719
 built locomotive 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.750
 three-piece like all freight 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.390
 locomotives that are operated by our 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.070
 d then due to heavy profiles 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.690
 There are no protracted 18 thousandths 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.550
 effectively use two-piece 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:48.190
 diesel locomotive freight movement they work 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:51.240
 with the fat skih hunt works in general 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:59.290
 the owner and his tires 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:03.120
 let's look inside now so we 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.580
 we are inside the locomotive 1397 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.220
 310m just above Ussuri 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.690
 apartments repair plant recall more 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.730
 time 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.020
 we are here so let's say small 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.710
 mess with that 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.480
 and mounted were bunks for medium for 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.330
 following the locomotive crew is 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.060
 accompanied by a heat from the factory chair 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.890
 not yet mounted but the essence is to 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.660
 show just the look of a diesel locomotive 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:42.610
 who just went through capital 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:45.130
 repair diesel room should be noted 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.260
 what of all locomotives which 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.410
 operated with diesel engines 10 and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.770
 becomes t-10 that is like t-10m 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.560
 and y and t-10m if the instructions 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.130
 respectively up to 49 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.680
 Ussuri locomotive repair plant 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.070
 carries out repairs with the greatest 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.050
 quality that is in other words better 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:10.390
 there are no cars yet with a major overhaul 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.690
 good luck diesel generator set 10 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.690
 up to 100 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.500
 angular reducer supercharger second 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.720
 stage traction generator and 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.420
 Respectively diesel 10 sheets on 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.400
 currently they were in three diesel locomotives 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:35.390
 get with at risk one locomotive 310m to 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.310
 13 t-10 y to 0 170 they respectively 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.080
 redone sick and diesel d49 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.320
 well, I donâ€™t know the money 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.320
 enough was installed 10ft 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:05.650
 here is a washstand and sign 1 doll here 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:05.650
 live water oil heat exchanger 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.980
 instrumentation 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:19.060
 turbocharger 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:20.900
 ordinary locomotive 3000 topics just clean 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.120
 refrigerator shaft 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:29.270
 hydraulic clutch shaft which is often 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.710
 comes off and can cripple the one who 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.710
 this moment will pass by 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.290
 from the middle section that is the remote 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.480
 intended for maneuvers only 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.190
 one of this section and devices 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.900
 showing parameters accordingly 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.340
 but that's just the middle section 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:53.419
 but otherwise everything is the same 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.820
 because it was shown on the main sections 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.060
 well, except that there are compresses there 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:05.290
 he was not visible was talking to torino 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.290
 low voltage camera plowing naturally 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.110
 let's see how this car will be 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.110
 show themselves in service
