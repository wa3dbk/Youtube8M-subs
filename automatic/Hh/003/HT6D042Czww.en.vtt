00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.240 
had me puzzled because it's a common
issue<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:13.170> done<00:00:13.440> several<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.160> them

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
issue and I have done several of them

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.980 
issue and I have done several of them
now<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.670> one<00:00:14.849> came<00:00:15.089> right<00:00:15.299> back<00:00:15.480> again<00:00:15.809> with

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
now this one came right back again with

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.660 
now this one came right back again with
the<00:00:16.170> exact<00:00:16.650> same<00:00:16.830> problem<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.220> thought<00:00:17.400> okay

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the exact same problem I thought okay

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.330 
the exact same problem I thought okay
maybe<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.060> missed<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.230> place<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.770> gasket<00:00:20.220> or

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
maybe I missed a place to gasket or

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.120 
maybe I missed a place to gasket or
something<00:00:21.080> maybe<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.260> was<00:00:22.380> pinched<00:00:22.980> in

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
something maybe it was pinched in

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.250 
something maybe it was pinched in
between<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.730> pump<00:00:24.119> drive<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> block<00:00:24.960> or

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
between the pump drive in the block or

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.070 
between the pump drive in the block or
something<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.269> tore<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.930> all

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
something like that so I tore it all

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.509 
something like that so I tore it all
apart<00:00:28.109> like<00:00:28.500> quick<00:00:28.740> didn't<00:00:29.070> take<00:00:29.160> long<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
apart like quick didn't take long it

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.040 
apart like quick didn't take long it
only<00:00:29.640> took<00:00:29.820> me<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.179> half<00:00:30.420> hour<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
only took me like a half hour to get to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.860 
only took me like a half hour to get to
this<00:00:31.140> point<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.180> got<00:00:33.180> everything<00:00:33.600> apart

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
this point and got everything apart

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.889 
this point and got everything apart
again<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.170> went<00:00:34.410> ahead<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.649> marked<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
again I went ahead and marked the

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.000 
again I went ahead and marked the
camshaft<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> belt<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.920> well<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
camshaft and the belt as well as the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.040 
camshaft and the belt as well as the
crank<00:00:41.010> sprocket<00:00:41.520> down<00:00:41.700> there<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.809> belt

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
crank sprocket down there and the belt

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.260 
crank sprocket down there and the belt
so<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.430> throw<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.850> right<00:00:44.940> back

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
so I can just throw it right back

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.380 
so I can just throw it right back
together<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> whole

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
together and not have to do the whole

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.639 
together and not have to do the whole
cylinder<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.570> atop<00:00:48.870> dead<00:00:49.110> center<00:00:49.440> thing

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
cylinder one atop dead center thing

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.910 
cylinder one atop dead center thing
again<00:00:50.090> just<00:00:51.090> makes<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.480> easier<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.530> here's

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
again just makes it easier but here's

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.630 
again just makes it easier but here's
what<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> found

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
what I found

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.270 
what I found
I<00:00:53.820> removed<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.840> oil<00:00:55.110> pump<00:00:55.559> drive<00:00:55.890> again

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
I removed the oil pump drive again

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.910 
I removed the oil pump drive again
there's<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.600> seal<00:00:58.140> still<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.739> good<00:00:58.859> shape

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
there's the seal still in good shape

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979 
there's the seal still in good shape
it's<00:00:59.820> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.149> replaced<00:01:00.270> anyway<00:01:00.840> though

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it's going to get replaced anyway though

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.619 
it's going to get replaced anyway though
because<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.530> RTV<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.070> there<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.600> I

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
because of that RTV on there but what I

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.080 
because of that RTV on there but what I
noticed<00:01:04.049> was<00:01:04.229> when<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.530> took<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.220> oil<00:01:05.880> pump

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
noticed was when I took the oil pump

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.890 
noticed was when I took the oil pump
drive<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.320> oil<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.830> actually<00:01:08.010> leaking

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
drive out the oil was actually leaking

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.510 
drive out the oil was actually leaking
from<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.140> shaft<00:01:10.409> housing<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.310> leaking

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
from the shaft housing it was leaking

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.490 
from the shaft housing it was leaking
from<00:01:11.640> behind<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> pulley<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.439> I

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
from behind the pulley there so I

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.810 
from behind the pulley there so I
thought<00:01:13.770> son<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.369> gun

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
thought son of a gun

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.109 
thought son of a gun
I<00:01:14.850> had<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> part<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.380> was<00:01:16.860> stupid<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.610> didn't

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
I had the part and I was stupid I didn't

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.510 
I had the part and I was stupid I didn't
replace<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.810> had<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.170> out<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.310> had

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
replace it I had this out and I had

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.429 
replace it I had this out and I had
everything<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.330> where<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> needed<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
everything right where I needed it and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.190 
everything right where I needed it and
all<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.250> spring<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> little<00:01:24.509> damaged<00:01:24.930> there

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
all the spring is a little damaged there

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.700 
all the spring is a little damaged there
but<00:01:26.159> literally<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.659> prying<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.380> seal

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
but literally when I was prying the seal

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.450 
but literally when I was prying the seal
out<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:30.020> seal<00:01:31.020> part<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.920> started

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
out the seal part here just started

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.080 
out the seal part here just started
breaking<00:01:33.000> into<00:01:33.090> pieces<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:34.350> see<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.770> can

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
breaking into pieces they see if I can

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.690 
breaking into pieces they see if I can
show<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.150> what<00:01:36.420> I'm<00:01:36.509> talking<00:01:36.900> about<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.380> I

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
show you what I'm talking about here I

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
show you what I'm talking about here I
was<00:01:38.700> twisting<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
was twisting it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.990 
was twisting it
and<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.800> literally<00:01:42.100> just<00:01:42.250> started<00:01:42.760> breaking

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
and it literally just started breaking

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.740 
and it literally just started breaking
it<00:01:43.570> should<00:01:43.810> flex<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.640> it's<00:01:45.790> breaking<00:01:46.060> as<00:01:46.510> you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
it should flex but it's breaking as you

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.250 
it should flex but it's breaking as you
can<00:01:46.930> see<00:01:47.140> there<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:47.860> cracks<00:01:48.400> brittle<00:01:49.260> exact

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
can see there is cracks brittle exact

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.550 
can see there is cracks brittle exact
same<00:01:50.740> thing<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.600> happened<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.900> pump

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
same thing that happened to the pump

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.700 
same thing that happened to the pump
drive<00:01:53.830> housing<00:01:54.370> seal<00:01:54.790> there<00:01:55.290> happened<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.500> the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
drive housing seal there happened to the

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.430 
drive housing seal there happened to the
drive<00:01:57.130> seal<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.729> stupid<00:02:00.729> mistake<00:02:01.210> if<00:02:01.690> you're
