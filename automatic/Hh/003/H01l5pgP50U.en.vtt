always do create a mode with your mobs

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.350 
always do create a mode with your mobs
so<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.100> go<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> more<00:01:11.549> options<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.210> there

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
so you can go to more options and there

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.390 
so you can go to more options and there
are<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> bunch<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:13.080> things<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:14.010> so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
are a bunch of things that you can do so

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.090 
are a bunch of things that you can do so
player<00:01:14.820> versus<00:01:15.180> player<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:16.979> see

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
player versus player is as you can see

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.340 
player versus player is as you can see
from<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> bottom<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:18.030> enabled<00:01:18.479> players<00:01:18.720> can

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
from the bottom one enabled players can

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.859 
from the bottom one enabled players can
inflict<00:01:19.799> damage<00:01:20.070> own<00:01:20.520> only<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.330> other<00:01:21.479> players

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
inflict damage own only on other players

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.830 
inflict damage own only on other players
so<00:01:22.200> basically<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.640> kill<00:01:23.850> each<00:01:23.880> other<00:01:24.330> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so basically you can kill each other and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
so basically you can kill each other and
if<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.409> take<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.710> off<00:01:25.860> they<00:01:26.100> can't<00:01:26.340> kill

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
if you take this off they can't kill

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.640 
if you take this off they can't kill
each<00:01:26.700> other<00:01:26.909> trust<00:01:27.630> players<00:01:27.990> now<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.500> is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
each other trust players now this is

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.160 
each other trust players now this is
like<00:01:28.829> almost<00:01:29.159> an<00:01:29.340> anti<00:01:29.820> grief<00:01:30.240> kind<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.900> thing

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
like almost an anti grief kind of thing

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.109

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
so the next thing is host privileges

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.040 
so the next thing is host privileges
this<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.520> just<00:02:26.700> truly<00:02:27.120> amazing<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.990> is

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
basically where only the host can be

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.780 
basically where only the host can be
invisible<00:02:31.800> he<00:02:32.760> can<00:02:33.000> fly<00:02:33.480> he<00:02:34.110> cannot<00:02:34.560> die<00:02:34.950> he

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
invisible he can fly he cannot die he

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.480 
invisible he can fly he cannot die he
has<00:02:36.000> everything<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.290> really<00:02:37.620> cool<00:02:38.100> and

playing<00:02:41.850> Hunger<00:02:42.270> Games<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.260> kind<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.310> think

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
playing Hunger Games so I kind of think

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.820 
playing Hunger Games so I kind of think
that<00:02:44.610> they<00:02:44.819> made<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.480> thing<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.440> for<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
that they made this thing just for the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.650 
that they made this thing just for the
Hunger<00:02:47.190> Games<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.270> can<00:02:48.390> kind<00:02:48.600> of

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
Hunger Games so that you can kind of

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.600 
Hunger Games so that you can kind of
like<00:02:48.840> go<00:02:49.110> fly<00:02:49.560> around<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.070> check<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.430> people

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
like go fly around and check on people

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.340 
like go fly around and check on people
and<00:02:50.880> see<00:02:51.060> how<00:02:51.180> they're<00:02:51.360> doing<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:51.810> anyway<00:02:52.290> so

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
and see how they're doing but anyway so

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.699 
and see how they're doing but anyway so
this<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.680> really<00:02:53.100> cool<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.200> different
