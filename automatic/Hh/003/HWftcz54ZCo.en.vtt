texture<00:00:22.060> pack<00:00:22.240> we<00:00:22.390> are<00:00:22.480> going<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.750> be<00:00:22.840> seeing

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
texture pack we are going to be seeing

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.900 
texture pack we are going to be seeing
or<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.230> first<00:00:23.410> one<00:00:23.680> will<00:00:24.250> be<00:00:24.279> the<00:00:24.610> plastic

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
or the first one will be the plastic

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.849 
or the first one will be the plastic
texture<00:00:25.510> pack<00:00:25.689> and<00:00:25.929> the<00:00:26.230> second<00:00:26.590> one<00:00:26.679> will<00:00:26.830> be

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
texture pack and the second one will be

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.220 
texture pack and the second one will be
a<00:00:26.980> natural<00:00:27.490> texture<00:00:28.150> pack<00:00:28.330> and<00:00:28.539> we<00:00:29.019> will<00:00:29.140> be

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
a natural texture pack and we will be

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.570 
a natural texture pack and we will be
seeing<00:00:29.470> the<00:00:29.590> first<00:00:29.800> one<00:00:29.980> next<00:00:30.250> week<00:00:30.400> so

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
seeing the first one next week so

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.700 
seeing the first one next week so
essentially<00:00:31.119> i<00:00:31.150> interpret<00:00:31.689> this<00:00:31.839> as<00:00:31.990> the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
essentially i interpret this as the

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.470 
essentially i interpret this as the
plastic<00:00:33.160> texture<00:00:33.489> pack<00:00:33.699> is<00:00:33.940> going<00:00:34.210> to<00:00:34.360> be

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
plastic texture pack is going to be

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.560 
plastic texture pack is going to be
something<00:00:34.750> i<00:00:34.989> picture<00:00:35.440> as<00:00:35.559> kind<00:00:35.830> of<00:00:35.920> cartoony

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
something i picture as kind of cartoony

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.880 
something i picture as kind of cartoony
have<00:00:37.570> a<00:00:37.600> plastic<00:00:37.870> look<00:00:38.230> obviously<00:00:38.620> because

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
have a plastic look obviously because

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.650 
have a plastic look obviously because
how<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.040> plastic<00:00:39.489> texture<00:00:39.760> pack<00:00:39.970> and<00:00:40.180> i'm

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
how the plastic texture pack and i'm

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.270 
how the plastic texture pack and i'm
thinking<00:00:41.019> that<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.260> natural<00:00:41.710> texture<00:00:42.070> pack

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
thinking that the natural texture pack

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.970 
thinking that the natural texture pack
is<00:00:42.489> going<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:42.879> be<00:00:43.000> kind<00:00:43.329> of<00:00:43.570> obviously<00:00:44.530> nature

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
is going to be kind of obviously nature

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.709 
is going to be kind of obviously nature
oriented<00:00:45.550> make<00:00:45.700> trees<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.360> make<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.570> outside

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
oriented make trees and make the outside

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.080 
oriented make trees and make the outside
look<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.260> lot<00:00:47.379> more<00:00:47.530> realistic<00:00:47.949> than<00:00:48.340> it<00:00:48.850> does

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
look a lot more realistic than it does

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.029 
look a lot more realistic than it does
and<00:00:49.390> maybe<00:00:49.539> focus<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:50.140> little<00:00:50.320> bit<00:00:50.469> less<00:00:50.739> on

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
and maybe focus a little bit less on

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.910 
and maybe focus a little bit less on
building<00:00:51.640> blocks<00:00:51.879> and<00:00:52.149> more<00:00:52.329> on<00:00:52.510> nature<00:00:52.920> hence

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
building blocks and more on nature hence

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.770 
building blocks and more on nature hence
how<00:00:54.100> natural<00:00:54.670> texture<00:00:55.000> pack<00:00:55.149> i<00:00:55.180> guess<00:00:55.449> i<00:00:55.600> don't

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
how natural texture pack i guess i don't

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.360 
how natural texture pack i guess i don't
know<00:00:55.840> that's<00:00:55.930> how<00:00:56.140> it<00:00:56.199> resonates<00:00:56.559> with<00:00:56.680> me<00:00:56.710> you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
know that's how it resonates with me you

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.500 
know that's how it resonates with me you
guys<00:00:57.550> might<00:00:57.730> think<00:00:57.910> something<00:00:58.120> different<00:00:58.210> but

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
guys might think something different but

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.880 
guys might think something different but
i<00:00:58.570> guess<00:00:58.750> we'll<00:00:58.960> know<00:00:59.109> for<00:00:59.260> sure<00:00:59.320> when<00:00:59.739> it

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
i guess we'll know for sure when it

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.130 
i guess we'll know for sure when it
comes<00:01:00.070> out<00:01:00.250> now<00:01:01.239> it's<00:01:01.539> said<00:01:01.750> that<00:01:01.780> we<00:01:01.960> will<00:01:02.050> be

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
comes out now it's said that we will be

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.049 
comes out now it's said that we will be
seeing<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.500> first<00:01:02.710> one<00:01:02.859> next<00:01:03.190> week<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.609> i

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
seeing the first one next week and i

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.310 
seeing the first one next week and i
would<00:01:04.210> assume<00:01:04.300> that<00:01:04.690> if<00:01:04.780> they're<00:01:04.899> showing<00:01:05.199> it

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
would assume that if they're showing it

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.109 
would assume that if they're showing it
to<00:01:05.440> us<00:01:05.470> next<00:01:05.890> week<00:01:06.039> we<00:01:06.190> will<00:01:06.220> be<00:01:06.340> seeing<00:01:06.789> it<00:01:07.000> at

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
to us next week we will be seeing it at

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.840 
to us next week we will be seeing it at
the<00:01:07.539> very<00:01:07.570> latest<00:01:08.020> two<00:01:08.440> weeks<00:01:08.649> from<00:01:08.770> now<00:01:08.979> or

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
the very latest two weeks from now or

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.490 
the very latest two weeks from now or
one<00:01:10.060> week<00:01:10.270> after<00:01:10.420> they<00:01:10.660> show<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.110> us<00:01:11.259> so<00:01:11.470> we

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
one week after they show it to us so we

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.200 
one week after they show it to us so we
can<00:01:11.830> expect<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.310> see<00:01:12.580> those<00:01:12.759> here<00:01:12.970> pretty

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
can expect to see those here pretty

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.450 
can expect to see those here pretty
quick<00:01:13.509> now<00:01:13.750> in<00:01:14.439> an<00:01:14.560> article<00:01:14.950> that<00:01:15.070> they<00:01:15.220> wrote

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
quick now in an article that they wrote

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.580 
quick now in an article that they wrote
they<00:01:15.640> actually<00:01:16.180> said<00:01:16.509> that<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:17.290> texture

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
they actually said that the texture

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.070 
they actually said that the texture
packs<00:01:17.890> are<00:01:18.100> going<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.670> cost<00:01:18.880> money<00:01:19.299> however

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
packs are going to cost money however

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.179 
packs are going to cost money however
they<00:01:20.229> promised<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:20.830> they<00:01:20.890> will<00:01:21.009> do<00:01:21.159> their

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
they promised that they will do their

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.070 
they promised that they will do their
best<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.640> keep<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.970> price<00:01:22.180> down<00:01:22.210> hopefully

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
best to keep the price down hopefully

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.319 
best to keep the price down hopefully
it'll<00:01:23.229> be<00:01:23.380> less<00:01:23.680> than<00:01:23.860> a<00:01:23.890> texture<00:01:24.340> pack<00:01:24.520> I'm

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
it'll be less than a texture pack I'm

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.120 
it'll be less than a texture pack I'm
sorry<00:01:25.630> less<00:01:25.960> than<00:01:26.079> a<00:01:26.140> mash-up<00:01:26.530> pack<00:01:26.680> but<00:01:26.920> about

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
sorry less than a mash-up pack but about

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.399 
sorry less than a mash-up pack but about
the<00:01:27.189> same<00:01:27.340> price<00:01:27.610> as<00:01:27.880> a<00:01:27.970> skin<00:01:28.210> pack<00:01:28.390> I'm<00:01:29.229> not

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
the same price as a skin pack I'm not

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.590 
the same price as a skin pack I'm not
exactly<00:01:29.740> sure<00:01:29.920> what<00:01:30.220> those<00:01:30.369> convert<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.880> in<00:01:31.119> in

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
exactly sure what those convert to in in

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.880 
exactly sure what those convert to in in
real<00:01:31.810> life<00:01:32.020> dollars<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.470> know<00:01:32.530> they<00:01:32.710> used<00:01:32.740> to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
real life dollars I know they used to

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.990 
real life dollars I know they used to
use<00:01:32.920> microsoft<00:01:33.430> points<00:01:33.700> but<00:01:33.790> they're<00:01:33.880> not

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
use microsoft points but they're not

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.850 
use microsoft points but they're not
doing<00:01:34.119> that<00:01:34.240> anymore<00:01:34.479> so<00:01:35.380> hopefully<00:01:35.560> it'll<00:01:35.799> be

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
doing that anymore so hopefully it'll be

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.100 
doing that anymore so hopefully it'll be
about<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.189> same<00:01:36.340> price<00:01:36.610> as<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.939> skin<00:01:37.600> pack<00:01:37.810> and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
about the same price as a skin pack and

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.480 
about the same price as a skin pack and
because<00:01:38.649> you<00:01:38.770> know<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:38.920> don't<00:01:39.100> get<00:01:39.220> all<00:01:39.340> the

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
because you know you don't get all the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.740 
because you know you don't get all the
all<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.850> stuff<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.210> get<00:01:40.299> with<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.479> mash-up

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
all the stuff you get with a mash-up

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.270 
all the stuff you get with a mash-up
pack<00:01:40.899> so<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.229> price<00:01:41.470> would<00:01:41.680> make<00:01:41.860> sense<00:01:42.040> that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
pack so the price would make sense that

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.760 
pack so the price would make sense that
it<00:01:42.759> was<00:01:42.880> going<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.149> be<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.390> little<00:01:43.720> bit<00:01:43.869> less<00:01:44.079> now

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
it was going to be a little bit less now

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.499 
it was going to be a little bit less now
another<00:01:45.159> thing<00:01:45.250> that<00:01:45.579> they've<00:01:45.729> said<00:01:46.030> about

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
another thing that they've said about

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.420 
another thing that they've said about
texture<00:01:47.470> packs<00:01:47.680> is<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:48.009> we<00:01:48.100> will<00:01:48.220> actually

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
texture packs is that we will actually

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.760 
texture packs is that we will actually
be<00:01:48.759> seeing<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.210> mid<00:01:49.509> evil<00:01:49.990> texture<00:01:50.380> pack<00:01:50.590> at

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
be seeing a mid evil texture pack at

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.679 
be seeing a mid evil texture pack at
some<00:01:51.100> point<00:01:51.310> in<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.430> future<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:52.329> can<00:01:52.479> see

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
some point in the future you can see

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.359 
some point in the future you can see
here<00:01:52.960> that<00:01:52.990> somebody<00:01:53.439> actually<00:01:53.469> tweeted<00:01:53.740> 4j

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
here that somebody actually tweeted 4j

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.069 
here that somebody actually tweeted 4j
Studios<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.090> was<00:01:55.180> kind<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.479> disappointed

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
Studios and was kind of disappointed

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.539 
Studios and was kind of disappointed
that<00:01:56.170> we<00:01:56.259> weren't<00:01:56.500> seeing<00:01:56.680> anything<00:01:56.979> medieval

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
that we weren't seeing anything medieval

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.609 
that we weren't seeing anything medieval
and<00:01:57.700> they<00:01:58.210> went<00:01:58.420> ahead<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:58.899> responded<00:01:59.530> and

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
and they went ahead and responded and

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.620 
and they went ahead and responded and
said<00:01:59.680> something<00:02:00.189> medieval<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.790> coming<00:02:01.149> so

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
said something medieval is coming so

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.209 
said something medieval is coming so
obviously<00:02:02.049> not<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.320> next<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.649> texture<00:02:02.979> packs

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
obviously not the next to texture packs

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.800 
obviously not the next to texture packs
they're<00:02:03.880> not<00:02:04.030> going<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.299> be<00:02:04.390> medieval<00:02:04.540> but

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
they're not going to be medieval but

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.719 
they're not going to be medieval but
possibly<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.320> third<00:02:05.560> one<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:06.250> we<00:02:06.369> will<00:02:06.549> see

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
possibly the third one that we will see

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.249 
possibly the third one that we will see
probably<00:02:07.000> in<00:02:07.210> about<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.390> month<00:02:07.659> or<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:07.869> time

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
probably in about a month or so time

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.889 
probably in about a month or so time
will<00:02:09.250> hopefully<00:02:09.579> be<00:02:09.970> something<00:02:10.390> medieval<00:02:10.570> you

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
will hopefully be something medieval you

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.420 
will hopefully be something medieval you
know<00:02:10.989> give<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.260> new<00:02:11.410> dynamic<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.160> game

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
know give you new dynamic to the game

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.000 
know give you new dynamic to the game
and<00:02:13.049> maybe<00:02:14.049> we'll<00:02:14.200> even<00:02:14.260> be<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.410> master<00:02:14.709> pack<00:02:14.890> I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
and maybe we'll even be a master pack I

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.189 
and maybe we'll even be a master pack I
don't<00:02:15.190> know<00:02:15.329> hopefully<00:02:16.329> it<00:02:16.510> will<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.900> cool

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:17.199 
don't know hopefully it will be cool

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.439 
don't know hopefully it will be cool
