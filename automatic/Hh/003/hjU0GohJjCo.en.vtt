00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.410 
you know they don't know what kick you
have<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:08.100> it's<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> be<00:02:08.519> multiplied<00:02:09.060> by

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
have but it's going to be multiplied by

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.130 
have but it's going to be multiplied by
something<00:02:10.400> there's<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.489> few<00:02:11.670> other<00:02:12.049> cards<00:02:13.049> that

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
something there's a few other cards that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.950 
something there's a few other cards that
are<00:02:13.230> included<00:02:13.470> in

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
are included in

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.530 
are included in
this<00:02:14.080> deck<00:02:14.410> but<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:15.010> want<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.000> make<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.300> known

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
this deck but I want to make it known

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.090 
this deck but I want to make it known
that<00:02:16.750> because<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.350> color<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.650> different<00:02:17.830> you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
that because the color is different you

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.950 
that because the color is different you
can<00:02:18.280> take<00:02:18.460> these<00:02:18.610> rewards<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:19.180> people<00:02:19.480> will

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
can take these rewards but people will

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.600 
can take these rewards but people will
likely<00:02:20.200> steal<00:02:20.620> them<00:02:20.800> because<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.220> chance<00:02:21.460> of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
likely steal them because the chance of

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.390 
likely steal them because the chance of
getting<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.910> good<00:02:22.150> card<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.690> high<00:02:23.400> especially

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
getting a good card is high especially

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.910 
getting a good card is high especially
since<00:02:24.640> some<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.820> these<00:02:25.000> cards<00:02:25.420> really<00:02:26.350> tend<00:02:26.830> to

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
since some of these cards really tend to

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.880 
since some of these cards really tend to
change<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.370> game<00:02:27.580> however<00:02:28.500> there's<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.590> card

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
change the game however there's a card

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.520 
change the game however there's a card
here<00:02:30.070> called<00:02:30.370> rift<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.080> rift<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.200> can<00:02:32.410> play

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
here called rift and rift you can play

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.530 
here called rift and rift you can play
the<00:02:32.650> study<00:02:32.830> if<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:32.950> turn<00:02:33.220> or<00:02:33.430> get<00:02:33.610> five<00:02:33.850> chips

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the study if you turn or get five chips

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.090 
the study if you turn or get five chips
back<00:02:34.810> for<00:02:35.050> any<00:02:35.170> player<00:02:35.410> okay<00:02:35.770> that's<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.950> neat

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
back for any player okay that's a neat

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.550 
back for any player okay that's a neat
card<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:37.060> itself<00:02:37.480> but<00:02:37.990> if<00:02:38.110> another<00:02:38.350> player

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
card in of itself but if another player

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.290 
card in of itself but if another player
steals<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.160> cards<00:02:39.550> from<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.790> they<00:02:40.000> lose

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
steals this cards from you they lose

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.900 
steals this cards from you they lose
five<00:02:40.690> ships<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.470> they<00:02:42.280> have<00:02:42.460> to<00:02:42.580> go<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
five ships and they have to go to the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.730 
five ships and they have to go to the
warp<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:43.870> basically<00:02:44.260> like<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.620> have<00:02:44.710> a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
warp so it's basically like you have a

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.080 
warp so it's basically like you have a
booby<00:02:45.070> trap<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.490> your<00:02:45.520> hand<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:45.940> there's

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
booby trap in your hand and there's

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.120 
booby trap in your hand and there's
three<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.420> these<00:02:46.600> cards<00:02:47.080> in<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.680> deck<00:02:47.710> that

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
three of these cards in the deck that

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.310 
three of these cards in the deck that
there's<00:02:48.760> some<00:02:48.880> crooked<00:02:49.150> negotiates<00:02:49.780> cards

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
there's some crooked negotiates cards

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.720 
there's some crooked negotiates cards
where<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.740> gives<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> better<00:02:51.430> deal<00:02:51.670> than

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
where that gives you a better deal than

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.120 
where that gives you a better deal than
your<00:02:52.060> opponent<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:53.050> is<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.260> neat<00:02:53.530> deck<00:02:53.890> and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
your opponent this is a neat deck and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.400 
your opponent this is a neat deck and
because<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.420> can<00:02:55.600> draw<00:02:55.840> from<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.200> when<00:02:56.320> you

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
because you can draw from that when you

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.920 
because you can draw from that when you
help<00:02:56.560> someone<00:02:56.770> defend<00:02:57.220> causes<00:02:58.180> defense<00:02:58.720> to

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
help someone defend causes defense to

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.750 
help someone defend causes defense to
happen<00:02:59.290> more<00:02:59.470> often<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.040> game<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
happen more often in the game the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.610 
happen more often in the game the
rewards<00:03:01.270> for<00:03:01.390> defense<00:03:01.750> are<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.170> as<00:03:02.290> great<00:03:02.500> as

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
rewards for defense are just as great as

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.290 
rewards for defense are just as great as
the<00:03:02.740> rewards<00:03:03.100> for<00:03:03.250> offense<00:03:03.700> at<00:03:03.790> this<00:03:03.940> point<00:03:04.210> in

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
the rewards for offense at this point in

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.350 
the rewards for offense at this point in
time<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.430> best<00:03:06.640> part<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.240> the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
time and so this is the best part of the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.590 
time and so this is the best part of the
expansion<00:03:07.920> except<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.460> aliens<00:03:10.090> there<00:03:10.480> are

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
expansion except the aliens there are

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.870 
expansion except the aliens there are
