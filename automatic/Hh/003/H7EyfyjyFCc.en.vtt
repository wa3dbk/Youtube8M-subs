00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.360
 Hey, I'm Sophie from Time for Action and welcome. 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.420
 In this video you will discover the 5 most important things you need to know about yourself 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.969
 to get the most out of your life. 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.930
 Self-knowledge is the beginning of all wisdom, they say. 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.259
 I would dare to go one step further: I even dare to say that self-knowledge is the basis 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:25.369
 lies of happiness. 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.910
 May I ask es: how well do you know yourself? 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.910
 Difficult question? 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.029
 Quite right! 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.250
 Do you know who you really are? 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.780
 What do you want in life? 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.739
 What are you good at and what you can improve? 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.310
 Which values ​​are important to you? 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.449
 Most people have no answer to these questions. 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.390
 We are so busy with others and we fly through our day, making us hardly silent 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.390
 stand with ourselves and our desires. 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.820
 That often creates a feeling of emptiness that we try to fill with new purchases, 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.820
 information, achievements. While we can learn so much about ourselves. 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.920
 The better we know and understand ourselves, the easier everything goes and the happier we are 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.920
 we can become. 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.610
 And isn't that what we all want? 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.190
 Let us pause for a moment on these 5 questions, which I think everyone can do for themselves 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.469
 should know the answer! 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.440
 Question 1 which are your most important values? 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.680
 Our values ​​represent different things in our lives, such as what you believe in, what 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.380
 you really care about your values ​​and define who you are as a person. 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.520
 When you have a clear picture of your values ​​and understand them, it is much easier 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 to find happiness and success. 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.970
 If you don't know your values, you can feel emptiness, stress and a feeling of frustration 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.630
 even if you don't know where that comes from. 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.610
 If you do know your values ​​you will understand yourself better and that is the start of everything. 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.759
 What are your most important values? 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.060
 Question 2: what you want in your life We have all been at one point 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.340
 where we did not know what direction we wanted to go in our life, what exactly we want. 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.890
 And that point may just as well come when you are 18 or when you are 50. 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.829
 Discovering what you want to do with your life is not something you do in between, 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.399
 and there is also no splash plan that you can follow to get out. 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.759
 It is a process, something that you must give time to think about. 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.360
 So: what do you actually want in your life? 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.540
 Question 3: what motivates you? 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.300
 It's like this: everything we do, or don't do, we do either to avoid pain or to 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.300
 to find pleasure. 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.360
 Some people go on a diet when they finally get tired of that 3-digit number 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.000
 standing on the scales, others because they are so looking forward to finally being in one 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.020
 size 38 and dare to walk on the beach in bikini. 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.630
 Think for a moment, what motivates YOU the most? 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.010
 The prospect of more pain or more pleasure? 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.420
 Question 4: what gives you energy? 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.560
 Have you ever paid attention to how some things give your masses of energy and others your energy arrow? 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.020
 pull down hard? 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.069
 Watching the (usually not so positive) news every day, surfing the web for hours, 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.670
 complain about what's wrong with the world, with your world. 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.670
 All things that bring down your energy. 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.780
 On the other hand: music, contact with other people, nature, healthy food, exercise, 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.760
 some examples of things that can give your energy a huge boost. 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.980
 What gives you energy and what doesn't? 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.340
 Question 5: what is your biggest fear and how can you eliminate it? 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.250
 The most common fears are fear of spiders, rejection, fear of failure, 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:47.630
 fear of heights, fear of pain, fear of intimacy, fear of not being good enough. 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.310
 Dare to dwell on your greatest fear. 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.930
 Once you know what it is that is stopping you, you can also do something about it. 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.480
 What is your biggest fear? 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.730
 They were. 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.060
 Five questions that can change your life. 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.100
 At least if you know the answer. 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.910
 So I challenge you today, or this week, to reflect on each of these questions, 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.910
 and look for your answers. 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.940
 I'm sure you will learn a lot from it.
