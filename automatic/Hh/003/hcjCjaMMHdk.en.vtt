00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
definite I think there's still a few

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.260 
definite I think there's still a few
issues<00:01:14.159> about<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> width<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.850> stance<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
issues about the width of stance you

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.160 
issues about the width of stance you
could<00:01:15.390> definitely<00:01:15.540> bring<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.049> the

yeah dude quite snowplow as well to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.730 
yeah dude quite snowplow as well to
start<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> weight<00:01:45.780> wasn't<00:01:46.020> she<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.320> little<00:01:46.500> bit

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
start the weight wasn't she a little bit

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.170 
start the weight wasn't she a little bit
of<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.860> loss<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.369> balance<00:01:47.490> there<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.030> can

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
of a loss of balance there but you can

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.960 
of a loss of balance there but you can
really<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:49.280> smooth<00:01:50.280> parallel<00:01:50.700> turns

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
really see that smooth parallel turns

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.030 
really see that smooth parallel turns
dropping<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> hip<00:01:52.079> into<00:01:52.380> turn<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:52.710> well<00:01:52.829> it's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
dropping the hip into turn as well it's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.260 
dropping the hip into turn as well it's
getting<00:01:53.220> actually<00:01:53.430> quite<00:01:53.610> dynamic<00:01:53.790> now<00:01:54.149> which

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
getting actually quite dynamic now which

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.289 
getting actually quite dynamic now which
is<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.390> good<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.720> see<00:01:57.950> really<00:01:58.950> nice<00:01:59.299> it
