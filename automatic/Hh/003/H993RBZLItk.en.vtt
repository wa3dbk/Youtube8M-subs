there<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.559> many<00:00:46.920> proteins<00:00:47.550> working

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
there are so many proteins working

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
last very long that a great over time

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.689 
last very long that a great over time
they<00:00:52.350> usually<00:00:52.500> only<00:00:52.680> last<00:00:53.039> about<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.309> day<00:00:53.520> or

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
they usually only last about a day or

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.910 
they usually only last about a day or
two<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.420> means<00:00:54.660> we're<00:00:54.870> constantly<00:00:55.410> making

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
two this means we're constantly making

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.849 
two this means we're constantly making
these<00:00:56.129> proteins<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:57.480> how<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
these proteins but how do we do that the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.520 
these proteins but how do we do that the
process<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.460> protein<00:00:59.760> synthesis<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.359> be

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
process of protein synthesis can be

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.080 
process of protein synthesis can be
extremely<00:01:01.530> complicated<00:01:02.070> especially<00:01:02.609> in

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
extremely complicated especially in

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.399 
extremely complicated especially in
about<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> minute<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.049> we'll<00:01:04.140> try<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
about a minute or so but we'll try and

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.750 
about a minute or so but we'll try and
make<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.589> as<00:01:04.680> easy<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.159> as<00:01:05.309> simple<00:01:05.519> as

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
make it as easy and as simple as

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.730 
make it as easy and as simple as
possible<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.900> process<00:01:07.290> starts<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
possible the process starts in the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980 
possible the process starts in the
nucleus<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.340> cell<00:01:08.369> RNA<00:01:09.270> polymerase<00:01:09.630> which

you<00:02:05.860> may<00:02:06.070> think<00:02:06.400> that<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.610> lot<00:02:06.880> can<00:02:06.909> go<00:02:07.150> wrong<00:02:07.329> in

you may think that a lot can go wrong in
these<00:02:07.840> processes<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.830> you're<00:02:09.099> actually

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
these processes and you're actually

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.280 
these processes and you're actually
right<00:02:09.580> even<00:02:10.270> other<00:02:10.420> processes<00:02:10.959> quite

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
effective mistakes can be made and

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.240 
effective mistakes can be made and
irregular<00:02:13.780> proteins<00:02:14.140> can<00:02:14.349> form<00:02:14.590> most<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
time that's not a big issue and they

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.449

just degrade over time but sometimes the

just degrade over time but sometimes the
result<00:02:18.760> can<00:02:18.819> be<00:02:19.030> quite<00:02:19.390> deadly<00:02:19.780> if<00:02:20.349> you'd<00:02:20.470> like

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
result can be quite deadly if you'd like
