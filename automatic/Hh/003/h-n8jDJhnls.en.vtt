00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.670 
tour beyond with three different cages
rotating<00:02:05.579> at<00:02:05.700> three<00:02:06.000> different<00:02:06.210> speeds<00:02:06.680> so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
rotating at three different speeds so

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.619 
rotating at three different speeds so
why<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.340> called<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.970> east<00:02:09.300> wadi

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
why this is called the east wadi

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.630 
why this is called the east wadi
turbulent<00:02:10.379> I'm<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.619> too<00:02:10.800> sure<00:02:11.039> because<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.550> is

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
turbulent I'm not too sure because it is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.050 
turbulent I'm not too sure because it is
actually

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
actually

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.000 
actually
in<00:02:12.240> a<00:02:12.660> sense<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.140> future<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.770> Torah

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
in a sense the future of the Torah

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.520 
in a sense the future of the Torah
beyond<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.569> idea<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
beyond and I like the idea that the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.730 
beyond and I like the idea that the
torreón<00:02:17.040> has<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.400> future<00:02:18.030> other<00:02:18.540> than<00:02:19.110> just<00:02:19.530> as

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
torreón has a future other than just as

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.100 
torreón has a future other than just as
decoration<00:02:20.490> which<00:02:21.120> basically<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.720> what<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.900> is

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
decoration which basically is what it is

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.199 
decoration which basically is what it is
on<00:02:22.140> ceremony<00:02:22.740> watches<00:02:23.190> today<00:02:23.400> because<00:02:24.120> on

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
on ceremony watches today because on

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.970 
on ceremony watches today because on
wristwatches<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:25.020> could<00:02:25.200> argue<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.620> does<00:02:25.800> not

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
wristwatches you could argue it does not

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.240 
wristwatches you could argue it does not
in<00:02:26.130> any<00:02:26.430> way<00:02:26.700> improve<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.780> timing<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.890> people

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
in any way improve the timing the people

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.250 
in any way improve the timing the people
at<00:02:29.310> Harry<00:02:29.550> Winston<00:02:29.690> knew<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.050> tour

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
at Harry Winston knew that the tour

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.710 
at Harry Winston knew that the tour
beyond<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.890> not<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> complication<00:02:32.910> but<00:02:33.690> a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
beyond is not a complication but a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.809 
beyond is not a complication but a
complexity<00:02:34.410> because<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.130> adds<00:02:35.280> nothing<00:02:35.580> to

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
complexity because it adds nothing to

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.479 
complexity because it adds nothing to
the<00:02:36.030> information<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.110> watch<00:02:37.290> supplies<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.160> get

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
the information the watch supplies I get

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.979 
the information the watch supplies I get
annoyed<00:02:38.670> when<00:02:38.940> people<00:02:39.000> always<00:02:39.390> call<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.810> tour

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
annoyed when people always call it tour

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.340 
annoyed when people always call it tour
beyond<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:41.030> complication<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.540> next<00:02:42.870> watch<00:02:43.110> I
