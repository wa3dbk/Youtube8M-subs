they have one that looks like slate they

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.929 
they have one that looks like slate they
have<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.259> smooth<00:01:33.680> pattern<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:34.520> just<00:01:34.729> have<00:01:34.850> to

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
have a smooth pattern you just have to

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.490 
have a smooth pattern you just have to
go<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.090> their<00:01:35.270> website<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:35.780> check<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:36.140> out<00:01:36.259> I'm

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
go to their website and check it out I'm

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.840 
go to their website and check it out I'm
going<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.650> show<00:01:36.829> you<00:01:36.860> how<00:01:37.070> easy<00:01:37.310> these<00:01:37.610> things

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
going to show you how easy these things

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.580 
going to show you how easy these things
are<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.060> put<00:01:38.210> together<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:38.990> know<00:01:39.079> basically

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
are to put together you know basically

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.109 
are to put together you know basically
you<00:01:39.710> just<00:01:39.970> line<00:01:40.970> up<00:01:41.000> these<00:01:41.360> little<00:01:41.689> tabs<00:01:42.020> and

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
you just line up these little tabs and

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.550 
you just line up these little tabs and
then<00:01:44.119> you<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.509> can<00:01:44.630> actually<00:01:44.990> press<00:01:45.350> them

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
then you you can actually press them

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.499 
then you you can actually press them
into<00:01:45.740> place<00:01:45.860> but<00:01:46.369> it's<00:01:46.520> easier<00:01:46.790> if<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.360> have<00:01:47.479> a

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
into place but it's easier if you have a

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.630 
into place but it's easier if you have a
rubber<00:01:47.780> mallet<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:48.439> you<00:01:48.799> just<00:01:48.950> basically<00:01:49.100> come

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
rubber mallet so you just basically come

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.359 
rubber mallet so you just basically come
along<00:01:50.439> tap<00:01:51.439> them<00:01:51.619> down
