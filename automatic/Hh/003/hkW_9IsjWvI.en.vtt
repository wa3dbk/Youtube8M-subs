gold it was staged the next stage we're
about<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.039> see<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.719> the<00:00:51.719> first<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.110> the

about to see is the the first of the
fusion<00:00:52.440> stages<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> where<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.550> actually

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
fusion stages this is where we actually

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.810 
fusion stages this is where we actually
reduce<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.079> lead<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> sample

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
reduce the lead that's in the sample

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.360 
reduce the lead that's in the sample
from<00:00:57.360> lead<00:00:57.539> oxide<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> lead<00:00:58.680> metallic<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.290 
from lead oxide to a lead metallic and
the<00:01:00.149> process<00:01:00.539> takes<00:01:01.320> about<00:01:01.469> an<00:01:02.039> hour<00:01:02.219> at<00:01:02.460> 1,100

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
the process takes about an hour at 1,100

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.980 
the process takes about an hour at 1,100
degrees<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.189> during<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.309> stage<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990

that's<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> sample<00:01:25.170> will<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.560> fused<00:01:26.100> into

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
that's in the sample will be fused into

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.910 
that's in the sample will be fused into
a<00:01:26.430> slag<00:01:26.909> which<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.630> broken<00:01:27.840> away<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.619> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
a slag which can be broken away and it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.880 
a slag which can be broken away and it
goes<00:01:29.070> away<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.869> next<00:01:31.049> stage<00:01:31.229> will<00:01:31.439> be

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
goes away so the next stage will be

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.130 
goes away so the next stage will be
showing<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.610> pouring<00:01:33.030> stage<00:01:33.270> which<00:01:33.540> takes

the molten lead will will sink to the
bottom<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> mold<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.780> slag<00:01:40.020> will<00:01:40.229> be
