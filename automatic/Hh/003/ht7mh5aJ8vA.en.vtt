00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.139
 music here by you frejat is then 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.840
 show the chords to you that are not 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.810
 few but we can work on 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.260
 Singular the first chord for us 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.050
 you are using an ordinary home you may be 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.349
 using it like this on that string 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.079
 tan become loose with the door using 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.200
 two middle fingers or the shape on the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.960
 Dollar formula even you take this 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.660
 low fear is there with the name is 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.550
 So you see what's best for you. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.489
 I'm going to work with these two of them here. 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 in the middle or simply with the fingers - 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.340
 that we assemble is there greater does it 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.840
 with canvas 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.969
 Then we'll get bigger too, and let's go 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.690
 have a fish here that is a cycle 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.690
 ninth 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.490
 so I put the cyclone because 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.130
 while replacing yes larger then cyclone 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.970
 it looks more beautiful and is easier to 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.000
 do's there we'll also be in C 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.530
 sharp minor flap which is the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.090
 home I 'm going to have a low micron in the hair 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.720
 then I make use of the shape of the rene and I 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:40.490
 I have touched the fourth string down 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:43.910
 Here I low're here I feel sorry and 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.060
 I'll have a greater risk is from 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.060
 read 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.060
 the tall people we're going to be 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.020
 using this song is a good move 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.000
 Simple, I prefer it so, who 's there? 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.460
 starting is not to use it until the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.150
 end is until the end of the song so it goes 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.420
 be like this let's follow the little ones 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:18.070
 The nether one gets a long down and then 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:34.360
 so you count 12 341 in 234 in tem 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:37.380
 23 is in a rhythm here beauty 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.380
 Let's go to the song now. 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:51.740
 With you I'd dance so much in the foot 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:57.190
 I gave him the metro 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.190
 I would walk from the river to Salvador. 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:08.400
 I would accept life as it is 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:19.519
 I would travel dish with faith I would take a shower. 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:25.799
 frosty in winter you'd leave baby 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:31.260
 With you I would become friend in the month I 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:37.530
 I would sleep 6 to become gay 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:40.760
 which would also change my name I 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:48.020

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:51.710

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.710

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.930
 I could get to be happy 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:16.780
 I would paint the whole sky in red 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:22.480
 I would have more heirs going to dust 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:26.620

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:34.360
