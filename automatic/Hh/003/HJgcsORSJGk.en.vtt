00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.600 
at how clear this text is this text is
like<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.930> know<00:02:22.050> like<00:02:22.320> you're<00:02:22.470> actually<00:02:22.860> you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
like you know like you're actually you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.760 
like you know like you're actually you
can<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:23.850> really<00:02:24.000> close<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.570> here<00:02:24.840> as<00:02:25.080> close<00:02:25.620> as

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
can get really close in here as close as

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.410 
can get really close in here as close as
I<00:02:25.830> can<00:02:25.890> get<00:02:26.220> with<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.550> focus<00:02:26.880> right<00:02:27.210> about

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
I can get with this focus right about

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.360 
I can get with this focus right about
there<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.290> really<00:02:28.530> get<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.770> idea<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:29.100> how

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
there you can really get the idea of how

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.620 
there you can really get the idea of how
clear<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.510> text<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.370> on<00:02:32.370> here<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.210> that's

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
clear that text is on here and that's

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.630 
clear that text is on here and that's
the<00:02:33.750> most<00:02:33.930> important<00:02:34.380> thing<00:02:34.560> for<00:02:34.920> me<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:35.520> if

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
the most important thing for me like if

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.890 
the most important thing for me like if
someone<00:02:35.940> else<00:02:36.060> didn't<00:02:36.420> really<00:02:36.600> care<00:02:36.810> about

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
someone else didn't really care about

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.450 
someone else didn't really care about
that<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.440> don't<00:02:37.800> know<00:02:37.890> why<00:02:38.010> you'd<00:02:38.160> have<00:02:38.190> an

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
that I don't know why you'd have an

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.740 
that I don't know why you'd have an
e-reader<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> think<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.570> could<00:02:39.690> just

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
e-reader then I think you could just

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.449 
e-reader then I think you could just
read<00:02:40.140> off<00:02:40.290> your<00:02:40.500> tablet<00:02:40.890> or<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> phone<00:02:41.070> or

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
read off your tablet or a phone or

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.770 
read off your tablet or a phone or
whatever<00:02:41.610> if<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.940> guess<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.240> didn't<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.540> them

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
whatever if I guess you didn't have them

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.590 
whatever if I guess you didn't have them
most<00:02:43.080> people<00:02:43.350> have<00:02:43.500> smartphones<00:02:44.270> so<00:02:45.270> that

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
most people have smartphones so that

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.260 
most people have smartphones so that
glow<00:02:45.990> on<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.470> paperwhite<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.430> cannot<00:02:50.270> you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
glow on the paperwhite you cannot you

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.890 
glow on the paperwhite you cannot you
cannot<00:02:52.340> turn<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.489> off<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:54.150> can<00:02:54.300> only<00:02:54.450> turn<00:02:54.720> it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
cannot turn it off you can only turn it

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.270 
cannot turn it off you can only turn it
down<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.290> seems<00:02:55.530> like<00:02:55.680> you're<00:02:55.800> turning<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.160> off

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
down it seems like you're turning it off

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.130 
down it seems like you're turning it off
but<00:02:56.760> there's<00:02:56.910> always<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.180> faint<00:02:57.570> glow<00:02:57.900> it

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
but there's always that faint glow it

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.930 
but there's always that faint glow it
always<00:02:58.350> bothered<00:02:59.070> my<00:02:59.220> eye<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.760> thought

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
always bothered my eye and I thought

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.540 
always bothered my eye and I thought
that<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.330> even<00:03:01.170> though<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.380> say<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.860> pixels

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
that it even though they say the pixels

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.280 
that it even though they say the pixels
per<00:03:02.730> inch<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:03.150> better<00:03:03.390> on<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.660> paperwhite<00:03:04.050> it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
per inch is better on the paperwhite it

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.660 
per inch is better on the paperwhite it
just<00:03:04.530> did<00:03:04.800> not<00:03:04.950> look<00:03:05.100> as<00:03:05.250> clear<00:03:05.489> that's

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
just did not look as clear that's

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.220 
just did not look as clear that's
because<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.330> Club<00:03:06.570> really<00:03:06.750> bothered<00:03:07.110> my

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
because of that Club really bothered my

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.270 
because of that Club really bothered my
eyes<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:07.890> if<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.070> have<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.310> same<00:03:10.100> ideas<00:03:11.100> that
