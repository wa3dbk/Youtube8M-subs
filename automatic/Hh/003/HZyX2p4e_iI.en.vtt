00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
fingers back on practice that and we'll

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.300 
fingers back on practice that and we'll
just<00:02:43.950> step<00:02:44.070> 3

strumming go to the G chord all three

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.759 
strumming go to the G chord all three
fingers<00:02:58.840> I<00:03:00.900> strum<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.379> hear<00:03:02.620> that

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
fingers I strum it just to hear that

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.530 
fingers I strum it just to hear that
it's<00:03:02.920> all<00:03:03.040> sounding<00:03:03.519> I'm<00:03:03.700> not<00:03:03.970> interested<00:03:04.239> in

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
it's all sounding I'm not interested in

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.280 
it's all sounding I'm not interested in
the<00:03:05.079> temple<00:03:05.439> right<00:03:05.590> now<00:03:06.209> fingers<00:03:07.209> off<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:08.170> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
the temple right now fingers off to the

the temple right now fingers off to the
D<00:03:11.129> now<00:03:12.129> do<00:03:12.189> not<00:03:12.609> overwhelm<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.239> don't<00:03:13.540> worry

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
D now do not overwhelm you don't worry

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.420 
D now do not overwhelm you don't worry
too<00:03:13.930> much<00:03:13.959> about<00:03:14.109> this<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:14.769> I'm<00:03:14.889> aiming

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
too much about this but I'm aiming

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.259 
too much about this but I'm aiming
towards<00:03:16.299> its<00:03:16.569> little<00:03:17.260> movement<00:03:17.620> as<00:03:17.709> possible

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
towards its little movement as possible

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.390 
towards its little movement as possible
so<00:03:19.269> when<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:19.629> go<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.989> G<00:03:20.170> chord<00:03:20.409> I'm<00:03:21.189> not

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
so when I go to the G chord I'm not

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.649 
so when I go to the G chord I'm not
lifting<00:03:21.609> my<00:03:21.849> fingers<00:03:22.120> way<00:03:22.269> higher<00:03:22.450> off<00:03:22.629> the

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
lifting my fingers way higher off the

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.800 
lifting my fingers way higher off the
fretboard<00:03:23.489> taking<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.639> path<00:03:24.909> that's<00:03:25.209> closest

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
fretboard taking the path that's closest

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.509 
fretboard taking the path that's closest
to<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:26.049> G<00:03:26.230> chord<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:27.459> don't<00:03:27.730> want<00:03:27.909> to<00:03:28.000> do<00:03:28.090> this

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
to the G chord you don't want to do this

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.629 
to the G chord you don't want to do this
that's<00:03:30.519> too<00:03:30.669> far<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.989> want<00:03:32.169> a<00:03:32.260> nice<00:03:32.980> small

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
that's too far you want a nice small

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.940 
that's too far you want a nice small
movement<00:03:37.049> sometimes<00:03:38.049> you'll<00:03:38.200> even<00:03:38.319> find<00:03:38.500> a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
movement sometimes you'll even find a

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.679 
movement sometimes you'll even find a
finger<00:03:39.280> stays<00:03:39.459> in<00:03:39.609> the<00:03:39.700> same<00:03:39.849> place<00:03:39.909> or<00:03:40.450> can

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
finger stays in the same place or can

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.500 
finger stays in the same place or can
slide<00:03:40.959> on<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.260> same<00:03:41.470> string<00:03:41.799> good<00:03:42.489> leave<00:03:43.359> the

slide on the same string good leave the
finger<00:03:43.689> they're<00:03:43.930> gonna<00:03:44.079> take<00:03:44.230> it<00:03:44.379> off<00:03:44.470> if<00:03:44.500> you

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
finger they're gonna take it off if you

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.540 
finger they're gonna take it off if you
don't<00:03:44.769> need<00:03:45.069> to

step 4 finger the a chord same as the
other<00:04:13.070> two<00:04:13.250> chords<00:04:13.640> i'm<00:04:14.390> using<00:04:14.870> a

other two chords i'm using a

other two chords i'm using a
three-finger<00:04:15.380> a<00:04:15.410> there's<00:04:15.830> many<00:04:16.040> versions

three-finger a there's many versions

three-finger a there's many versions
that's<00:04:17.209> not<00:04:17.420> too<00:04:17.660> important<00:04:18.049> right<00:04:18.200> now<00:04:18.230> which

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
that's not too important right now which

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.480 
that's not too important right now which
version<00:04:19.010> you<00:04:19.130> use<00:04:20.859> just<00:04:21.859> strum<00:04:22.100> to<00:04:22.220> make<00:04:22.340> sure

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
version you use just strum to make sure

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.840 
version you use just strum to make sure
it's<00:04:22.640> sounding<00:04:22.970> accurately<00:04:23.350> fingers<00:04:24.350> off
