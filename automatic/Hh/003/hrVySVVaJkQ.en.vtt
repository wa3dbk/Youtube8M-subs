00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 there are gamers to see next commenting and 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.450
 we're back when that saying a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.480
 new tutorial and then in this case as 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.059
 we opened it left at number two I 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.510
 it seems that it was the one of the ducks and then in 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.330
 Today I will teach you 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.570
 something that the truth is a bit 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.430
 surprising but very little credible are 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.470
 the sizes of portals to the best 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.260
 some of you already know or maybe 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.960
 I do not recommend that if you do not 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.750
 they knew 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.239
 and he asks for my channel as the truth is 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.019
 deserves no and here we have the first one that 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.710
 is the normal 44 by 4 it seems to me here 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:44.100
 we have the 4 by 8 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.809
 and see is so beautiful this we go 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.809
 here that is this 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.360
 how much little portal and we go to 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.170
 to a big one 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.780
 as they are and we put ourselves here but if 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.490
 we want to make it bigger we are going to 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.010
 be up top up this 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.939
 magazine above 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.700
 and we cut him all this we're going to cut him 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:13.950
 all this can still be enlarged more 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.950
 until what you want that yes 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.840
 let's see we put this here we put 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.560
 this here here here and here here 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.560
 here here 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.430
 here 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.430
 what 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.830
 but it does not allow me 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.240
 all because we are here 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:42.060
 we have until here and here 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.880
 I happened to think 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.869
 it does not matter we put here here here 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.869
 here here 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.060
 if we remove these the remains and we put 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.610
 so we go down 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.610
 and we are here 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.939
 is here with this it does not work anymore it's because 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.939
 that does not have to stretch so much 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.370
 if we want to remind you a little bit because 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:16.720
 little by little we have to get 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.030
 for this distance 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.980
 and soft and wood because then there are times 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.880
 that it's okay that you can do your 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.880
 heights you want, but not 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.590
 so much good until they call it allowed 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.840
 is as high as a block can be 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.610
 less a block more and then nothing guys 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.450
 I hope you liked it I am recording 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.490
 this at 2 and a half in the morning and 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.080
 we are types of portals you 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.890
 they can do it in short topics more 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.130
 guys but if it's still the same 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.710
 water put this name I put this one next 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.530
 being the same 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.140
 it seems that the same neider does not change 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.450
 nothing 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:05.970
 are things like that no more than nothing is left 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.820
 that generates the land because it is 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.870
 it's the same nothing but the size of the 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:17.700
 that spoke and we left and then it's the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:21.080
 same no more than anything and it assumes 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.080
 lips where gullet I do not know 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.670
 and this one is the same guy yes 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.790
 I discovered it because I was doing a 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.360
 portal and I was wrong 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.349
 I was wrong in height it came out I did it 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.709
 of five by five it seems to me and it came out 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.350
 typical that is 4x4 in down 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.410
 comes out 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.620
 it has to be in front of this if not 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.530
 these guys do not come out 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.379
 what are the portals and then nothing guys 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.090
 I'm Bryant Alex remember that if he has 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.510
