one so make sure you pay attention it's
the<00:01:24.570> fact<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.080> game<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> proteins

play in tournaments and competitions is

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.170 
play in tournaments and competitions is
almost<00:01:28.350> identical<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:29.250> gameplay<00:01:29.549> mechanics
