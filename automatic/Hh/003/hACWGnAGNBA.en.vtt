right<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:44.789> from<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> gameplay<00:00:45.710> normally

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
right here from the gameplay normally

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.110 
right here from the gameplay normally
you<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> don't<00:00:47.309> mind<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.700> don't<00:00:47.910> watch

you know I don't mind if you don't watch
too<00:00:48.390> much<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.570> game<00:00:48.780> playing<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> listen

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
too much a game playing just to listen

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.410 
too much a game playing just to listen
but<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.219> think<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.550> plays<00:00:50.820> an<00:00:51.000> important

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
but this I think it plays an important

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.020 
but this I think it plays an important
factor<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:53.160> definitely<00:00:53.370> pay<00:00:53.670> attention

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
factor so you definitely pay attention

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.720 
factor so you definitely pay attention
to<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> gameplay<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.590> then<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
to the gameplay and then you can see you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.040 
to the gameplay and then you can see you
know<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.629> judge<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:57.989> yourself

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
know if you you can judge for yourself

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.319 
know if you you can judge for yourself
if<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> uh<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.789> want<00:01:00.239> to

the<00:01:40.510> laser<00:01:40.750> sight<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:42.280> course<00:01:42.490> with<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:43.200> laser

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
the laser sight of course with the laser

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.140 
the laser sight of course with the laser
sight<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:44.650> know<00:01:44.680> it<00:01:45.040> helps<00:01:45.190> it<00:01:45.550> it<00:01:45.970> helps

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
sight you know it helps it it helps

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.990 
sight you know it helps it it helps
improve<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.720> hipfire<00:01:46.930> it<00:01:47.650> me<00:01:48.130> like<00:01:48.760> you<00:01:48.880> know

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
improve the hipfire it me like you know

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.490 
improve the hipfire it me like you know
sometimes<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.570> know<00:01:49.690> up<00:01:49.990> with<00:01:50.170> like<00:01:50.290> for

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
sometimes you know up with like for

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.840 
sometimes you know up with like for
example<00:01:50.620> if<00:01:51.010> you're<00:01:51.130> running<00:01:51.250> around<00:01:51.490> them

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
example if you're running around them

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.000 
example if you're running around them
out<00:01:52.030> then<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:53.140> know<00:01:53.260> you<00:01:53.320> bump<00:01:53.620> into<00:01:53.770> the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
out then you you know you bump into the

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.590 
out then you you know you bump into the
enemy<00:01:54.370> instead<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.790> like<00:01:54.910> trying<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.240> load<00:01:55.450> up

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
enemy instead of like trying to load up

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.930 
enemy instead of like trying to load up
a<00:01:55.720> name<00:01:55.900> on<00:01:55.930> someone<00:01:56.560> no<00:01:57.250> nine<00:01:57.550> times<00:01:57.790> out<00:01:57.910> of

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
a name on someone no nine times out of

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.580 
a name on someone no nine times out of
ten<00:01:58.060> sometimes<00:01:58.690> if<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.080> have<00:01:59.230> a<00:01:59.350> quick

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
ten sometimes if you have a quick

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.710 
ten sometimes if you have a quick
reaction<00:02:00.190> you're<00:02:00.760> going<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.940> get<00:02:01.030> dropped<00:02:01.360> you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
reaction you're going to get dropped you

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.050 
reaction you're going to get dropped you
know<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.980> easiest<00:02:03.130> thing<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.520> do<00:02:03.610> just<00:02:03.640> far

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
know so the easiest thing to do just far

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.360 
know so the easiest thing to do just far
from<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.330> hip<00:02:04.480> right<00:02:04.770> what<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.920> red<00:02:06.100> laser

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
from the hip right what the red laser

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.940 
from the hip right what the red laser
does<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.910> helps<00:02:07.210> 25<00:02:08.110> reduction<00:02:08.650> the<00:02:08.770> hipfire

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
does it helps 25 reduction the hipfire

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.670 
does it helps 25 reduction the hipfire
penalty<00:02:09.760> so<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.450> helps<00:02:10.720> improve<00:02:11.080> your<00:02:11.530> hipfire

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
penalty so it helps improve your hipfire

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.540 
penalty so it helps improve your hipfire
and<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:13.000> think<00:02:13.420> that's<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.720> big<00:02:13.930> help<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.800> you

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
and I think that's a big help so you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.860 
and I think that's a big help so you
should<00:02:15.700> definitely<00:02:15.730> do<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.270> running<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.660> red

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
should definitely do the running the red

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.870 
should definitely do the running the red
light<00:02:16.900> I'm<00:02:17.380> going<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.560> lay<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.830> site<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.700> now

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
light I'm going to lay the site and now

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.610 
light I'm going to lay the site and now
for<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.150> lsat<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.630> rainy<00:02:19.840> gonna<00:02:20.080> get<00:02:20.350> or<00:02:20.500> you

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
running gun type person like myself you

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.030 
running gun type person like myself you
know<00:02:25.600> how<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.780> hi<00:02:25.960> Patti<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.530> tend<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.860> just

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
I don't have a health pack around me I

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.030 
I don't have a health pack around me I
think<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:31.930> would<00:02:32.380> definitely<00:02:32.500> help<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:32.920> out

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
think this would definitely help you out

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.150 
think this would definitely help you out
it<00:02:33.430> helps<00:02:33.640> improve<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.180> hipfire<00:02:35.040> other<00:02:36.040> than

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
it helps improve the hipfire other than

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.570 
it helps improve the hipfire other than
that<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.580> run<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.570> heavy<00:02:37.810> barrel<00:02:38.400> yeah<00:02:39.400> it

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
that I run of the heavy barrel yeah it

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.210 
that I run of the heavy barrel yeah it
helps<00:02:39.910> improve<00:02:40.300> my<00:02:40.450> fire<00:02:40.660> accuracy<00:02:41.080> but<00:02:41.920> fifty

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
helps improve my fire accuracy but fifty

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.720 
helps improve my fire accuracy but fifty
percent<00:02:42.780> that's<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.930> big<00:02:44.140> thing<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:44.770> bad<00:02:45.459> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
percent that's a big thing but bad the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.790 
percent that's a big thing but bad the
downfall<00:02:46.300> of<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.660> there's<00:02:47.470> always<00:02:47.770> a

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
downfall of that there's always a

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.660 
downfall of that there's always a
downfall<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.820> cause<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.330> effect<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.980> cost<00:02:51.400> me

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
downfall of cause and effect it cost me

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.530 
downfall of cause and effect it cost me
fifty<00:02:51.880> percent<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.240> my<00:02:52.360> muzzle<00:02:52.660> climb

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
fifty percent of my muzzle climb

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.100 
fifty percent of my muzzle climb
no<00:02:53.719> penalty<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.769> my<00:02:54.890> state<00:02:55.189> my<00:02:55.489> stability

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
no penalty to my state my stability

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.050 
no penalty to my state my stability
which<00:02:57.110> pretty<00:02:57.379> much<00:02:57.469> means<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.700> know<00:02:58.849> that

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
which pretty much means you know that

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.869 
which pretty much means you know that
your<00:02:59.209> shots<00:02:59.420> would<00:02:59.510> come<00:02:59.719> more<00:02:59.900> accurate<00:03:00.879> but

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
your shots would come more accurate but

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.009 
your shots would come more accurate but
yeah<00:03:02.000> however<00:03:02.209> you're<00:03:02.420> gonna<00:03:02.599> lose<00:03:02.810> some

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
yeah however you're gonna lose some

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.349 
yeah however you're gonna lose some
stability<00:03:03.439> because<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.430> muzzle<00:03:04.790> elevates

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
stability because the muzzle elevates

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.709 
stability because the muzzle elevates
due<00:03:05.659> to<00:03:05.840> record<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:07.370> yeah<00:03:07.579> that's<00:03:08.000> that's

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
due to record so yeah that's that's

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.569 
due to record so yeah that's that's
doing<00:03:09.170> problem<00:03:09.530> with<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:09.859> one<00:03:10.099> but<00:03:10.310> I

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
doing problem with that one but I

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.580 
doing problem with that one but I
figured<00:03:11.359> you<00:03:11.689> know<00:03:11.720> I'd<00:03:11.930> make<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.319> sacrifice

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
figured you know I'd make that sacrifice

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.559 
figured you know I'd make that sacrifice
because<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.579> next<00:03:13.790> thing<00:03:14.000> I'm<00:03:14.209> about<00:03:14.299> to<00:03:14.450> get

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
because the next thing I'm about to get

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.780 
because the next thing I'm about to get
into<00:03:14.930> will<00:03:15.319> pretty<00:03:15.650> much<00:03:15.769> help<00:03:16.099> you<00:03:16.459> know<00:03:16.579> in<00:03:16.700> a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
into will pretty much help you know in a

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.030 
into will pretty much help you know in a
little<00:03:17.090> way<00:03:17.260> but<00:03:18.260> I<00:03:18.319> think<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.590> heavy<00:03:18.739> barrel

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
little way but I think the heavy barrel

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.330 
little way but I think the heavy barrel
is<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.989> definitely<00:03:21.379> will<00:03:21.439> help<00:03:21.590> especially

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
is it definitely will help especially

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.220

fifty<00:04:10.280> percent<00:04:10.519> of<00:04:10.639> stability<00:04:11.090> this<00:04:12.079> is<00:04:12.229> when

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
fifty percent of stability this is when

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.860 
fifty percent of stability this is when
the<00:04:12.560> next<00:04:12.859> thing<00:04:13.190> comes<00:04:13.489> in<00:04:13.699> it's<00:04:14.419> the<00:04:14.510> angled

the next thing comes in it's the angled
grip<00:04:15.070> you<00:04:16.070> know<00:04:16.220> it<00:04:16.669> improves<00:04:17.359> your<00:04:17.419> fire<00:04:17.690> aim

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870

see<00:04:20.570> by<00:04:21.019> reducing<00:04:21.500> first<00:04:21.739> shot<00:04:21.979> recoil<00:04:22.010> by

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
see by reducing first shot recoil by

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.420 
see by reducing first shot recoil by
thirty<00:04:22.909> three<00:04:23.120> percent<00:04:23.440> so<00:04:24.440> yeah<00:04:24.650> every<00:04:25.190> bill

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
thirty three percent so yeah every bill

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.029 
thirty three percent so yeah every bill
every<00:04:26.030> barrel<00:04:26.419> excuse<00:04:26.900> me<00:04:27.110> as<00:04:27.380> much<00:04:27.740> as<00:04:27.800> it

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
every barrel excuse me as much as it

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.029 
every barrel excuse me as much as it
does<00:04:28.220> cost<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:28.760> fifty<00:04:29.060> percent<00:04:29.360> of<00:04:29.630> that

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
does cost you fifty percent of that

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.070 
does cost you fifty percent of that
least<00:04:31.039> of<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.580> angled<00:04:31.849> grip<00:04:31.849> will<00:04:32.389> help<00:04:32.659> by

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
least of the angled grip will help by

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.129 
least of the angled grip will help by
thirty-five<00:04:33.560> percent<00:04:33.789> so<00:04:34.789> it's<00:04:35.510> not<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:35.690> bad

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
thirty-five percent so it's not that bad

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.540 
thirty-five percent so it's not that bad
then<00:04:36.530> you<00:04:36.650> know<00:04:36.740> it's<00:04:37.010> like<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.130> fifteen

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
then you know it's like a fifteen

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.300 
then you know it's like a fifteen
percent<00:04:37.909> difference<00:04:38.530> so<00:04:39.530> that's<00:04:39.860> much<00:04:40.130> better

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
percent difference so that's much better

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.969 
percent difference so that's much better
than<00:04:40.520> fifty<00:04:40.880> percent<00:04:41.210> don't<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:41.599> agree<00:04:41.979> so

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
than fifty percent don't you agree so

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.560 
than fifty percent don't you agree so
that<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.729> should<00:04:43.880> definitely<00:04:44.030> could<00:04:44.270> see<00:04:44.300> so
