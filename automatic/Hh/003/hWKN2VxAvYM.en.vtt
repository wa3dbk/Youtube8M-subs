00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.980
 video today I make a video to one 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.319
 what you might already have 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.530
 can see in the title and that the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.480
 castings handkes jelly and yes that have 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.309
 I bought last time it costs to think 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.470
 I'm about six euros and me 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.300
 I was hoping for that a lot 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.500
 I think I have to email pink or something 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.140
 Seen as I watch myself from time to time 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.029
 Unite if I want to know what 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.730
 about new comes on the market and it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.039
 this is a yes as already 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.150
 it says 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.529
 That should be pure in the hair 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.660
 make because you should strassenchen 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.489
 can make and the good thing is you 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.570
 it does not have to wash out but you have to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.149
 lets in like this is for example 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.860
 this brightening space but in contrast 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.540
 to that brightening space with things yes 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.770
 that's how general they are 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.840
 could lighten if I used to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.640
 You still have to do it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.800
 go with this really targeted 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.809
 single strands marry 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.829
 and yes you either do it like that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.420
 is here on one side one 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.890
 instructions to either you can be 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.480
 whether the whole house distribute the place 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.969
 Anyway, we each a bit strange 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.770
 so i can imagine that then 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.019
 very spotty or he does it 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.180
 like me and try a few 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.229
 to marry Strahenchen and I found that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.909
 pretty So now I want to no 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.470
 blonde strands or something I want 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.990
 also make me now never seasonally 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.820
 because so i had it spring and it 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.830
 I'm just annoyed annoying because firstly 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.450
 it is so very attacking for the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.820
 hair this blond and secondly 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.799
 it will grow out looking away 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.880
 It looks pretty stupid I thought 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.710
 if I have such a light whitening 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.450
 do not let it be the same blond 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.520
 but is a level lighter or something 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.659
 then my got a little bit 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.220
 more elan if you can say so yes 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.030
 That's why I have a lot of me from that 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.890
 hopes there are two boxes or two 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.810
 versions of it once for fair hair 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.119
 and once for with blond hair 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.320
 or so , blonde hair or something and keeps 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.060
 once that I took for 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.560
 mittelblondes bistum blond hair was 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.890
 you with me more or less the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.170
 case is, look like that, then so soon 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.780
 is just a tube I have to say 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.030
 I think it's incredibly pretty, so yes 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.830
 What should I say I stand on this 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.980
 packaging so that looks a bit 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.770
 rose gold although yes it shimmers 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.000
 so here it is a bit 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.570
 reflecting the pink and looks easy 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.790
 nice summery out if so 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.620
 That's the way it is when you're alone 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.960
 really very good smells I would 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.520
 say it smells like peach or 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.080
 apricot or so very pleasant so 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.040
 not where you say now oh god that would 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.330
 I never smear my hair 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.910
 and then let the inside 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.040
 but if you put it in your hair then 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.960
 and then that interacts a bit 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.850
 this first for yourself or apricot 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.140
 smell evaporates then stays that way 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.340
 typical i know what i mean by grosz 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.190
 but you may know that from this 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.630
 brightening space, too, that's one of those 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.970
 bad musty odor I would 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.190
 So do not say such a pleasant 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.300
 smell and he stays unfortunately too 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.830
 a little bit in it but it is not so 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.510
 that there is such a huge cloud around you 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.020
 carries around and that never goes away again 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.910
 So it does not fall on yes I have 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.560
 this product as I said some 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.850
 tried and tried it 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.170
 every now and then in my hair 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.570
 incorporate 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.700
 I have to say that, in my opinion 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:12.660
 to pretty much split or very 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:16.500
 is undecided because I find that 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.019
 there is nothing or little with me 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.940
 So I brought my today 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.830
 Hair washed again fresh and 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.390
 then you see that many as if you were 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.940
 look on it you look maybe it is 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.350
 my hair is not one hundred percent one 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.060
 have color and that's exactly what 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.620
 I really wanted to and it is me 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.910
 noticed here I know some pulls 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.670
 So I think here is somehow one 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.140
 Shut the plates out of here you see 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.019
 maybe it could be that 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.750
 it is the only problem is that 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:04:02.810
 the packaging says it too is one 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:04:05.519
 infinitely adjustable when the steps 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.280
 however, a lightening in stages 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.900
 So it will not be the same dark blond 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.670
 but it gets dark a bit 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.720
 brighter still a bit brighter again 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.970
 in light and blond but it is just 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.489
 problem that you actually 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.440
 has to carry on repeatedly then 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.940
 at least with the spray always so and there 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.440
 did it work if you have it 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.970
 repeatedly applied then it is 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.320
 sometime then just this 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.680
 Brightness arrived you too 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.030
 the problem is expected and i know 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.980
 not if someone thought about it 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.940
 did l'orÃ©al if you stand 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.380
 how high is that? 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.170
 Probably that's exactly the one 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.820
 same strand finds again and herself 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.500
 exactly this same strand again 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.600
 can marry just when the effect 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.860
 not that big is that was with me 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.330
 really the problem where i say now 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.650
 I can not over it 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.690
 thought that's only me at home 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.130
 I really like this one 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.180
 find streak and how can I 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.090
 Find out if that really is 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.590
 works then started here before 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.020
 to take a strand here 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.670
 very first I know about where 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.600
 That's the same with me 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.180
 brighten up 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.390
 but I think it's incredible 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.590
 Sophisticated says yes and you leave that 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.800
 as I said in there and then you can now 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.240
 either with a hairdryer or with 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.120
 sunlight or so through the heat 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.470
 balance the sun and point the sun 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.940
 but it always works 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.919
 better and I also tried it once 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.330
 So it was the last two days 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.100
 really very sunny 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.600
 and if it does not work out then 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.800
 works as I said so until just thought 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.090
 I actually , I was really very 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.979
 very disappointed me a little bit and 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.260
 torn because actually it is yes 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.000
 what I wanted this work one 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.300
 white strands or else but me 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.790
 just wants to form a bit yes 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.440
 pure and a bit dynamic and that 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.700
 I actually have but I know 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.310
 not if I've had it before 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.479
 I also somehow convinced the feeling 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.790
 the product is not really me 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.060
 simply because it's a bit complicated 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.169
 is just always the same strand 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.430
 lighten 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.940
 and because I'm not one hundred percent 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.010
 Can say if it brings anything 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:06.850
 and because I do not believe it 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:09.160
 but it is especially good for the hair 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.930
 is logical is a blondierung it 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.100
 By the way, it is also permanent and if you are 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.150
 then look in here now for the 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.770
 I'm mine now 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.370
 I'm reading this so I'm watching 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.580
 times as a bit on the 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.950
 ingredients and 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.570
 This must be down here 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.340
 then on the pack so on the 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.430
 back enriched with 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.160
 nourishing camellia oil at summer 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.770
 Camellia oils are known for their very own 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.720
 caring properties ultimately 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.890
 just say it with caring 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.500
 oil is but if you are now 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:44.290
 times the fabrics look then you put 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:48.940
 notice that the oil is very far down 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.980
 down there I found yes at 1,234 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.440
 in the fifth row of ingredients 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.140
 is and there is always of the 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:00.940
 concentration or quantity in the 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:02.800
 Product goes is kinda logical that 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.510
 that probably not much 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:10.300
 has any sense that there anyway 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.260
 well that's my buq symbol now 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.430
 it costs six euros 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.390
 I can not do it as I said 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.620
 One hundred percent say if it something 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.690
 I brought has might is an image 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.190
 stop what you can see here what 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.500
 happened to my hair I 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:25.390
 again and again such a few strands 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:27.010
 made and yes by sun through for her 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.020
 but can not wait for it right away 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.180
 if your friend is perfect immediately 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:35.860
 result is and yes so have already 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.120
 yes basically good idea so funny 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.130
 Just think that a bit 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.590
 brighten up can because it too 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:44.229
 that's what I took respond well 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.090
 not so thoughtful with the concept 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:49.570
 that you maybe another one rove 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:51.880
 must treat again to get it right 

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:57.610
 Nice blonde to get this look

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.290
 I believe in the soundings directly 

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.370
 yes that now my opinion must 

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.870
 Just tell her that you know about it 

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.120
 Do you think you've already tried it and whether 

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:18.600
