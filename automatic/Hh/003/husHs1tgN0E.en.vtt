form kibble here really is detrimental
to<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> mode<00:01:05.150> something<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> nice

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
to the mode something that is nice

mine has a specific issue this area
right<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:18.990> I'll<00:01:19.200> talk<00:01:19.680> about<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
right here which I'll talk about in the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.679 
right here which I'll talk about in the
robot<00:01:20.400> mode<00:01:20.549> look<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.509> is

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
robot mode look a little more is

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.510 
robot mode look a little more is
incredibly<00:01:22.680> loose<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> haven't<00:01:23.340> been<00:01:23.400> able

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
incredibly loose and I haven't been able

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.609 
incredibly loose and I haven't been able
to<00:01:23.700> figure<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:23.970> how<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.240> tighten<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.930> this

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
to figure out how to tighten it and this

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.330 
to figure out how to tighten it and this
part<00:01:25.920> back<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.490> pops<00:01:26.909> off<00:01:27.180> very<00:01:27.990> easily<00:01:28.340> now

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
part back here pops off very easily now

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.520 
part back here pops off very easily now
you<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.790> store<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.299> weapons<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> top<00:01:31.229> or

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
you can store the weapons on the top or

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.550 
you can store the weapons on the top or
on<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.770> bottom<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.729> wings<00:01:33.530> they're<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
on the bottom of the wings they're a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.730 
on the bottom of the wings they're a
little<00:01:34.979> big<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> actual

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
little big for the for the actual

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.550 
little big for the for the actual
vehicle<00:01:38.579> mode<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.000> mean<00:01:39.630> they're<00:01:39.780> practically

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
vehicle mode I mean they're practically

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.700 
vehicle mode I mean they're practically
half<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.130> size<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> mode<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.689> let's<00:01:42.990> go

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
half the size of the mode so let's go

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.490 
half the size of the mode so let's go
ahead<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.009> look<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> transformation

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
ahead and look at the transformation

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.590 
ahead and look at the transformation
transformation<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:46.680> Laserbeak<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.600> pretty

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
transformation for Laserbeak is pretty

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.560 
transformation for Laserbeak is pretty
interesting<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.530> very<00:01:49.920> predictable<00:01:50.570> first

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
interesting but very predictable first

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
interesting but very predictable first
thing<00:01:51.689> we're<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.229> come<00:01:52.409> back<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
thing we're going to do is come back and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.649 
thing we're going to do is come back and
take<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> tail<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.180> pretty<00:01:54.479> much

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
take the tail and just pretty much

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.859 
take the tail and just pretty much
unfold<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.450> either<00:01:57.600> leave<00:01:57.840> it

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
unfold it and you can either leave it

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.069 
unfold it and you can either leave it
like<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.170> or<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.420> unfold<00:02:00.930> it

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
like that or you can just unfold it

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.340 
like that or you can just unfold it
straight<00:02:01.439> out<00:02:02.210> put<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.360> part<00:02:03.630> down<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.869> then

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
straight out put that part down and then

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.880 
straight out put that part down and then
fold<00:02:04.770> these<00:02:05.540> claw<00:02:06.540> bets<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.409> you've<00:02:07.710> got

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
fold these claw bets out and you've got

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.010 
fold these claw bets out and you've got
the<00:02:07.979> tail<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:08.599> next<00:02:09.599> thing<00:02:09.720> we're<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:09.959> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
the tail there next thing we're going to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.309 
the tail there next thing we're going to
do<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.410> open<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.849> V<00:02:12.150> tolls

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
do is open up the V tolls

we'll do the same thing on the other
side<00:02:29.249> now<00:02:29.969> one<00:02:30.120> thing<00:02:30.299> you<00:02:30.389> need<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.569> be

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
side now one thing you need to be

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.569 
side now one thing you need to be
careful<00:02:31.109> of<00:02:31.200> when<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.439> close<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.069> wing

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
careful of when you close that this wing

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.089 
careful of when you close that this wing
is<00:02:32.760> on<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:32.909> double<00:02:33.209> hinge<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.349> kinda

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
is on a double hinge so you kinda

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.009 
is on a double hinge so you kinda
actually<00:02:35.489> want<00:02:35.639> to<00:02:35.700> get<00:02:35.879> it<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.329> that<00:02:36.359> it<00:02:36.599> just

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
actually want to get it so that it just

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.800 
actually want to get it so that it just
closes<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.769> top<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.189> itself<00:02:38.459> like<00:02:38.609> that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
closes on top of itself like that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.440 
closes on top of itself like that
otherwise<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.989> won't<00:02:40.079> be<00:02:40.200> able<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.439> close<00:02:40.620> it

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
otherwise you won't be able to close it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.309

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
just redone and I think there's a

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.450 
just redone and I think there's a
repaint<00:04:36.930> coming<00:04:37.349> with<00:04:37.889> a<00:04:37.919> different<00:04:38.310> head

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
repaint coming with a different head

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.379 
repaint coming with a different head
maybe<00:04:38.699> it's<00:04:38.879> going<00:04:38.969> to<00:04:39.060> be<00:04:39.150> buzzsaw<00:04:39.659> but<00:04:40.469> I

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
maybe it's going to be buzzsaw but I

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.899 
maybe it's going to be buzzsaw but I
hate<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.599> head<00:04:42.860> otherwise<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.340> figure

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
stupid I'm sorry to say it's just kind

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.339 
stupid I'm sorry to say it's just kind
of<00:05:31.319> dumb<00:05:31.529> and<00:05:32.279> that<00:05:32.460> you<00:05:32.909> can<00:05:33.270> attach<00:05:34.080> it

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
underneath so that kind of works but

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.860 
underneath so that kind of works but
okay<00:05:44.699> no<00:05:45.060> no<00:05:45.870> we<00:05:46.379> didn't<00:05:46.680> see<00:05:46.889> that<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.870> don't

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.399 
the seeker the figure is actually pretty
solid<00:06:05.310> and<00:06:05.669> has<00:06:05.789> kind<00:06:06.060> of<00:06:06.150> won<00:06:06.270> me<00:06:06.419> over<00:06:06.449> if<00:06:07.229> I

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
except for the head and I think my my

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.960 
except for the head and I think my my
only<00:07:12.780> complaint<00:07:13.170> other<00:07:13.530> than<00:07:13.890> a<00:07:13.920> head<00:07:14.190> is<00:07:14.460> I

only complaint other than a head is I

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.970 
only complaint other than a head is I
think<00:07:15.420> the<00:07:15.690> vehicle<00:07:16.050> mode<00:07:16.200> is<00:07:16.350> a<00:07:16.380> little<00:07:16.680> silly

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:16.980 
think the vehicle mode is a little silly

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.820 
think the vehicle mode is a little silly
it<00:07:17.250> is<00:07:18.060> it's<00:07:18.630> not<00:07:19.050> that<00:07:19.440> great<00:07:19.800> but<00:07:20.220> otherwise

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830 
it is it's not that great but otherwise

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.350 
it is it's not that great but otherwise
otherwise<00:07:22.830> the<00:07:23.160> figures<00:07:23.490> are<00:07:23.670> definite<00:07:24.210> by

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
otherwise the figures are definite by

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.300 
otherwise the figures are definite by
and<00:07:24.750> I<00:07:24.870> would<00:07:25.020> recommend<00:07:25.590> picking<00:07:25.980> him<00:07:26.130> up

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
and I would recommend picking him up

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.710 
and I would recommend picking him up
