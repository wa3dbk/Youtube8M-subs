00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:06.390
 producer a query is good for the 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:10.740
 Heart take a glass of wine 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.870
 look makes a plastic that removes all 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.280
 the fats well that's a very good 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.850
 ask me they do it all the time 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.850
 the liabilities 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.250
 in the question of what size the cup 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:27.109
 but the truth is that the alcohol molecule 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.419
 it's the same in red wine in wine 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.000
 white in the whiskey the factor in box or 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.980
 alcohol is always of molecules by 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.769
 so what matters here is the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.710
 amount of alcohol already ok and there are many 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.720
 studies that have linked the intake 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.120
 chronic alcohol with effectively the 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.290
 decrease in cardiovascular risk 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.600
 however obviously these 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.649
 independent and also believes that the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.530
 like this manuel the same for example 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.699
 take a daily drink is effectively 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.739
 related to risk reduction 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.559
 a cup that is a quantity a cup of 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.570
 wine and also red wine because it has 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.500
 some elements that could be of 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.930
 better quality than a stan tourist and 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.390
 the important thing is that that amount of 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.430
 alcohol I drink a daily drink are 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.570
 seven drinks a week will be the same 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.370
 that I took seven as on Sunday 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.890
 and that in general is more harmful than 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.300
 have a daily drink in the amount 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.740
 alcohol has to do with the dose and 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.290
 how and how is it taken therefore 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.670
 finally what in theory any 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.250
 this thing all based on studies 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.170
 population position protects or decreases 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.960
 the risk is alcohol intake 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.010
 absolutely moderate in the form of 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.010
 then diaries 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.800
 but it has been changing 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.550
 a little bit 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.869
 problems and without good accounts 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.110
 understand that it has a protective effect 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.700
 but it is also true that alcohol 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.560
 has another effect that is very ethereal 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.450
 and if any alcohol molecule or a 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.650
 gram of the body to compare a gram 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.220
 of alcohol compared to one gram 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.770
 hydrate carbon 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.690
 nine times more calories if any 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.950
 more fat when you drink alcohol it 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.950
 first I asked nutritionist 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.220
 immediately to lose weight by 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.350
 why why does it really have 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.240
 a calorie then the protective effect 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:37.310
 of alcohol has to do with a dose 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.310
 very young to take advantage
