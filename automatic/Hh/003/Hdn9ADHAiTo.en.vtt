00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 ah 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.610
 Y 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.119
 they have links I am one on green youtube 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.700
 chile more not chilean today I find 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.610
 here to tell you a couple of things like that 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.810
 that with nothing more to say here we go 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.000
 I'll start with some deep questions 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.010
 for you you think that a president 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.380
 was born being president and a successful 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.670
 footballer was born being a soccer player or that 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.320
 a great entrepreneur was born being 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.020
 entrepreneur the answer is much more than 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.810
 obviously not so you tell me a great youtube 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.500
 A successful youtuber was born being successful 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.030
 au definitely naps definitely not 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.100
 but because I find myself saying this 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.199
 have something that bothers me a lot and I do not 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.789
 only in this channel but I've seen it 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.100
 in many channels are those typical 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.559
 comments that say you are coated with 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.120
 that holder already said it in another 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.120
 youtube on youtube 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.530
 and the last sentence that he personally is 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.900
 the one that hurts me the most because you feel like 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.090
 they are sending you to keep centimeter 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.280
 by centimeter I'm sorry I only see such 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 why it hurts personally one makes a 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.150
 attempt to rise up but that guy 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.150
 of people do not allow it 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.510
 you really believe that those subscribers 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.070
 you really think those youtubers of 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.990
 which you speak to me left with 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.150
 so large numbers clear that no 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.250
 they started with 10 then with 100 then 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.780
 with 1000 up to where they are and not 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.610
 I'm saying that this is the best 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.350
 YouTube channel neither am I 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 speaking for me I'm talking about all 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.910
 those little channels that I've seen is 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.280
 100 of 500 thousand subscribers and that 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.050
 I personally find them so good and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.149
 even better than the big ones 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.490
 absolutely everyone deserves 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.790
 an opportunity do not discard a channel by 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.460
 have 10 50 or 100 subscribers believe me 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.930
 that this channel that everyone despises 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.940
 You may be surprised if you are 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.280
 you decide to help sharing your videos 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.319
 every time you go up that channel you can get 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.469
 to be great 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.209
 50 subscribers can easily be 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.189
 get to convert to 100,000 and even 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.290
 much more is a simple reaction in 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.999
 chain in what shared another saw it to 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.159
 she liked it and if there is something that you do not 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.870
 liked of this video comment it the 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.849
 youtuber will always want you to pin it 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.859
 to make the best possible content and 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.450
 not for him but for you who 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:33.980
 they are there behind your screen 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.870
 you understand, you ignore the power that 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.219
 they have in their hands a single 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.260
 share a simple action can 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.599
 change a whole world and in this case 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.730
 a whole channel so from now on 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.189
 Take your time and observe before 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.659
 say any stupidity and good this 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.069
 it's a video I wanted to do a long time ago 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.900
 but I was presented with different 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.299
 problems that really hit me 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.980
 strong more I was not going to give up here 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.870
 my relief arrives but if you are 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.939
 subscriber and youtube habitual seer 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.129
 keep watching the video instead if you 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.079
 you find yourself watching this video and you do not have 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.329
 no fucking idea what the channel is about 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.310
 you have two options one to investigate in the 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.169
 channel and see our different gameplays 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.000
 and surely more than one will make you laugh or 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:15.099
 two you can reflect on what you 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.099
 I just said thank you for watching and closing 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.780
 close it and for my people the crumbs 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.760
 lately there have been many problems 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.560
 around these places and I talk about so many 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.110
 personal problems like the channel 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.300
 I was about to give up on things 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.490
 that they were going to me to point but I did not 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.230
 I did not even notice and I was already editing a 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.540
 new video for you I think it's 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.310
 something that relaxes me and obviously something that 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.200
 I like to do also have up 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.000
 thanks to all your messages in my 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.890
 personal facebook and really 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.830
 I thank each of you never 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.620
 before in the life of the channel I thought only about 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.390
 me but from this point I'm thinking 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.370
 in doing everything that was once 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.070
 promised as in questions and answers 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.410
 romÃ¡n live etcetera completely alone 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.510
 since this is a responsibility to the 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.550
 which I must answer so for these 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.380
 days I clear and traveling the world 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.600
 and by the time I get back 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.270
 I promise to focus more on you as a 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.090
 channel that promises and answers if you have 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.160
 good gear and remember if you liked this 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.320
 video or the previous 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.510
 or the one before that you can help us 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.280
 sharing any video whatsoever 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.230
 I really felt very helpful, not you 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.000
 forget to comment and leave your opinion 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.770
 down here not on the floor in the box and if 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.050
 for those things in life you would like 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.890
 to talk about something in this style alone 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.900
 a comment 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.630
 I'll keep it in mind so with nothing else 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.020
 to say I am one and from your laptop 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:45.660
 tablet smartphone or where do I fuck 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.660
 are you watching I tell you until next time 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:06.110
 A) Yes 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.110
