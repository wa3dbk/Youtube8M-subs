00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.399
 if they do not match, delete the file with 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.630
 your file 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.909
 rename well and finally transfer it 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.820

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.119

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.670
 and now admire the image if you 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.579
 done correctly you should 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.100
 turn out now you can hang this 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.930
 map on the wall for this we first 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.890
 we hang a frame 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.980
 but what if you want a picture 1 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.710
 2 blocks or better TV two 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.590
 on three blocks the output is something simple 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.420
 you share your picture and share photoshop 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.880
 required number of parts 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.300
 then save everything as said 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.709
 previously, however, remember that first you 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.980
 must use the cards in the game itself 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:37.140
 the number of cards with is the number of pictures and input 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.070
