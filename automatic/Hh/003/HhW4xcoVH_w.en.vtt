00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.020 
I have here under lists and it's all in
French<00:01:49.350> right<00:01:49.680> now<00:01:49.890> which<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.369> another<00:01:50.640> thing

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
French right now which is another thing

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.899 
French right now which is another thing
but<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.600> ultimately<00:01:52.549> that<00:01:53.549> doesn't

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
but you know ultimately that doesn't

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.880 
but you know ultimately that doesn't
matter<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.540> far<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.020> demonstration<00:01:55.590> is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
matter as far as this demonstration is

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.940 
matter as far as this demonstration is
concerned<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:57.390> real<00:01:57.689> exciting<00:01:58.649> thing<00:01:58.920> about

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
concerned the real exciting thing about

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.530 
concerned the real exciting thing about
this<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> fact<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.000> you'll<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.360> this

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
this is the fact that you'll have this

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.350 
this is the fact that you'll have this
nice<00:02:01.130> display<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.759> used<00:02:03.060> for

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
nice display that can be used for

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.300 
nice display that can be used for
instance<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.990> car<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.770> don't<00:02:04.950> even<00:02:05.040> have

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
instance in a car so you don't even have

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.670 
instance in a car so you don't even have
to<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.939> theory<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:07.020> don't<00:02:07.170> even<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.469> to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
to in theory you don't even have to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.589 
to in theory you don't even have to
replace<00:02:08.039> your<00:02:08.190> head<00:02:08.459> unit<00:02:08.849> what<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.179> could<00:02:09.360> do

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
replace your head unit what you could do

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.470 
replace your head unit what you could do
in<00:02:09.840> theory<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:11.310> basically

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
in theory is to basically

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.869 
in theory is to basically
your<00:02:12.900> iPhone<00:02:13.409> or<00:02:13.620> your<00:02:13.709> iPad<00:02:14.190> directly<00:02:14.730> in

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
your iPhone or your iPad directly in

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.880 
your iPhone or your iPad directly in
your<00:02:14.940> car<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.569> then<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.050> have<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.409> benefit

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
your car and then you have the benefit

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.660 
your car and then you have the benefit
of<00:02:16.920> having<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.540> carplay<00:02:19.080> interface

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
of having the the carplay interface

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.640 
of having the the carplay interface
without<00:02:20.670> having<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.450> buy<00:02:21.690> an<00:02:21.900> expensive<00:02:22.170> head

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
without having to buy an expensive head

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.009 
without having to buy an expensive head
unit<00:02:22.980> now<00:02:23.129> that<00:02:23.310> kind<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.970> guess<00:02:24.540> sort<00:02:24.840> of

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
unit now that kind of I guess sort of

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.630 
unit now that kind of I guess sort of
defeats<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.470> purpose<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.950> having<00:02:26.129> that<00:02:26.400> nice

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
defeats the purpose of having that nice

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.630 
defeats the purpose of having that nice
head<00:02:26.879> unit<00:02:27.209> already<00:02:27.390> mounted<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:28.110> your<00:02:28.230> car

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
head unit already mounted in your car

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.479 
head unit already mounted in your car
properly<00:02:29.640> mounted<00:02:30.150> properly<00:02:31.310> installed<00:02:32.310> in

properly mounted properly installed in
your<00:02:32.519> car<00:02:33.019> but<00:02:34.019> if<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.860> don't<00:02:35.040> want<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> shell

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
your car but if you don't want to shell

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.949 
your car but if you don't want to shell
out<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.580> money<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:36.180> those<00:02:36.239> expensive<00:02:36.810> head

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
out the money for those expensive head

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.740 
out the money for those expensive head
units<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.410> they<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.650> run<00:02:37.860> between<00:02:38.400> 500<00:02:39.299> up<00:02:39.569> to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
units and they can run between 500 up to

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.110 
units and they can run between 500 up to
$1,000<00:02:40.680> then<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> good<00:02:42.000> alternative

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
$1,000 then this is a good alternative

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.479 
$1,000 then this is a good alternative
it<00:02:42.659> gives<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> nice<00:02:43.170> big<00:02:43.500> icons<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.400> a

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
it gives you a nice big icons it's a

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.860 
it gives you a nice big icons it's a
perfect<00:02:44.940> size<00:02:45.390> for<00:02:46.160> navigating<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:48.780> know

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
perfect size for navigating and you know

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.080 
perfect size for navigating and you know
working<00:02:49.410> inside<00:02:50.129> your<00:02:50.400> car<00:02:50.640> without<00:02:50.910> having

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
working inside your car without having

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.300 
working inside your car without having
to<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.660> too<00:02:51.870> distracted<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.650> hopefully<00:02:53.069> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
to be too distracted and hopefully the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.460 
to be too distracted and hopefully the
Siri<00:02:53.609> integration<00:02:53.819> which<00:02:54.329> is<00:02:54.359> really<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.200> big

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
Siri integration which is really the big

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.619 
Siri integration which is really the big
feature<00:02:55.799> of<00:02:55.950> carplay<00:02:56.489> will<00:02:56.849> eventually<00:02:57.390> be

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
feature of carplay will eventually be

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.559 
feature of carplay will eventually be
found<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.620> here<00:02:58.829> as<00:02:58.950> well<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.579> it's<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.450> a

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
found in here as well so it's it's a

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.750 
found in here as well so it's it's a
definite<00:03:00.989> step<00:03:01.200> in<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.440> right<00:03:01.590> direction<00:03:01.799> not

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
definite step in the right direction not

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.210 
definite step in the right direction not
although<00:03:03.090> all<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.569> way<00:03:03.660> there<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:04.290> yet<00:03:04.560> but

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
although all the way there just yet but

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.039 
although all the way there just yet but
a<00:03:05.400> definite<00:03:06.150> step<00:03:06.359> in<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.690> right<00:03:06.840> direction

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
a definite step in the right direction

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.559 
a definite step in the right direction
and<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.530> think<00:03:07.700> especially<00:03:08.700> if<00:03:09.060> Adam<00:03:09.359> bells

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
and I think especially if Adam bells

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.150 
and I think especially if Adam bells
working<00:03:09.900> on<00:03:10.019> this<00:03:10.170> who<00:03:10.319> is<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.500> very<00:03:10.920> well-known

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160
