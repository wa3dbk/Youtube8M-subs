00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 The body guides everything well that it has

 I hope everything is fine 11 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.080
 I'll talk to you a little about the effect of 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.590
 late shine bath spoken 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.770
 looking in the mirror is also me 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.699
 spoken there on my page in the face that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.529
 is below the video is about 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.199
 bath that had made these 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.160
 days including recorded step 4 to 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.559
 but the camera simply disappears a 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.820
 invitation at the time I was put in the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.100
 computer 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.120
 she recorded a part of the goal I did not see 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.210
 So let's go here, the goal is over. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.879
 I will also talk to you're step 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.700
 bastard like I did 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.539
 and you will understand why it is super easy 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.090
 first the brightening bath for those who 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.629
 he recommend it is recommended for 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.680
 people who have not got so much hair 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.960
 white because it's the truth competing 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 time it goes cream it also will not 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.630
 reach your hair in a way too 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.299
 stay and you teacher who want to give a 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.520
 more shine in hair when hair 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.460
 becomes more opaque or else who 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.920
 it paints when it comes back to color 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.560
 field is not indicated 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.810
 these people who want to give 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.210
 result but hair color 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.880
 First of all, what did I do? I washed. 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.220
 in hair with anti-waste type shampoo 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.939
 A little bit on my blog is also on 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.390
 low 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.329
 the link I did a post about the shampoo 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.420
 anti-waste and was thus a breakthrough 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.159
 Because it 's a boy, he did not have me. 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.799
 sent an email asking about the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.290
 shampoo that I thought I did not have 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.680
 formed opinion that I had used 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.299
 still as a constancy then the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.579
 What I did, I decided to do a thorough search. 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.850
 about this type of shampoo 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:07.140
 it removes the excess accumulation of 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.670
 substances in the new hair as cream 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.009
 is the day that builds up and 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.250
 impregnated our in our hair 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.830
 The second one is simply stripped. 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.020
 because it makes a lot more cleaning 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.920
 deep in the children, right? 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:27.959
 he has a lower pH and so he 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:31.070
 withdraws all right and the accumulation of 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.890
 wire strands hair substance 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:38.190
 Then you can ask me but what only? 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.770
 can residue has to see when you wash 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.739
 eduardo flavored hair scales 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.290
 It opens up so much more that you go 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.690
 realize that hair looks good but I know 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.890
 When will I be washing right with this? 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.780
 type of shampoo 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.220
 There you will wash and you will open the scales. 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.700
 of hair 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.970
 with that once we got there you will not 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.450
 will pass the conditioner is still like this 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.280
 highly recommended to make a hydration 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.000
 after silvio called had lived 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.019
 but in this case we opened from the bed of the 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.840
 for the product with electra mother in the 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.000
 if our compound it that we 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.090
 we made for the brightening bath 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.579
 ok and it runs the open field 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.910
 product will penetrate more hair like 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.190
 contains cream will also treat and due 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.019
 the painting goes also gives a glow 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.239
 special to the head 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.820
 so let's go the step by step as 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.329
 then do step by step what I did 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.430
 here on my dog grandma was the 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.350
 The next I washed with shampoo 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:53.850
 Then I prepared mine. 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:56.880
 little bowl I prepared 66 portion of red 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.980
 time to the pen of my hair already in black I 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.769
 I got the black ink it has to be 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.220
 exactly the tone that a column is the 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.310
 goal is not to change hair color 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.799
 The objective is to give only in a bath of 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.989
 shine with my own name right? 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.390
 depending on the size of your hair if 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.000
 For a lot of hair and if it's great you 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.750
 can use 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.290
 the entire tube of ink you have in it 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:27.220
 mixed to cream with apparel 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:29.160
 I got a balloon and my size 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.790
 hair even more now that I cut it 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.250
 half the ink law still has one more 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.720
 part to apply to do in another 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.430
 application 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:46.080
 so I took half the paint plus the 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:49.900
 even so much moisturizer 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.480
 half the amount of paint and the same amount of 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.890
 put of paint you put of cream 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.580
 moisturizing 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.840
 Then you 'll mix what you can. 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.960
 add also you can add 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.650
 a little bit just a few spoons and 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.669
 olive oil from extra olive oil 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.240
 virgin 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:16.360
 It still shines brighter 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.870
 Then you 'll do what you're going to do. 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:24.340
 in your entire hair does not need to make a 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.350
 that massage movement is when 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.050
 when one is not okay for us 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.140
 they will not splash cream for everything 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.160
 that you then spent the blend in the 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.120
 hair 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.850
 You'll wait for 30 minutes to leave. 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.330
 resting for 30 minutes 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.510
 The mixture in your hair is soon in 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.550
 when you spend within 30 minutes 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.160
 can wash normally 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.280
 There's no need to pass the shampoo, you're alone. 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.070
 pull the mentor's hair tie with 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.890
 said the motor simply you pull 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.160
 I like hair and hit the computer and which one 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.800
 the frequency is indicated to make me as 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.930
 I like to wear anything I'm very 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.780
 Nature does not like darwin I do not like 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.400
 to take medicine for a thing I know I 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.350
 I need to take I take when I 'm 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.060
 needing but I'm kind of in your lead 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.030
 that I can take when natural I 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.210
 I prefer to do I 'm duck that bath of 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.009
 brightness when I have my 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.580
 It's already getting crowded without color without 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:30.060
 life 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:34.819
 knows the fact and look at the result 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:36.479
 How cool is your hair? 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:39.780
 briozzo 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:42.419
 So you see, you take care of it. 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.720
 not to do too close to each other 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:47.720
 Why do you have some ink on it? 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.610
 how easy and simple 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.259
 I washed it with anti-waste shampoo if you 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.199
 not because she can not wash to do 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:59.009
 this normal and persecuted washing 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.750
 mix in half 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:02.880
 and half a cream 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.139
 if your hair is too large or 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.440
 very good on the hill 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:10.889
 mix an entire paint tube 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.270
 but the same measure of cream 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:16.139
 hydration
