00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and we'll be using red snow it's

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.310 
and we'll be using red snow it's
basically<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.610> very<00:00:41.730> easy<00:00:42.270> program<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.260> know

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
basically a very easy program and I know

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.260 
basically a very easy program and I know
this<00:00:43.530> may<00:00:43.680> seem<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.920> little<00:00:44.010> bit<00:00:44.280> confusing<00:00:44.399> but

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
this may seem a little bit confusing but

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.850 
this may seem a little bit confusing but
if<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.510> were<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.719> yes<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.230> would<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.680> this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
if I were you yes I would do this

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.229 
if I were you yes I would do this
there's<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.370> much<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
there's so much you can do with a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.810 
there's so much you can do with a
jailbreak<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.899> iOS<00:00:49.350> 6<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.770> using<00:00:50.280> red<00:00:50.460> snow<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
jailbreak on iOS 6 and using red snow is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.459 
jailbreak on iOS 6 and using red snow is
probably<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.300> easiest<00:00:51.449> way<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.960> jailbreak

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
