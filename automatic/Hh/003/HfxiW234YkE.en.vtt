00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.700
 here 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.670
 small infiltration problem 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.189
 in a c4 picasso so for this one 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.130
 it's a big model 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:23.169
 so little problem so note on 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.090
 a forum an infiltration of rainwater 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:29.829
 in the passenger compartment for 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.119
 start you see it's wet 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.030
 it's been three times, but 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.270
 good usually the level is pretty much 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:43.100
 close 5 6 cm below the carpet 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:47.810
 so the water comes from behind the box 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.030
 to gloves so I found on a forum 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.790
 which in fact there was a flapper that 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.720
 was stuck so they say from 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.720
 disassemble the front wheel 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:05.659
 then remove the mudguards and 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.729
 behind the mudguards one will find 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.180
 surely the flapper must be here I 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.270
 will start to disassemble 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.399
 here is the wheel is dismounted 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:23.479
 now you have to remove the mudguard 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:27.229
 so apparently there is some clipping a 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:32.749
 little bit everywhere so I'll start then 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:34.850
 we'll see then that's the system of 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:39.049
 clip this with a slide screwdriver 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:49.520
 below pulled towards us and it depends and 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:51.829
 it comes off quietly here 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.710
 then I can not pull the 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:02:08.390
 mudguard is actually several 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:11.799
 vices to undo below so here I have 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:18.110
 two managed to multiply the mudguard is 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:20.629
 actually the surprise and here it is 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.920
 piece that was advertised on the internet of 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:29.930
 blow and here it's all 26 days so 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.319
 I will have to demonstrate this 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.319
 piece then on some sites they 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.670
 say they did not hand it 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.380
 but hey I think I'll 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.549
 put back she cleaned up and then put it back 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.549
 we will see 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.560
 alright here's actually I just shoot 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.180
 on it and it fell right away 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:57.400
 so here we see the problem the 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:01.239
 clap is completely clogged 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.819
 so there is more to clean up to omit 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.480
 so here I handed all the elements 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.049
 in place 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.569
 it did not take very long 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.250
 a little twenty minutes of time 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.329
 to take out the material to disassemble the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.790
 wheel I advise you to do it yourself 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.220
 even because at citroen apparently 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.799
 on the forums it's at least 150 euros 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.560
 and as you saw it was not very 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.209
 complicated to do so I 'm even going in 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.780
 enjoy to do the other side because 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.010
 that honestly hey it's more 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.180
 nice to have your feet dry in 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.700
 his car that wet feet 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.700
 that's a good DIY
