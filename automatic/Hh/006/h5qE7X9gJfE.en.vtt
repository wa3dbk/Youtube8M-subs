00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.509
 Let's make this lost video together 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:12.700
 Who is the event that own Scar block not yet joined 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:15.550
 If you want to participate, please look at the recruitment video from the explanation column 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:20.710
 Then please go to the main story 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:26.160
 Let's make everyone very much Hello Aqua this time 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.160
 I participated in a project called Self-made Sky Block 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:38.200
 When the play-by-play who say or woody what planning is building one person one his own island in the air 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.560
 It becomes a kind of content 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.560
 So let's make immediately 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.710
 Hmm 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.710
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 Hmm 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:55.730
 Yes I moved to the sky block world 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.730
 I already made the foundation and the statement 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:06.570
 It's okay, because subtitles will surely work well 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.570
 Perhaps 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.010
 At first we build pillar with cobblestone 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.500
 Hmm 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.230
 Hmm 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.220
 We had 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.640
 not 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.650
 That's right, because it's not the main story 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.650
 You can make it without worrying about it 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.480
 Hmm 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.690
 wh 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.690
 I'm wall-clad because the pillar is over 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:53.490
 I do not know how to use so much because it is a unique color of acacia 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:02:00.869
 What kind of architecture do you use acacia wood agents for ? 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.680
 Some people that are using the Western-style building Is or Hata also Japanese-style architecture or modern architecture 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.850
 Hey 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.399
 I would like to know for future study of architecture 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.360
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.420
 I surround the part of the cobble with stone brick 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.420
 eh 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:26.370
 In fact, this building is a draft plan for a building that I planned to establish in the world I am doing 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.790
 right 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:35.750
 Issue but because I thought also wasteful say not issued in this state video on this project 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.750
 I decided to 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.980
 Sale 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.980
 I hope some other drafts will come out in the video someday 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.640
 Hmm 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:55.530
 I'm sorry and don't worry 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.530
 It is impossible because it is serious 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.030
 There 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.030
 Hmm 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:12.609
 I'm doing Yuka Hari The floor will be like black and white already familiar 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:18.599
 At this time there was no ground below 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:18.599
 It remains in the impression that Yuka Hari was very hard 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:30.030
 I am making the interior 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.900
 It was easy because the exterior etc. was built in Test World, but the interior was not handed out at all 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.350
 Because 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:41.180
 We are in a haphazard 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:43.690
 At first, this building is a setting of ruins, so I would like to decorate it, but still difficult 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.690
 is not it 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:04:00.360
 Whether I'm ruins it is nice and certainly there is also a strong place, but that beautiful 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.360
 The combination of ruins and light is the best if there is something to be attracted like this 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.910
 Hmm 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.670
 Hmm 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.670
 me 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:27.479
 I managed to finish it 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.479
 It is such a feeling from the front 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.740
 It's like this from other angles 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.740
 Hmm 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.210
 Please understand that you are not good at rotating 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.860
 Next is the introduction of the interior 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.060
 It looks like this 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.060
 I have zombies 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.060
 Hmm 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:23.110
 I wonder why I thought that the atmosphere is out, I wonder why the plateau was reduced 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.110
 It leaves increase plateau after 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:36.240
 At first it is introduction of left room 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:39.330
 It is a chair and a table, and both furniture are being broken over time 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:43.759
 The theme is ruined, so various furniture 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.759
 It's about time and it's getting broken 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.980
 Hmm 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:06:00.819
 The following is an introduction to the work room on the right 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:06:00.819
 This is a workbench and there are stoves and chess here 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.740
 Here to Anne There is a field 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.949
 Next is the introduction of the terrace 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.060
 Hmm 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.040
 Hmm 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.040
 Hmm 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:31.340
 This chest is like a treasure chest 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.340
 Well the contents are known though 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.050
 Next is the introduction of the terrace on the other side 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:42.129
 Hmm 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:48.779
 I moved to the terrace on the other side 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:48.779
 There is nothing here except for the chest as well. 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.060
 It concludes the introduction of here more 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:07.960
 Now my turn is the end so successfully completed 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:14.500
 I was nervous at the first project but it was fun 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:19.390
 Thank you very much for watching it. 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.540
 It is such a video, but I'm glad if I see it again 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.370
 eh 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.680
 Hmm 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:28.960
