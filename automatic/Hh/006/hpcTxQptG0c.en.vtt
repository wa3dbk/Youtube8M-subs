00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
looks like right to the end of the scale

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.980 
looks like right to the end of the scale
and<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.370> scale<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:01.790> about<00:03:01.880> 12<00:03:02.330> inches

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.420

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
probably go a little bit past it but

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.390 
probably go a little bit past it but
that<00:03:07.580> is<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.730> big<00:03:07.940> old<00:03:08.120> hunk<00:03:08.390> of<00:03:08.510> silver<00:03:09.400> all

we'll<00:03:29.690> see<00:03:29.900> how<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.080> e-track<00:03:30.470> goes<00:03:31.150> I'll<00:03:32.150> set

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
we'll see how the e-track goes I'll set

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.230 
we'll see how the e-track goes I'll set
that<00:03:32.600> up<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.870> get<00:03:32.960> back<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:34.060> okay

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:32.430 
the e-track looks like I call that
diggable<00:04:25.280> at<00:04:25.520> nine<00:04:25.760> and<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.060> half<00:04:30.250> possibly<00:04:31.250> ten

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
diggable at nine and a half possibly ten

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:42.640 
diggable at nine and a half possibly ten
so<00:04:33.440> we're<00:04:33.620> coming<00:04:33.830> up<00:04:34.070> a<00:04:34.160> half<00:04:34.400> inch<00:04:34.640> shy<00:04:35.590> limit

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.520 

yeah<00:04:44.000> diggable<00:04:45.000> between<00:04:45.930> nine<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.500> half

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
yeah diggable between nine and a half

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.290 
yeah diggable between nine and a half
and<00:04:46.919> ten<00:04:47.100> so<00:04:47.340> we're<00:04:47.490> coming<00:04:47.639> up<00:04:47.760> a<00:04:47.940> half<00:04:48.120> inch

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
and ten so we're coming up a half inch

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.460 
and ten so we're coming up a half inch
shy<00:04:48.690> of<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.080> CTX<00:04:51.080> actually<00:04:52.080> I'm<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.230> little

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.740 
shy of the CTX actually I'm a little
surprised<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:53.100> didn't<00:04:53.340> buy<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.550> CTX<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.600> get

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
surprised I didn't buy the CTX to get

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.220 
surprised I didn't buy the CTX to get
more<00:04:54.990> depth<00:04:56.210> bought<00:04:57.210> it<00:04:57.360> for<00:04:57.540> all<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.930> extra

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
going to be really jumpy I don't know if

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:35.480 
going to be really jumpy I don't know if
I<00:06:26.130> dig<00:06:26.430> it<00:06:33.410> but<00:06:34.410> it<00:06:34.590> is<00:06:34.740> definitely<00:06:34.919> hitting<00:06:35.340> it

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
I dig it but it is definitely hitting it

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.540 
I dig it but it is definitely hitting it

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
to see this so that's why I did it and I

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.610 
to see this so that's why I did it and I

gotta say I'm pretty pleased with the
outcome<00:07:08.650> I<00:07:10.529> was<00:07:11.529> really<00:07:11.860> just<00:07:12.069> hoping<00:07:12.490> that

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
outcome I was really just hoping that

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.929 
outcome I was really just hoping that
the<00:07:12.759> CTX<00:07:13.300> would<00:07:13.539> do<00:07:13.749> just<00:07:14.169> as<00:07:14.379> good<00:07:14.469> as<00:07:14.949> the

00:07:15.929 --> 00:07:15.939 
the CTX would do just as good as the

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:20.279 
the CTX would do just as good as the
e-track<00:07:17.520> but<00:07:18.520> now<00:07:18.669> I<00:07:18.699> see<00:07:19.059> it<00:07:19.270> is<00:07:19.300> a<00:07:19.719> little<00:07:20.169> bit

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:20.289 
e-track but now I see it is a little bit

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:23.129 
e-track but now I see it is a little bit
better<00:07:20.499> at<00:07:21.189> least<00:07:21.490> on<00:07:21.639> the<00:07:21.729> air<00:07:21.879> test<00:07:22.240> not<00:07:22.930> to

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:23.139 
better at least on the air test not to

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:25.469 
better at least on the air test not to
say<00:07:23.319> it's<00:07:23.499> better<00:07:24.460> on<00:07:24.580> the<00:07:24.759> ground<00:07:24.789> yet<00:07:25.270> I'll

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479
