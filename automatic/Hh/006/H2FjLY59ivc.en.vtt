00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
have that's expanding the steam universe

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.080 
have that's expanding the steam universe
so<00:02:00.030> when<00:02:00.299> i<00:02:00.329> first<00:02:00.689> heard<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:02.090> steam

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
so when i first heard of this steam

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.120 
so when i first heard of this steam
group<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> steam<00:02:04.049> universe<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.740> didn't

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
group for the steam universe I didn't

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.800 
group for the steam universe I didn't
think<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.759> official<00:02:06.329> because<00:02:06.570> when<00:02:06.719> you

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
think it was official because when you

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.540 
think it was official because when you
actually<00:02:06.960> look<00:02:07.380> at<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.680> groups<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.280> are<00:02:08.459> in

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
actually look at the groups that are in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.609 
actually look at the groups that are in
the<00:02:08.640> steam<00:02:08.849> community<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.509> not<00:02:09.959> listed<00:02:10.289> as

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the steam community it's not listed as

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.210 
the steam community it's not listed as
enough<00:02:10.920> fish

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
enough fish

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.120 
enough fish
group<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:12.210> I<00:02:12.240> did<00:02:12.420> some<00:02:12.540> research<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.950> was

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
group so I did some research and it was

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.600 
group so I did some research and it was
created<00:02:14.670> by<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> guy<00:02:15.420> named<00:02:15.780> Eric<00:02:15.990> hope

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
created by a guy named Eric hope

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.460 
created by a guy named Eric hope
supposedly<00:02:17.610> who<00:02:18.390> goes<00:02:18.780> by<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:18.990> user<00:02:19.230> name

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
supposedly who goes by the user name

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.940 
supposedly who goes by the user name
axiom<00:02:20.190> he<00:02:21.120> also<00:02:21.240> went<00:02:21.450> by<00:02:21.570> no<00:02:21.630> escape<00:02:22.140> Eric

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
axiom he also went by no escape Eric

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.920 
axiom he also went by no escape Eric
hope<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.400> man<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.820> works<00:02:24.090> at<00:02:24.270> valve<00:02:24.630> and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
hope is a man that works at valve and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.460 
hope is a man that works at valve and
axiom<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:26.240> connected<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.750> actual<00:02:28.110> Eric

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
axiom is connected to the actual Eric

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.380 
axiom is connected to the actual Eric
hope<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.160> do<00:02:29.280> think<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.730> that's<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.270> guy

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
hope so I do think that that's the guy

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.510 
hope so I do think that that's the guy
unless<00:02:30.570> he<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.290> uh<00:02:31.320> there's<00:02:32.160> someone<00:02:32.370> like

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
unless he is uh there's someone like

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.160 
unless he is uh there's someone like
impersonating<00:02:33.120> him<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.870> does<00:02:33.990> tell<00:02:34.140> me

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
impersonating him so it does tell me

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.540 
impersonating him so it does tell me
that<00:02:34.380> someone<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:34.710> valve<00:02:34.950> did<00:02:35.160> create<00:02:35.430> this

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
that someone at valve did create this

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.610 
that someone at valve did create this
group<00:02:35.790> which<00:02:36.000> means<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.510> could<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:37.410> an

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
group which means it could be an

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.370 
group which means it could be an
official<00:02:37.980> group<00:02:38.160> down<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.910> line<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:40.170> want

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
conspiracy theories because I've been

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.740 
conspiracy theories because I've been
researching<00:02:55.740> this<00:02:56.160> stuff<00:02:56.550> like<00:02:57.030> all<00:02:57.240> day<00:02:57.540> long

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
I'm good like the media cows guys except

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.520 
I'm good like the media cows guys except
for<00:03:01.950> Tom<00:03:02.130> Tom<00:03:02.430> agrees<00:03:02.700> with<00:03:02.880> me<00:03:03.530> somewhat

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
for Tom Tom agrees with me somewhat

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.170 
for Tom Tom agrees with me somewhat
thinks<00:03:05.220> they<00:03:05.670> think<00:03:05.880> I'm<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.120> crazy

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
thinks they think I'm going crazy

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.590 
thinks they think I'm going crazy
because<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.930> believe<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:08.070> ps4<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.880> the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
because I believe that the ps4 is the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.510 
because I believe that the ps4 is the
steam<00:03:09.870> box<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.470> don't<00:03:10.860> think<00:03:10.920> valve<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.370> making

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
steam box I don't think valve is making

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.550 
steam box I don't think valve is making
any<00:03:11.790> hardware<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.510> i<00:03:12.780> realize<00:03:13.140> i'm<00:03:13.290> making

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
any hardware and i realize i'm making

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.780 
any hardware and i realize i'm making
this<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.920> probably<00:03:14.100> going<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.459> be<00:03:14.520> proven

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
this and probably going to be proven

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.240 
this and probably going to be proven
wrong<00:03:14.970> today<00:03:15.630> when<00:03:16.350> valve<00:03:16.709> announces

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
wrong today when valve announces

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.890 
wrong today when valve announces
hardware<00:03:17.610> but<00:03:18.030> valves<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.390> software<00:03:18.780> company

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
hardware but valves a software company

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.050 
hardware but valves a software company
they<00:03:19.590> were<00:03:19.650> researching<00:03:20.070> hardware<00:03:20.550> but

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
they were researching hardware but

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.280 
they were researching hardware but
they've<00:03:21.180> never<00:03:21.300> released<00:03:21.660> hardware<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.230> they

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
they've never released hardware and they

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.720 
they've never released hardware and they
don't<00:03:22.380> have<00:03:22.530> any<00:03:22.650> experience<00:03:23.250> sending<00:03:23.640> that

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
don't have any experience sending that

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.520 
don't have any experience sending that
hardware<00:03:24.090> out<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:24.959> i<00:03:24.989> think<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.320> they're

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
hardware out so i think that they're

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.530 
hardware out so i think that they're
just<00:03:25.739> partnering<00:03:26.220> with<00:03:26.250> people<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.269> think

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
just partnering with people and I think

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.960 
just partnering with people and I think
