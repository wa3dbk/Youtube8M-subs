as possible don't forget to measure
accurately<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:23.160> make<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> next<00:00:23.609> step<00:00:23.730> easier

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
accurately to make the next step easier

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.990 
accurately to make the next step easier
and<00:00:24.769> that<00:00:25.769> next<00:00:26.130> step<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.580> cut<00:00:26.880> your

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
and that next step is to cut your

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.150 
and that next step is to cut your
materials<00:00:27.539> we'll<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.170> using<00:00:28.289> copper<00:00:28.980> and

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
materials we'll be using copper and

next up is to use a divider that will

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.030 
next up is to use a divider that will
mark<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> lines<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.390> sawn<00:00:54.890> before<00:00:55.890> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
other piece of copper next we drill a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.580 
other piece of copper next we drill a
hole<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.819> acrylic<00:01:57.209> for<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> bail<00:02:00.890> and

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
hole in the acrylic for the bail and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.169 
hole in the acrylic for the bail and
then<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:04.739> go<00:02:04.890> straight<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.459> the<00:02:05.489> making<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
then we go straight to the making of the

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.029 
then we go straight to the making of the
bill<00:02:06.329> itself<00:02:06.509> which<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.319> case<00:02:07.379> is<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
bill itself which in this case is just a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.080 
bill itself which in this case is just a
piece<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.250> wire<00:02:10.160> first<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.430> use<00:02:11.579> a<00:02:11.609> torch<00:02:12.030> to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
piece of wire first we use a torch to

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.830 
piece of wire first we use a torch to
ball<00:02:12.600> up<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.900> end<00:02:13.019> of<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> wire<00:02:14.329> then<00:02:15.329> insert

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
ball up the end of the wire then insert

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.660 
ball up the end of the wire then insert
the<00:02:15.989> wire<00:02:16.139> into<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.620> draw<00:02:16.920> plate<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.459> Hammer

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the wire into a draw plate and Hammer

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.080 
the wire into a draw plate and Hammer
the<00:02:17.880> end<00:02:18.030> flat<00:02:19.100> this<00:02:20.100> flat<00:02:20.430> part<00:02:20.730> will<00:02:20.880> be<00:02:21.000> on

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the end flat this flat part will be on

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.920 
the end flat this flat part will be on
the<00:02:21.239> inside<00:02:25.310> then<00:02:26.310> use<00:02:26.609> the<00:02:26.790> pliers<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.540> bend

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
the inside then use the pliers to bend

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.949 
the inside then use the pliers to bend

making it a bail the final step is to

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.960 
making it a bail the final step is to
stack<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.470> pieces<00:02:37.799> together<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.370> drill<00:02:38.940> a

stack the pieces together and drill a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.520 
stack the pieces together and drill a
hole<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.389> each<00:02:39.480> corner<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.109> you<00:02:40.230> can<00:02:40.380> rivet

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
hole in each corner so you can rivet

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.680 
hole in each corner so you can rivet
them<00:02:40.769> all<00:02:40.920> together<00:02:41.069> with<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> hammer<00:02:41.700> here<00:02:42.569> is

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
them all together with a hammer here is

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.750 
them all together with a hammer here is
the<00:02:42.840> final<00:02:43.049> pendant<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.739> since<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.400> use<00:02:44.579> the

the final pendant and since we use the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.879 
the final pendant and since we use the
veil<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.239> can<00:02:45.420> spin<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.290> pendant<00:02:46.680> can<00:02:46.799> be
