now<00:00:10.280> when<00:00:10.459> I<00:00:10.490> say<00:00:10.670> depth<00:00:10.940> don't<00:00:11.210> just<00:00:11.360> think

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480

linear perspective to create space is
just<00:00:14.509> silly<00:00:15.019> because<00:00:15.440> it's<00:00:15.559> both<00:00:15.710> easier<00:00:16.130> and

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
just silly because it's both easier and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
between these characters ie we fear for

the safety of the representation of a

the safety of the representation of a

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
sloth because we assume that this

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.990 
sloth because we assume that this
representation<00:00:57.739> of<00:00:57.829> a<00:00:57.890> shark<00:00:58.190> is<00:00:58.520> filled<00:00:58.820> with

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
teeth that are controlled by a desire to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.550 
teeth that are controlled by a desire to
rent<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:01.670> tear<00:01:01.910> we<00:01:02.899> infer<00:01:03.140> all<00:01:03.320> of<00:01:03.440> this

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
rent and to tear we infer all of this

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.719 
rent and to tear we infer all of this
although<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.890> picture<00:01:04.009> itself<00:01:04.430> is

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
although the picture itself is

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.850 
although the picture itself is
admittedly<00:01:05.299> rather<00:01:05.420> banal<00:01:05.930> which<00:01:06.560> is<00:01:06.680> pretty

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
admittedly rather banal which is pretty

admittedly rather banal which is pretty

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
cool from a psychological standpoint but

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.390

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
it is not the only way to create drama I

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.310 
it is not the only way to create drama I
can<00:01:10.880> also<00:01:11.090> make<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:11.630> picture<00:01:11.840> more<00:01:12.080> or<00:01:12.170> less

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
can also make a picture more or less

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.200 
can also make a picture more or less
dramatic<00:01:12.710> by<00:01:12.830> manipulating<00:01:13.490> strictly<00:01:13.880> formal

further even distance also removes

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.580 
further even distance also removes

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
low-frequency light and so red light

low-frequency light and so red light
some<00:03:40.190> artists<00:03:40.580> say<00:03:40.700> this<00:03:40.940> makes<00:03:41.150> distant

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
things more blue but I personally think

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.830 
things more blue but I personally think
that's<00:03:43.700> misleading<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.390> like<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.630> think<00:03:44.810> of

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
that's misleading and like to think of

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.710 
that's misleading and like to think of
it<00:03:44.990> as<00:03:45.140> distant<00:03:45.650> things<00:03:45.830> being<00:03:46.040> less<00:03:46.280> red

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
it as distant things being less red

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.760 
it as distant things being less red
because<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.810> way<00:03:47.900> atmosphere<00:03:48.410> removes

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
because the way atmosphere removes

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.080 
because the way atmosphere removes
contrast<00:03:49.220> us<00:03:49.340> who<00:03:49.430> makes<00:03:49.640> bright<00:03:49.850> blue

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
contrast us who makes bright blue

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.640 
contrast us who makes bright blue
objects<00:03:50.570> less<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.990> less<00:03:51.080> blue<00:03:51.380> when<00:03:51.560> they

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
objects less and less blue when they

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.810 
objects less and less blue when they
move<00:03:51.770> away<00:03:51.860> because<00:03:52.190> they're<00:03:52.340> also<00:03:52.460> losing

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820

some of that to all this may sound like
