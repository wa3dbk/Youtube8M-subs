somebody goes down you run right up
there<00:02:11.489> exactly

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
there exactly

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.210 
there exactly
exactly<00:02:12.540> except<00:02:13.020> i'm<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.320> horrible<00:02:13.560> IPC

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
exactly except i'm a horrible IPC

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.290 
exactly except i'm a horrible IPC
shooters<00:02:14.550> i'm<00:02:14.730> more<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.910> an<00:02:14.970> Xbox<00:02:15.330> guy<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.200> I

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
shooters i'm more of an Xbox guy so I

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.670 
shooters i'm more of an Xbox guy so I
aiming<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.420> not<00:02:18.630> really<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.140> point<00:02:19.380> and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
aiming is not really on point and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.560 
aiming is not really on point and
neither<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:20.010> learning<00:02:20.730> how<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.880> revive<00:02:21.330> people
