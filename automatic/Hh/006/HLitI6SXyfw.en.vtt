00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:05.229
 the functional training room of the 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.939
 gym fitness platinum we already had a 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:08.380
 warming up and now we're with the 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.700
 professor oscar vÃ©lez who is going to 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.410
 explain what the routine will consist of 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.360
 from now or be welcome fitness agent 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.340
 very well thank you very much then already 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.140
 after having done the warm-up 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.650
 that prior activation we will enter 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.810
 then to work 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.250
 functional training training 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.199
 of union has to do with many 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.900
 characteristics of the training that 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.150
 are the resistance to force the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.180
 balance proprioception is worked 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.670
 everything so that there is a complement 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.070
 ideal of all of all the work of the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.050
 ready body oscar I see the bosu also 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.790
 I see medical balls what are they going to be 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.620
 the benefits when using 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.480
 those implements when we involve 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.180
 the different muscle groups 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.500
 benefits are everything all everything 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.059
 it has to do with that because when 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.559
 we are trying in boxing we are 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.150
 working the balance and also you 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.449
 There is a lot to see with concentration 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.440
 then they fulfill many functions and what 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.210
 another is that I have to be very 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.070
 concentrated to be able to handle the load 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.600
 that I have about on the hands that goes to 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.729
 be the medicine ball then it's a 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.439
 perfect complement to catch a 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.640
