look<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:31.550> hmm<00:01:32.550> I<00:01:32.900> think<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> might<00:01:34.110> even

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
look at that hmm I think it might even

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.840 
look at that hmm I think it might even
be<00:01:34.410> better<00:01:34.650> without<00:01:34.920> tartar<00:01:35.490> sauce<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:37.850> think

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
be better without tartar sauce I think

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.130 
be better without tartar sauce I think
the<00:01:38.910> tartar<00:01:39.180> sauce<00:01:39.360> would<00:01:39.750> make<00:01:39.899> it<00:01:40.050> even

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the tartar sauce would make it even

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.530 
the tartar sauce would make it even
better<00:01:40.320> without<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.850> that<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> good<00:01:42.270> fish

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
better without it that is a good fish

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.900 
better without it that is a good fish
