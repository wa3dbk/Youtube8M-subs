00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.830
 when welcome to sit on n-tv 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.289
 lukas shepherd i'm the leon petzold 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.259
 that is one free and it works great 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.660
 stick walls golf24 could first 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:37.000
 a super stick mandy bork 2 would be from 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.070
 digne developer becomes the developer 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.600
 behind the successful statement series 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.550
 no, they are not the heads only 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.230
 start with the name piste on the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.090
 success on whether that was extra white 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.100
 I do not but in any case we have 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.660
 Again, a piece more so than 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.710
 stick figure playing which ball 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.250
 want the whole thing reminds one so 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:58.540
 a little bit of the series of stickers on golf 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.700
 I play know because no specific and 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.440
 anna hÃ¼bers exactly and we push 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.420
 Just press on play 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.350
 singleplayer where we also more accurate 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.850
 We can play multiplayer 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.320
 not here now in the corner because we are not 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.939
 internet but they are the same 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.770
 worlds we can play like in the 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.270
 singleplayer mode and therefore catch 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.890
 Just go to level 1 ann and claire 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.719
 loading pick one at the beginning of the levels 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.890
 little sign what gives us tips 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.509
 how we ever play in this 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.679
 but it's above me now 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.499
 down here on these two buttons 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.939
 let's move on we adjust the height in 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:33.069
 who should fly the ball and you down 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.499
 on gold and on it and on 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.859
 second time to select the hardness 

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:40.899
 that was the hertha I have exactly 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.670
 that's why it's completely fucked up and that's why 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.429
 we have now down here in each one 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.049
 level 7 extra power ups free we press 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.399
 it's just on the first level 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.560
 make a strike possible 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.719
 but that will be more from level to level 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.880
 opportunities that we just get there 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:03.159
 it will similarly poke in and deliver 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.600
 By the way, the game comes from us 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.329
 already have not said of citiworks 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.250
 but by uk studios inc 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.780
 a top developer but not 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.880
 the one in the stick men series 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.099
 they also have many other apps in the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.750
 store 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.980
 I do not know specifically about them 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.900
 not exactly none 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.519
 but they seem to have some and 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.970
 partly also relatively successful 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.410
 of it, however, noodle-like studios 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.310
 inc alone for the name you should look 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.019
 download the game 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.000
 there is a multiplayer mode and 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.739
 successes from the google games feature 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.080
 of course, the song we already 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.989
 We all know and we also test them 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.290
 version 2.1 which also from the 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.519
 average user a relatively good 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.840
 arrived which at the average 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.010
 about also arrives relatively well what the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.120
 current rating of 43 in playboy 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.000
 Most people actually find plays 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.790
 pretty cool even if some have a long time 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.620
 to criticize any small lead 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.410
 why because no 50 but which 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.819
 targeted the 50 guests do not play me 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.980
 It would also be very likely 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.730
 no matter in any case joke says apple 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.560
 fallen 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.600
 I think that's good on everyone 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.220
 if not maybe lead times 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.019
 we have such in the levels here 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.370
 small obstacles such as 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.090
 sand or water 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.579
 The water is sometimes blue-red-good 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.959
 no idea in the sand remains the effect 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.170
 Ball stand immediately we wanted 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.090
 further and remains me a halt 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.500
 Obstacle and in the water we get 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.750
 a penalty and we have the 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.709
 Start from the beginning and after each 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.340
 got hole made here 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.709
 our statistics are displayed 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.380
 maximum we may need 83 beats 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.549
 around here an overall score of 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.350
 to get zero 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.620
 which brings us to the next level 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.420
 unlock if we at plus 1 23 and 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.220
 then we have to go to the level 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.470
 repeat until we get to zero or im 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.930
 negative area are you are yes 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.730
 negative now we have small ones here 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.049
 banknotes we can collect 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.469
 we have all for the first time 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.510
 We got in the shop 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:08.390
 I'll just do that now 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.000
 short in the shop we find in the menu 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.920
 small special features can buy 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.329
 we just go over here and 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.280
 then we have our golfer here 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.199
 level 1 then we can deal with this 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.729
 translucent upgrade to level 2 of this 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.610
 we need to move on to the next 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.900
 we can reach worlds 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.699
 also easy to play free 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.270
 we can buy ourselves here 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.310
 We can buy glasses 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.479
 buy characters we can get here 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.400
 special balls then buy somehow 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.680
 have other effects and we can 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.759
 power-ups ransom namely as such 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.400
 I already said we have from 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.500
 at the beginning only this blow reversed 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.919
 do and then there is here and 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.210
 just keep on going 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.349
 and who of course the whole stuff 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.539
 I want to play here can 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.039
 Also buy over in app and look for it 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.419
 then sell a pirate or something 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.889
 But we have to be valid 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.539
 not you money is enough 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.190
 loosely around from level to level to further 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.710
 we still have the head 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.539
 lottery where we at least otherwise 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.810
 dollars and if then 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.550
 easy to press here and then 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.990
 we got a pirate hat 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.490
 which surprising would be lucky 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.130
 stupidly enough, that's why 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:19.760
 we sell the 463 experience points 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:21.680
 and then money rises like point 50 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.510
 50 in virtual unite to 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.570
 Exactly what it cost was not 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.240
 No matter is important rather unimportant 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:33.259
 but that the app broke in 47mb 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.120
 In fact, 47.09 is not really 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.430
 a lot but fits that actually wants that 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.990
 play before the courses year as a feature set 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.220
 top features gives developers to us 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.020
 even just can underline it easily 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.810
 in the online multiplayer at which you look 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.889
 then virtually beg for friends 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:52.340
 180 challengers 53 active and 28 hats 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.120
 that's really damn important and so 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.430
 on and on 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.690
 to the online mode we have to see here 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.460
 a moment we see the way the 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.260
 the whole world we can switch and 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.930
 in every world we have below 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.510
 times sub points online multiplayer 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.190
 If we had exactly here we have to ourselves 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.690
 do not connect internet but im 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.210
 we get one online multiplayer 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.950
 random opponent assigned and against the 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.860
 Let's just play one of those 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.210
 these worlds we see here and yes 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.370
 that's just like taking turns 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.500
 maybe play at grace where he finds 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.120
 then just where only with opponents beat 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.710
 and then it's your turn and 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.780
 At the end, the least hits will be 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.000
 needs the wins and surrenders 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.200
 Wacklers came with you can also 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.330
 Friends chat with friends 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.460
 you can also yes yes there you have to 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.110
 stop with google knows forbidden clear so 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:49.520
 that and also who will enlighten this 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:51.850
 and by then I want to say one with it 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.850
 it
