that<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.180> given<00:02:42.420> situation<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.140> very

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
that in a given situation in a very

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.690 
that in a given situation in a very
serious<00:02:43.530> situation<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:44.280> wouldn't<00:02:44.549> be<00:02:44.670> a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
serious situation I wouldn't be a

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.699 
serious situation I wouldn't be a
bystander<00:02:44.910> not<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> lot<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.049> men<00:02:46.230> are<00:02:46.350> violent

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
bystander not a lot of men are violent

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.710 
bystander not a lot of men are violent
but<00:02:46.799> most<00:02:47.010> men<00:02:47.190> are<00:02:47.310> silent<00:02:47.730> both<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
but most men are silent both the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.600 
but most men are silent both the
academic<00:02:49.260> piece<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.830> activists<00:02:50.430> issue

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
academic piece and the activists issue

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.990 
academic piece and the activists issue
pieces<00:02:51.269> need<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.140> be<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.290> part<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.680> schools

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
pieces need to be a part of schools

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.360 
pieces need to be a part of schools
and<00:02:54.210> I<00:02:54.450> think<00:02:54.720> if<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:55.020> did<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.440> K<00:02:55.890> through<00:02:56.070> 12

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
and I think if we did that K through 12

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.420 
and I think if we did that K through 12
I<00:02:56.670> think<00:02:57.030> we<00:02:57.330> would<00:02:57.480> live<00:02:57.630> in<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.810> very

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
I think we would live in a very

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.960 
I think we would live in a very
different<00:02:59.430> world<00:03:00.710> we<00:03:01.710> derive<00:03:02.280> our<00:03:02.490> definition

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
different world we derive our definition

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.090 
different world we derive our definition
