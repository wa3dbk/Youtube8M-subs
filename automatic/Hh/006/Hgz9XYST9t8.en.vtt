00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
this hair because apparently my finger

this hair because apparently my finger
cut<00:01:28.149> off<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:29.259> bigger<00:01:29.649> one<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:29.950> when<00:01:30.429> you're

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
cut off the bigger one so when you're

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.660 
cut off the bigger one so when you're

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
curling the hair the way the buttons are

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.820 
curling the hair the way the buttons are
placed<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.300> mean<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.750> guess<00:01:34.780> I<00:01:35.200> accidentally

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
placed I mean I guess I accidentally

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.440 
placed I mean I guess I accidentally
turned<00:01:36.220> it<00:01:36.340> off<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.670> didn't<00:01:36.910> know<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.240> turn
