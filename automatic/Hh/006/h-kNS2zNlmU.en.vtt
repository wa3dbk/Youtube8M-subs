12<00:04:09.420> 30<00:04:09.720> million<00:04:10.230> power<00:04:10.500> battery<00:04:10.970> so<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.000> has

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
12 30 million power battery so it has

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.360 
12 30 million power battery so it has
the<00:04:12.690> latest<00:04:12.989> most<00:04:13.470> up-to-date<00:04:13.650> experience

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
the latest most up-to-date experience

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.840 
the latest most up-to-date experience
with<00:04:14.640> Windows<00:04:15.209> Phone<00:04:15.420> 7<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:17.489> it's<00:04:17.640> fairly

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
with Windows Phone 7 so it's fairly

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.810 
with Windows Phone 7 so it's fairly
smooth<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.690> processors<00:04:19.500> as<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.310> 1<00:04:20.579> gigahertz

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
smooth the processors as the 1 gigahertz

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.779 
smooth the processors as the 1 gigahertz
processor<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:22.320> their<00:04:22.470> believe<00:04:22.860> snapdragon

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
processor and their believe snapdragon

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.460 
processor and their believe snapdragon
so<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.030> does<00:04:24.150> make<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.659> handset<00:04:25.020> fly<00:04:25.229> pretty

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
so it does make the handset fly pretty

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.780 
so it does make the handset fly pretty
quickly

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
quickly

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.730 
quickly
and<00:04:27.210> for<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.720> most<00:04:27.840> part<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.200> has<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.530> most

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
and for the most part it has the most

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.230 
and for the most part it has the most
up-to-date<00:04:28.920> experience<00:04:29.610> with<00:04:29.790> windows<00:04:30.090> so

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
up-to-date experience with windows so

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.450
