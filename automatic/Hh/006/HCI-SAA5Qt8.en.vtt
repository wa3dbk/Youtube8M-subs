00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 the queen of cinema with 24 all the big ones 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.109
 studios karmann crawled and you have 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.480
 all open doors slammed shut 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello together because the film factory today 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.139
 I have you but almost smaller 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.719
 film brought the congress is called the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.190
 movie and robin wright who knows her 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.960
 maybe from forrest gump too 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.279
 jenny played is something 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.869
 but that is exactly what this is about 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.550
 film because she plays herself here 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.140
 and they do not just see the successful one 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.189
 actress is he so on the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.900
 descending branch 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 But the film studios want theirs 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 They offer a one-time contract 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.480
 has to be scanned once and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.250
 afterwards you can do with your figure 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.969
 do whatever you want she will never have to do again 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.649
 play 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.360
 she may not even but it stops 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.160
 every year in several movies as 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.809
 computer figure to be seen 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.030
 it all went a bit crazy 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.690
 and that's exactly what this movie is 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.690
 but looks that you see here first 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.690
 computer 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.829
 the hypo the former actor 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.620
 but I want you to stay young for 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.829
 always awake to robin this is a gateway to 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.030
 freedom and now smile 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.890
 can I go back to where he is me 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.090
 come to something like the place you are 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.090
 come that does not give riots 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.479
 wow you look fantastic animated 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.479
 mine 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.470
 they are already the sixth today 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.470
 sixth what the sixth robin wright 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.190
 he works with the film quite a bit 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.160
 crazy ideas that is also such a 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.960
 in between, hifi drama and all 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.580
 possible other small jobs which the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.680
 favorites are among others 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.810
 animated film of the second half of the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.030
 films is completely two-dimensional 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.590
 Drawn how it comes to betray 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.540
 Not me it is definitely one 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.370
 pretty bad as you have kicked 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.480
 also quite often the feeling I have 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.910
 right now any drugs 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.080
 taken or what's going on the first one 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.110
 By the way, I think that is forty-five minutes 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.360
 Saustark so everything that plays in the real 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.460
 I think it really brings great 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.380
 many criticisms of the current 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 hollywood situation simply on the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.410
 point where you sit then yourself 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.690
 or I'm sitting then you say 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.910
 yes you are completely right so robin 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.130
 wright robin struggles to fight right then 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.140
 keep it up is totally behind you 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.150
 and that is just right in the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.070
 movie anyway she has one 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.820
 fantastic actress she is very 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.310
 Naturally 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.959
 I love it when she is smiling and the 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.040
 eyes that can just sparkle like 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.810
 Somehow something else 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.950
 and that's why this movie is actually 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.020
 also a lesson in the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.180
 acting just because this too 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.489
 We treat you as a topic 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.420
 figure by scanning and then with it yourself 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.430
 to act 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.959
 where is the heart where is the heart 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.790
 at the game if only one 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.500
 computer there is really a great 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.630
 the topic but then in the second 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.670
 half a bit breaks away the second 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.590
 then part has become a bit confused 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.370
 he also brings such platitudes on the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.720
 Live with phrases that either 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.760
 HanebÃ¼chen are or partially complete 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.230
 Corny also the sign style itself 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.600
 so why anime tell it now 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.459
 i do not know but the sign style very much 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.900
 a bit exhausting to pursue 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.459
 and at some places comes one too 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.820
 music does not fit at all 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.530
 want 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.000
 what is another thing you are 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.890
 just does not understand the movie completely 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.810
 So he's very complex that's it 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.280
 but you have to go after that too 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.140
 film so everything somehow in the head 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.280
 sort of what is not bad if 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.450
 is one of the movie to a still 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.100
 second time wants to see if you want the 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.080
 would like to have a solution 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.840
 but the film is just partially like that 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.250
 abstruse and strange and far away bulky 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.130
 that you do not get the movie 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.630
 want to see it a second time and that is 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.650
 then some kind of conflict-of for with 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.600
 if I bring them now 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.459
 I just understand or just want to understand it 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.410
 forget and that is a pity 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.120
 because the film had so much potential 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.310
 a little masterpiece to the defense 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.750
 what he has not used who should 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.250
 Watch this movie in the cinema 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.379
 especially when it something really departed 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.060
 it is not so far okay what 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.010
 has the dom is there now so says 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.170
 I can simplify that a bit 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.569
 namely film-form of the ari also 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.519
 painting with bashir made so that's yes 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.920
 also this film with a lot of animation 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.510
 and real world plays a bit 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.099
 maybe you have seen that and say 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.420
 he found it cool in front of the filmmaker 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.010
 want new items, draw something else 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.900
 in general, people who say I think 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.909
 It's great if two completely different 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.349
 worlds meet each other 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.970
 actually did not belong together and 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.500
 From this a whole work will look 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.329
 the movie in any case 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.769
 but who should not look at it 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.930
 is now a man says I want it 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.430
 understand what I see there and I want 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.440
 Do not sit down for two hours afterwards 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.000
 and first sort all the thoughts around 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.260
 to know what that was actually 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.550
 everything in detail 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.530
 then you are here in any case 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.970
 wrong address so a movie where 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.190
 But then in the end also evaluate and 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.449
 I give six out of ten points 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.550
 Among other things, that is because of me 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.039
 always great when people are brave 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.910
 Something else on the screen conjures up what 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.680
 But that does not mean that you but the 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.479
 Last garbage can be the main thing 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.520
 I do not mean that differently now but where 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.289
 one recognizes approaches I would like something 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.030
 do differently than others not to 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.840
 I follow the same convention 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.910
 make size 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.860
 There are definitely bonuspoints for that 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.289
 also by the mix he is played great 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.610
 and since you can only say it's been 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.840
 above average even if you do not 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.610
 but maybe everything understood 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.750
 then I look at some point but still 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.490
 a second time 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.870
 just write times the comments on 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.460
 if you have seen him whether due 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.690
 completely understood you always have one 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.030
 I would be happy to discuss this 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.430
 but first the rating six by 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.050
 ten points for the congress has you 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.430
 the rive has fallen to the congress last week 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.870
 Definitely a thumb up there 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.030
 But sometimes write the comments 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.979
 What are the films he is at 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.510
 first time not one hundred percent 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.070
 understood and where you are honest 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.990
 since you are not even at the first 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.910
 have to understand times I am 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.169
 look forward to what's coming out here 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.639
 her the possibility of another 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.710
 We definitely enjoy watching the movie 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.539
 all can understand 2000 percent and 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.430
 have understood the first time 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.169
 who says I'm curious what you are 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.849

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.500
