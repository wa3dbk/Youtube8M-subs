at<00:00:48.210> least<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.840> far<00:00:49.079> less<00:00:49.110> Protoss

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
at least if I was far less Protoss

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.290 
at least if I was far less Protoss
there's<00:00:50.190> probably<00:00:50.430> some<00:00:50.579> debate<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.030> far<00:00:51.210> as

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
there's probably some debate as far as

there's probably some debate as far as
you<00:00:51.420> know<00:00:51.510> maybe<00:00:51.690> Wayson<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.289> something<00:00:52.500> like

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you know maybe Wayson or something like

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.670 
you know maybe Wayson or something like
that<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.340> among<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> Protoss<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:55.289> soo<00:00:55.530> is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
that but among the Protoss is be soo is

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.029 
that but among the Protoss is be soo is
king<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.250> stork<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.300> second<00:00:57.750> because<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
king and stork a second because and the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.599 
king and stork a second because and the
only<00:00:59.219> reason<00:00:59.340> why<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.730> because<00:01:00.050> storks<00:01:01.050> um<00:01:01.609> vs

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
only reason why is because storks um vs

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.100 
only reason why is because storks um vs
zerg<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.359> little<00:01:03.539> bit<00:01:03.690> weak<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
zerg is just a little bit weak and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.340 
zerg is just a little bit weak and
honestly<00:01:05.070> I'm<00:01:05.479> thinking<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.020> time

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
honestly I'm thinking this is the time

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
honestly I'm thinking this is the time
store<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.920> actually<00:01:08.280> take<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> though<00:01:08.729> he's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
store can actually take it though he's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.609 
store can actually take it though he's
been<00:01:09.090> losing<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> Savior<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
so you know if PJ can beat him honestly

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.810 
so you know if PJ can beat him honestly
stork<00:01:46.560> has<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.920> capability<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.430> beating<00:01:47.729> him

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
stork has the capability of beating him

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.300 
stork has the capability of beating him
it's<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.780> stork<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.500> has<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.770> focus<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
it's just a stork just has to focus and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.580 
it's just a stork just has to focus and
do<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.670> I'm<00:01:50.790> hoping<00:01:51.720> store<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.470> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
do it and I'm hoping store can do it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.560 
do it and I'm hoping store can do it
this<00:01:52.710> time<00:01:52.770> because<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.250> he<00:01:53.369> beats<00:01:53.579> stork<00:01:53.880> it's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
this time because if he beats stork it's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.510 
this time because if he beats stork it's
basically<00:01:55.079> her<00:01:55.409> probably<00:01:55.920> gonna<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.250> stored

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
basically her probably gonna be stored

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.550 
basically her probably gonna be stored
versus<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:56.969> soo<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> msl<00:01:57.960> final<00:01:58.350> again

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
him to fight this off that tends to be

where winds and wow store manages to
take<00:02:37.569> down<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.780> drone<00:02:38.170> there<00:02:38.440> very<00:02:38.709> early

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
take down a drone there very early

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.770 
take down a drone there very early
that's<00:02:39.190> going<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.430> cost<00:02:39.610> him<00:02:39.760> too<00:02:40.030> because<00:02:40.540> it

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
that's going to cost him too because it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.910 
that's going to cost him too because it
looks<00:02:40.959> like<00:02:41.080> he<00:02:41.170> got<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.349> little<00:02:41.379> bit<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.769> gas

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
looks like he got a little bit of gas

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.130 
looks like he got a little bit of gas
with<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:42.940> not<00:02:43.660> going<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.900> make<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
with that so not going to make the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.210 
with that so not going to make the
difference<00:02:44.260> in<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.680> game<00:02:44.799> per<00:02:45.010> se<00:02:45.160> but

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
difference in the game per se but

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.580 
difference in the game per se but
definitely<00:02:45.880> going<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.180> set<00:02:46.780> save<00:02:47.290> your<00:02:47.440> back<00:02:47.560> a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
definitely going to set save your back a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.170 
definitely going to set save your back a
little<00:02:47.829> bit<00:02:48.010> early<00:02:48.310> there<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.670> was<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.060> was

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
little bit early there that was I was

little bit early there that was I was
impressive<00:02:49.660> yeah<00:02:50.440> especially<00:02:50.920> because<00:02:51.069> he's

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
impressive yeah especially because he's

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.979 
impressive yeah especially because he's
not<00:02:51.579> going<00:02:51.910> for<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.209> econ<00:02:52.540> build<00:02:52.750> when<00:02:52.900> she

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
usually does you'll almost always see

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.020 
usually does you'll almost always see
state<00:02:55.030> Savior<00:02:55.599> going<00:02:55.840> for<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:57.069> hatch<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.940> then

his pool so great for that pool early is

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.850 
his pool so great for that pool early is
a<00:03:00.370> little<00:03:00.670> bit<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.910> variation<00:03:01.500> he<00:03:02.500> might<00:03:02.709> be

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
a little bit of a variation he might be

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.059 
a little bit of a variation he might be
worried<00:03:03.129> about<00:03:03.480> proxies<00:03:04.480> or<00:03:04.599> something<00:03:05.069> deity

putting that probe in that little hole
by<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.680> way<00:03:14.860> making<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.879> so<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.090> the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
by the way making it so that the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.479 
by the way making it so that the
certainly<00:03:17.079> can't<00:03:17.680> just<00:03:17.859> rush<00:03:18.040> through<00:03:18.069> giving

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
certainly can't just rush through giving

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.640 
certainly can't just rush through giving
himself<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:19.030> extra<00:03:19.450> second<00:03:19.900> for<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.139> cannon

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
himself that extra second for the cannon

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.530 
himself that extra second for the cannon
to<00:03:20.709> come<00:03:20.829> in<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.370> cannon<00:03:21.819> is<00:03:21.940> in<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:22.389> now

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
to come in so that cannon is in so now

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.059 
to come in so that cannon is in so now
basically<00:03:22.810> there's<00:03:23.290> no<00:03:23.470> chance<00:03:23.709> for<00:03:23.950> this

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
basically there's no chance for this

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.390 
basically there's no chance for this
early<00:03:24.970> pool<00:03:25.239> rush<00:03:26.079> to<00:03:26.319> work<00:03:26.530> for<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.220> savior

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
early pool rush to work for a savior

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.150 
early pool rush to work for a savior
anymore<00:03:27.880> so<00:03:28.180> stork<00:03:29.079> has<00:03:29.170> basically<00:03:29.620> taken<00:03:29.739> in

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
anymore so stork has basically taken in

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.789 
anymore so stork has basically taken in
secondary<00:03:30.579> base<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.870> yeah<00:03:31.989> we<00:03:32.139> see<00:03:32.290> bc<00:03:32.500> doing

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
secondary base and yeah we see bc doing

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.710 
secondary base and yeah we see bc doing
a<00:03:32.889> lot<00:03:33.069> we'll<00:03:33.489> take<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.700> secondary<00:03:34.180> put<00:03:34.480> up<00:03:34.569> a

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
a lot we'll take a secondary put up a

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.479 
a lot we'll take a secondary put up a
couple<00:03:34.900> cannons<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:35.470> then<00:03:35.980> he<00:03:36.130> usually<00:03:36.250> goes

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
couple cannons and then he usually goes

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.129 
couple cannons and then he usually goes
straight<00:03:36.849> for<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.090> Corsair<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:37.780> we'll<00:03:37.930> see<00:03:38.109> if

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
straight for the Corsair so we'll see if

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.759 
straight for the Corsair so we'll see if
in<00:03:38.950> store<00:03:39.880> kinds<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.209> doing<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.569> or<00:03:40.840> not

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
in store kinds of doing that or not

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.289 
in store kinds of doing that or not
depending<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:42.340> I<00:03:42.810> guess<00:03:43.810> what<00:03:44.940> save<00:03:45.940> your<00:03:46.120> ends

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
depending on I guess what save your ends

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.949 
depending on I guess what save your ends
up<00:03:46.389> doing<00:03:48.030> looks<00:03:49.030> like<00:03:49.209> saviors<00:03:49.540> bring<00:03:49.690> up<00:03:49.840> a

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
up doing looks like saviors bring up a

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.930 
up doing looks like saviors bring up a
really<00:03:49.989> quick<00:03:50.470> drone<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:51.010> like<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:51.579> maneuver

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
really quick drone I like this maneuver

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.670 
really quick drone I like this maneuver
it<00:03:52.030> looks<00:03:52.150> like<00:03:52.269> he's<00:03:52.389> going<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.599> put<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.780> really

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
it looks like he's going to put a really

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.920 
it looks like he's going to put a really
close<00:03:53.889> proxy<00:03:54.340> hatch<00:03:54.519> down<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.329> really<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:55.660> feel

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
close proxy hatch down and really I feel

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.150 
close proxy hatch down and really I feel
like<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.230> might<00:03:56.410> be<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.560> secret<00:03:56.889> to<00:03:56.980> beating

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
like that might be the secret to beating

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.430 
like that might be the secret to beating
us<00:03:57.400> build<00:03:57.639> he<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.269> we<00:03:58.450> saw<00:03:58.599> GG<00:03:58.959> plate<00:03:59.169> have<00:03:59.410> a

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
a quick three hatch build my feel like

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.180 
a quick three hatch build my feel like
he<00:04:04.510> was<00:04:04.569> kind<00:04:04.780> of<00:04:04.900> on<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.109> right<00:04:05.349> track<00:04:05.620> in

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
he was kind of on the right track in

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.520 
he was kind of on the right track in
defeating<00:04:06.849> this<00:04:07.060> but<00:04:07.480> really<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.750> proxy<00:04:08.290> here

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
defeating this but really a proxy here

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.849 
defeating this but really a proxy here
this<00:04:09.310> could<00:04:09.459> really<00:04:09.669> help<00:04:09.819> ya<00:04:10.299> if<00:04:10.329> end<00:04:10.660> that

this could really help ya if end that
yeah<00:04:11.859> it<00:04:11.950> doesn't<00:04:12.099> look<00:04:12.220> like<00:04:12.310> he's<00:04:12.489> letting

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
yeah it doesn't look like he's letting

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.920 
yeah it doesn't look like he's letting
gas

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
gas

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.469 
gas
we<00:04:14.109> hear<00:04:14.799> he<00:04:15.159> got<00:04:15.189> enough<00:04:15.670> he<00:04:15.909> got<00:04:16.060> enough<00:04:16.269> for

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
we hear he got enough he got enough for

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.819 
we hear he got enough he got enough for
speedlings<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.169> now<00:04:17.259> is<00:04:17.410> going<00:04:17.620> all

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
speedlings and now is going all

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.310 
speedlings and now is going all
zerglings<00:04:18.340> right<00:04:18.549> now<00:04:18.729> which<00:04:19.419> is<00:04:19.449> which<00:04:20.289> is

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
zerglings right now which is which is

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.409 
zerglings right now which is which is
going<00:04:20.709> to<00:04:20.769> be<00:04:20.859> major<00:04:21.190> because<00:04:21.579> I<00:04:21.910> don't<00:04:22.270> think

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
going to be major because I don't think

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.760 
going to be major because I don't think
storks<00:04:22.690> going<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:22.900> expect<00:04:23.199> that<00:04:23.350> his<00:04:23.470> Scout

got killed so he's not seeing this he's

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.170 
got killed so he's not seeing this he's
not<00:04:26.020> seeing<00:04:26.259> this<00:04:26.410> proxy<00:04:26.979> hatch<00:04:27.160> saviors<00:04:27.970> I'm

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
not seeing this proxy hatch saviors I'm

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.379 
not seeing this proxy hatch saviors I'm
using<00:04:28.780> those<00:04:29.020> links<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.380> keep<00:04:29.590> storks<00:04:30.389> probit

using those links to keep storks probit

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.390 
using those links to keep storks probit
his<00:04:31.479> base<00:04:31.690> keep<00:04:31.990> him<00:04:32.139> from<00:04:32.289> scouting<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.919> let's

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
his base keep him from scouting it let's

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.980 
his base keep him from scouting it let's
see<00:04:33.550> if<00:04:33.669> this<00:04:33.699> probe<00:04:34.060> gets<00:04:34.210> out<00:04:34.419> far<00:04:34.660> enough<00:04:34.690> to

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
see if this probe gets out far enough to

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.060 
see if this probe gets out far enough to
see<00:04:35.139> that<00:04:35.259> hatchery<00:04:35.620> because<00:04:35.800> that's<00:04:35.949> going

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
see that hatchery because that's going

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.529 
see that hatchery because that's going
to<00:04:36.160> make<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.310> big<00:04:36.400> difference<00:04:36.610> if<00:04:37.030> he<00:04:37.120> sees<00:04:37.360> it

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
to make a big difference if he sees it

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.420 
to make a big difference if he sees it
or<00:04:37.630> not<00:04:37.750> if<00:04:37.960> he<00:04:38.050> expects<00:04:38.410> this<00:04:38.590> okay<00:04:39.250> he's

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
or not if he expects this okay he's

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.590 
or not if he expects this okay he's
getting<00:04:39.580> enough<00:04:39.850> for<00:04:40.030> layer<00:04:40.180> I'm<00:04:40.300> sorry<00:04:40.509> he

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
getting enough for layer I'm sorry he

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.930 
getting enough for layer I'm sorry he
went<00:04:41.169> back<00:04:41.289> to<00:04:41.440> mine<00:04:41.620> and<00:04:41.740> gas<00:04:41.919> so<00:04:42.580> maybe<00:04:42.759> he

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
went back to mine and gas so maybe he

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.279 
went back to mine and gas so maybe he
just<00:04:42.970> wanted<00:04:43.300> enough<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.570> get<00:04:43.690> some<00:04:43.870> wings<00:04:44.080> out

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
just wanted enough to get some wings out

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.930 
just wanted enough to get some wings out
very<00:04:44.500> quickly<00:04:44.650> that's<00:04:45.070> interesting<00:04:45.639> if

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
very quickly that's interesting if

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.670 
very quickly that's interesting if
getting<00:04:46.509> hosed<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.990> make<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.139> guess<00:04:47.380> here<00:04:47.620> I

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
getting hosed to make a guess here I

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.230 
getting hosed to make a guess here I
would<00:04:47.860> say<00:04:48.070> he's<00:04:48.310> going<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.550> push<00:04:48.789> directly

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
would say he's going to push directly

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.879 
would say he's going to push directly
into<00:04:49.509> Hydra<00:04:49.780> lists<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.229> just<00:04:50.440> try<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.650> get

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
into Hydra lists and just try to get

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.950 
into Hydra lists and just try to get
those<00:04:50.979> hydraulics<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.759> just<00:04:52.240> interesting

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
those hydraulics to just interesting

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.320 
those hydraulics to just interesting
clave<00:04:53.380> just<00:04:53.770> get<00:04:54.009> all<00:04:54.220> around<00:04:54.699> just<00:04:54.970> seal

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
clave just get all around just seal

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.350 
clave just get all around just seal
stork<00:04:56.139> in<00:04:56.410> and<00:04:57.280> keep<00:04:57.580> those<00:04:57.729> Corsairs<00:04:58.180> from

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
stork in and keep those Corsairs from

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.610 
stork in and keep those Corsairs from
coming<00:04:58.630> down<00:04:58.780> doing<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.110> her<00:04:59.259> ass<00:04:59.349> on<00:04:59.560> the

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
coming down doing the her ass on the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.700 
coming down doing the her ass on the
overlords<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.340> then<00:05:01.030> just<00:05:01.479> push<00:05:01.780> up<00:05:01.990> and<00:05:02.500> take

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
overlords and then just push up and take

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.870 
overlords and then just push up and take
those<00:05:02.860> cannon<00:05:03.160> downs<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:03.490> see<00:05:03.610> if<00:05:03.699> you<00:05:03.759> can

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
those cannon downs and see if you can

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.850 
those cannon downs and see if you can
take<00:05:04.000> that<00:05:04.030> secondary<00:05:04.479> down<00:05:04.720> so<00:05:05.199> the<00:05:05.530> Stargate

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
take that secondary down so the Stargate

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.379 
take that secondary down so the Stargate
going<00:05:06.099> up<00:05:06.190> right<00:05:06.370> now<00:05:06.490> now<00:05:06.970> really<00:05:07.180> the

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
going up right now now really the

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.150 
going up right now now really the
question<00:05:07.509> is<00:05:07.810> is<00:05:08.020> he<00:05:08.380> going<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.590> be<00:05:08.680> successful

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
question is is he going to be successful

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.390 
question is is he going to be successful
with<00:05:09.250> that<00:05:09.479> yeah<00:05:10.479> last<00:05:10.780> game<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.410> mean<00:05:11.919> Game<00:05:12.190> one

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
with that yeah last game I mean Game one

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.010 
with that yeah last game I mean Game one
of<00:05:12.430> this<00:05:12.610> series<00:05:12.910> that's<00:05:13.240> what<00:05:13.419> we<00:05:13.539> saw<00:05:13.750> is

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
of this series that's what we saw is

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.070 
of this series that's what we saw is
Savior<00:05:15.009> went<00:05:15.250> for<00:05:15.789> mass<00:05:15.970> hydras<00:05:16.570> very<00:05:16.840> quickly

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
Savior went for mass hydras very quickly

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.219 
Savior went for mass hydras very quickly
and<00:05:17.410> I<00:05:18.250> mean<00:05:18.580> stork<00:05:19.180> went<00:05:19.419> early<00:05:19.960> expansion

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
and I mean stork went early expansion

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.159 
and I mean stork went early expansion
and<00:05:20.639> Savior<00:05:21.639> went<00:05:21.820> early<00:05:22.240> double<00:05:22.599> expansion

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
and Savior went early double expansion

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.469 
and Savior went early double expansion
and<00:05:23.409> out<00:05:24.220> a<00:05:24.520> condom<00:05:24.789> and<00:05:25.060> then<00:05:25.150> went<00:05:25.300> mass

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
and out a condom and then went mass

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.149 
and out a condom and then went mass
hydras<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.110> then<00:05:26.199> went<00:05:26.380> straight<00:05:26.590> in<00:05:26.710> they

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
hydras and then went straight in they

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.189 
hydras and then went straight in they
think<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.729> thing<00:05:27.909> is<00:05:28.150> is<00:05:28.389> that<00:05:28.750> he<00:05:28.900> caught

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
think the thing is is that he caught

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.350 
think the thing is is that he caught
stork<00:05:29.949> at<00:05:30.070> the<00:05:30.159> perfect<00:05:30.460> moment<00:05:30.669> when<00:05:31.090> he<00:05:31.180> was

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
stork at the perfect moment when he was

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.390 
stork at the perfect moment when he was
spending<00:05:32.020> all<00:05:32.229> his<00:05:32.320> money<00:05:32.380> on<00:05:32.710> some<00:05:32.979> tech<00:05:33.190> and

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
spending all his money on some tech and

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.969 
spending all his money on some tech and
that<00:05:33.490> expansion<00:05:33.909> but<00:05:34.599> he<00:05:34.720> hadn't<00:05:35.110> quite

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
that expansion but he hadn't quite

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.100 
that expansion but he hadn't quite
gotten<00:05:36.250> the<00:05:36.520> his<00:05:36.820> forces<00:05:37.270> built<00:05:37.510> up<00:05:37.690> yet<00:05:37.870> so

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
gotten the his forces built up yet so

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.020 
gotten the his forces built up yet so
basically<00:05:39.099> it's<00:05:39.220> going<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.460> come<00:05:39.610> down<00:05:39.669> to

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
basically it's going to come down to

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.820 
basically it's going to come down to
that<00:05:40.389> again<00:05:40.750> here<00:05:41.020> well<00:05:41.320> at<00:05:41.409> least<00:05:41.530> for<00:05:41.740> the

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
that again here well at least for the

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.560 
that again here well at least for the
first<00:05:41.979> part<00:05:42.130> of<00:05:42.220> the<00:05:42.340> game<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.880> see<00:05:43.060> if<00:05:43.090> Savior

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
first part of the game to see if Savior

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.350 
first part of the game to see if Savior
ends<00:05:43.960> up<00:05:44.050> attacking<00:05:44.500> at<00:05:45.310> that<00:05:45.669> crucial<00:05:45.880> moment

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
ends up attacking at that crucial moment

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.540 
ends up attacking at that crucial moment
because<00:05:46.539> right<00:05:46.720> now<00:05:46.750> stork<00:05:47.680> is<00:05:47.830> tacking<00:05:48.460> up

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
because right now stork is tacking up

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.890 
because right now stork is tacking up
and<00:05:48.729> he's<00:05:48.820> spending<00:05:49.060> a<00:05:49.210> lot<00:05:49.360> of<00:05:49.389> money<00:05:49.599> on<00:05:49.659> that

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
and he's spending a lot of money on that

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.100 
and he's spending a lot of money on that
tech<00:05:50.169> getting<00:05:50.470> those<00:05:50.590> Corsairs<00:05:51.039> getting<00:05:51.460> the

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
tech getting those Corsairs getting the

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.730 
tech getting those Corsairs getting the
robotics<00:05:53.110> facility<00:05:53.259> out<00:05:54.090> so<00:05:55.090> if<00:05:55.810> but<00:05:56.440> Savior

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
robotics facility out so if but Savior

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.810 
robotics facility out so if but Savior
doesn't<00:05:56.979> appear<00:05:57.130> to<00:05:57.159> have<00:05:57.250> a<00:05:57.340> lot<00:05:57.460> of<00:05:57.490> forces

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
doesn't appear to have a lot of forces

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.950 
doesn't appear to have a lot of forces
on<00:05:57.880> the<00:05:57.970> ground<00:05:58.030> either<00:05:58.330> so<00:05:58.599> it<00:05:58.690> doesn't<00:05:58.900> look

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
on the ground either so it doesn't look

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.760 
on the ground either so it doesn't look
like<00:05:59.020> he's<00:05:59.259> gonna<00:05:59.380> be<00:05:59.470> able<00:05:59.530> to<00:05:59.650> take

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
like he's gonna be able to take

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.260 
like he's gonna be able to take
advantage<00:05:59.800> of<00:06:00.250> this<00:06:00.370> moment<00:06:00.759> at<00:06:00.849> least<00:06:00.880> it'll

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
advantage of this moment at least it'll

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.020 
advantage of this moment at least it'll
be<00:06:01.330> turning<00:06:01.690> into<00:06:01.840> a<00:06:01.900> long-ish<00:06:02.139> game<00:06:02.530> I<00:06:03.030> almost

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
be turning into a long-ish game I almost

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.360 
be turning into a long-ish game I almost
feel<00:06:04.240> like<00:06:04.300> you<00:06:04.930> made<00:06:05.169> more<00:06:05.710> players<00:06:06.039> should

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
feel like you made more players should

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.520 
feel like you made more players should
keep<00:06:06.789> the<00:06:07.120> two-spot<00:06:07.690> overlords<00:06:08.169> on<00:06:08.259> the<00:06:08.380> field

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
keep the two-spot overlords on the field

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.379 
keep the two-spot overlords on the field
looks<00:06:08.710> like<00:06:08.830> spire<00:06:09.130> going<00:06:09.460> up<00:06:09.580> and<00:06:10.210> another

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
looks like spire going up and another

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.450 
looks like spire going up and another
hatchery<00:06:10.780> going<00:06:11.020> down<00:06:11.169> for<00:06:11.470> Savior<00:06:11.919> and<00:06:12.099> first

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
hatchery going down for Savior and first

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.620 
hatchery going down for Savior and first
Corsairs<00:06:12.940> out<00:06:13.120> but<00:06:13.270> really<00:06:13.479> they<00:06:13.599> should

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
Corsairs out but really they should

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.210 
Corsairs out but really they should
gather<00:06:13.870> up<00:06:14.050> the<00:06:14.169> overlords<00:06:14.710> that<00:06:14.860> aren't<00:06:15.130> out

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
gather up the overlords that aren't out

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.159 
gather up the overlords that aren't out
in<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:15.370> field<00:06:15.610> and<00:06:15.820> and<00:06:16.570> put<00:06:16.960> them<00:06:17.080> around

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
in the field and and put them around

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.659 
in the field and and put them around
your<00:06:17.409> hydraulics<00:06:18.070> just<00:06:18.280> so<00:06:18.400> the<00:06:18.490> course

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
your hydraulics just so the course

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.370 
your hydraulics just so the course
errors<00:06:18.880> are<00:06:19.000> forced<00:06:19.300> to<00:06:19.419> at<00:06:19.810> least<00:06:19.930> contend

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
errors are forced to at least contend
