00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.140
 I do not know 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.070
 so we 're interested in supplements 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.189
 comes to the correct channel how are they 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.189
 everyone 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.309
 good today we are going to talk 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.290
 with a few years 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.379
 let's talk about nitric oxides of 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.930
 mosul because that was basically what 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.860
 they asked me what they thought about 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.100
 metric oxides of otates 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.400
 precursors all the truth also the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.990
 Mark Mosul is handled a lot a lot 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.310
 to be in terms of proteins 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.700
 precursors whatever you want Mosul tech 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.399
 testa is pure marketing and exceeded 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.070
 those products are very bad there is one 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.539
 only that it's new that is the one that 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.930
 recommend regarding oxide precursors 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.960
 nitric is why 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.390
 and how much protein all more in their 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.620
 products that is like flours 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.620
 literally hot cakes 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.720
 the truth is not everything does not work like 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.680
 any other product that is in the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.830
 market east 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.280
 of my other videos better products 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:00.000
 than others and it would be 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.540
 As for you, tell me what 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.570
 nitric oxide are those who want to know 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:11.959
 and I try them out and I tell them what opinion 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.959
 I give then let's see 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.640
 good first is neuro port from del 1 to 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.900
 10 I give a 9 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.990
 it tastes good this congestions 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.970
 of muscle these are good not you 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.900
 you get used to the product and the interesting thing 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.959
 of this is the concentration that gives you is 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.010
 give give to the gym and brambles 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.560
 very fast to the last sha enter and what the 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.470
 congestions that three are impressive 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.489
 the taste is of fruit punch then 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.100
 if it's good how long it lasts for a 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.910
 month or month and a half depends on how 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.350
 do not go but this one of mosul tech yo 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.290
 I think it's the number one product 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.650
 because it's new this is very striking the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.810
 the presentation of everything but of all the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.890
 beautiful tec range is the best thing that has 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:17.150
 then we have the line of your and that 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.250
 Well, I put it in second place because 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.269
 more than anything because of the vote because it brings you 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.640
 more product this taste is good is 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.860
 the fruit punch you get used to 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.099
 quick the truth to this kind of rust 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.700
 nitric and texture is the same 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.500
 It is always type flour type for hot 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.359
 cakes always always always then 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.069
 this would put it as a second option 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:44.620
 in case there is no neurocor 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.349
 the next one is nano steam this the 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.290
 it's really crap from 1 to 10 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.799
 7 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.650
 you get used to it, you get used to it very quickly 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.250
 to this 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.470
 to this stimulant I think that for 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.900
 the second time you take it because it 's 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.390
 in pills you no longer feel absolutely 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.010
 nothing you do not have congestions the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:14.060
 concentration is that it goes well but not 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.329
 not after we have the no equis nine 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.090
 this was for a long time one of the 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.120
 the best is a pill and it's going 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.919
 releasing this energy all over the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.639
 body according to this but the truth is that 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.530
 not from 1 to 10 of 15 is very expensive in 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.020
 genes and the truth that they want to see the 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:38.199
 face is very expensive not convenient 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.270
 you also get used to the product and 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.120
 go to most of the time you feel 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.759
 the energy post gym already go the 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.819
 you feel almost 23 hours after you 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:52.270
 you take it then it's amazing to pay for 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:55.360
 this this product and it does not have 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.900
 results and the last one because this is the 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.340
 nano steam too long a lot 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.740
 people say that if it works but the 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.400
 truth is lying 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.020
 this 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.340
 from 1 to 10 I give a 4 it looks like flour 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.320
 has good congestion good 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.030
 muscle congestions you do not have 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.920
 concentration or you do not feel the 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.410
 energy needed to 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.680
 to complete your exercise cycle 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.610
 then the truth is I would leave it as 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.610
 last option
