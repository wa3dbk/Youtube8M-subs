00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.740
 Hello, I am a record of chats and today we are going to 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.340
 talk about remineralization by 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.670
 half of two techniques or two instruments 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.029
 prehispanic that is the molcajete and 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.000
 metate to start working with 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.570
 molcajete and the metate first we must 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.130
 make sure that the molcajete or metate 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.520
 are actually made from 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.370
 a stone and not a conglomerate made 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.579
 cementitious powder and stone 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.519
 commercial molcajetes are sometimes 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.370
 precisely made imitations of 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.539
 this way and these do not work for the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.109
 our purposes for purposes of 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.989
 feeding 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:58.140
 they are simply decorative artifacts 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.760
 since we make sure that the molcajete and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.830
 metate that come from volcanic rock 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.180
 called basalt and then we can 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.600
 proceed to cure both of us first we go 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.830
 place some rice in the molcajete 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.100
 and joel in the metate and we made a 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.580
 crushing approximately half an hour 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.950
 until the rice powder is left 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.740
 fully incorporated into the pores of 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.740
 molcajete and the metate and that remain 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.020
 also eliminated the small peaks of 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.290
 remaining stone at the time of elaboration 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.240
 the both artifacts then at the time 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.480
 to crush the rice 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.420
 let's cover the small imperfections 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:50.060
 on the stone and we're also going to sand 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 spikes or loose powder 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:59.430
 after making that mark teo this 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.700
 metal once we realize that 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.310
 sanding is successful we can do it 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.550
 palpating with the fingers on the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.069
 molcajete or on the metate then 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.550
 we can proceed to wash the metate in 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.250
 Water 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:21.040
 of the key and we prepare a body of 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.590
 tomato and proceed to the same 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.590
 operation for half an hour let's 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.590
 incorporating seeds 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.700
 after that we can record through 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.910
 both artifacts and they're ready to 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.360
 the first grind the ideal is that 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.220
 when we grind to the food or the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:54.280
 species or chili or what we prepare in 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.410
 both leave us small particles of 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.010
 powder so that it does not grind between 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.220
 teeth and clear each stone will drop 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.980
 a slightly different flavor in the 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.820
 sauce so there are stones that 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.190
 flavor they raise or mineralize in food or 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.430
 the sauce in a very special way and 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.530
 they are very appreciated by their owners 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.900
 even though 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.050
 all molcajetes may seem 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.690
 similar the stone in the composed in the 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.590
 composition of the stone is not homogeneous 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.620
 and of course it depends on the vein or it depends 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.630
 the place where the stone came 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.700
 will mark 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.190
 precisely the properties not only 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.250
 food but also an active 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.400
 molcajete the metate in case of lack 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.950
 of rice to perform the operation of 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.540
 cured we can use with the same 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.660
 purpose corn grains that also 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.890
 They serve precisely to keep the 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.010
 molcajete and the metate and also serve 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.440
 to fill in the small holes or 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.290
 small cavities that are in 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.409
 the molcajete 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.700
 in the metate I am a record and chats that 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.700
 we talk next week
