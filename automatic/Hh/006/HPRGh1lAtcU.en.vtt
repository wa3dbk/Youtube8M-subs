00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.860 
daunting and lots of fun so now we're in
another<00:04:21.039> level<00:04:21.400> where<00:04:21.579> gravity<00:04:21.909> plays<00:04:22.539> a<00:04:22.659> big

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
another level where gravity plays a big

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.560 
another level where gravity plays a big

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
role you can jump up as you normally

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.300 
role you can jump up as you normally
would<00:04:25.810> in<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:26.139> side-scroller<00:04:26.740> but<00:04:27.039> it<00:04:27.159> also

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
would in a side-scroller but it also

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.399 
would in a side-scroller but it also
goes<00:04:27.669> into<00:04:28.000> a<00:04:28.030> sort<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.330> an<00:04:28.449> inverted<00:04:28.930> mode<00:04:29.139> as

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
goes into a sort of an inverted mode as

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.200 
goes into a sort of an inverted mode as
you<00:04:29.500> can<00:04:29.620> see<00:04:29.800> when<00:04:30.010> she<00:04:30.159> flies<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.940> level

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
you can see when she flies to the level

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.379 
you can see when she flies to the level
they're<00:04:31.830> sort<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.979> switcheroo<00:04:33.400> on<00:04:33.760> on<00:04:34.240> the

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
they're sort of a switcheroo on on the

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.000 
they're sort of a switcheroo on on the
horizon<00:04:34.539> there<00:04:35.050> but<00:04:35.380> it's<00:04:35.500> a<00:04:35.590> lot<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.740> fun<00:04:35.919> to

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
horizon there but it's a lot of fun to

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.529 
horizon there but it's a lot of fun to
play<00:04:36.190> through<00:04:36.430> once<00:04:36.699> you<00:04:36.820> get<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.000> once<00:04:37.479> you

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
play through once you get to once you

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.600 
play through once you get to once you
get<00:04:37.659> used<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:37.990> concept<00:04:38.500> again<00:04:39.400> they're

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
get used to the concept again they're

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.950 
get used to the concept again they're
sort<00:04:39.760> of<00:04:39.820> objective<00:04:39.970> is<00:04:40.389> to<00:04:40.539> cruise<00:04:40.930> through

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
sort of objective is to cruise through

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.409 
sort of objective is to cruise through
the<00:04:41.289> level<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.740> collect<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.159> balloons<00:04:42.490> get

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
the level and collect the balloons get

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:44.760 
the level and collect the balloons get
through<00:04:43.630> it<00:04:43.690> as<00:04:43.780> fast<00:04:43.810> as<00:04:44.199> you<00:04:44.289> can<00:04:44.500> and<00:04:44.560> then

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
through it as fast as you can and then

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.200 
through it as fast as you can and then
you'll<00:04:44.949> be<00:04:45.039> scored<00:04:45.400> against<00:04:45.789> everybody<00:04:46.150> else

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
you'll be scored against everybody else

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.760 
you'll be scored against everybody else
that's<00:04:46.539> that's<00:04:47.139> planted<00:04:47.530> if<00:04:47.650> you're

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
that's that's planted if you're

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.560 
that's that's planted if you're
connected<00:04:48.159> online<00:04:48.280> you'll<00:04:49.030> have<00:04:49.180> access<00:04:49.360> to

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
connected online you'll have access to

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.879 
connected online you'll have access to
those<00:04:49.780> leaderboards<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.590> can<00:04:50.710> see<00:04:50.860> how

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
those leaderboards and you can see how

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.200 
those leaderboards and you can see how
well<00:04:51.159> you<00:04:51.280> did

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
well you did

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.330 
well you did
so<00:04:53.840> I<00:04:53.870> think<00:04:53.960> now<00:04:54.199> we're<00:04:54.770> going<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:54.919> transition

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
so I think now we're going to transition

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.820 
so I think now we're going to transition
we're<00:04:55.610> going<00:04:55.729> to<00:04:55.789> go<00:04:56.169> show<00:04:57.169> some<00:04:57.380> of<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.590> new

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
we're going to go show some of the new

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.320 
we're going to go show some of the new
toy<00:04:58.039> box<00:04:58.280> features<00:04:58.699> that<00:04:58.819> we<00:04:58.940> have<00:04:59.090> in<00:04:59.240> the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
toy box features that we have in the

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.300 
toy box features that we have in the
game<00:04:59.509> as<00:04:59.720> well<00:04:59.870> as<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.199> toy<00:05:00.440> box<00:05:00.620> expansion

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
game as well as the toy box expansion

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.010 
game as well as the toy box expansion
games<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:01.880> I<00:05:02.150> think<00:05:02.509> we're<00:05:02.660> going<00:05:02.750> to<00:05:02.840> walk

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
games so I think we're going to walk

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.210 
games so I think we're going to walk
over<00:05:03.050> here<00:05:03.650> and<00:05:03.770> take<00:05:04.460> a<00:05:04.520> look<00:05:04.669> at<00:05:04.819> that<00:05:04.849> down
