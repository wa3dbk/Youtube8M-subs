00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.270 
called your brake bias and what it does
is<00:02:06.240> by<00:02:06.390> turn<00:02:06.660> this<00:02:06.869> knob<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.560> left<00:02:07.800> it'll<00:02:08.100> give

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
is by turn this knob the left it'll give

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.669 
is by turn this knob the left it'll give
more<00:02:08.580> front<00:02:09.509> brake<00:02:09.840> if<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.229> turn<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
more front brake if I turn it to the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.590 
more front brake if I turn it to the
right<00:02:10.770> it'll<00:02:11.220> give<00:02:11.340> more<00:02:11.580> rear<00:02:11.820> brake<00:02:12.090> which

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
right it'll give more rear brake which

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.880 
right it'll give more rear brake which
ultimately<00:02:12.780> affects<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.440> handling<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
car this is obviously a fire hazard I've

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.400 
car this is obviously a fire hazard I've
never<00:02:17.490> personally<00:02:18.209> in<00:02:18.480> my<00:02:18.600> career<00:02:18.840> had<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.260> hit

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
never personally in my career had to hit

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
the fire bottle but in case of a fire

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.690 
the fire bottle but in case of a fire
and<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:22.080> can't<00:02:22.380> get<00:02:22.530> out<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:23.220> go<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.459> hit

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and I can't get out I can go and hit

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.550 
and I can't get out I can go and hit
this<00:02:23.910> button<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.690> there's<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.930> fire<00:02:25.140> bottle<00:02:25.470> in

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
this button and there's a fire bottle in

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.020 
this button and there's a fire bottle in
here<00:02:25.680> that's<00:02:25.890> wired<00:02:26.100> throughout<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.580> car<00:02:26.760> and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
here that's wired throughout the car and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.570 
here that's wired throughout the car and
it'll<00:02:27.690> extinguish<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.290> fire<00:02:28.500> out<00:02:28.739> but<00:02:29.100> it's<00:02:29.550> a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
it'll extinguish the fire out but it's a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.340 
it'll extinguish the fire out but it's a
pretty<00:02:29.760> big<00:02:29.970> mess<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.360> I'd<00:02:30.810> rather<00:02:30.930> get<00:02:31.140> out<00:02:31.260> of

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
pretty big mess so I'd rather get out of

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.750 
pretty big mess so I'd rather get out of
the<00:02:31.410> car<00:02:31.620> before<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.980> hit<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.310> button<00:02:32.550> and

the car before I hit that button and
right<00:02:33.090> here<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.570> switch<00:02:34.019> for<00:02:34.170> my<00:02:34.260> cool<00:02:34.500> shirt

instead of your normal aged pattern to
the<00:02:50.280> upshift<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.760> just<00:02:50.940> go<00:02:51.180> ahead<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.420> pull

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
the upshift you just go ahead and pull

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.180 
the upshift you just go ahead and pull
this<00:02:51.720> thing<00:02:51.930> back<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.440> downshift<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:53.040> just

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
this thing back to downshift you just

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.590 
this thing back to downshift you just
put<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.459> forward<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:53.970> up<00:02:54.120> high<00:02:54.299> enough

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
put you forward it's up high enough

put you forward it's up high enough
where<00:02:54.870> if<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.140> my<00:02:55.260> hands<00:02:55.530> are<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.769> wheel<00:02:55.890> and

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
where if I my hands are on the wheel and

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.949 
where if I my hands are on the wheel and
I<00:02:56.280> need<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.519> go<00:02:56.670> shifting<00:02:57.090> gear<00:02:57.299> it's<00:02:57.720> right

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
I need to go shifting gear it's right

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.780 
I need to go shifting gear it's right
next<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:58.769> grab<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> gear<00:02:59.310> forward

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
next to it so I can grab a gear forward

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.270 
next to it so I can grab a gear forward
or<00:02:59.970> back<00:03:00.420> really<00:03:00.780> easily<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.380> that's<00:03:02.100> pretty

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
you're going but this is basically where

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.199 
you're going but this is basically where
all<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.160> brake<00:03:32.340> lines<00:03:32.580> are<00:03:32.760> held<00:03:32.910> all

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
all the brake lines are held all

all the brake lines are held all
electronics<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.020> computers<00:03:34.410> up<00:03:34.560> here<00:03:34.770> and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
electronics the computers up here and

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.250 
electronics the computers up here and
the<00:03:35.640> main<00:03:35.819> part<00:03:36.120> up<00:03:36.390> here<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.840> fuel<00:03:37.050> cell

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
the main part up here is the fuel cell

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.930 
the main part up here is the fuel cell
definitely<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.100> go<00:03:38.310> ahead<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.580> give<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.819> guys

a<00:03:38.970> look<00:03:39.270> at<00:03:39.450> my<00:03:39.660> racing<00:03:40.050> motor<00:03:40.230> which<00:03:40.440> is

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
a look at my racing motor which is

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.229 
a look at my racing motor which is
essentially<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.010> same<00:03:41.040> motor<00:03:41.610> that's<00:03:41.910> in<00:03:42.060> the

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
essentially the same motor that's in the

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.250 
essentially the same motor that's in the
street-legal<00:03:42.750> gt3<00:03:43.530> RS<00:03:44.750> pop<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.900> thing<00:03:45.959> open

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
street-legal gt3 RS pop this thing open

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.620 
street-legal gt3 RS pop this thing open
as<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.100> can<00:03:47.250> see<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.580> really<00:03:47.820> is<00:03:47.940> your<00:03:48.150> same

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
as you can see it really is your same

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.199 
as you can see it really is your same
3.8<00:03:49.350> motor<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.769> puts<00:03:49.980> out<00:03:50.100> about<00:03:50.310> 450

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
3.8 motor that puts out about 450

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.670 
3.8 motor that puts out about 450
horsepower<00:03:51.480> that's<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.080> same<00:03:52.290> motor<00:03:52.500> that

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
horsepower that's the same motor that

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.900 
horsepower that's the same motor that
it's<00:03:52.800> come<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.160> street<00:03:53.400> car<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.760> only

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
it's come to the street car the only

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.250 
it's come to the street car the only
difference<00:03:54.269> is<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.959> catalytic

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
difference is that the catalytic

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.870 
difference is that the catalytic
converter<00:03:55.380> racing<00:03:56.220> components<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:56.670> are<00:03:56.790> in

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
converter racing components that are in

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:08.680 
converter racing components that are in
here<00:03:57.000> along<00:03:57.420> with<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.780> sequential<00:03:58.290> shifter
