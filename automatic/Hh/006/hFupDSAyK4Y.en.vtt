a<00:02:31.829> race<00:02:32.310> as<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> stylin<00:02:33.329> quite<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.629> few<00:02:33.870> years

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
a race as a stylin quite a few years

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.009 
a race as a stylin quite a few years
back<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:35.250> looks<00:02:35.430> pretty<00:02:35.700> damn<00:02:35.970> decent<00:02:36.269> in<00:02:36.750> I

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
back it looks pretty damn decent in I

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.479 
back it looks pretty damn decent in I
don't<00:02:37.230> have<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.409> call<00:02:37.590> spread<00:02:37.890> too<00:02:37.980> hard<00:02:38.220> but

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
don't have the call spread too hard but

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.550 
don't have the call spread too hard but
I'm<00:02:38.970> fairly<00:02:39.390> sure<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.989> feast<00:02:40.260> didn't

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
I'm fairly sure that the feast didn't

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.699 
I'm fairly sure that the feast didn't
really<00:02:40.799> look<00:02:40.980> like<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:42.319> but<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:43.349> can't

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
really look like that but I can't

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.330 
really look like that but I can't
actually<00:02:43.890> remember<00:02:44.690> again<00:02:45.980> some<00:02:46.980> reason<00:02:47.220> of

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
actually remember again some reason of

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.009 
actually remember again some reason of
what<00:02:47.519> she<00:02:47.609> was<00:02:47.730> actually<00:02:47.849> frowning<00:02:48.540> on<00:02:48.629> it<00:02:48.780> was

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
what she was actually frowning on it was

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.979 
what she was actually frowning on it was
yeah<00:02:49.560> well<00:02:49.739> who<00:02:49.859> cares<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:51.120> rest<00:02:51.329> of<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.599> it's

a<00:03:24.599> better<00:03:24.720> version<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.319> this<00:03:25.470> one<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.730> not

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
a better version of this one this is not

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.030 
a better version of this one this is not
normal<00:03:27.599> Robin<00:03:28.500> done<00:03:28.769> with<00:03:29.220> by<00:03:29.700> impressed<00:03:30.060> or

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
normal Robin done with by impressed or

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.550 
normal Robin done with by impressed or
his<00:03:32.040> handiwork<00:03:32.609> really<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.780> it's<00:03:34.169> not<00:03:34.319> a<00:03:34.349> bad

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
his handiwork really and it's not a bad

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.650 
his handiwork really and it's not a bad
figured<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.310> after<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.790> DPC<00:03:36.209> effort<00:03:36.569> just

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
figured just after the DPC effort just

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.580 
figured just after the DPC effort just
seems<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.049> bit<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.379> letdown<00:03:37.650> merely<00:03:38.310> and

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
seems a bit of a letdown merely and

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.080 
seems a bit of a letdown merely and
doesn't<00:03:40.590> really<00:03:40.739> i<00:03:41.040> don't<00:03:41.340> need<00:03:41.639> to<00:03:41.760> get<00:03:41.970> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
doesn't really i don't need to get the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.030 
doesn't really i don't need to get the
feeling<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.750> but<00:03:43.079> i<00:03:43.109> should<00:03:43.349> be<00:03:43.620> looked<00:03:43.859> at

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
feeling that but i should be looked at

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.170 
feeling that but i should be looked at
the<00:03:44.129> course<00:03:44.340> but<00:03:44.519> i<00:03:44.549> think<00:03:44.760> they<00:03:44.819> just<00:03:44.910> sort<00:03:45.120> of

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
the course but i think they just sort of

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.970 
the course but i think they just sort of
took<00:03:45.389> the<00:03:45.449> am<00:03:48.169> pieces<00:03:49.169> of<00:03:49.319> it<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.620> then<00:03:49.739> just

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
took the am pieces of it and then just

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.089 
took the am pieces of it and then just
quickly<00:03:50.280> made<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.579> figure<00:03:50.940> out<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:52.099> the

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
quickly made a figure out of it the

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.930 
quickly made a figure out of it the
beasts<00:03:53.579> once<00:03:54.329> again<00:03:54.709> at<00:03:55.790> pinecrest<00:03:56.790> or

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
beasts once again at pinecrest or

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.750 
beasts once again at pinecrest or
Magister<00:03:57.359> prove<00:03:57.660> us<00:03:57.840> all<00:03:57.959> wrong<00:03:58.340> by<00:03:59.340> not<00:03:59.370> even

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
Magister prove us all wrong by not even

looking at orders color work the boys

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.199 
looking at orders color work the boys
realize<00:04:02.430> if<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:02.669> deed<00:04:03.000> then<00:04:03.900> it's<00:04:04.109> brown<00:04:04.620> eyes

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
realize if the deed then it's brown eyes

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.189 
realize if the deed then it's brown eyes
i'm<00:04:06.209> sure<00:04:06.449> i<00:04:06.480> see<00:04:06.690> that<00:04:06.840> would<00:04:06.989> pretty<00:04:07.109> much

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
i'm sure i see that would pretty much

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.650 
i'm sure i see that would pretty much
every<00:04:07.560> Robin<00:04:07.889> figure<00:04:08.160> be<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.459> but<00:04:08.639> it's<00:04:09.449> based

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
every Robin figure be it but it's based

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.659 
every Robin figure be it but it's based
on<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.870> color<00:04:10.079> spreads<00:04:10.470> then<00:04:11.099> yeah<00:04:11.459> that

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
on the color spreads then yeah that

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.449 
on the color spreads then yeah that
really<00:04:11.819> should<00:04:12.629> be<00:04:12.680> decent<00:04:13.680> off<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.280> color

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.150 
just compared to the DBC efforts just a
bit<00:05:34.700> of<00:05:34.729> a<00:05:34.789> letdown<00:05:35.260> so<00:05:36.260> yeah<00:05:36.470> that's<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.979> new

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
bit of a letdown so yeah that's the new

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.830 
bit of a letdown so yeah that's the new
snug<00:05:37.760> girls<00:05:38.060> line<00:05:38.750> but<00:05:39.500> line<00:05:39.740> set<00:05:40.690> thanks<00:05:41.690> and

unfortunately<00:05:42.410> it's<00:05:42.650> bit<00:05:42.860> of<00:05:42.979> a<00:05:43.130> real<00:05:43.370> letdown

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
unfortunately it's bit of a real letdown

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.550 
unfortunately it's bit of a real letdown
compared<00:05:44.570> to<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.720> previous<00:05:44.930> ones<00:05:45.289> I<00:05:45.530> think

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
compared to the previous ones I think

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.150 
compared to the previous ones I think
maybe<00:05:46.070> it's<00:05:46.310> because<00:05:46.460> Robin<00:05:47.000> has<00:05:47.720> had<00:05:47.900> a<00:05:48.160> far

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
maybe it's because Robin has had a far

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.760 
maybe it's because Robin has had a far
better<00:05:49.580> figure<00:05:50.450> recently<00:05:51.050> released<00:05:51.229> him<00:05:51.650> I
