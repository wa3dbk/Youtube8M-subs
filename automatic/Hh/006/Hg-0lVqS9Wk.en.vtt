as<00:02:00.180> we<00:02:00.660> see<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.980> the<00:02:02.970> zapper<00:02:03.180> circuit

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
as we see here in the zapper circuit

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
as we see here in the zapper circuit
this<00:02:04.650> is<00:02:04.830> basically<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:06.410> rectifier<00:02:07.410> which

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
this is basically a rectifier which

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.090 
this is basically a rectifier which
converts<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> AC<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.940> DC<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.710> then<00:02:10.710> this<00:02:10.860> dish

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
converts the AC to DC and then this dish

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.180 
converts the AC to DC and then this dish
is<00:02:11.250> given<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.760> these<00:02:12.650> universal<00:02:13.650> caps<00:02:13.920> of

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
is given to these universal caps of

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.420 
is given to these universal caps of
three<00:02:14.580> kb<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.930> reason<00:02:16.290> why<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:16.620> did<00:02:16.770> not<00:02:16.920> take

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
three kb the reason why we did not take

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.000 
three kb the reason why we did not take
out<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.090> rectifier<00:02:18.540> circuit<00:02:18.930> from<00:02:19.050> here<00:02:19.350> is

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
out the rectifier circuit from here is

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.690 
out the rectifier circuit from here is
because<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:21.180> transformer<00:02:21.780> has<00:02:21.960> an<00:02:22.700> inverter

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
because the transformer has an inverter

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.530 
because the transformer has an inverter
circuit<00:02:24.210> in<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.700> that's<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.150> reason<00:02:27.180> why

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
circuit in it so that's the reason why

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.800 
circuit in it so that's the reason why
we<00:02:27.780> require<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.710> supply<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.370> DC<00:02:29.790> which<00:02:30.510> then

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
we require to supply the DC which then

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.190 
we require to supply the DC which then
gets<00:02:31.080> again<00:02:31.560> inverted<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.400> EC<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.150> then<00:02:34.050> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
gets again inverted to EC and then the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.230 
gets again inverted to EC and then the
output<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.830> rectified<00:02:35.460> again<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.880> has<00:02:36.060> an

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
output is rectified again it has an

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.690 
output is rectified again it has an
inverter<00:02:36.630> circuit<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.890> rectifier<00:02:38.310> circuit

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
inverter circuit and a rectifier circuit

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.410 
inverter circuit and a rectifier circuit
in<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:40.170> that's<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.100> reason<00:02:41.130> why<00:02:41.580> we<00:02:42.150> didn't

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
in it so that's the reason why we didn't

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.080 
in it so that's the reason why we didn't
touch<00:02:42.690> or<00:02:43.560> manipulate<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.400> zapper<00:02:44.610> circuit

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
touch or manipulate the zapper circuit

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.630 
touch or manipulate the zapper circuit
which<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.390> seen<00:02:45.750> there<00:02:46.370> now<00:02:47.370> for<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
which is seen there now for the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.670 
which is seen there now for the
directional<00:02:48.090> strike<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:49.110> told<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.470> is

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
directional strike as I told you this is

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.220 
directional strike as I told you this is
the<00:02:49.710> negative<00:02:50.670> terminal<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.540> second<00:02:52.050> ring

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the negative terminal of the second ring

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.890 
the negative terminal of the second ring
hello<00:02:52.620> pity<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.820> we'll<00:02:54.030> be<00:02:54.210> basically<00:02:54.540> keeping

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
hello pity so we'll be basically keeping

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.250 
hello pity so we'll be basically keeping
plates<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:55.740> all<00:02:56.280> around<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.300> this

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
plates here all around this and this

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.810 
plates here all around this and this
will<00:02:58.470> be<00:02:58.620> one<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.130> plate<00:02:59.370> where<00:02:59.760> the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
will be one of the plate where the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.860 
will be one of the plate where the
strike<00:03:00.240> will<00:03:00.960> hit<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.700> that's<00:03:02.940> how<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.840> are

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
strike will hit so that's how we are

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.350 
strike will hit so that's how we are
going<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.260> give<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> targeted<00:03:05.880> directional

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
going to give a targeted directional

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.800 
going to give a targeted directional
strike<00:03:06.660> on<00:03:06.870> enemy<00:03:07.230> vehicles<00:03:07.620> or<00:03:07.950> infantry<00:03:08.810> so

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
strike on enemy vehicles or infantry so

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.740 
strike on enemy vehicles or infantry so
this<00:03:09.989> is<00:03:10.110> just<00:03:10.260> basically<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.220> demonstrate<00:03:11.880> my

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
this is just basically to demonstrate my

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.340 
this is just basically to demonstrate my
real<00:03:12.959> project<00:03:13.440> will<00:03:13.590> basically<00:03:13.970> deal<00:03:14.970> with

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
real project will basically deal with

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.000 
real project will basically deal with
nearly<00:03:16.350> 500<00:03:16.860> kV<00:03:18.050> so<00:03:19.050> without<00:03:19.410> further<00:03:19.680> ado

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
nearly 500 kV so without further ado

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.479 
nearly 500 kV so without further ado
let's<00:03:20.520> turn<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.600> on<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.910> now<00:03:24.150> we<00:03:24.209> see

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.920 

circuit<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.609> turned<00:03:28.849> on<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.599> can<00:03:29.629> see<00:03:29.900> the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
circuit is turned on you can see the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.459 
circuit is turned on you can see the
spark<00:03:30.379> that<00:03:31.129> is<00:03:31.340> developed<00:03:31.790> on<00:03:31.909> the<00:03:32.030> spark<00:03:32.299> a

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:35.469 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:41.470 

spark<00:03:36.469> at

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.690 

it<00:03:42.480> gives<00:03:42.750> totally<00:03:43.380> around<00:03:43.770> five<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.430> six

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
it gives totally around five to six

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.720 
it gives totally around five to six
centimeters<00:03:44.880> park<00:03:48.290> which<00:03:49.290> can<00:03:49.560> be<00:03:49.770> seen<00:03:50.460> very

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
centimeters park which can be seen very

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:59.570 
centimeters park which can be seen very
well<00:03:56.870> six<00:03:57.870> centimeter<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.070> directional

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
well six centimeter so the directional

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.360 
well six centimeter so the directional
strike<00:03:59.910> will<00:04:00.090> be<00:04:00.209> basically<00:04:00.600> like<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.370> we

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
strike will be basically like this we

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.250 
strike will be basically like this we
keep<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.700> metalic<00:04:03.090> plate<00:04:03.330> here<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.720> we'll

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
keep the metalic plate here and we'll

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.540 
keep the metalic plate here and we'll
get<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:05.280> spark<00:04:05.580> gap<00:04:05.760> is<00:04:05.970> here<00:04:06.240> as<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:07.350> can<00:04:07.380> see

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.880 

and<00:04:12.020> this<00:04:13.020> is<00:04:13.140> how<00:04:13.290> we<00:04:13.350> are<00:04:13.500> going<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.709> achieve

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
and this is how we are going to achieve

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.849 
and this is how we are going to achieve
the<00:04:14.310> strike<00:04:14.640> on<00:04:15.239> enemy<00:04:15.750> vehicles<00:04:16.169> Oh<00:04:16.350> enemy

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
the strike on enemy vehicles Oh enemy

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.400 
the strike on enemy vehicles Oh enemy
personnel<00:04:17.840> thereby<00:04:18.840> rending<00:04:19.230> them

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
personnel thereby rending them

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.040 
personnel thereby rending them
defenseless
