00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.039
 hello I'm sarah one of the teachers of 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.469
 your course in this video I'll explain 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.689
 a few small strokes of what 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.789
 could be the hotel management for it 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.119
 we have called it an introduction to 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.550
 hotel management in this case what 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.640
 first thing I want you to see is that the 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.159
 sector or the hotel sector has a 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.800
 perishable service is to say that there is 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:36.410
 certain simultaneity between consumption and 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.210
 the service for that reason in the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.430
 activity can not talk about a 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.800
 uniformity since it is seasonal and 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.440
 it depends on the place that wants us 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.240
 to say then what it tells us is that no 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.580
 is going to be neither going to lend the same 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.220
 service a hotel that we are in 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.580
 the mountain that you are going to have your time 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.380
 summit in the winter season with the 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.240
 ski resorts that one that we 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.710
 let's find for example in the 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.879
 Caribbean with sun beaches and people going 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.530
 basically to rest 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.079
 for that reason I want to give you now a 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.150
 little brushstroke of what the 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.830
 contracts that can be made and how 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.510
 can manage the hotel 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.730
 we will deepen this 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.960
 in the next seminar 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.600
 we will announce through the virtual campus 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.400
 but I want you to have some guidelines for 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.440
 that you know about what we are going to talk about and 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.840
 about what we are going to discuss 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.730
 typologies of the hotel companies 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.890
 as I said the contracts are very 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.650
 diverse in this case let's see five 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.570
 the management contracts in this case 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.760
 what happens then we have an agreement 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.680
 between the owner company and a 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.170
 Company management company 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.700
 owner decides on the capital and 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.890
 a management company that is going to decide 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.229
 about the operative is to say I can 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.630
 have a hotel I can have a lot of money 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.000
 but I can not have much idea about 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.370
 how to manage a hotel because this would be 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.260
 for example what would best for me 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.330
 what then because I would provide a capital 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.280
 and another person would have to give me 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.950
 accounts on the management and operational 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.920
 from that hotel the second one that I love you 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.450
 indicate is a lease 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.580
 here basically so I want to make you 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.470
 emphasis in case I had some doubts 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.120
 between what is a landlord and a 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.620
 lessee because if you do not go to 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.730
 understand correctly this this 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.170
 contract 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.490
 imagine that you live in a flat 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.170
 rent the landlord 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.480
 staff that is on the floor and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.260
 tenant the person who pays a 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.090
 canon or a bearing about making use of that 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.760
 property because in this case it is the same 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.700
 there is a lease there is an agreement 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.350
 between the property and a manager on 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.570
 the rental of the hotel business and not 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.880
 of the establishment is to say that it is not 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.580
 renting the business not your own 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.400
 physical establishment itself we have 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.860
 also the franchise contract equal 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.750
 that the landlord and the tenant who 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.690
 we are the franchisor and the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.060
 franchisee in this case the agreement of 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.730
 cooperation is between the management company 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.350
 and the owner company what happens in 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.810
 this case then that the company 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.330
 franchisor will be the one that gives the 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.550
 right to use your policies in return 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.840
 of a payment in addition to its policies 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.989
 it can be your operational form and others 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.360
 we turn to the fourth type of contract or 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.060
 possible management in a hotel and it is the 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.860
 affiliation to a hotel group in 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.540
 this case will also be an agreement 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.510
 but what is going to happen then what is going to 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.989
 have access to a commercial structure 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.540
 already some benefits and this is going to be a 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.459
 kind of symbiosis because because a 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.500
 independent hotel will be able to have 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.170
 coverage at the commercial level both 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.450
 national and international level of a 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.950
 from a cold in a little bigger that is going to 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.739
 help then take off 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.900
 or that your income better for another 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.780
 side and finally I imagine that it will be the 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.549
 What else will you think of your own management? 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.620
 this case is the owner who in 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.650
 manages the establishment in its entirety 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.540
 both capital and operational 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.790
 did not want to put a very good example 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.030
 simple a family hotel a house 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.190
 rural is going to be the one who is going to manage 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.569
 everything all everything from the agreement with 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.030
 suppliers until dealing with customers 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.799
 on the other hand and seeing the contracts 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.509
 I want you to see also in the 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.669
 main hotel areas in which 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:21.729
 we are going to move you have to have very 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.169
 clear that management is a very 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.910
 big and we could be talking about 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.220
 she for a long time that's why I give you 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.380
 these small these little guidelines that 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.720
 they will serve you as main areas 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.789
 hotels have to take into account the 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.500
 administration in finance and we 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.750
 let's find inside this 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.660
 department then both the accounting 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.400
 analytic as the general as well as the 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.750
 account management amortizations 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.300
 taxes within what is the 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.580
 taxation of the company on the other hand 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.560
 well human resources here that we're going to 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.560
 find us then contract management 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.539
 training posts and so on 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.650
 maintenance we have to have in 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.259
 mind that you have to have a 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.610
 planning security systems see 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.250
 that everything is correct a maintenance 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.690
 corrective etcetera the area of ​​the 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.210
 sales is very important because here 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.949
 We will have the management of the clients 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.169
 and the logistics as always the management 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.669
 from products suppliers we have very 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.070
 clear the stock that we have what we 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.630
 what we do not do not 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.729
 we have to ask this one 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.639
 etc 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.259
 for that reason in the webinar that you 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.289
 I was commenting we will also review 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:28.779
 information systems management 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.430
 of clients in full management 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.460
 basic income because you already know that 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.439
 our motto practically what 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.229
 we look at hotel management is 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:40.319
 fill the hotel to the maximum amount 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.639
 possible in the best possible way 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:45.219
 we also have to analyze key figures 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.490
 costs what the staff costs us what 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.839
 what it costs us is to place an order 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.669
 out of the time in which we have to 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:54.279
 do all those things we're going to 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.919
 analyze and for that reason the only thing that 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:59.889
 I want to do and it is to hope that I have 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.749
 liked this little introduction and that 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.300
 If you are interested in this topic, you will sign up 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:06.610
 the seminar that we will announce 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.960
 soon in the virtual campus for 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.300
 Any doubt you have to me 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.629
 disposition and nothing simply that you 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.629
 we wait 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.530
 two
