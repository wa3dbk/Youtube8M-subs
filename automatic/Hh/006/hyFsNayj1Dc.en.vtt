knuckle<00:00:00.390> right<00:00:00.570> here<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.960> what's<00:00:01.199> going<00:00:01.290> to

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
knuckle right here is what's going to

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.110 
knuckle right here is what's going to
touch<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:01.770> top<00:00:02.040> of<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.280> knife<00:00:02.460> you're<00:00:02.820> not

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
touch the top of the knife you're not

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.360 
touch the top of the knife you're not
ever<00:00:03.389> in<00:00:03.600> danger<00:00:04.110> because<00:00:04.680> your<00:00:04.950> fingers<00:00:05.250> are

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
ever in danger because your fingers are

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.560 
ever in danger because your fingers are
curled<00:00:05.520> our<00:00:05.730> underling<00:00:06.470> okay<00:00:08.330> that's<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
curled our underling okay that's the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.799 
curled our underling okay that's the
trick<00:00:09.920> okay<00:00:10.920> that's<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.210> it's<00:00:12.330> these<00:00:12.630> three

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
trick okay that's it so it's these three

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.660 
trick okay that's it so it's these three
fingers<00:00:12.990> they<00:00:13.200> have<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.530> be<00:00:13.620> together<00:00:13.710> they're

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
fingers they have to be together they're

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.400 
fingers they have to be together they're
curled<00:00:14.940> under<00:00:15.210> slightly<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.900> like<00:00:16.020> that

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
curled under slightly just like that

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.080 
curled under slightly just like that
so<00:00:16.710> pre-cut<00:00:17.220> anything<00:00:17.520> should<00:00:17.699> just<00:00:17.820> get<00:00:17.940> used

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
so pre-cut anything should just get used

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.570 
so pre-cut anything should just get used
to<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.210> motion<00:00:18.710> you<00:00:19.710> should<00:00:19.890> never<00:00:20.039> practice

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
to the motion you should never practice

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.380 
to the motion you should never practice
this<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.910> first<00:00:21.029> time<00:00:21.210> when<00:00:21.300> you're

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this for the first time when you're

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.540 
this for the first time when you're
cooking<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.660> meal<00:00:21.689> like<00:00:22.590> no<00:00:22.800> steaks<00:00:23.100> practice

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
cooking a meal like no steaks practice

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
cooking a meal like no steaks practice
get<00:00:23.699> some<00:00:23.820> celery<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.330> practice<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.470> from

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
get some celery in just practice so from

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.400 
get some celery in just practice so from
here<00:00:25.920> that's<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.880> okay<00:00:27.510> there<00:00:28.170> are<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.260> couple

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
here that's it okay there are a couple

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.509 
here that's it okay there are a couple
of<00:00:28.560> different<00:00:28.830> ways<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
of different ways to do it

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.999 
of different ways to do it
the<00:00:30.029> French<00:00:30.300> technique<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.679> find

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the French technique is like this I find

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.069 
the French technique is like this I find
it<00:00:32.130> more<00:00:32.250> complicated<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.780> what<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.930> recommend

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
it more complicated so what I recommend

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.209 
it more complicated so what I recommend
people<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:35.570> you're<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> have

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
people do is you're going to have

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.319 
people do is you're going to have
fingernails<00:00:38.219> down<00:00:39.170> thumb<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> back<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
fingernails down thumb on the back and

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.600 
fingernails down thumb on the back and
then<00:00:42.350> I'm<00:00:43.350> looking<00:00:43.469> straight<00:00:43.860> down<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.309> blade

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
then I'm looking straight down the blade

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.180 
then I'm looking straight down the blade
and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> motions<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.350> my<00:00:46.530> elbow<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and then the motions from my elbow and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.319 
and then the motions from my elbow and
I'm<00:00:47.489> actually<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.820> doing<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:49.020> okay

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
I'm actually just doing this okay

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.430 
I'm actually just doing this okay

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
raising it just enough to clear the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.119
