untrained<00:00:04.380> eye<00:00:04.859> it<00:00:04.890> looks<00:00:05.130> like<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.339> pretty<00:00:05.819> big

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
untrained eye it looks like a pretty big

aeroplane<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:07.379> don't<00:00:07.919> know<00:00:07.980> if<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.160> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
aeroplane I don't know if that is the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.919 
aeroplane I don't know if that is the
case<00:00:08.429> but<00:00:08.820> if<00:00:08.940> that<00:00:09.090> has<00:00:09.330> ditched<00:00:09.660> and

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
case but if that has ditched and

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.680 
case but if that has ditched and
obviously<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.349> say<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> big<00:00:11.160> if<00:00:11.690> what

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
obviously we say that is a big if what

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.570 
obviously we say that is a big if what
would<00:00:13.110> actually<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.620> visible<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.309> think

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
would actually be visible do you think

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.670 
would actually be visible do you think
in<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> CR<00:00:15.299> these<00:00:15.450> airplanes<00:00:15.809> designed<00:00:16.109> to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
in the CR these airplanes designed to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.349 
in the CR these airplanes designed to
have<00:00:17.250> bits<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.699> them<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:17.940> essentially

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
have bits of them which essentially

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.099 
have bits of them which essentially
float<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.260> water<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.029> the<00:00:21.029> if<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
float on the water and the if the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.170 
float on the water and the if the
aeroplane<00:00:22.470> ditched<00:00:22.740> yes<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> big<00:00:23.970> error

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
aeroplane ditched yes it is a big error

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.910 
aeroplane ditched yes it is a big error
by<00:00:24.240> no<00:00:24.449> means<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.810> approximately<00:00:25.289> 60<00:00:25.590> metres

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
by no means is approximately 60 metres

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.060 
by no means is approximately 60 metres
wingspan<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.439> little<00:00:28.769> smaller

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
wingspan so it's just a little smaller

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.479 
wingspan so it's just a little smaller
than<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.400> 747<00:00:30.529> so<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.710> quite<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> considerably

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
than a 747 so it is quite a considerably

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.950 
than a 747 so it is quite a considerably
large<00:00:33.390> wide<00:00:33.690> bodied<00:00:34.020> aeroplane<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.960> what

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
large wide bodied aeroplane and the what

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.110 
large wide bodied aeroplane and the what
would<00:00:37.079> happen<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.829> ditching<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.850> saw<00:00:39.090> in

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
would happen in a ditching as you saw in

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.959 
would happen in a ditching as you saw in
the<00:00:39.329> New<00:00:39.840> York<00:00:40.079> accident<00:00:40.649> recently<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.550> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the New York accident recently is it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.959 
the New York accident recently is it
likely<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.600> engines<00:00:43.020> would<00:00:43.260> detach<00:00:43.820> and<00:00:44.820> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
likely the engines would detach and it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.700 
likely the engines would detach and it
could<00:00:45.239> well<00:00:45.390> float<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.350> was<00:00:46.500> ditched

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
could well float if it was ditched

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.619 
could well float if it was ditched
properly<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.789> could<00:00:47.969> well<00:00:48.180> float<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
properly it could well float for a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.950 
properly it could well float for a
considerable<00:00:49.020> period<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.559> time<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.820> way<00:00:51.690> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
considerable period of time the way that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.410 
considerable period of time the way that
they<00:00:52.170> will<00:00:52.320> find<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> aeroplane<00:00:53.280> could<00:00:54.239> well

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
they will find the aeroplane could well

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.099 
they will find the aeroplane could well
be<00:00:54.600> through<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.940> transmitters<00:00:56.940> mounted<00:00:57.510> in

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the black boxes as you call them so they

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.009

told about the inflatable shoots and
we're<00:01:44.520> told<00:01:44.700> they're<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> life<00:01:45.119> raft<00:01:45.570> life

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
we're told they're a life raft life

prove much practical help well i think

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
prove much practical help well i think
that<00:01:54.540> there's<00:01:54.750> always<00:01:54.960> been<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.320> theory

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that there's always been this theory

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.969 
that there's always been this theory
that<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.700> any<00:01:56.880> accident<00:01:57.479> your<00:01:58.439> fate<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.950> in

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that in any accident your fate is in

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
that in any accident your fate is in
your<00:01:59.280> own<00:01:59.460> hands<00:01:59.909> or<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.780> too<00:02:00.990> late<00:02:01.170> there's

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
your own hands or it's too late there's

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.350 
your own hands or it's too late there's
nothing<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:02.009> about<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:03.180> really

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
nothing you can do about it that really

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.870 
nothing you can do about it that really
is<00:02:03.540> incorrect<00:02:04.250> there's<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.310> very<00:02:05.759> high

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
is incorrect there's a very high

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.880 
is incorrect there's a very high
survival<00:02:06.390> chance<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.049> lot<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.439> types<00:02:07.680> of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
survival chance of a lot of types of

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.249 
survival chance of a lot of types of
accidents<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.429> aeroplanes<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.300> which<00:02:10.110> is

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
accidents that aeroplanes have which is

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
accidents that aeroplanes have which is
why<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.440> safety<00:02:10.890> briefing<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.340> given<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.849> I

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
why the safety briefing is given and I

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.220 
why the safety briefing is given and I
think<00:02:12.209> that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
think that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.589 
think that
a<00:02:13.260> lot<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.739> people<00:02:14.069> decided<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.269> any

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
a lot of people decided that any

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.030 
a lot of people decided that any
ditching<00:02:16.200> was<00:02:16.349> going<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.680> completely

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
ditching was going to be completely

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.570 
ditching was going to be completely
fatal<00:02:17.549> or<00:02:17.879> as<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.299> saw<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.540> New<00:02:18.989> York<00:02:19.260> recently

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
fatal or as you saw in New York recently

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.699 
fatal or as you saw in New York recently
with<00:02:20.580> an<00:02:21.209> unplanned<00:02:21.599> itching<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.379> only<00:02:22.530> a

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
with an unplanned itching with only a

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.670 
with an unplanned itching with only a
few<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.730> couple<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.180> minutes<00:02:24.299> notice<00:02:24.690> they

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
few a couple of minutes notice they

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.140 
few a couple of minutes notice they
managed<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.040> get<00:02:26.220> everybody<00:02:26.730> at<00:02:26.909> you<00:02:27.030> know

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
managed to get everybody at you know

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.619 
managed to get everybody at you know
everybody<00:02:27.900> out<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.349> airplane<00:02:28.650> now<00:02:29.629> the

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
everybody out of the airplane now the

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.770 
everybody out of the airplane now the
subsequent<00:02:31.200> rescue<00:02:31.860> having<00:02:32.790> got<00:02:33.209> people<00:02:33.540> out

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
subsequent rescue having got people out

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.800 
subsequent rescue having got people out
you<00:02:34.680> now<00:02:34.890> need<00:02:35.129> to<00:02:35.190> collect<00:02:35.970> those<00:02:36.150> people<00:02:36.599> and

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
you now need to collect those people and

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.390 
you now need to collect those people and
get<00:02:36.930> them<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.110> land<00:02:37.410> which<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:37.920> considerably

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
get them to land which is considerably

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.250 
get them to land which is considerably
more<00:02:38.519> difficult<00:02:38.629> in<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.900> South<00:02:40.110> Atlantic

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
more difficult in the South Atlantic

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.100 
more difficult in the South Atlantic
than<00:02:40.799> it<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.040> obviously<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:42.090> busy<00:02:42.629> central<00:02:42.900> New

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
than it is obviously in busy central New

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.479 
than it is obviously in busy central New
York<00:02:43.579> so<00:02:44.579> I<00:02:44.989> think<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.230> enough<00:02:46.829> history<00:02:47.040> to

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
York so I think that enough history to

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.490 
York so I think that enough history to
be<00:02:47.579> able<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.790> say<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.239> aeroplanes<00:02:49.110> can

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
be able to say that aeroplanes can

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.759 
be able to say that aeroplanes can
survive<00:02:49.920> ditching<00:02:50.489> successfully<00:02:51.769> and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
survive ditching successfully and

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.550 
survive ditching successfully and
therefore<00:02:53.310> people<00:02:53.489> really<00:02:53.790> should<00:02:54.000> pay<00:02:54.209> some

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
therefore people really should pay some

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.020 
therefore people really should pay some
significant<00:02:55.560> degree<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.920> attention<00:02:56.129> to<00:02:56.640> to

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
significant degree of attention to to

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.839 
significant degree of attention to to
the<00:02:57.150> safety<00:02:57.329> briefings<00:02:57.870> okay<00:02:58.590> yeah<00:02:58.829> that<00:02:59.069> is<00:02:59.790> a

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
the safety briefings okay yeah that is a

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.930 
the safety briefings okay yeah that is a
piece<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.180> good<00:03:00.629> news<00:03:00.660> there<00:03:01.440> we<00:03:01.980> hope<00:03:02.250> David

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
piece of good news there we hope David

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.880 
piece of good news there we hope David
Lee<00:03:03.060> thank<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.480> very<00:03:03.810> much<00:03:03.989> they<00:03:04.260> go<00:03:04.560> off

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
Lee thank you very much they go off

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.369 
Lee thank you very much they go off
radar<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.150> given<00:03:06.540> obviously<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.049> has

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
radar and given obviously that it has

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.740 
radar and given obviously that it has
what<00:03:07.739> what<00:03:08.220> are<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.519> options<00:03:08.819> that<00:03:09.510> we<00:03:09.629> are

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
what what are the options that we are

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.770 
what what are the options that we are
looking<00:03:10.079> at<00:03:10.310> well<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.340> can't<00:03:11.940> really<00:03:12.120> add<00:03:12.450> all

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
looking at well I can't really add all

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.390 
looking at well I can't really add all
that<00:03:12.959> much<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.200> what<00:03:13.470> David<00:03:13.680> leave<00:03:14.099> has<00:03:14.370> been

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
that much to what David leave has been

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.580 
that much to what David leave has been
saying<00:03:14.849> because<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.569> soon<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.290> we

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
saying because it's so soon and we

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.900 
saying because it's so soon and we
really<00:03:16.890> don't<00:03:17.040> know<00:03:17.280> what's<00:03:17.519> happened

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
really don't know what's happened

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.150 
really don't know what's happened
however<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.319> think<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.590> point<00:03:19.739> about<00:03:19.919> the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
however and I think the point about the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.159 
however and I think the point about the
radar<00:03:20.579> is<00:03:20.609> that<00:03:21.000> there<00:03:21.209> is<00:03:21.329> no<00:03:21.510> radar<00:03:21.810> coverage

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
radar is that there is no radar coverage

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.500 
radar is that there is no radar coverage
over<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.709> big<00:03:23.040> oceanic<00:03:23.700> areas<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.359> this

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
over the big oceanic areas and this

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.589 
over the big oceanic areas and this
aircraft<00:03:24.930> had<00:03:25.169> a<00:03:25.319> long<00:03:26.040> oceanic<00:03:26.819> track<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.419> go

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
aircraft had a long oceanic track to go

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.409 
aircraft had a long oceanic track to go
through<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.799> what<00:03:29.459> happens<00:03:29.880> there<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.389> that

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
through and what happens there is that

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.479 
through and what happens there is that
once<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.870> go<00:03:31.049> out<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.650> radar<00:03:32.010> cover<00:03:32.250> which

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
once you go out of the radar cover which

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.240 
once you go out of the radar cover which
as<00:03:33.180> David<00:03:33.480> suggested<00:03:33.630> might<00:03:34.169> be<00:03:34.349> as<00:03:34.470> much<00:03:35.040> as

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
as David suggested might be as much as

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.190 
as David suggested might be as much as
300<00:03:35.760> miles<00:03:35.940> from<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.239> coast<00:03:36.480> but<00:03:36.690> may<00:03:36.900> not<00:03:37.049> be

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
300 miles from the coast but may not be

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.470 
300 miles from the coast but may not be
that<00:03:37.349> far<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.980> there<00:03:38.489> then<00:03:38.639> under<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.030> sort<00:03:39.419> of

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
that far and there then under a sort of

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.659 
that far and there then under a sort of
procedure<00:03:39.900> where<00:03:40.230> they<00:03:40.260> talk<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.919> the<00:03:41.130> air

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
procedure where they talk to the air

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.120 
procedure where they talk to the air
traffic<00:03:42.079> containing<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.230> traffic<00:03:43.709> control

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
traffic containing a traffic control

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.400 
traffic containing a traffic control
center<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:45.269> they<00:03:45.419> report<00:03:45.840> their<00:03:45.959> position

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
center and they report their position

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.440 
center and they report their position
every<00:03:46.650> half<00:03:46.829> hour<00:03:47.069> either<00:03:47.760> by<00:03:48.090> high-frequency

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
every half hour either by high-frequency

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.069 
every half hour either by high-frequency
radio<00:03:49.139> or<00:03:49.880> sometimes<00:03:50.880> by<00:03:51.150> satellite<00:03:51.660> links

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
radio or sometimes by satellite links

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.920 
radio or sometimes by satellite links
but<00:03:52.829> they're<00:03:53.010> not<00:03:53.160> on<00:03:53.310> any<00:03:53.549> radar<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.630> course

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
but they're not on any radar of course

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.440 
but they're not on any radar of course
and<00:03:55.139> that<00:03:55.739> route<00:03:56.160> may<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.549> taken<00:03:56.910> them<00:03:57.060> along

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
and that route may have taken them along

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.199 
and that route may have taken them along
the<00:03:57.629> coast<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.260> Brazil<00:03:59.040> for<00:03:59.280> some<00:03:59.489> part<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.090> it

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
the coast of Brazil for some part and it

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.150 
the coast of Brazil for some part and it
may<00:04:00.389> have<00:04:00.599> been<00:04:00.780> on<00:04:00.959> radar<00:04:01.290> at<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.500> time<00:04:01.709> but

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
may have been on radar at the time but

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.860 
may have been on radar at the time but
I'm<00:04:02.370> inclined<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.760> think<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.480> this

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
I'm inclined to think that the this

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.080 
I'm inclined to think that the this
phrase<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.590> dropped<00:04:04.950> off<00:04:05.129> radar<00:04:05.579> is<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.790> bit<00:04:06.000> of

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
phrase it dropped off radar is a bit of

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.909 
phrase it dropped off radar is a bit of
a<00:04:06.150> journalistic<00:04:06.750> cliche<00:04:07.200> if<00:04:07.680> they<00:04:07.859> were

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
a journalistic cliche if they were

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.379 
a journalistic cliche if they were
actually<00:04:08.310> out<00:04:08.430> well<00:04:08.760> over<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.090> ocean<00:04:09.359> that

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
actually out well over the ocean that

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.599 
actually out well over the ocean that
would<00:04:09.720> not<00:04:09.840> have<00:04:09.989> been<00:04:10.109> the<00:04:10.230> case<00:04:10.379> but<00:04:11.129> for<00:04:11.400> air

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
would not have been the case but for air

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.270 
would not have been the case but for air
fonts<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.299> give<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> details<00:04:13.169> they<00:04:13.739> have<00:04:13.980> to

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
fonts to give the details they have to

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.120 
fonts to give the details they have to
set<00:04:14.669> up<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.819> reception<00:04:15.750> center<00:04:16.410> obviously<00:04:16.979> that

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
set up a reception center obviously that

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.770 
set up a reception center obviously that
is<00:04:17.250> not<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.880> only<00:04:17.910> option<00:04:18.539> that<00:04:18.570> they've

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
is not the only option that they've

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.830 
is not the only option that they've
simply<00:04:18.989> gone<00:04:19.500> out<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:20.160> range<00:04:20.750> given<00:04:21.750> what

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
simply gone out of range given what

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.270 
simply gone out of range given what
you've<00:04:21.989> just<00:04:22.019> said<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.860> fact<00:04:23.039> that<00:04:23.130> they

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
you've just said and the fact that they

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.330 
you've just said and the fact that they
supposed<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.700> have<00:04:23.789> made<00:04:23.969> radio<00:04:24.570> contact

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
supposed to have made radio contact

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.120 
supposed to have made radio contact
how<00:04:26.400> quickly<00:04:26.730> can<00:04:26.940> they<00:04:27.199> establish<00:04:28.199> if<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
how quickly can they establish if the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.890 
how quickly can they establish if the
the<00:04:29.370> plane<00:04:29.580> has<00:04:29.730> actually<00:04:30.030> gone<00:04:30.270> down<00:04:30.330> through

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
the plane has actually gone down through

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.990 
the plane has actually gone down through
through<00:04:31.139> other<00:04:31.380> ways<00:04:31.680> like<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.430> satellite<00:04:32.850> we

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
through other ways like the satellite we

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.719 
through other ways like the satellite we
were<00:04:33.120> just<00:04:33.270> hearing<00:04:33.570> from<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.290> moment<00:04:34.800> ago<00:04:34.860> well

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
were just hearing from a moment ago well

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.770 
were just hearing from a moment ago well
and<00:04:36.000> see<00:04:36.740> if<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:38.130> aircraft<00:04:38.520> has<00:04:38.760> gone<00:04:38.970> down<00:04:39.240> it

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
and see if the aircraft has gone down it

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.070 
and see if the aircraft has gone down it
isn't<00:04:40.110> only<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:42.180> emergency

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
isn't only the the emergency

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.140 
isn't only the the emergency
transmitters<00:04:43.860> in<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:44.370> black<00:04:44.550> boxes<00:04:44.940> of

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
transmitters in the black boxes of

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.840 
transmitters in the black boxes of
course<00:04:45.330> also<00:04:45.510> if<00:04:45.870> people<00:04:46.229> have<00:04:46.470> taken<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.729> the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
course also if people have taken to the

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.250 
course also if people have taken to the
life<00:04:48.030> raft<00:04:48.360> or<00:04:49.669> activated<00:04:50.669> some<00:04:51.600> of<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.780> life

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.860 
life raft or activated some of the life
jacket<00:04:52.710> emergency<00:04:53.370> radios<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.270> then<00:04:54.750> they

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
jacket emergency radios and then they

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.140 
jacket emergency radios and then they
will<00:04:55.020> be<00:04:55.199> picked<00:04:55.440> up<00:04:55.560> by<00:04:55.620> satellites<00:04:56.370> but<00:04:56.669> I

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
will be picked up by satellites but I

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.000 
will be picked up by satellites but I
think<00:04:57.810> we<00:04:57.960> might<00:04:58.110> have<00:04:58.260> heard<00:04:58.440> if<00:04:58.680> that<00:04:58.830> had

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
think we might have heard if that had

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.800 
think we might have heard if that had
happened<00:04:59.120> because<00:05:00.120> that<00:05:00.270> would<00:05:00.419> give<00:05:00.570> a<00:05:00.600> much

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
happened because that would give a much

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.390 
happened because that would give a much
clearer<00:05:01.110> idea<00:05:01.380> of<00:05:01.620> whether<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.070> aircraft

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
clearer idea of whether the aircraft

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.390 
clearer idea of whether the aircraft
actually<00:05:02.639> had<00:05:03.300> ditched<00:05:03.750> or<00:05:04.050> not<00:05:04.290> and<00:05:04.590> I<00:05:05.070> think

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
actually had ditched or not and I think

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.520 
actually had ditched or not and I think
David<00:05:05.820> lead<00:05:06.030> was<00:05:06.210> making<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.630> point<00:05:06.780> that<00:05:06.930> it

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
David lead was making the point that it

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.770 
David lead was making the point that it
is<00:05:07.710> now<00:05:07.889> getting<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.400> stage<00:05:08.760> where<00:05:08.790> it

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
is now getting to the stage where it

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.629 
is now getting to the stage where it
would<00:05:09.960> almost<00:05:10.110> certainly<00:05:10.470> be<00:05:10.740> out<00:05:11.100> of<00:05:11.160> fuel

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
would almost certainly be out of fuel

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.500 
would almost certainly be out of fuel
and<00:05:12.050> it<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.200> classed<00:05:13.500> as<00:05:13.710> overdue<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:15.330> of

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
and it is classed as overdue and of

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.180 
and it is classed as overdue and of
course<00:05:15.720> I<00:05:15.870> think<00:05:16.080> we<00:05:16.229> can<00:05:16.380> probably<00:05:16.560> say<00:05:17.010> that

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
course I think we can probably say that

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.790 
course I think we can probably say that
it<00:05:17.310> hadn't<00:05:17.669> got<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.180> any<00:05:18.539> of<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.930> land<00:05:19.289> on<00:05:19.560> this

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
it hadn't got to any of the land on this

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.010 
it hadn't got to any of the land on this
side<00:05:20.070> of<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.280> Atlantic<00:05:20.910> otherwise<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.900> air

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
side of the Atlantic otherwise the air

side of the Atlantic otherwise the air
traffic<00:05:22.200> control<00:05:22.620> authorities<00:05:23.130> would<00:05:23.310> have

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
traffic control authorities would have

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.230 
traffic control authorities would have
known<00:05:23.610> about<00:05:23.639> it<00:05:23.910> there<00:05:24.530> so<00:05:25.970> fact<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:27.120> we

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
known about it there so fact that we

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.270 
known about it there so fact that we
don't<00:05:27.419> seem<00:05:27.780> to<00:05:27.930> know<00:05:28.080> anything<00:05:28.229> suggests<00:05:29.039> bad

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
don't seem to know anything suggests bad

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.400 
don't seem to know anything suggests bad
news<00:05:29.639> but<00:05:30.000> I<00:05:30.030> also<00:05:30.270> go<00:05:30.570> along<00:05:30.780> with<00:05:30.900> what<00:05:31.050> David

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
news but I also go along with what David

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.129 
news but I also go along with what David
gleave<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.400> saying<00:05:32.669> in<00:05:32.850> that<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.479> know<00:05:33.630> a<00:05:33.660> few

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
gleave the saying in that you know a few

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.990 
gleave the saying in that you know a few
months<00:05:34.410> ago<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:34.919> there<00:05:35.340> hadn't<00:05:35.580> really<00:05:35.850> been

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
months ago and there hadn't really been

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.420 
months ago and there hadn't really been
any<00:05:36.360> really<00:05:37.050> successful<00:05:37.650> ditching<00:05:38.039> but<00:05:38.340> of

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
any really successful ditching but of

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.460 
any really successful ditching but of
course<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:38.789> New<00:05:38.910> York<00:05:39.210> one<00:05:39.450> showed<00:05:40.200> that<00:05:40.350> it

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
course the New York one showed that it

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.260 
course the New York one showed that it
can<00:05:40.650> be<00:05:40.830> done<00:05:40.979> bearing<00:05:41.639> in<00:05:41.700> mind<00:05:41.760> though<00:05:42.240> that

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
can be done bearing in mind though that

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.240 
can be done bearing in mind though that

we'll<00:05:58.110> do<00:05:58.260> the<00:05:58.349> altitude<00:05:58.919> that<00:05:59.160> the<00:05:59.610> plane<00:05:59.880> is

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
we'll do the altitude that the plane is

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.240 
we'll do the altitude that the plane is
actually<00:06:00.360> coming<00:06:00.599> down<00:06:00.930> from<00:06:01.260> in<00:06:01.710> an<00:06:01.889> instance

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
actually coming down from in an instance

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.430 
actually coming down from in an instance
like<00:06:02.310> this<00:06:02.580> this<00:06:02.789> far<00:06:03.120> into<00:06:03.389> an<00:06:04.169> actual

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
like this this far into an actual

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.219 
like this this far into an actual
journey<00:06:04.889> oh<00:06:05.300> they<00:06:06.300> would<00:06:06.510> be<00:06:06.690> at<00:06:06.960> their

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
journey oh they would be at their

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.170 
journey oh they would be at their
cruising<00:06:07.650> altitude<00:06:08.190> you<00:06:08.400> know<00:06:08.520> between<00:06:08.789> 30

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
cruising altitude you know between 30

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.000 
cruising altitude you know between 30
and<00:06:09.300> 38<00:06:09.900> thousand<00:06:10.410> feet<00:06:10.560> probably<00:06:11.360> and<00:06:12.919> but<00:06:13.919> of

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
and 38 thousand feet probably and but of

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.879 
and 38 thousand feet probably and but of
course<00:06:14.570> with<00:06:15.570> no<00:06:15.720> idea<00:06:15.990> what<00:06:16.169> went<00:06:16.349> wrong<00:06:16.530> and

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
course with no idea what went wrong and

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.969 
course with no idea what went wrong and
you<00:06:17.340> know<00:06:17.490> if<00:06:18.120> and<00:06:18.780> I've<00:06:19.260> no<00:06:19.500> particular

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
you know if and I've no particular

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.529 
you know if and I've no particular
reason<00:06:20.099> for<00:06:20.220> things<00:06:20.430> but<00:06:20.639> if<00:06:20.820> it<00:06:20.970> were<00:06:21.150> a<00:06:21.180> bomb

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
reason for things but if it were a bomb

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.270 
reason for things but if it were a bomb
then<00:06:21.900> you<00:06:22.200> know<00:06:22.349> the<00:06:22.530> airplane<00:06:22.860> has<00:06:23.039> probably

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
then you know the airplane has probably

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.580 
then you know the airplane has probably
destroyed<00:06:23.729> if<00:06:24.060> it<00:06:24.510> had<00:06:24.720> a<00:06:24.750> total<00:06:25.320> engine

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
destroyed if it had a total engine

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.860 
destroyed if it had a total engine
failure<00:06:25.800> of<00:06:26.280> some<00:06:26.310> sort<00:06:26.820> which<00:06:27.030> is<00:06:27.180> very<00:06:27.510> which

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
failure of some sort which is very which

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.440 
failure of some sort which is very which
is<00:06:28.020> vanishingly<00:06:28.620> rare<00:06:28.740> these<00:06:29.160> days<00:06:29.300> and<00:06:30.300> it

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
is vanishingly rare these days and it

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.240 
is vanishingly rare these days and it
was<00:06:30.599> able<00:06:30.990> to<00:06:31.110> glide<00:06:31.320> which<00:06:31.650> is<00:06:31.770> what<00:06:31.919> happened

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
was able to glide which is what happened

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.399 
was able to glide which is what happened
in<00:06:32.400> New<00:06:32.520> York<00:06:32.820> then<00:06:33.630> it<00:06:33.750> would<00:06:33.870> just<00:06:33.900> you<00:06:34.380> know

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
in New York then it would just you know

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.320 
in New York then it would just you know
glide<00:06:34.860> down<00:06:35.130> as<00:06:35.370> far<00:06:35.550> as<00:06:35.700> it<00:06:35.849> could<00:06:36.000> they<00:06:36.180> would

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
glide down as far as it could they would

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.300 
glide down as far as it could they would
glide<00:06:36.539> towards<00:06:36.840> the<00:06:37.320> coast<00:06:37.590> if<00:06:37.830> they<00:06:37.979> if<00:06:38.159> they

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
glide towards the coast if they if they

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.890 
glide towards the coast if they if they
still<00:06:38.550> had<00:06:38.729> control

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
still had control

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.749 
still had control
and<00:06:40.169> when<00:06:40.560> they<00:06:40.680> got<00:06:40.710> to<00:06:41.009> the<00:06:41.040> surface<00:06:41.340> of<00:06:41.610> the

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 
and when they got to the surface of the

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.999 
and when they got to the surface of the
sea<00:06:41.940> they<00:06:42.150> would<00:06:42.360> alight<00:06:43.199> on<00:06:43.229> it<00:06:43.530> i<00:06:43.650> think<00:06:43.710> i

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
sea they would alight on it i think i

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.200 
sea they would alight on it i think i
think<00:06:44.220> is<00:06:44.310> the<00:06:44.460> proper<00:06:44.610> word<00:06:44.820> if<00:06:45.030> they

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
think is the proper word if they

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.010 
think is the proper word if they
possibly<00:06:45.630> could<00:06:46.009> but<00:06:47.009> you<00:06:47.850> know<00:06:48.000> we<00:06:48.900> just

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
possibly could but you know we just

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.400 
possibly could but you know we just
don't<00:06:49.229> know<00:06:50.479> okay<00:06:51.479> well<00:06:51.780> Shawn<00:06:52.020> have<00:06:52.289> it

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
don't know okay well Shawn have it

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.509 
don't know okay well Shawn have it
thanks<00:06:52.620> very<00:06:52.979> much<00:06:53.039> for<00:06:53.490> talking<00:06:54.090> to
