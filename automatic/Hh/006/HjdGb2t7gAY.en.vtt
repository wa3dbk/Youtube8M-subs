so<00:00:00.359> when<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.570> videoing<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.170> demonstrate

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
so when this videoing in a demonstrate

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.010 
so when this videoing in a demonstrate
had<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:01.890> true<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.399> wheels<00:00:02.639> on<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.879> bicycle<00:00:03.149> which

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
had a true the wheels on a bicycle which

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.410 
had a true the wheels on a bicycle which
has<00:00:04.230> disc<00:00:04.620> brakes<00:00:05.009> so<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> couple<00:00:05.970> years<00:00:06.180> ago<00:00:06.299> I

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
has disc brakes so a couple years ago I

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.330 
has disc brakes so a couple years ago I
made<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.720> video<00:00:06.930> demonstrating<00:00:07.830> how<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.010> true

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
made a video demonstrating how to true

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.459 
made a video demonstrating how to true
the<00:00:08.490> wheels<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> bicycle<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.290> that

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
the wheels on a bicycle and in that

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.080 
the wheels on a bicycle and in that
video<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.860> showed<00:00:11.190> how<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.460> could<00:00:11.670> use<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
video I showed how you could use the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.369 
video I showed how you could use the
brake<00:00:12.360> pads<00:00:12.719> as<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.400> reference<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:15.379> showing

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
brake pads as a reference for showing

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.320 
brake pads as a reference for showing
where<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.680> high<00:00:16.859> spots<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.490> low<00:00:17.640> spots<00:00:17.970> are

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
where the high spots and low spots are

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.960 
where the high spots and low spots are
on<00:00:18.539> your<00:00:19.170> rim<00:00:19.410> for<00:00:20.100> when<00:00:20.250> your<00:00:20.400> truing<00:00:20.789> them

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
on your rim for when your truing them

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060 
on your rim for when your truing them
however<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> question<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> frequently<00:00:22.800> get

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
however a question that I frequently get

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.859 
however a question that I frequently get
asked<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.730> how<00:00:24.000> do<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.359> do<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.660> procedure

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
asked is how do you do this procedure

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.679 
asked is how do you do this procedure
for<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> bike<00:00:25.680> which<00:00:25.920> has<00:00:26.130> disc<00:00:26.490> brakes<00:00:26.849> because

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
for a bike which has disc brakes because

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.960 
for a bike which has disc brakes because
disc<00:00:28.109> brakes<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> brake<00:00:29.429> pads<00:00:29.730> which

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
disc brakes have the brake pads which

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.999 
disc brakes have the brake pads which
are<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:31.109> up<00:00:31.289> against<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> disc

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
are in here going up against the disc

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.819 
are in here going up against the disc
and<00:00:32.399> down<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.420> where<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> brake<00:00:34.290> pads<00:00:34.559> would

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
and down here where the brake pads would

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.069 
and down here where the brake pads would
normally<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.550> up<00:00:36.180> against<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> rim

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
normally be up against the rim

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.869 
normally be up against the rim
there's<00:00:37.530> nothing<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.309> use<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:38.820> a

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
there's nothing that you can use as a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.119 
there's nothing that you can use as a
reference<00:00:39.660> surface<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.800> explained

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
reference surface just like I explained

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.920 
reference surface just like I explained
in<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:41.340> other<00:00:41.550> video<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.180> options<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.809> can

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
in my other video one options is you can

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.110 
in my other video one options is you can
take<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.260> wheel<00:00:43.440> off<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.860> bike<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.969> can

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
take your wheel off the bike and you can

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.479 
take your wheel off the bike and you can
get<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:45.570> truing<00:00:46.079> stands<00:00:46.649> which<00:00:47.309> you

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
get one of these truing stands which you

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.639 
get one of these truing stands which you
can<00:00:47.670> fix<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> wheel<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.660> there<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.500> has

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
can fix the wheel in there and it has

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.549 
can fix the wheel in there and it has
this<00:00:49.920> special<00:00:50.579> thing<00:00:50.940> down<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.600> which<00:00:52.410> you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
this special thing down here which you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.220 
this special thing down here which you
can<00:00:52.710> adjust<00:00:52.829> these<00:00:53.219> things<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.910> use<00:00:54.809> those<00:00:55.020> as

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
can adjust these things and use those as

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560 
can adjust these things and use those as
your<00:00:55.379> reference<00:00:55.530> surface<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:57.270> true

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
your reference surface to see how true

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.900 
your reference surface to see how true
the<00:00:57.719> wheel<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.289> given<00:00:58.590> spot<00:00:58.829> however<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the wheel is in a given spot however the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.340 
the wheel is in a given spot however the
average<00:01:00.000> person<00:01:00.539> probably<00:01:00.780> doesn't<00:01:00.930> own<00:01:01.320> a

average person probably doesn't own a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.529 
average person probably doesn't own a
truing<00:01:01.859> stand<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.149> something<00:01:03.480> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
truing stand and it's not something that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.570 
truing stand and it's not something that
I<00:01:03.600> would<00:01:03.780> recommend<00:01:04.049> buying<00:01:04.439> unless<00:01:05.339> you're

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
I would recommend buying unless you're

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550 
I would recommend buying unless you're
frequently<00:01:06.090> truing<00:01:06.479> bike<00:01:06.780> wheels<00:01:07.020> rather

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
frequently truing bike wheels rather

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.899 
frequently truing bike wheels rather
than<00:01:07.799> getting<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.100> truing<00:01:08.549> stand<00:01:08.580> all

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
than getting that truing stand all

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.310 
than getting that truing stand all
you've<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.240> got<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.020> find

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
you've really got to do is just find

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.170 
you've really got to do is just find
some<00:01:10.619> kind<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.920> an<00:01:11.040> item<00:01:11.280> which<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.030> can

attach to your frame here which is going

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.310 
attach to your frame here which is going
to<00:01:14.250> stick<00:01:14.580> out<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:16.110> that

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
reference surface for you and the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.060 
reference surface for you and the
possibilities<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.259> item<00:01:19.590> are<00:01:19.710> analysts

possibilities for that item are analysts
you<00:01:20.159> could<00:01:20.310> build<00:01:20.490> something<00:01:20.790> out<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.000> wood

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you could build something out of wood

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.929 
you could build something out of wood
that<00:01:21.479> will<00:01:21.600> clamp<00:01:21.810> onto<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.380> somehow<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.850> an

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
that will clamp onto here somehow but an

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.219 
that will clamp onto here somehow but an
idea<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> had<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:24.869> something<00:01:25.110> that's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
idea that I had for something that's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.990 
idea that I had for something that's
really<00:01:25.439> simple<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.860> could<00:01:26.009> use<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.880> could

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
really simple you could use as you could

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.690 
really simple you could use as you could
just<00:01:27.150> use<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> regular<00:01:27.540> household<00:01:28.170> pencil

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
just use a regular household pencil

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.460 
just use a regular household pencil
preferably<00:01:29.700> one<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.000> an<00:01:30.119> eraser<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
preferably one with an eraser and you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.319 
preferably one with an eraser and you
can<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.799> put<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.280> there<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
can just put that on there like that and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.270 
can just put that on there like that and
hold<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.020> place<00:01:34.140> all<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.740> need<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.130> is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
on this part of the rim so your

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.780 
on this part of the rim so your
reference<00:02:14.440> surface<00:02:14.740> might<00:02:14.950> rub<00:02:15.160> up<00:02:15.310> against

reference surface might rub up against
the<00:02:16.209> sticker<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.840> think<00:02:17.050> that's<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.350> high<00:02:17.530> spot

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
the sticker and think that's a high spot

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.370 
the sticker and think that's a high spot
but<00:02:18.610> as<00:02:18.760> long<00:02:18.940> as<00:02:19.060> you're<00:02:19.180> aware<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.660> you

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
but as long as you're aware of that you

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.140 
but as long as you're aware of that you
should<00:02:20.560> be<00:02:20.680> able<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.950> find<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.670> real<00:02:21.880> high

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
should be able to find the real high

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.699 
should be able to find the real high
spots<00:02:22.510> which<00:02:22.690> will<00:02:22.840> be<00:02:22.959> much<00:02:23.140> higher<00:02:23.380> than<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
spots which will be much higher than the

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.100 
spots which will be much higher than the
thickness<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.340> sticker<00:02:24.840> I've<00:02:25.840> done<00:02:25.989> the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
thickness of this sticker I've done the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.809 
thickness of this sticker I've done the
same<00:02:26.290> from<00:02:26.500> my<00:02:26.620> back<00:02:26.860> wheel<00:02:27.100> back<00:02:27.370> here<00:02:27.700> again

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
same from my back wheel back here again

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.220 
same from my back wheel back here again
just<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.209> this<00:02:28.360> little<00:02:28.630> part<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.989> frame<00:02:29.200> I

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
just on this little part of the frame I

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.530 
just on this little part of the frame I
was<00:02:29.500> able<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.800> put<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.489> pencil<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:31.000> there<00:02:31.180> using

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
was able to put a pencil in there using

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.360 
was able to put a pencil in there using
a<00:02:31.600> regular<00:02:31.870> rubber<00:02:32.530> band<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.190> wheel

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
a regular rubber band and this wheel

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.490 
a regular rubber band and this wheel
actually<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.000> little<00:02:34.390> bit<00:02:34.510> out<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.750> true<00:02:35.020> so

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
actually is a little bit out of true so

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.400 
actually is a little bit out of true so
you'll<00:02:35.650> be<00:02:35.739> able<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:36.010> see<00:02:36.190> as<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.430> spin<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.910> that

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
you'll be able to see as I spin it that

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.900 
you'll be able to see as I spin it that
it<00:02:38.410> does<00:02:38.560> rub<00:02:38.769> up<00:02:38.920> against<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.310> pencil<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.790> it

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
it does rub up against the pencil and it

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.850 
it does rub up against the pencil and it
vibrates<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.780> little<00:02:40.989> bit<00:02:41.110> each<00:02:41.260> time<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.650> hits

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
vibrates a little bit each time it hits

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.760 
vibrates a little bit each time it hits
it

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.260 

so<00:02:50.310> like<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.550> said<00:02:50.610> once<00:02:50.880> you've<00:02:51.000> got<00:02:51.150> your

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
so like I said once you've got your

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.180 
so like I said once you've got your
reference<00:02:51.660> surface<00:02:51.990> in<00:02:52.110> place<00:02:52.380> here<00:02:52.770> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
reference surface in place here the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
procedure for towing this wheel is

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.020 
procedure for towing this wheel is
exactly<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.620> same<00:02:55.770> as<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.070> procedure<00:02:56.460> that<00:02:57.000> I

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
exactly the same as the procedure that I

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.090 
exactly the same as the procedure that I
showed<00:02:57.300> my<00:02:57.540> other<00:02:57.720> video<00:02:58.140> demonstrating<00:02:59.070> how

showed my other video demonstrating how

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.100 
showed my other video demonstrating how
