core<00:00:34.570> like<00:00:34.810> this<00:00:45.840> now<00:00:46.840> what<00:00:47.020> I'm<00:00:47.140> doing<00:00:47.170> there

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
core like this now what I'm doing there

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.460 
core like this now what I'm doing there
is<00:00:48.010> strumming<00:00:48.910> starting<00:00:49.450> out<00:00:49.630> because<00:00:50.170> I<00:00:50.290> want

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
is strumming starting out because I want

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.940 
is strumming starting out because I want
to<00:00:50.560> sound<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:52.180> a<00:00:52.390> string<00:00:52.900> right<00:00:53.110> there<00:00:53.410> so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
to sound that a string right there so

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.840 
to sound that a string right there so
I'm<00:00:54.220> going<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:54.490> strum<00:00:56.070> starting<00:00:57.070> out<00:00:57.250> at<00:00:57.550> G

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
I'm going to strum starting out at G

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.850 
I'm going to strum starting out at G
minor<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:59.730> sliding<00:01:00.730> into<00:01:00.910> G<00:01:01.360> sharp<00:01:01.720> minor<00:01:02.050> ok

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860

and I'm emphasizing the a string on that
so<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:06.850> is<00:01:06.909> how<00:01:07.149> we're<00:01:07.299> going<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.539> do<00:01:07.719> it<00:01:07.869> put

so this is how we're going to do it put
my<00:01:08.560> pick<00:01:08.799> on<00:01:08.979> that<00:01:09.189> string<00:01:09.579> and<00:01:09.609> go

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.660 

every<00:01:14.020> time<00:01:14.200> I<00:01:14.230> start<00:01:14.620> my<00:01:14.800> pattern<00:01:15.250> I'm<00:01:15.400> going

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
every time I start my pattern I'm going

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.270 
every time I start my pattern I'm going
to<00:01:15.790> rest<00:01:16.090> my<00:01:16.210> pic<00:01:16.660> on<00:01:16.870> that<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.560> string

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
to rest my pic on that a string

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.600 
to rest my pic on that a string
okay<00:01:19.240> now<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.720> strumming<00:01:20.170> pattern<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.740> down

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
okay now that strumming pattern is down

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.850 
okay now that strumming pattern is down
up<00:01:22.210> down<00:01:23.080> up<00:01:23.740> up<00:01:24.460> up<00:01:25.240> down<00:01:25.900> down<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:27.820> down<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:29.140> up

up down up up up down down up down up up

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:40.800 
up down up up up down down up down up up
up<00:01:30.520> down<00:01:38.580> I'm<00:01:39.580> going<00:01:39.910> to<00:01:39.970> use<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.480> same

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
up down I'm going to use the same

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.010 
up down I'm going to use the same
pattern<00:01:41.200> for<00:01:41.980> C<00:01:42.400> sharp<00:01:42.730> minor<00:01:42.970> seven<00:01:43.540> chord<00:01:43.570> by

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
pattern for C sharp minor seven chord by

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.680 
pattern for C sharp minor seven chord by
going<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.560> court<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.240> strumming<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.510> as

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
going to the court and strumming and as

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.140 
going to the court and strumming and as
I<00:01:46.720> strum<00:01:47.260> on<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.830> first<00:01:48.130> from<00:01:48.490> I'm<00:01:48.760> going<00:01:49.030> to

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
I strum on the first from I'm going to

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.430 
I strum on the first from I'm going to
hammer<00:01:50.010> like<00:01:51.010> that<00:01:51.310> on<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.420> chord<00:01:52.690> so<00:01:53.200> this

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
hammer like that on the chord so this

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:10.020 
hammer like that on the chord so this
pattern<00:01:53.680> will<00:01:54.070> be<00:01:54.160> done<00:01:54.340> this<00:01:54.520> way<00:02:09.030> for

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
pattern will be done this way for

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.850 
pattern will be done this way for
pattern<00:02:10.360> number<00:02:10.660> three<00:02:10.959> we're<00:02:11.440> going<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.740> go

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
pattern number three we're going to go

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.800 
pattern number three we're going to go
all<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.250> way<00:02:12.280> up<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.760> 11th<00:02:13.180> fret<00:02:13.510> and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
all the way up to the 11th fret and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.800 
all the way up to the 11th fret and
we're<00:02:14.740> going<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.010> play<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.640> G<00:02:16.269> sharp<00:02:16.300> minor

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
we're going to play a G sharp minor

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.250 
we're going to play a G sharp minor
chord<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:18.690> come<00:02:19.690> back<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.440> an<00:02:20.590> F<00:02:20.769> sharp<00:02:22.260> chord

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
chord and come back to an F sharp chord

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.490 
chord and come back to an F sharp chord
like<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.980> okay<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:25.360> this<00:02:25.660> pattern<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.230> going

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
like that okay so this pattern is going

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:35.390 
like that okay so this pattern is going
to<00:02:26.769> go<00:02:27.040> like<00:02:27.760> this

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.190 

now<00:02:36.400> there's<00:02:36.580> two<00:02:36.760> parts<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.269> we've<00:02:38.019> got

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
now there's two parts to this we've got

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.530 
now there's two parts to this we've got
to<00:02:38.320> put<00:02:38.500> our<00:02:38.620> fingers<00:02:39.070> in<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.489> out<00:02:39.940> at<00:02:40.180> the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
to put our fingers in and out at the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.720 
to put our fingers in and out at the
right<00:02:40.690> time<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.290> we've<00:02:41.799> got<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> strum<00:02:42.430> a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
right time and we've got a strum a

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.390 
right time and we've got a strum a
little<00:02:43.120> bit<00:02:43.209> differently<00:02:43.630> up<00:02:43.870> here<00:02:44.290> okay<00:02:44.890> so

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
little bit differently up here okay so

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.910 
little bit differently up here okay so
first<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.820> all<00:02:45.970> let's<00:02:46.510> get<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.870> part<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:47.470> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
first of all let's get this part so the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:18.450 
first of all let's get this part so the
first<00:02:48.160> part<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:56.340> slowly

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.790 

and<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:20.350> strumming<00:03:20.800> pattern<00:03:20.830> is<00:03:21.990> down<00:03:22.990> down

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
and the strumming pattern is down down

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:33.080 
and the strumming pattern is down down
down<00:03:24.670> down<00:03:25.450> down<00:03:25.840> up<00:03:28.200> down<00:03:29.850> down<00:03:30.850> down<00:03:31.540> down

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
down down down up down down down down

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.660
