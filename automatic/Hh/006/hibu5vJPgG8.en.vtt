00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.679
 hello I am neither from l'aquila 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.210
 Marketing I am here today in the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.679
 small animal practice of woman dr 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.389
 you can already see they are here 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.240
 treatment table we do here 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.630
 but not the general medicine 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.279
 but it's about osteopathy woman dr 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.510
 Scholz is the osteopathy 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.060
 actually osteopathy is a form of 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.510
 Manual medicine comes from the United States 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.550
 was founded by a human physician 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.989
 Andrew Taylor also gets along too 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.000
 various other things busy 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.480
 has and the essence of osteopathy 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.899
 is a holistic view of the body 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.629
 and of the whole organism in life 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.079
 is movement and also looks support 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.510
 In principle, where is movement in the body and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.360
 or where there is no movement that is where 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.399
 we have many talk of blockades 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.460
 we can stop it a disturbed 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.040
 energy flow or flow of movement and the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.299
 the task of the osteopath is the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.549
 to bring movement back into gear 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.350
 which concrete diseases or 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.409
 they treat most common diseases 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.960
 then there are quite a lot with osteopathy 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.170
 just packs motion problems so if 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.840
 dogs or limping problems with the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.780
 spine, therefore, have to be educated in the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.119
 spine area then joint 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.470
 changes or just very often 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.930
 at larger we have often solves 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.540
 to treat problems of clarity or country 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.650
 similar problems or just stop too 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.560
 if the quasi with the cervical spine 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.150
 So problems simply have of the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.530
 movement are restricted 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.990
 but if that makes sense so if 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.280
 I notice my animal has problems running 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.890
 not anymore and not anymore 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.360
 funky has, for example, problems when meeting 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.130
 do not go up or jump like that anymore 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.840
 easy in the car then that's it 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.700
 actually 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.229
 because not to the osteopath 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.509
 can imagine can then ever 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.289
 there are any 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.420
 movement restrictions with which 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.649
 methods do you do that the animals 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.560
 to feel good again 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.780
 there the passion is the powder too 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.369
 fortune or pension streaming a lot 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.590
 important than holding the body 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.260
 senses and senses where tension 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.470
 But this is also a good one 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.480
 Knowledge of anatomy and physiology 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.360
 you have to go over a couple of years 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.549
 to deal with it and then it will 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.269
 So the body, so to speak 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.989
 Just fold granted quasi 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.310
 then examined one feels 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:34.310
 tension and, of course, then 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.230
 also always looking for the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.879
 main problem then what actually the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.680
 whole tense pulled close to each other 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.250
 and then you try this one 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.760
 Restrict movement back into gear 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.170
 bring 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.599
 Actually, that's how it's done to the body 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.690
 almost like a new movement pattern 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.459
 offers and then comes the next 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.110
 step the body is also one 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.750
 essential approach of osteopathic 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.310
 philosophy the self regeneration of the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.590
 Self-healing powers of the body 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.510
 then come into play because then it is just 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.660
 stop the patient asked to what extent he 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.670
 The help that you give him then converts 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.290
 yes I am very excited here 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.209
 here is not moritz already on the 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.190
 floor and sleeps almost 1 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.090
 the feeling now such an atmosphere of 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.819
 relaxation according to which system the tired 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.079
 her own dog rosi is already missing 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.209
 what a 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.069
 The result is I think real 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.749
 Fantastic so we had before too 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.019
 and he has very soft fur 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:32.459
 court and do not know exactly 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.290
 so why just by the 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.200
 decision maybe in any case 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.030
 it felt right and I thank you 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.879
 me with you woman she scholz that me 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.299
 who have explained austria and me now 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.299
