00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
well you know internally we never

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.069 
well you know internally we never
actually<00:00:50.890> felt<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.700> we<00:00:51.880> had<00:00:51.910> done<00:00:52.450> you<00:00:52.960> know

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
actually felt that we had done you know

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.030 
actually felt that we had done you know
the<00:00:53.170> best<00:00:53.350> thing<00:00:53.470> that<00:00:53.710> we<00:00:53.739> could<00:00:53.890> do<00:00:54.010> for

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
the best thing that we could do for

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.640 
the best thing that we could do for
basketball<00:00:54.579> but<00:00:55.329> we<00:00:55.660> also<00:00:55.810> knew<00:00:56.110> that<00:00:56.140> we<00:00:56.620> had

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
basketball but we also knew that we had

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.650 
basketball but we also knew that we had
set<00:00:56.950> ourselves<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.610> really<00:00:58.030> really<00:00:58.180> high<00:00:58.390> bar

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
set ourselves a really really high bar

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.080 
set ourselves a really really high bar
so<00:00:59.170> NBA<00:00:59.470> 2k12<00:00:59.829> needed<00:01:00.340> to<00:01:00.460> really<00:01:00.579> step<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:00.910> up

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
so NBA 2k12 needed to really step it up

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.319 
so NBA 2k12 needed to really step it up
and<00:01:01.270> be<00:01:01.420> just<00:01:01.750> as<00:01:02.380> good<00:01:02.590> or<00:01:02.800> way<00:01:03.280> better<00:01:03.579> than<00:01:03.850> a

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
and be just as good or way better than a

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.569 
and be just as good or way better than a
year<00:01:04.449> prior<00:01:04.659> so<00:01:05.049> in<00:01:05.259> the<00:01:05.619> core<00:01:05.860> game<00:01:06.100> yeah

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
year prior so in the core game yeah

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.850 
year prior so in the core game yeah

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
on Rails and once they get started we

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.190 
on Rails and once they get started we
can't<00:01:24.490> do<00:01:24.670> anything<00:01:24.909> about<00:01:25.150> it<00:01:25.330> this<00:01:25.930> year

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
it's all about control it's about

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.969 
it's all about control it's about
putting<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.720> control<00:01:29.140> back<00:01:29.170> into<00:01:29.650> your<00:01:29.830> own

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
putting that control back into your own

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.930 
putting that control back into your own
hands<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:31.240> script<00:01:31.780> what<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.950> see<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.820> the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
hands you script what you see to the

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.670 
hands you script what you see to the
point<00:01:34.210> where<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.840> know<00:01:34.960> anything<00:01:35.409> can<00:01:35.560> be

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
point where you know anything can be

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.890 
point where you know anything can be
interrupted<00:01:36.090> collisions<00:01:37.090> changed<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.750> way<00:01:37.869> I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
interrupted collisions changed the way I

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.219 
interrupted collisions changed the way I
react<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:38.619> what<00:01:39.549> you<00:01:39.670> see<00:01:39.880> in<00:01:39.970> one<00:01:40.180> game<00:01:40.450> you

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
react so what you see in one game you

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.590 
react so what you see in one game you
don't<00:01:41.470> really<00:01:42.130> see<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.580> next<00:01:42.909> time<00:01:43.119> so<00:01:43.420> let's
