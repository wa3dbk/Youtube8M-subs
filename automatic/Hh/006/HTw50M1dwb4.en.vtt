a<00:02:49.690> couple<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:49.989> issues<00:02:50.080> though<00:02:50.410> one<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.190> photo

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
a couple of issues though one the photo

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.250 
a couple of issues though one the photo
overall<00:02:51.880> looks<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.209> little<00:02:52.450> bit<00:02:52.569> orange<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.110> me

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
overall looks a little bit orange to me

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.630 
overall looks a little bit orange to me
so<00:02:53.650> let<00:02:53.769> me<00:02:53.830> go<00:02:53.950> ahead<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.340> slide<00:02:55.209> down<00:02:56.049> that

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
so let me go ahead and slide down that

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.280 
so let me go ahead and slide down that
white<00:02:57.640> balance<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.360> get<00:02:58.510> something<00:02:58.870> like<00:02:59.019> this

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
white balance to get something like this

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.570 
white balance to get something like this
I<00:02:59.470> think<00:02:59.830> that<00:03:00.010> looks<00:03:00.220> much<00:03:00.340> more<00:03:00.519> natural

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
I think that looks much more natural

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.680 
I think that looks much more natural

you<00:04:18.510> know<00:04:18.570> what<00:04:18.720> maybe<00:04:18.870> that<00:04:19.080> skies<00:04:19.290> looking<00:04:19.530> a

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
you know what maybe that skies looking a

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.020 
you know what maybe that skies looking a
little<00:04:19.800> too<00:04:19.920> bright<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.190> let's<00:04:20.490> add<00:04:20.700> curves

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
little too bright so let's add curves

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.820 
little too bright so let's add curves
adjustment<00:04:21.540> layer<00:04:21.570> we're<00:04:22.140> just<00:04:22.320> gonna<00:04:22.410> drag

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
adjustment layer we're just gonna drag

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.860 
adjustment layer we're just gonna drag
it<00:04:23.130> down<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.310> little<00:04:23.520> bit<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:24.030> drag<00:04:24.360> up<00:04:24.630> so<00:04:24.780> we

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
it down a little bit and drag up so we

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.510 
it down a little bit and drag up so we
don't<00:04:24.900> lose<00:04:25.140> our<00:04:25.200> highlight<00:04:25.590> detail<00:04:26.010> maybe

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
don't lose our highlight detail maybe

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.400 
don't lose our highlight detail maybe
this<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:26.820> little<00:04:26.850> more<00:04:27.150> hit<00:04:27.600> G<00:04:27.870> for<00:04:28.110> gradient

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
this is a little more hit G for gradient

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.720 
this is a little more hit G for gradient
