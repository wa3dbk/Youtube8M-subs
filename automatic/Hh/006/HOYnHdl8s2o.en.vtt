00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:19.369
 advanced in plan spoken with contempt 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.369
 by colleagues 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.060
 the soap I call white in the typical 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.960
 film and when one centimeter is missing 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.980
 to fall it is said that when the typical 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.350
 movies and yes it was the car 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.680
 the slope never stays at the limit of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.930
 the movie but it does not matter that we accept 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.180
 It's worth no more limiting the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.650
 motorcycle has already been throwing that man and I 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.210
 in the depths of me I felt bad 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.710
 for having thrown him and then my 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.559
 brain thematically has thrown me 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.470
 no but what the fuck web I do not understand 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.220
 there is nothing to understand spikes of knowledge 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.810
 but question in the work 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.970
 I just continued site because it 's 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.870
 a question is a very big question 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.870
 in the world it does not make sense 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.100
 I do the fifth is that we will go here 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.570
 it gives me that it's going to be complicated 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.550
 because it goes first but hey we do not 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.900
 we lose nothing for trying to stay in a 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.290
 position do not put me in the middle to 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.710
 real money people are very very 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.580
 little pelotín gas vale let's go let's go fourth 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.470
 view we have advanced positions 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.729
 little by little the head never s ever 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.190
 nor in doing everything perfect 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.320
 good is the key to life not 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.350
 simply the third one seen a little bit 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.350
 little we are advancing positions when 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.700
 I know because I also go back and it seems 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.200
 that as if my mind reflected what 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.600
 happens in interstellar space we go 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.490
 do not throw me out I do not say because if it 's fuck 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.509
 physical on the bright side and if it comes out 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.580
 flying but because it's happening the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.050
 video that is not you fall give and the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.940
 Iranian because your motorcycle whistle sounds 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.710
 every time you brake because I turn and 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.670
 spin tightens so hard that it whistled without 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.670
 that these two 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.569
 perfect perfect perfect perfect 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.650
 First 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.900
 and in need to accompany me Spain do not come 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.760
 another day guys let's go first be 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.660
 you just have to save the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.460
 rhythm 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.670
 get it and get this career from 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.670
 no type 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.040
 we are going to complete the second round and not 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.110
 would miss the last one let's go set 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.760
 so that although my god 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.830
 because this that carries the same thing that 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.000
 they are collecting is kid who copied 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.290
 is not again me that with the same 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.060
 site that before but what happens to me there 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.130
 Whoever passes that curve, I think the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.260
 floor for sure is a little bit 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.820
 pocho on things like they are smaller 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.560
 bashbush we follow the mouths first 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.690
 once again they catch me new see and 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.010
 one more time because if you do not see your vouchers 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.290
 boy missing a whole lap missing 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.790
 enough so we can not make ourselves 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.060
 illusions still worth we comment very 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.060
 all right 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:19.430
 like a game 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:23.370
 shit inside the container guys 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.420
 also the second assured 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:33.370
 I just equipped those similar people 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:39.290
 boy I can not believe it by the air 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.340
 the asshole air with the natives we follow 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.450
 first a motorcycle goes flying out there 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.640
 very well I think it's a pretty detail 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.640
 correct we caught the point 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.080
 ok ok but we have the next point 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.319
 perfect here we go let's go let's go 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.319
 we go 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.250
 subscriber so in plan because if I 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.400
 work 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.950
 we are missing two little dots two olé dots 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.250
 Ole Ole 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.250

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.700

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.870
