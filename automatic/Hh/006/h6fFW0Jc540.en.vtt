00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.190
 muds 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.680
 I'm here today to explain to you. 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.630
 on a new scheme of video-lessons that 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.410
 I'm selling nelson and video video 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.139
 on order and what happens I already give 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.090
 the live skype route has a good time 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.730
 and there is also a good time is there are people me 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.160
 This era makes for more 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.439
 specific for sale if on video that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.820
 I do not have the money to pay tuition or 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.399
 So I do not have time to take on a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.640
 fixed commitment there every week is everything 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.070
 month and so on and so on these days I resorted to 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.730
 think more about it and it ended 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.590
 which worked very well I I before you 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.960
 before I post this video that you are 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.660
 seeing now I already started with a business 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.820
 so it 's selling very well right then 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.469
 I decided to make this video that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.770
 pricing how it works 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.800
 so there's no good sound the videos are them 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.890
 are basically measured and 13 types 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.409
 different are the separations by 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.310
 Please, we'll have the videos of 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.729
 five links of 10 links and of 20m x all 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.560
 good 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.909
 the price is not here in the description does not 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.700
 I'll tell the price here the video because 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.009
 it is not that he decided to make the adjustment that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.720
 it will not be very sure but it is not 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.150
 that I'm going to do something and then I 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.799
 Do not stop talking here in the video, no. 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.930
 will always be here in the description of the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.450
 video is the catalog updated with everything 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.119
 that I already have for sale and also the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.119
 prices right then back right 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.000
 videos from 5 10 and 20 links all that I 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.900
 I asked now were videos intended to 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.030
 technical 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.220
 Yeah, but you can contact the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.579
 people can see something for theory 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.259
 harmony too and there the person comes speech 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.180
 always in pokhara I want to study the 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.509
 some techniques diversified by 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.340
 example I like to play rock'n'roll and 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.700
 I want some links so I can 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.740
 yes, the loc or beauty is fine there 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.590
 Dude, if he wants, he can ask for a 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.649
 pack of 10 links for example it can 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.690
 talk look I want three tep links 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.770
 3 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.340
 the state has nothing and 4 link only with the 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.620
 flip beauty understood and what happened 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.630
 these videos are all customized not 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.670
 is the customer can ask 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.560
 according to what he wants to understand 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.320
 Then the person comes and tells me what she wants. 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.290
 and one amount a proposal in video I 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.360
 I try to do an analysis first. 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.270
 time to observe how the person 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.190
 already plays if you have a video or audio so 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.680
 to send me I ask that I can 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.470
 analyze for doing nothing below and 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.490
 not so much higher than the person already 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.280
 knows to be able to take 11 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.910
 cool stuff like that right? 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.250
 so it's all right, 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.060
 you can contact and take your 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.180
 doubts 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.120
 but so very good I've ever recorded is a 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.070
 where you may have nothing 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.940
 I recorded one of a modern rock record 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.950
 I recorded one of 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.840
 exercises also have some more 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.050
 things I've already recorded that the catalog 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.780
 will have that in the description of the video is 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.480
 Right now and I'll show you how 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.120
 It works, right? So I 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.540
 I prepared a sample link, just to 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.890
 you see how it goes 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.060
 It's not in the video lesson. 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.640
 as it already comes because it is a 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.520
 video file that already comes with all 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.020
 links is that all the links they are 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.580
 explained are demonstrated in the 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.920
 slow speed is normal 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.200
 then they have a verbal and 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.519
 then have the application to playback 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.340
 You'll see how it goes. 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.720
 so let's take an example here now 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:56.060
 from a link to you right then let's 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.100
 look like he's here naná 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.080
 video lesson now how would you go? 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.410
 Let us suppose that this is today that one is the 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.810
 first link from the right package then 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.810
 Let's go and see what it's like. 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.270
 this link 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.610
 where built on top of the archer of 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.700
 me as the seventh major where we 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.670
 will start here on rope 4 house 13 with 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.530
 connected right and you notice in the table 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.560
 height you will see that it is a link 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.500
 octave is and we are going to have a slide 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.480
 here make a ticket for you 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.970
 still sent at higher air kiss 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.880
 larger concept only using another one here 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.900
 chip and the end of it will look like 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.110
 the beginning 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.750
 only an octave down that's fine then 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.240
 I want you to watch the connected 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.020
 because you need to apply 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:10.100
 a considerable force for them to do 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:16.100
 it's a sound with the right volume right 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:18.500
 also in the slides and in the time of the link 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.480
 okay so it's important to you 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.280
 try all this and start training 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.960
 slowly and then increase 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.810
 speed can be practiced 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.780
 teaching of playback at speed 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.260
 slowly at normal speed without problem 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.180
 none 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.980
 Okay, so let's now check out the 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.980
 application in playback 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.930
 ae 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.129
 Alright then how did you see the link has? 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.150
 is demonstration at normal speed in the 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.310
 slow speed 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.810
 after the explanation and then application 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.539
 in tribeca the two speeds this 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.139
 It happens with all the links you 're on and on 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:12.599
 the end of all these explanations of the 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:15.419
 application links if this has a 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:18.330
 general application of all links in the 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:21.479
 playback understood then I make a video 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.939
 is the application soil 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:27.240
 to see how they would look like this 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:30.000
 all the links in the right playback with a 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.909
 some connection between them including me already 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.659
 have some application videos here 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.909
 on my way 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:38.340
 You can see on the screen I'm going to put some 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:40.530
 place here you can click for you 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.810
 check out some application videos of 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.270
 effects and already enjoy and already have interest 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.590

 that it was not the system he sees 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:56.729
