00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.080
 so that it would fall until it seems like 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:19.009
 It may be like envy, I do not know, I do not know 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.320
 there's something very deep that that kind of 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.320
 rivals as they want to win us 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.890
 then knowing that they do not want 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.890
 win as 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.830
 we do not have to fall for their games 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.290
 kicks up to even arbitration of 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.050
 arbitration can can happen and that 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.180
 I also tell you that we have very marked 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.580
 do not forget to do everything 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.980
 work and good to win not that what 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.840
 primordial I think we have to be 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.629
 very smart not to despair 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.269
 know what what we know to do that 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.010
 is to have the ball and pay attention to 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.980
 obvious indications of the technician he 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.320
 will know the approach that will have to 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.079
 do will know how to stand on court 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.479
 rival, I will not be easy because 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.869
 are we are visiting with a 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.580
 hostile environment where where you can 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.350
 complicate but where we have the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.729
 ability also to overcome 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.550
 our circumstances no mexico has 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.200
 grown in mentality and we have started to 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.380
 believe that we are made for things 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.409
 big 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.710
 who seeks his 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.659
 have in favor many things like this that 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.270
 tell us the weather we want to play 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.420
 against all of that all also 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.220
 when is the Aztec said he imposes the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.220
 selection in the stadium the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.750
 at the height of everything you can say and 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.750
 well everyone I do not have to think 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.380
 so much in that in our game and not 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.380
 they serve things 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.549
 the match here in the Aztec against 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.859
 against Jamaica shared obviously of 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.990
 those that happen once every five years 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:00.140
 every ten years no no it is not very frequent 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.390
 what happens, but it usually happens to us 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.119
 players sometimes draws him not 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.149
 you get or you do not even get a pass 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.099
 and it's very common in the soccer player but you 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.080
 I say we have to forget this let in 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.180
 the past and live the present do not think 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.400
 in what comes to raise the game well 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.810
 and leave with the greatest confidence as 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.400
 has been demonstrating the selection in 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.470
 all its categories I do not think that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.870
 mexico is repeated again has grown 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.690
 a lot we do not believe and that's what 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.690
 that we have good achievements 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.690
 important as those achieved 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.480
 lately they are a package that does not 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.660
 liked but then only one party 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.390
 there is also no need to point out no 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.489
 that does not happen what happened to us what was 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.019
 that through us was not not in 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.299
 a beginning and at the end that was the 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.420
 goal that was always the goal and 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:54.650
 dallas a role 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.260
 it was a bad game it was just the beginning 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.870
 of the hexagonal and ccoo that the team 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.260
 lift and you will not have any doubt in 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.260
 qualify
