contrary to popular belief though your

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.219 
contrary to popular belief though your
your<00:01:02.309> body<00:01:02.579> type<00:01:02.910> does<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.270> affect<00:01:03.930> how<00:01:04.080> much

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
your body type does not affect how much

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.960

damage<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.739> makes<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.100> pretty<00:01:05.400> much<00:01:05.640> does<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
damage it makes it pretty much does the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880 
damage it makes it pretty much does the
same<00:01:06.150> exact<00:01:06.479> thing<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.110> knife<00:01:07.320> but<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.650> more
