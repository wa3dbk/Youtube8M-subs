00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.070 
say they're back I mean that was a big
shock<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.729> confidence<00:02:01.149> I<00:02:01.509> think<00:02:01.869> they're

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
shock to the confidence I think they're

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.440 
shock to the confidence I think they're
so<00:02:02.679> they'll<00:02:03.009> build<00:02:03.310> up<00:02:03.460> again<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.940> that<00:02:04.270> win

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
so they'll build up again and that win

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.630 
so they'll build up again and that win
against<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.840> Springboks<00:02:05.289> whilst<00:02:05.590> they<00:02:05.979> it

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
against the Springboks whilst they it

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.820 
against the Springboks whilst they it
wasn't<00:02:07.000> convincing<00:02:07.690> they<00:02:08.410> won<00:02:08.590> in<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.769> last

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
wasn't convincing they won in the last

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.190 
wasn't convincing they won in the last
few<00:02:09.160> minutes<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.640> game<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:11.080> that's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
few minutes of the game and so that's

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.620 
few minutes of the game and so that's
good<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.560> know<00:02:11.680> they<00:02:11.980> played<00:02:12.519> pretty<00:02:13.390> average

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
good you know they played pretty average

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.240 
good you know they played pretty average
but<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:14.440> still<00:02:14.620> got<00:02:14.769> a<00:02:14.800> winner<00:02:15.040> way<00:02:15.190> so

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
but they still got a winner way so

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.430 
but they still got a winner way so
that's<00:02:15.489> sometimes<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.269> good<00:02:16.390> sign<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.319> think

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
that's sometimes a good sign so I think

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.350 
that's sometimes a good sign so I think
the<00:02:17.680> Wallabies<00:02:18.100> confidence<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.910> something

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
the Wallabies confidence is something

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.759 
the Wallabies confidence is something
that<00:02:19.480> they<00:02:19.630> really<00:02:19.840> need<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.170> build<00:02:20.350> up<00:02:20.530> after

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
that they really need to build up after

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.530 
that they really need to build up after
one<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.040> them<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.250> walk<00:02:21.459> up<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.880> lot<00:02:22.269> of<00:02:22.299> your

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
one of them that walk up a lot of your

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.259 
one of them that walk up a lot of your
core<00:02:23.110> players<00:02:23.470> from<00:02:23.910> 2007<00:02:24.910> are<00:02:25.030> still

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
core players from 2007 are still

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.210 
core players from 2007 are still
knocking<00:02:25.930> around<00:02:26.140> there<00:02:26.500> but<00:02:26.709> all<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.040> lot

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
knocking around there but all of a lot

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.090 
knocking around there but all of a lot
of<00:02:27.310> young<00:02:27.430> players<00:02:27.610> coming<00:02:27.880> through<00:02:28.180> as<00:02:28.540> well

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
of young players coming through as well

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.880 
of young players coming through as well
where<00:02:30.100> do<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.220> see<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:31.600> Springboks<00:02:32.410> going

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
where do you see the Springboks going

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.259 
where do you see the Springboks going
with<00:02:33.070> this<00:02:33.250> we<00:02:33.459> think<00:02:33.880> it's<00:02:33.970> gonna<00:02:34.030> be<00:02:34.150> a

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
with this we think it's gonna be a

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.850 
with this we think it's gonna be a
transition<00:02:34.750> with<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.049> younger<00:02:35.650> players

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
transition with the younger players

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.830 
transition with the younger players
breaking<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.519> worrying<00:02:37.030> factor<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.420> think<00:02:37.450> for

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
breaking in worrying factor I think for

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.900 
breaking in worrying factor I think for
for<00:02:37.870> us<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.500> yeah<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.459> think<00:02:39.579> there's

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
for us is that yeah and I think there's

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.220 
for us is that yeah and I think there's
more<00:02:40.090> than<00:02:40.269> three<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:40.750> have<00:02:40.840> come<00:02:40.989> from<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
more than three that have come from the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.470 
more than three that have come from the
2007<00:02:41.980> woke<00:02:42.100> up<00:02:42.250> from<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> Oobleck<00:02:42.670> squad<00:02:42.940> they

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
2007 woke up from the Oobleck squad they

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.270 
2007 woke up from the Oobleck squad they
seem<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.750> have<00:02:43.900> progress<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.650> moved<00:02:44.829> on<00:02:45.070> and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
seem to have progress that moved on and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.099 
seem to have progress that moved on and
and<00:02:45.459> blood<00:02:45.850> of<00:02:45.880> new<00:02:46.180> guys<00:02:46.359> with<00:02:46.630> enough<00:02:46.900> time

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
and blood of new guys with enough time

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.020 
and blood of new guys with enough time
if<00:02:47.410> they<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:47.739> well<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.250> they<00:02:48.430> lost<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.910> a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
if they go well and they lost in a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.090 
if they go well and they lost in a
effort<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.540> they<00:02:49.750> got<00:02:49.930> good<00:02:50.079> form<00:02:50.320> in<00:02:50.410> 2015

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
effort and they got good form in 2015

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.099 
effort and they got good form in 2015
the<00:02:51.549> experience<00:02:52.299> that<00:02:52.359> that<00:02:52.570> team<00:02:52.780> will<00:02:53.079> be

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
the experience that that team will be

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.920 
the experience that that team will be
probably<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.100> most<00:02:54.340> experienced<00:02:54.910> from<00:02:55.840> a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
probably the most experienced from a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.569 
probably the most experienced from a
from<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.290> caps<00:02:56.590> point<00:02:56.859> of<00:02:56.950> view<00:02:57.100> at<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.430> World

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
from a caps point of view at the World

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.910 
from a caps point of view at the World
Cup<00:02:57.760> no<00:02:58.359> that's<00:02:58.540> it's<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.810> big<00:02:58.959> risk<00:02:59.109> I<00:02:59.590> think<00:02:59.890> I

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
Cup no that's it's a big risk I think I

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.890 
Cup no that's it's a big risk I think I
