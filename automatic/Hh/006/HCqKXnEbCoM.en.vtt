 how about friends, I'm javier mota and 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.540
 we are here with talk jobs de caldas 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.280
 how is it 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.200
 the road already has an American name 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.269
 to speak perfectly Spanish because 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.010
 is from kids Mexico is very well very 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.779
 Well, thank you very much for having us 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.140
 here at the cadillac invitation to 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.260
 new atlanta love sports park for 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.240
 handle the new 2010 2003 they count a 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.470
 little this car in the transmission more 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.660
 days I had been very happy that 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.600
 be here we have a car completely 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.910
 new in haiti is 2013 is a car 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.920
 compact luxury that is has an aspect 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.100
 Sports comes in three different 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.470
 engine options you can buy a 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.909
 2.5-liter base and then you can 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.989
 buy this that we have here that is the 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:49.390
 of 2 liters turbo culminating with the 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.989
 engine option we have are 3.6 v6 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.760
 and every 321 horsepower and this 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.500
 this is the best balanced of all not 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.330
 sure even the engineers that we 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.799
 have recommended that this is the car that 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.479
 we must try so it will look like 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.210
 more a round here we talked a little 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.799
 let's go about on the fly how 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.460
 let's handle the mind if it took away the 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.770
 brake better if you are doing more 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.210
 it was not a small wood that we 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.979
 they put in to stop the car because 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.800
 we were standing here in transmission 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.229
 manual so let's diet is a car 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.630
 completely new is not to say a 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.270
 redesign of the site is that it is a bit more 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.340
 big is a car that engineers 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.500
 designers of the general motors of the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.729
 face and the one in particular 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.680
 developed just to compete 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.119
 in a segment and that correctly this one 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.580
 javier this is a car that we have 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.250
 completely new designed we have 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.240
 redesigned everything from the platform in 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.149
 the engines 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.909
 we have balanced in the car so that 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.439
 have a 50/50 balance is a very car 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.960
 lightweight the lightest in its kind of 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.450
 done and we feel like tourists we 're going 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.329
 to be able to compete and win 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.299
 and to compete fairly models 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.969
 with those who compete are the 3d series 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.399
 double well or mercedes benz figures 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.049
 and audi a4 mainly around here 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.820
 you went to actually do the 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.160
 germany tests we were not there 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.510
 demanded they were in the prime is the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.799
 famous track 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.530
 and even the German companies 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.540
 they test their cars there and that's where 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.939
 we were able to refine and put the cars 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.260
 we transferred and we are very proud 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.049
 of the product that we have as you can see 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.150
 right now are you angle on driving 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.470
 of these 12 it shows what you 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.959
 you mentioned that it is a car extremely 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.299
 light but at the same time with a lot 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.640
 control the balance that says 50/50 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.829
 really feel in the direction that 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.200
 it's electro electromechanical is no longer 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.290
 Hydraulics , however, has a large 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.800
 great control one the car does not 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.590
 where good directs it precisely 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.970
 another thing that we should mention the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.870
 function that you are feeling right now 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.340
 more curves 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.190
 we have a suspension we call 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.160
 magna baile is a technology that was 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.290
 introduced to look for our production 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.180
 by cadillac and now ferrari 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.740
 is also using or is it a 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.270
 export in reverse because at 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.600
 general many things come from europe 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.950
 us in this case has been the wants to 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.730
 engine that is giving you lessons 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.730
 let's say the ferrari 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.580
 practically the entire track to 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.980
 who we planted response that 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.630
 handles in third gear although to 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.970
 times here in the separate layers it 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.720
 can lower the second to redirect the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.520
 auto and taking advantage of this track has 1.8 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.060
 miles of trajectory 14 curves and 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.280
 unfortunately they have not left us 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.840
 drive here on the main straight but 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.030
 well at least we have taken out here 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.940
 for the quite take advantage of this 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.010
 super motor is not happiness made from a 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.320
 great car the truth is is very very 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.420
 very nice to handle besides not 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.950
 only the performance inside 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.570
 things that cadillac had never done 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.850
 as for example carbon fiber here 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.320
 in the correct correct panels and other 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.380
 which we must mention in this 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.590
 model is that it has the cue system that 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.140
 is the system 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.950
 that controls all technologies 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.840
 of the car navigation audio system and 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.280
 air information and has many things 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.950
 which is a new technology too 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.109
 correct and several there are several technologies 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.030
 that our themes come, I think they are 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.389
 first in the automotive industry 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.340
 for example the screen is touch 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.620
 capacitive stable people ask 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.990
 at home what does this mean if you 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.790
 you watch a phone iphone a phone 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.830
 android 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.960
 it's the same technology you do not have to 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.729
 put pressure on the screen when you touch it 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.440
 but basically when your body 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.870
 connects an electrical circuit with the 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.270
 screen then then it's something that 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.860
 it also gives you a resolution 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.990
 greater or you can say that the 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.790
 screen of your movements too 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.500
 we intend what you want 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.570
 we have a proximity sensor in the 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.220
 car when you bring your hand you appear 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.510
 more buttons and it's something also that 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.350
 squeeze in the automotive industry already 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.830
 same 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.830
 Excellent 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.610
 well a second round here with the 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.610
 Haiti is 2 liters turbocharged 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.990
 is already grabbing the handle yo 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.990
 I think it is not much more 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.039
 It is worth mentioning that this javier track 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:27.409
 they just opened it about three months ago 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:29.419
 It is a private track for members 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:33.440
 they have a fast car that they want 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.979
 handle the highest power of the car but not 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.270
 they can do it on public roads 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:42.530
 a membership costs you approximately 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:45.409
 20 thousand dollars and you can be up 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.849
 range of 200 thousand dollars a year down and 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.620
 that in addition to the car you must buy 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.300
 because if you're going to come here good in 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.069
 actually this car let's talk about that 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.789
 talking about cadillac prices haiti 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:57.530
 it's really a price in addition to 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.969
 that although it has all that great 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.849
 technology that we are taking advantage of 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.650
 now here and showing the car 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.639
 accessible at the price not clear yes 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.710
 This is a section with many years and 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.520
 we give you your tickets 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.550
 the car starts costing 33 thousand 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.550
 dollars approximately 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.980
 1 all equipment can cost you up to 2 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.290
 that if we take into account how we talked 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.540
 of the German competition actually 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.120
 the prices there soar much more 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.680
 that so a great competition that 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.030
 are going to have the Germans with our 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.030
 new offer 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.900
 2013 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.270
 We can actually be here all day 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:42.270
 driving hilarious 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.110
 4a 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.949
 at 36 miles per hour 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:54.949
 it's very good 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.440
 incredible the car the truth very good 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.410
 and although I know that maybe he can not 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.270
 answer the question I have to ask you 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.490
 do anyway there will be a plan 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.990
 to put a bird next to the name and 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.210
 feet in the future 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.430
 Look, it 's a question that many people 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.380
 they do and this one we appreciate, I'm going to 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.120
 ask everyone to stay home 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.560
 aware for news in the future but 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.970
 right now we have this car for 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.970
 enjoy excellent thanks
