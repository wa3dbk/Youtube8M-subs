spring<00:04:59.100> the<00:05:00.100> large<00:05:00.370> spring<00:05:00.850> will<00:05:01.150> go<00:05:01.360> over<00:05:03.870> the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
spring the large spring will go over the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.680 
spring the large spring will go over the
cable<00:05:05.290> housing<00:05:06.030> go<00:05:07.030> ahead<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.300> push<00:05:07.480> that

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
cable housing go ahead and push that

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.150 
cable housing go ahead and push that
there<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.050> now<00:05:08.170> let's<00:05:08.350> go<00:05:08.500> ahead<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:08.860> feed

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
there and now let's go ahead and feed

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:18.780 
there and now let's go ahead and feed
the<00:05:09.760> cable<00:05:10.210> through<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.540> cable<00:05:10.930> holder<00:05:17.790> push

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
the cable through the cable holder push

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.090 
the cable through the cable holder push
the<00:05:19.030> ferrule<00:05:19.540> on<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:19.900> cable<00:05:20.290> housing<00:05:20.710> into

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
the ferrule on the cable housing into

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.730 
the ferrule on the cable housing into
the<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:22.120> adjustment<00:05:22.750> nut<00:05:22.900> go<00:05:23.230> ahead<00:05:23.530> and

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
the the adjustment nut go ahead and

the the adjustment nut go ahead and
slide<00:05:24.040> your<00:05:24.340> spring<00:05:25.860> up<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:27.130> the<00:05:27.250> cable<00:05:27.580> nut

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
slide your spring up to the cable nut

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.700 
slide your spring up to the cable nut
and<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.030> spring<00:05:28.360> is<00:05:28.600> what<00:05:28.870> keeps<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.290> K<00:05:29.590> it

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
and the spring is what keeps the K it

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.810 
and the spring is what keeps the K it
will<00:05:29.770> keep<00:05:29.950> the<00:05:30.070> cable<00:05:30.250> away<00:05:30.580> from<00:05:30.610> the

will keep the cable away from the

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.810 
will keep the cable away from the
cylinder<00:05:31.740> here<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:32.800> keep<00:05:33.130> it<00:05:33.280> from<00:05:33.430> getting<00:05:33.490> a

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
cylinder here and keep it from getting a

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.560 
cylinder here and keep it from getting a
too<00:05:34.060> hot<00:05:35.280> your<00:05:36.280> smaller<00:05:36.790> spring<00:05:37.330> will<00:05:38.140> go<00:05:39.570> over

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
too hot your smaller spring will go over

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.890 
too hot your smaller spring will go over
the<00:05:40.750> cable<00:05:41.730> go<00:05:42.730> ahead<00:05:42.940> and<00:05:43.090> push<00:05:43.300> your<00:05:43.450> cable
