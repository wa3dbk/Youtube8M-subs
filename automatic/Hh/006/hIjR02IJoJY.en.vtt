get the idea it's so cool that so you

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.090 
get the idea it's so cool that so you
can't<00:00:53.479> see<00:00:54.050> like<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:56.360> other<00:00:56.589> walls<00:00:57.589> on<00:00:57.979> the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.829 
can't see like the other walls on the
inside<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.790> can<00:00:58.909> only<00:00:59.000> see<00:00:59.239> like<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.509> nearest

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
inside you can only see like the nearest

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.670 
inside you can only see like the nearest
one<00:01:01.449> so<00:01:02.449> it<00:01:02.600> looks<00:01:02.750> like<00:01:02.809> all<00:01:03.019> that<00:01:03.170> stuff<00:01:03.350> on
