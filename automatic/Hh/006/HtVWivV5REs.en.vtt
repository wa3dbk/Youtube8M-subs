hey what's up guys this is King yo-yo
here<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:23.029> how<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.090> boost<00:00:24.680> weapons<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.920> Far

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
here this is how to boost weapons on Far

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.210 
here this is how to boost weapons on Far
Cry<00:00:26.310> 2<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> little<00:00:28.410> um<00:00:28.800> video

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
Cry 2 and this is like a little um video

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.420 
Cry 2 and this is like a little um video
actually<00:00:29.730> because<00:00:30.029> there's<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.359> much<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.689> do

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
actually because there's so much to do

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.010 
actually because there's so much to do
the<00:00:32.430> reason<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:32.969> decided<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.570> make<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> video

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the reason we decided to make a video

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.000 
the reason we decided to make a video
for<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.829> because<00:00:34.980> pretty<00:00:35.520> much<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
for this is because pretty much the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.190 
for this is because pretty much the
solutions<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.160> were<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.610> ta<00:00:38.879> were<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:39.870> very

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
solutions that were on ta were not very

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.380 
solutions that were on ta were not very
specific<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.980> how<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.219> boost<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.940> we

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
specific on how to boost and we

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.479 
specific on how to boost and we
encountered<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.410> many<00:00:43.440> problems<00:00:44.280> while

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
encountered so many problems while

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.910 
encountered so many problems while
boosting<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.420> could<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:45.920> figure

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
boosting and we just could not figure

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.270 
boosting and we just could not figure
out<00:00:47.100> how<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.550> some<00:00:47.789> stuff<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.500> this

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
out how to do some stuff on here so this

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.130 
out how to do some stuff on here so this
is<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:52.039> exactly<00:00:53.039> how<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> do<00:00:53.879> everything<00:00:54.420> on

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
is just exactly how to do everything on

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
is just exactly how to do everything on
here<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.579> learned<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.910> lot<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
here because we we learned a lot and I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
here because we we learned a lot and I
wish<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.379> video<00:00:58.680> existed<00:00:59.250> when<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.640> were

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
wish this video existed when we were

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.090 
wish this video existed when we were
when<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.390> were<00:01:00.510> boosting<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.949> want

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
when we were boosting so what you want

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.320 
when we were boosting so what you want
to<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:04.129> yourself<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.090> dummy

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
to do is have yourself and then a dummy

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.390 
to do is have yourself and then a dummy
and<00:01:06.659> then<00:01:07.080> you're<00:01:07.290> boosting<00:01:07.470> partner<00:01:08.070> so

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and then you're boosting partner so

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.969 
and then you're boosting partner so
right<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.479> boosting<00:01:09.840> partner<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
right here the boosting partner and the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.740 
right here the boosting partner and the
dummy<00:01:11.159> are<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> team<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.240> my<00:01:12.600> own

dummy are on a team and I'm on my own
team<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.680> harvested<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.130> game<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
team and I harvested a game so just to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.260 
team and I harvested a game so just to
you<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.619> make<00:01:16.710> make<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> match<00:01:17.640> exactly<00:01:17.970> how

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
you know make make the match exactly how

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.580 
you know make make the match exactly how
I<00:01:18.299> did<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.820> this<00:01:20.820> map<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.119> dirty<00:01:21.659> work<00:01:21.960> which<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
I did and this map is dirty work which a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.859 
I did and this map is dirty work which a
lot<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.860> people<00:01:23.189> say<00:01:23.460> last<00:01:23.850> bastion<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.630> better

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
lot of people say last bastion is better

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.070 
lot of people say last bastion is better
but<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.640> tried<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.240> couple<00:01:27.299> times<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.930> we

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
but we we tried it a couple times and we

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.950 
but we we tried it a couple times and we
didn't<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.509> found<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.810> little

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
didn't like it so and we found a little

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.740 
didn't like it so and we found a little
spot<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.640> boost<00:01:32.640> warlord<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.390> too<00:01:33.570> but

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
spot to boost warlord on here too but

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.780 
spot to boost warlord on here too but
we'll<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> warlord<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.220> another<00:01:35.460> video

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
we'll get to warlord in another video

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.370 
we'll get to warlord in another video
this<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:37.189> just<00:01:38.189> weapons<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> as

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
this is going to be just weapons so as

this is going to be just weapons so as
soon<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> game<00:01:43.979> starts<00:01:44.549> here<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:46.860> want<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
soon as the game starts here you want to

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.100 
soon as the game starts here you want to
switch<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.549> whatever<00:01:48.299> weapon<00:01:48.659> you're<00:01:48.780> working

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
you have to do I think 150 for one

like that so you just come over here
so<00:02:21.400> my<00:02:21.519> boosting<00:02:21.910> partner<00:02:22.269> took<00:02:23.019> himself<00:02:23.530> and

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
so my boosting partner took himself and

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.530 
so my boosting partner took himself and
the<00:02:24.430> dummy<00:02:24.610> up<00:02:24.879> on<00:02:25.060> top<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.390> little

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
the dummy up on top of that little

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.020 
the dummy up on top of that little
building<00:02:25.750> up<00:02:26.049> there<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.470> just<00:02:27.250> showed<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:31.530> then

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
building up there I just showed and then

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.220 
building up there I just showed and then
you<00:02:34.030> walk<00:02:34.239> up<00:02:34.450> here<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:38.950> shoot<00:02:39.400> him

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
you walk up here and you just shoot him

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.250 
you walk up here and you just shoot him
there<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.260> go<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.709> then<00:02:42.360> he<00:02:43.360> he's<00:02:43.720> turbo<00:02:44.079> and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
there you go and then he he's turbo and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.830 
there you go and then he he's turbo and
why<00:02:44.410> right<00:02:44.620> now<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:44.950> he<00:02:45.040> can<00:02:45.190> go<00:02:45.310> afk

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
why right now so he can go afk

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.180 
why right now so he can go afk
for<00:02:46.840> 15<00:02:47.170> minutes<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.680> then<00:02:47.769> you<00:02:47.890> just<00:02:48.069> keep

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
for 15 minutes and then you just keep

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.309 
for 15 minutes and then you just keep
shooting<00:02:48.760> keep<00:02:49.030> shooting<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.870> game<00:02:53.110> is

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
shooting keep shooting this game is

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.920 
shooting keep shooting this game is
really<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:54.190> lot<00:02:54.970> better<00:02:55.390> when<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.780> have<00:02:55.870> a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
really a lot better when you have a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.080 
really a lot better when you have a
turbo<00:02:56.319> controller<00:02:56.470> because<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.549> get<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.910> go

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
turbo controller because you get to go

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.900 
turbo controller because you get to go
away<00:02:58.180> for<00:02:58.569> a<00:02:58.599> really<00:02:59.500> long<00:02:59.650> time<00:02:59.709> so<00:03:00.459> now<00:03:00.609> on<00:03:00.790> to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
away for a really long time so now on to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.839 
away for a really long time so now on to
executions<00:03:03.750> executions<00:03:04.750> are<00:03:05.640> instead<00:03:06.640> of

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
executions executions are instead of

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.920 
executions executions are instead of
just<00:03:07.840> killing<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.319> person<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:10.690> down

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
just killing the person you you you down

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.280 
just killing the person you you you down
them<00:03:11.109> which<00:03:11.739> counts<00:03:12.340> as<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.459> kill<00:03:13.109> but<00:03:14.109> then

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
them which counts as a kill but then

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.830 
them which counts as a kill but then
when<00:03:14.950> they're<00:03:15.069> on<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.280> ground<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:16.000> let<00:03:16.660> me

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
when they're on the ground you let me

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.190 
when they're on the ground you let me
actually<00:03:17.470> kill<00:03:17.680> him<00:03:17.829> for<00:03:18.010> real<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:18.930> that's<00:03:19.930> an

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
actually kill him for real and that's an

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.080 
actually kill him for real and that's an
execution<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:21.010> we<00:03:21.280> could<00:03:21.489> not<00:03:21.609> figure<00:03:21.849> that

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
execution and we could not figure that

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.339 
execution and we could not figure that
out<00:03:22.269> when<00:03:22.389> we<00:03:22.510> first<00:03:22.660> started<00:03:23.049> playing<00:03:23.079> this

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
out when we first started playing this

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.390 
out when we first started playing this
game<00:03:23.530> you're<00:03:23.709> like<00:03:23.859> well<00:03:23.980> what<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.220> hell<00:03:24.340> is

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
game you're like well what the hell is

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.289 
game you're like well what the hell is
in<00:03:24.489> execution<00:03:25.060> how<00:03:25.180> do<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.359> do<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.940> we

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
in execution how do you do that so we

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.129 
in execution how do you do that so we
recommend<00:03:28.660> doing<00:03:28.959> executions<00:03:29.769> first<00:03:31.109> so<00:03:32.109> that

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
recommend doing executions first so that

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.490 
recommend doing executions first so that
that<00:03:33.069> way<00:03:33.310> when<00:03:33.880> you're<00:03:34.269> starting<00:03:34.630> your<00:03:35.019> kills

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
that way when you're starting your kills

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.890 
that way when you're starting your kills
you<00:03:35.829> already<00:03:36.130> have<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.730> lot<00:03:37.269> of<00:03:37.299> kills<00:03:37.599> done

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
you already have a lot of kills done

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.690 
you already have a lot of kills done
already<00:03:38.049> because<00:03:38.530> executions<00:03:39.340> count<00:03:39.579> as

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
already because executions count as

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.599 
already because executions count as
kills<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.120> isn't<00:03:40.389> set<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.280> just<00:03:42.459> keep

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
kills it isn't set so you just keep

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.120 
kills it isn't set so you just keep
doing<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.410> then<00:03:44.410> there's<00:03:44.650> some<00:03:44.799> ammo

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
doing that and then there's some ammo

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.940 
doing that and then there's some ammo
right<00:03:45.280> there<00:03:45.519> you<00:03:45.700> can<00:03:45.849> keep<00:03:45.970> getting<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.660> it

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
right there you can keep getting and it

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.920 
right there you can keep getting and it
I'm<00:03:47.950> not<00:03:48.130> I'm<00:03:48.549> not<00:03:48.760> doing<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.180> as<00:03:49.419> efficiently

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
I'm not I'm not doing it as efficiently

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.659 
I'm not I'm not doing it as efficiently
as<00:03:50.169> possible<00:03:50.260> in<00:03:50.799> this<00:03:50.889> video<00:03:51.190> because<00:03:51.370> it's

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
as possible in this video because it's

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.610 
as possible in this video because it's
been<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.910> while<00:03:52.120> since<00:03:52.359> we've<00:03:52.569> done<00:03:52.599> this<00:03:52.780> but

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
been a while since we've done this but

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.740 
been a while since we've done this but
when<00:03:54.519> you're<00:03:54.669> doing<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.060> you'll<00:03:55.239> you'll<00:03:55.599> get

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
when you're doing it you'll you'll get

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.080 
when you're doing it you'll you'll get
faster<00:03:55.989> at<00:03:56.349> it<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:56.680> you'll<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.910> don't<00:03:58.030> know

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
faster at it and you'll you don't know

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.809 
faster at it and you'll you don't know
what<00:03:58.239> you're<00:03:58.359> doing<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.540> oh<00:04:02.459> yeah<00:04:03.489> another

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
what you're doing so oh yeah another

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.650 
what you're doing so oh yeah another
thing<00:04:04.079> when<00:04:05.280> when<00:04:06.280> whoever<00:04:07.239> you're<00:04:07.389> boosting

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
thing when when whoever you're boosting

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.240 
thing when when whoever you're boosting
with<00:04:07.720> spawns<00:04:08.109> they<00:04:08.410> have<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.680> shoot<00:04:08.919> their<00:04:09.099> gun

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
with spawns they have to shoot their gun

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.830 
with spawns they have to shoot their gun
so<00:04:09.549> that<00:04:09.579> their<00:04:09.849> spawn<00:04:10.090> shield<00:04:10.359> goes<00:04:10.569> away

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
so that their spawn shield goes away

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.470 
so that their spawn shield goes away
because<00:04:11.769> if<00:04:11.889> not<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.160> have<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.370> wait<00:04:12.489> like<00:04:12.730> 10

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
because if not you have to wait like 10

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.949 
because if not you have to wait like 10
seconds<00:04:13.930> or<00:04:14.049> something<00:04:14.850> okay<00:04:15.850> so<00:04:16.269> now<00:04:16.419> on<00:04:16.660> to

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
seconds or something okay so now on to

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.320 
seconds or something okay so now on to
headshots<00:04:17.470> headshot<00:04:18.100> self-explanatory

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.730 

you<00:04:22.330> just<00:04:22.540> shoot<00:04:22.690> him<00:04:22.780> in<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:22.930> head<00:04:23.170> and<00:04:23.380> then

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
you just shoot him in the head and then

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.800 
you just shoot him in the head and then
they<00:04:23.980> spawn<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.580> then<00:04:25.270> you<00:04:25.420> just<00:04:25.600> shoot<00:04:25.750> him

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
they spawn and then you just shoot him

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.370 
they spawn and then you just shoot him
in<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:25.960> head<00:04:26.050> again

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
in the head again

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.000 
in the head again
well<00:04:27.000> it's<00:04:28.000> pretty<00:04:28.150> easy<00:04:31.260> it's<00:04:32.260> best<00:04:32.650> it's

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
well it's pretty easy it's best it's

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.990 
well it's pretty easy it's best it's
best<00:04:33.250> done<00:04:33.490> with<00:04:33.610> a<00:04:33.670> sniper<00:04:33.970> it's<00:04:35.670> easier<00:04:36.670> I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
best done with a sniper it's easier I

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.300 
best done with a sniper it's easier I
guess<00:04:37.650> what<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:38.710> have<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.950> get<00:04:39.100> headshots

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
guess what you have to get headshots

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.120 
guess what you have to get headshots
with<00:04:39.700> every<00:04:39.970> gun<00:04:40.530> but<00:04:41.530> when<00:04:41.890> you<00:04:41.980> have<00:04:42.070> a

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
with every gun but when you have a

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.530 
with every gun but when you have a
sniper<00:04:42.340> it's<00:04:42.670> cool<00:04:42.880> because<00:04:43.000> you<00:04:43.210> can<00:04:43.240> just

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
sniper it's cool because you can just

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.020 
sniper it's cool because you can just
sit<00:04:43.690> in<00:04:43.780> one<00:04:43.960> spot<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.610> you<00:04:45.610> can<00:04:45.760> pretty<00:04:45.940> much

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
sit in one spot and you can pretty much

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.060 
sit in one spot and you can pretty much
see<00:04:46.390> him<00:04:46.510> spawn<00:04:46.870> there<00:04:47.410> like<00:04:47.680> three<00:04:47.950> or<00:04:48.040> four

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
see him spawn there like three or four

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.820 
see him spawn there like three or four
spawns<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.550> can<00:04:48.730> see<00:04:48.910> him<00:04:49.060> spawn<00:04:49.360> from<00:04:49.990> that

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
spawns you can see him spawn from that

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.480 
spawns you can see him spawn from that
one<00:04:51.010> spot<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:51.790> can<00:04:51.910> see<00:04:52.060> all<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.330> spawns<00:04:52.600> so

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
one spot you can see all the spawns so

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.210 
one spot you can see all the spawns so
snipers<00:04:54.490> are<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.970> best<00:04:55.770> but<00:04:56.770> for<00:04:56.950> this<00:04:57.070> one

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
snipers are the best but for this one

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.160 
snipers are the best but for this one
you<00:04:57.340> just<00:04:57.370> you<00:04:57.850> know<00:04:57.940> headshot<00:04:58.360> them<00:04:58.540> make

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
you just you know headshot them make

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.870 
you just you know headshot them make
them<00:04:59.350> let<00:04:59.770> away<00:04:59.980> from<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.280> spawn<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.820> then

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
them let away from the spawn and then

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.820 
them let away from the spawn and then
headshot<00:05:01.210> him<00:05:01.300> again<00:05:01.600> away<00:05:02.290> from<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.590> spawn

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
headshot him again away from the spawn

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.730 
headshot him again away from the spawn
you<00:05:03.070> know<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:06.280> think<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.990> last<00:05:08.200> thing<00:05:08.440> we

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
you know and I think the last thing we

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.570 
you know and I think the last thing we
will<00:05:08.800> be<00:05:08.920> covering<00:05:10.050> is<00:05:13.260> multi<00:05:14.260> kills<00:05:14.550> yeah

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
will be covering is multi kills yeah

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.080 
will be covering is multi kills yeah
multi<00:05:16.120> kills<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:18.640> is<00:05:18.880> also

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
multi kills and that is also

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.420 
multi kills and that is also
self-explanatory<00:05:19.840> you<00:05:20.440> just<00:05:20.800> get<00:05:21.070> two<00:05:21.250> kills

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
self-explanatory you just get two kills

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.580 
self-explanatory you just get two kills
now<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.090> thing<00:05:22.570> with<00:05:22.960> this<00:05:23.110> game<00:05:23.320> is<00:05:23.560> that

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
now the thing with this game is that

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.980 
now the thing with this game is that
they<00:05:24.220> made<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.550> explosives<00:05:25.180> on<00:05:25.360> here<00:05:25.600> really

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
they made the explosives on here really

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.620 
they made the explosives on here really
really<00:05:26.170> weak<00:05:26.650> like<00:05:27.310> they<00:05:27.880> don't<00:05:28.060> they<00:05:28.210> do<00:05:28.270> shit

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
really weak like they don't they do shit

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.780 
really weak like they don't they do shit
damage<00:05:28.990> so<00:05:29.170> you're<00:05:29.320> gonna<00:05:29.440> need<00:05:29.530> a<00:05:29.650> dummy<00:05:30.520> for

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
damage so you're gonna need a dummy for

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.440 
damage so you're gonna need a dummy for
this<00:05:30.910> one<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.300> what<00:05:32.020> you<00:05:32.080> do<00:05:32.200> is<00:05:32.380> you<00:05:32.530> shoot

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
well my boosting partner shoots his

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.250 
well my boosting partner shoots his
dummy<00:05:36.850> and<00:05:37.590> then<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:39.660> then<00:05:40.660> I<00:05:40.690> shoot<00:05:41.080> my

dummy and then and then I shoot my
boosting<00:05:41.650> partner<00:05:42.040> so<00:05:42.490> that<00:05:42.760> way<00:05:42.880> their

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
boosting partner so that way their

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.240 
boosting partner so that way their
health<00:05:43.330> is<00:05:43.540> both<00:05:43.720> really<00:05:43.990> really<00:05:44.350> low<00:05:44.800> then

you<00:06:01.390> go<00:06:01.510> multigo<00:06:01.950> it<00:06:02.950> sounds<00:06:03.880> complicated<00:06:04.240> at

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
you go multigo it sounds complicated at

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.720 
you go multigo it sounds complicated at
first<00:06:04.660> but<00:06:05.170> when<00:06:05.740> you're<00:06:05.890> doing<00:06:06.160> it<00:06:06.310> you'll<00:06:06.490> it

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
first but when you're doing it you'll it

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.350 
first but when you're doing it you'll it
you'll<00:06:06.940> see<00:06:07.150> it<00:06:07.270> make<00:06:07.420> it<00:06:07.780> makes<00:06:08.080> sense<00:06:09.360> so

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
you'll see it make it makes sense so

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.180 
you'll see it make it makes sense so
yeah<00:06:10.510> that's<00:06:10.750> pretty<00:06:10.990> much<00:06:11.110> how<00:06:11.770> to<00:06:11.800> do

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
yeah that's pretty much how to do

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.260 
yeah that's pretty much how to do
weapons<00:06:12.850> it<00:06:13.170> it's<00:06:14.170> a<00:06:14.320> it<00:06:14.980> really<00:06:15.790> does<00:06:15.970> sound

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
weapons it it's a it really does sound

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.570 
weapons it it's a it really does sound
very<00:06:16.810> complicated<00:06:17.470> but<00:06:17.680> it's<00:06:17.860> it's<00:06:18.190> it's

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
very complicated but it's it's it's

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.580 
very complicated but it's it's it's
really<00:06:18.730> not<00:06:18.940> if<00:06:19.180> you<00:06:19.330> plan<00:06:20.050> on<00:06:20.080> doing<00:06:20.440> this

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
really not if you plan on doing this

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.440 
really not if you plan on doing this
game<00:06:20.770> it's<00:06:20.980> certainly<00:06:21.310> better<00:06:21.550> this<00:06:22.030> guide<00:06:22.240> is

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
game it's certainly better this guide is

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.670 
game it's certainly better this guide is
certainly<00:06:22.720> better<00:06:22.930> than<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.200> guide<00:06:23.440> so<00:06:23.590> they

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
certainly better than the guide so they

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.990 
certainly better than the guide so they
have<00:06:23.830> on<00:06:23.980> ta<00:06:24.160> so<00:06:25.110> so<00:06:26.110> yeah<00:06:26.230> just<00:06:26.820> stay<00:06:27.820> tuned

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
have on ta so so yeah just stay tuned

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.700 
have on ta so so yeah just stay tuned
for<00:06:28.210> the<00:06:28.300> warlord<00:06:28.660> video<00:06:28.930> that<00:06:29.229> one<00:06:29.410> will<00:06:29.560> be

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
for the warlord video that one will be

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.870 
for the warlord video that one will be
up<00:06:29.919> shortly<00:06:30.240> so<00:06:31.240> see<00:06:31.630> you<00:06:31.690> guys
