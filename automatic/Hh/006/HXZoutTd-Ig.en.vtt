through each stage of the gullet there
were<00:00:39.570> there<00:00:40.140> was<00:00:40.260> no<00:00:40.500> easy<00:00:40.860> step<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.610> for

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
were there was no easy step here for

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.030 
were there was no easy step here for
cloud<00:00:42.030> nine<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.600> had<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.050> work<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.559> every

cloud nine they had to work for every

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.770 
cloud nine they had to work for every
single<00:00:44.340> inch<00:00:44.700> they<00:00:45.090> made<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.539> hard<00:00:45.719> on

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
single inch they made a little hard on

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.479 
single inch they made a little hard on
themselves<00:00:45.989> at<00:00:46.379> some<00:00:46.530> points<00:00:46.890> they<00:00:47.219> learned

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
themselves at some points they learned

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.400 
themselves at some points they learned
they<00:00:47.820> learned<00:00:48.090> exactly<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.750> gauntlet<00:00:49.079> there

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
they learned exactly a gauntlet there

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.020 
they learned exactly a gauntlet there
you<00:00:49.559> go<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:50.010> least<00:00:50.190> that's<00:00:50.430> that's<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> thing

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you go at least that's that's the thing

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
you go at least that's that's the thing
is<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.270> you're<00:00:51.420> you're<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:52.079> own<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.500> then

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
is if you're you're in your own way then

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.200 
is if you're you're in your own way then
it's<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> little<00:00:53.309> easier<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.730> past<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.090> had

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it's a little easier to get past we had

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.670 
it's a little easier to get past we had
to<00:00:54.329> give<00:00:54.449> him<00:00:54.570> some<00:00:54.780> training<00:00:55.170> before<00:00:55.440> he<00:00:55.500> send

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
to give him some training before he send

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.990 
to give him some training before he send
them<00:00:55.800> off<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> world's<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
them off the world's for not to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.549 
them off the world's for not to
represent<00:00:57.449> North<00:00:57.629> America<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> test

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
represent North America there is a test

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.900 
represent North America there is a test
there<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.859> definitely<00:00:59.190> trial<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.550> error<00:00:59.699> oh

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
there is definitely trial and error oh

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.430 
there is definitely trial and error oh
that's<00:01:00.239> hot<00:01:00.420> don't<00:01:00.660> touch<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.020> again<00:01:01.079> oh

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that's hot don't touch it again oh

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.630 
that's hot don't touch it again oh
that's<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> movement<00:01:02.160> let's<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.399> pick<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
that's a movement let's not pick that

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.219 
that's a movement let's not pick that
there<00:01:03.030> were<00:01:03.120> some<00:01:03.270> things<00:01:03.420> along<00:01:03.719> didn't<00:01:04.110> I

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
there were some things along didn't I

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
but looking at how they fixed stings so

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.649 
but looking at how they fixed stings so
quickly<00:01:10.770> how<00:01:10.890> they<00:01:11.100> adapted<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.909> gives<00:01:12.299> them<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
quickly how they adapted it gives them a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.090 
quickly how they adapted it gives them a
bit<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> light<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.710> end<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> tunnel

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
bit of a light at the end of the tunnel

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 
bit of a light at the end of the tunnel
on<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> world<00:01:14.670> stage<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.150> again<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.869> I
