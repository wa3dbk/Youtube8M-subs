nuts<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.040> seeds<00:00:05.310> are<00:00:05.490> delicious<00:00:06.060> and

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
nuts and seeds are delicious and

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.270 
nuts and seeds are delicious and
nutritious<00:00:06.330> snack<00:00:07.020> but<00:00:07.770> did<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:08.069> know<00:00:08.250> that

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
nutritious snack but did you know that

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.339 
nutritious snack but did you know that
most<00:00:08.700> raw<00:00:08.970> nuts<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.750> seeds<00:00:09.960> are<00:00:10.050> actually

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
most raw nuts and seeds are actually

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.020 
most raw nuts and seeds are actually
quite<00:00:10.530> difficult<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:11.099> our<00:00:11.190> bodies<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.490> digest

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
quite difficult for our bodies to digest

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.299 
quite difficult for our bodies to digest
and<00:00:12.780> that's<00:00:12.960> because<00:00:13.259> they<00:00:13.410> contain<00:00:13.769> enzyme

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
and that's because they contain enzyme

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.180 
and that's because they contain enzyme
inhibitors<00:00:14.849> which<00:00:15.210> nature<00:00:15.980> intended<00:00:16.980> to

inhibitors which nature intended to
protect<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.640> life<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> seed<00:00:18.330> or<00:00:18.449> nut<00:00:18.480> but

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
protect the life of the seed or nut but

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.570 
protect the life of the seed or nut but
that<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> human<00:00:19.830> body<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.340> wreak<00:00:20.550> havoc

they're very difficult to break down
these<00:00:22.890> enzyme<00:00:23.220> inhibitors<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:23.970> also<00:00:24.119> is

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
these enzyme inhibitors and it also is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.000 
these enzyme inhibitors and it also is
hard<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.750> us<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.019> absorb<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.500> nutrients

enzyme<00:00:32.669> inhibitors<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.690> way<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:34.020> did<00:00:34.260> it

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
enzyme inhibitors the way they did it

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.110 
enzyme inhibitors the way they did it
was<00:00:34.559> by<00:00:34.739> soaking<00:00:35.160> their<00:00:35.280> nuts<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.550> seeds<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
was by soaking their nuts and seeds in a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.619 
was by soaking their nuts and seeds in a
salty<00:00:37.050> water<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:38.129> overnight<00:00:38.879> basically<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
salty water for overnight basically and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.209 
salty water for overnight basically and
then<00:00:39.719> letting<00:00:39.930> them<00:00:40.079> sit<00:00:40.320> out<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.680> Sun<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
then letting them sit out in the Sun and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.510 
then letting them sit out in the Sun and
dry<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.660> earth<00:00:43.530> mama<00:00:43.829> wants<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> bring<00:00:44.460> back

also<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.329> sharing<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.750> news<00:00:49.020> because

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
also are sharing this news because

we've<00:00:52.140> lost<00:00:52.350> track<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:52.980> essential<00:00:53.910> step

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
we've lost track of this essential step

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
we've lost track of this essential step
and<00:00:54.629> eating<00:00:54.930> nuts<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> seeds<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.520> you're

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and eating nuts and seeds so what you're

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.950 
and eating nuts and seeds so what you're
going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.760> need<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.239> favorite<00:00:57.629> nuts<00:00:57.809> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
going to need is your favorite nuts and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.630 
going to need is your favorite nuts and
seeds<00:00:58.230> you're<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> need<00:00:59.250> filtered

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
seeds you're going to need filtered

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.479 
seeds you're going to need filtered
water<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.359> high-quality<00:01:00.629> sea<00:01:01.469> salt<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
water and a high-quality sea salt you

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.039 
water and a high-quality sea salt you
will<00:01:02.609> also<00:01:02.760> need<00:01:03.030> something<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.539> dry<00:01:03.840> your

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
will also need something to dry your

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.140 
will also need something to dry your
seeds<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.530> really<00:01:04.830> prefer<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.519> dehydrator

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
seeds so I really prefer a dehydrator

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.179 
seeds so I really prefer a dehydrator
because<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> keeps<00:01:06.810> them<00:01:07.080> alive<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.830> set

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
because it keeps them alive you can set

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.950 
because it keeps them alive you can set
it<00:01:08.280> at<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> lower<00:01:08.640> temperature<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
it at a lower temperature but if you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.270 
it at a lower temperature but if you
don't<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> dehydrator<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.100> always

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
don't have a dehydrator you can always

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.219 
don't have a dehydrator you can always
use<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:11.549> oven<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.510> set<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> lowest

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
use your oven just set at the lowest

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
use your oven just set at the lowest
possible<00:01:13.439> temperature<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.390> see

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
possible temperature so as you can see

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.160 
possible temperature so as you can see
here

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
here

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590 
here
voila<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:17.880> pecans<00:01:18.210> they've<00:01:18.509> been

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
voila here are my pecans they've been

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.990 
voila here are my pecans they've been
soaking<00:01:18.810> for<00:01:18.990> 24<00:01:19.500> hours<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.640> salt<00:01:20.909> water

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
soaking for 24 hours in the salt water

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.660 
soaking for 24 hours in the salt water
and<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:22.020> every<00:01:22.320> four<00:01:22.650> cups<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.100> nuts<00:01:23.310> or<00:01:23.430> seeds

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and for every four cups of nuts or seeds

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.240 
and for every four cups of nuts or seeds
you<00:01:24.000> want<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.210> use<00:01:24.330> about<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.930> tablespoon<00:01:25.710> of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
you want to use about a tablespoon of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.490 
you want to use about a tablespoon of
sea<00:01:26.430> salt<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.150> once<00:01:27.360> you're<00:01:27.509> done<00:01:27.540> soaking<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
sea salt so once you're done soaking you

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.870 
sea salt so once you're done soaking you
want<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.740> drain<00:01:28.950> them<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.759> let

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
want to drain them and I like to let

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.609 
want to drain them and I like to let
them<00:01:30.060> sit<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> while<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> get<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.470> much

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
them sit for a while so I get as much

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
them sit for a while so I get as much
water<00:01:31.920> out<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.430> possible<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.210> just

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
water out as possible because it just

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.870 
water out as possible because it just
makes<00:01:33.509> my<00:01:33.630> drying<00:01:33.930> time<00:01:34.200> faster<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.850> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
makes my drying time faster and then I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.910 
makes my drying time faster and then I
start<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.540> once<00:01:36.750> they're<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:37.020> dry<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.560> put<00:01:37.799> them

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
start to once they're all dry I put them

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.429 
start to once they're all dry I put them
