main issue with the president put aside
whatever<00:01:55.650> philosophical<00:01:57.030> differences<00:01:58.030> I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
whatever philosophical differences I

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.520 
whatever philosophical differences I
have<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.659> president<00:01:59.050> and<00:01:59.140> there<00:01:59.229> are<00:01:59.320> many

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
have of the president and there are many

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.080 
have of the president and there are many
but<00:01:59.770> there<00:01:59.890> are<00:02:00.009> some<00:02:00.130> places<00:02:00.310> where<00:02:00.640> we<00:02:00.759> agree

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
but there are some places where we agree

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.899 
but there are some places where we agree
on<00:02:01.680> education<00:02:02.680> reform<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:03.250> renewable<00:02:03.640> energy

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
on education reform and renewable energy

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.100 
on education reform and renewable energy
and<00:02:03.940> other<00:02:04.090> things<00:02:04.300> where<00:02:04.450> we<00:02:04.570> have<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.900> lot<00:02:05.080> of

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
and other things where we have a lot of

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.100 
and other things where we have a lot of
common<00:02:05.560> ground<00:02:05.590> but<00:02:06.520> my<00:02:06.940> main<00:02:07.210> critique<00:02:07.630> and

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
common ground but my main critique and

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.960 
common ground but my main critique and
problem<00:02:08.530> with<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.709> president<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.910> I

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
problem with the president is that I

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.640 
problem with the president is that I
don't<00:02:10.030> think<00:02:10.450> he<00:02:10.509> has<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.660> first<00:02:11.050> idea<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.560> how

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
don't think he has the first idea of how

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.670 
don't think he has the first idea of how
to<00:02:11.680> use<00:02:11.890> executive<00:02:12.190> power<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.780> nor<00:02:14.230> much<00:02:14.560> of

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
to use executive power and nor much of

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.400 
to use executive power and nor much of
an<00:02:14.770> interest<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.260> know<00:02:17.290> I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
an interest in it and and I you know I

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.390 
an interest in it and and I you know I
think<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.709> goes<00:02:17.860> back<00:02:18.040> right<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
think this goes back right to the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.500 
think this goes back right to the
beginning<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> presidency<00:02:19.209> when<00:02:19.450> he

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
beginning of the presidency when he

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.759 
beginning of the presidency when he
basically<00:02:19.780> turned<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.080> stimulus<00:02:20.440> package

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
basically turned the stimulus package

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.530 
basically turned the stimulus package
over<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.070> Congress<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.580> let<00:02:22.060> them<00:02:22.239> deal<00:02:22.480> with

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
over to Congress and let them deal with

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.660 
over to Congress and let them deal with
it<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.560> healthcare<00:02:24.010> thing<00:02:24.040> dragged

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
it and and the healthcare thing dragged

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.420 
it and and the healthcare thing dragged
on<00:02:24.910> as<00:02:25.060> long<00:02:25.360> as<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.750> did<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:27.010> became<00:02:27.370> a

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
on as long as it did and became a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.090 
on as long as it did and became a
hodgepodge<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:29.050> whole<00:02:29.440> bunch<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.769> different

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
hodgepodge of a whole bunch of different

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.370 
hodgepodge of a whole bunch of different
ideas<00:02:30.190> without<00:02:30.519> real<00:02:30.910> direction<00:02:31.330> from<00:02:32.080> him

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
ideas without real direction from him

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.620 
ideas without real direction from him
and<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.769> so<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.580> couple<00:02:33.940> maybe<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.420> couple

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
and and so so a couple maybe a couple

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.680 
and and so so a couple maybe a couple
concrete<00:02:35.200> things<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.739> he<00:02:35.830> could<00:02:36.010> do<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:37.570> got

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
concrete things that he could do you got

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.930 
concrete things that he could do you got
to<00:02:37.780> be<00:02:37.900> there<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:38.530> mean<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.459> fact<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.790> he's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
to be there I mean the fact that he's

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.430 
to be there I mean the fact that he's

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
let's face it the downside risk was

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.289 
let's face it the downside risk was
relatively<00:03:27.130> minimal<00:03:27.370> even<00:03:27.970> if<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.180> had<00:03:28.269> gone

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
relatively minimal even if it had gone
