00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.550
 so then I may the next 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.370
 I already mentioned it 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.090
 Mr dr full chamber expert on many 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.920
 especially in the area 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.750
 Connection of traditional knowledge 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.460
 technical knowledge scientific 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.379
 know with spiritual knowledge 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.940
 that is his main focus but today 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.220
 we are very practical 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.699
 We got in touch a few days ago 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.300
 again with the company in Germany 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.769
 the company ebm papenburg or that is 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.159
 that I have in my heart 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.479
 they make a so-called miss 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.070
 Fuel that means we have one 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.110
 process develops where you are very 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.479
 efficient use of fuel 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.820
 by adding water that sounds like that 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.520
 simple is not that easy 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.649
 also a very specific art and that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.020
 but obviously it is very interesting too 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.470
 economical and that is why the whole 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.659
 company crowe at the moment in ramadan speak 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.800
 traveled to Dubai where now 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.229
 Ramadan starts 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.030
 and they could not come here 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.979
 but they told us that 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.020
 real expert on these areas 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.390
 also the scientific chemical 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.310
 may represent background is her 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.229
 Consultant dr klaus volkmer 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.129
 Please, very much, he will be short for you now 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.149
 introduce in this topic please yes 

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:56.149
 Thanks for the invitation 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.619
 may also want to why 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.780
 standing tall you can say I can 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.729
 While working its okay all country 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.069
 Thank you very much for sharing 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.709
 may here about the company ebm of Mr 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.230
 pour in papenburg the currently the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.360
 plant that I introduce to you 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.730
 large-scale mascara the abu dhabi 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:26.290
 optimized for beginners and as a basis for 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:30.680
 a reference plant used worldwide 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.010
 the process turns to an extreme 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.269
 unusual conversion principle it 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.540
 will be water directly in this 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.660
 fuel is evacuated in the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.890
 Secondary water is in the diesel 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.950
 converted and this step is high 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.170
 incredibly phenomenal that him 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.610
 actually only a non-academic 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.959
 Everybody can study physics 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.209
 but came or otherwise 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.070
 scientific subject would have said there 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.130
 I do not even start 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.370
 it could only make someone we 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.579
 pour a very profound intuition 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.400
 has and is about modern thermodynamics 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.650
 did not care at all and just 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.120
 However, he has also started 20 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.910
 used years but now is the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.670
 process and does exactly that and how that works 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.650
 is very strange because you can yes 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.250
 now also purely physically 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.720
 can take and do a mass balance around 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.700
 the cores make themselves the 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.799
 that is oxygen here 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.720
 and that only kicks off and carbon 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.239
 That is exactly what you can calculate 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.040
 it comes out when you get here 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.650
 carbon one uses and here one 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.079
 product and every oxygen here that 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:53.109
 for 18 kilograms of water what you need 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:55.540
 produces 33 grams after this process 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.489
 energy needs 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.030
 and you know how much grams of mass in 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.500
 Hiroshima became the first atomic bomb in 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.050
 how have transformed into kinetic 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.280
 energy three grams 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:12.370
 that was always out and we need 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.239
 she water for 18 kilograms and he does 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:19.299
 that's the equivalent of three grams of energy 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.730
 You can already tell that they are 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.320
 so a bit of light with a 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.870
 a bit of electromagnetic staggering 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.310
 radiation or other 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.580
 electromagnetic energy is better 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:35.020
 they could not do anything 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.970
 because these of these products of this 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.240
 Production runs in a reactor 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.850
 where the time to stay in seconds 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.730
 So if you put this energy then 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.470
 by the second they are in there 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.760
 then they need one 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.479
 performance in the large gigawatt area that 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.880
 close 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.340
 they would need to be added, so to speak 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.090
 use room temperature with low increased 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.760
 Overpressure near a nuclear power plant 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.560
 these are total thermal energy in 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.720
 what is going on in this process anyway 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.210
 does not work 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.729
 it is impossible so we come with it 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.600
 an electromagnetic energy form 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.729
 however creative she may be 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.100
 no further step and we need 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.280
 a new form of energy the one 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.770
 microscopic in grammar mass 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.590
 content has apparently the ability 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.210
 did look so easy in one 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.539
 reactions of some kind 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.520
 intervene and both the energy as 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:41.020
 also the entropy for the process too 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.910
 I would like to deliver that 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.200
 Here you have a little excursion with you 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.479
 make them before I then on the 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.270
 process come back to explain 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.800
 could go again and she says 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.080
 detour is now here in one 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.850
 outline first needed 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.820
 we are a new form of energy today 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.560
 still largely or largely 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.960
 I am not aware of that personally 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.550
 30-year-old research has several books 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.380
 written I have two 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.000
 Here are some examples of what you can do 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.009
 copies with me or at the publishing house 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.159
 order or with every book 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:15.789
 action and it's all about something 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:18.399
 something curious what in turn a professor 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:21.099
 a university in an established person 

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:22.360
 never would have done so easily 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:24.490
 if a professor at the tu munchen 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.860
 begins subtle research 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.749
 it is very questionable if he is there 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.580
 but I still get research funds 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:32.409
 I do not want to be fussy here now 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.990
 you sometimes need simple and 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:37.509
 just outsider and here in this 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.809
 forum of mr. schneider will be since 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:42.969
 decades these creative outsiders 

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:44.999
 collected and formed for that we thank 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:48.189
 also very cordially 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:49.839
 and of course her women too 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:51.219
 we need a new form of energy and 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:55.180
 there is such an energy 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:58.270
 you can experiment him one way 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:01.389
 today unknown form subtle 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.459
 matter after eat the macroscopic 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:07.469
 energy content really in the gram range 

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:10.539
 and that can be characterized 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:12.279
 can have physical consequences in the 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:13.959
 you draw gravity research from it 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:16.779
 Can she just then to the technical 

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:18.939
 application and a special case 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:21.490
 a whole bundle conceivable 

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:25.599
 technical application is just that of 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:28.419
 Mr. Jesu awesome found what to 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:31.120
 diesel conversion i can about this 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:36.209
 Just be amazed and see him in 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.209
 summarize this direction round
