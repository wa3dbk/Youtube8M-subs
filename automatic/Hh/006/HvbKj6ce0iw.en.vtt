I<00:01:00.240> think<00:01:01.240> a<00:01:01.390> big<00:01:01.600> benefit<00:01:01.990> to<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.230> liberal

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
I think a big benefit to the liberal

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.350 
I think a big benefit to the liberal
arts<00:01:02.740> education<00:01:02.950> is<00:01:03.670> that<00:01:03.910> you<00:01:04.000> can<00:01:04.150> take<00:01:04.300> a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
arts education is that you can take a

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.970 
arts education is that you can take a
variety<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.930> different<00:01:05.110> classes<00:01:05.410> that<00:01:05.860> don't

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
variety of different classes that don't

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.300 
variety of different classes that don't
necessarily<00:01:06.480> coincide<00:01:07.480> with<00:01:07.840> your<00:01:08.080> major

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
necessarily coincide with your major
