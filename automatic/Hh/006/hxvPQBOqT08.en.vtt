00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
and to me at times those people are as

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.179 
and to me at times those people are as
harmful<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.180> useless<00:01:15.810> when<00:01:16.590> they<00:01:16.740> live<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> life

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
harmful as useless when they live a life

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.039 
harmful as useless when they live a life
and<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:17.790> go<00:01:18.090> by<00:01:18.270> without<00:01:18.689> doing

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
and they just go by without doing

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.679 
and they just go by without doing
anything<00:01:19.340> but<00:01:20.340> over<00:01:20.880> there<00:01:21.060> she<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.240> comes

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
anything but over there she just comes

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.420 
anything but over there she just comes
and<00:01:21.840> becomes<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.380> hero<00:01:22.530> who<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
and becomes the hero who know it and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.039 
and becomes the hero who know it and
that's<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> journey<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> think<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.990> think

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that's the journey so I think I think

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.690 
that's the journey so I think I think
instinctively<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.340> excites<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:28.700> just

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
instinctively just excites me and just

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700 
instinctively just excites me and just
happened<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.450> any<00:01:30.869> particular<00:01:31.049> reason<00:01:31.590> of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
happened and any particular reason of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.319 
happened and any particular reason of
choosing<00:01:32.610> Turner<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> role<00:01:35.119> actually<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
choosing Turner for the role actually I

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.520

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.300 
with Ronnie it would have become a
caricature<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:14.440> fine<00:02:14.769> line<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.220> we

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
caricature and I the fine line that we

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.250 
caricature and I the fine line that we
had<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.610> walk<00:02:15.760> in<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.060> remote<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.540> while

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
had to walk in this remote that while

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.800 
had to walk in this remote that while
Ronnie<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.340> character<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.209> created

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
Ronnie is a character that is created

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.690 
Ronnie is a character that is created
from<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:20.290> real<00:02:20.470> life<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:21.099> moment<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:21.579> crosses

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
from a real life the moment it crosses

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.030 
from a real life the moment it crosses
the<00:02:22.030> line<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.239> become<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.750> caricature<00:02:23.140> I

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
the line and become the caricature I

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.180 
the line and become the caricature I
think<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.760> would<00:02:24.879> have<00:02:24.940> qualified<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.620> just

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
think it would have qualified so I just

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.319 
think it would have qualified so I just
keep<00:02:27.370> saying<00:02:27.549> this<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:27.970> was<00:02:28.120> really

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
keep saying this that I was really

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.390 
keep saying this that I was really
looking<00:02:28.420> for<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.959> also<00:02:29.709> because<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.069> bring<00:02:30.280> a

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
looking for a also because I bring a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.140 
looking for a also because I bring a
woman<00:02:30.549> with<00:02:30.879> oriented<00:02:31.510> film<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:33.430> wanted<00:02:34.090> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
woman with oriented film and I wanted to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.759 
woman with oriented film and I wanted to
be<00:02:34.239> sure<00:02:34.269> that<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.900> am<00:02:34.930> not<00:02:35.170> missing<00:02:35.379> out<00:02:35.709> on

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
be sure that I am not missing out on

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.569 
be sure that I am not missing out on
nuances<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.790> things<00:02:37.090> which<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.200> just<00:02:38.590> don't

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
nuances and things which I just don't

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:40.800 
nuances and things which I just don't
know<00:02:39.849> like<00:02:40.030> there's<00:02:40.329> a<00:02:40.390> scene<00:02:40.569> in<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
know like there's a scene in the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.960 
know like there's a scene in the
bathroom<00:02:41.260> where<00:02:41.980> two<00:02:42.129> girls<00:02:42.340> are<00:02:42.489> talking<00:02:42.670> and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
bathroom where two girls are talking and

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.069 
bathroom where two girls are talking and
that's<00:02:43.060> my<00:02:43.269> interpretation<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.019> that

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
that's my interpretation of that

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.510 
that's my interpretation of that
bathroom<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:45.250> what<00:02:45.640> they<00:02:45.790> do

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
bathroom and what they do

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.570 
bathroom and what they do
and<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.750> just<00:02:49.750> wanted<00:02:49.960> to<00:02:50.050> be<00:02:50.200> sure<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.710> this

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
and I just wanted to be sure that this

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.730 
and I just wanted to be sure that this
is<00:02:51.790> really<00:02:52.030> what<00:02:52.360> they<00:02:52.510> do<00:02:52.570> okay<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:56.710> I

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
is really what they do okay so and so I

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.130 
is really what they do okay so and so I
really<00:02:57.130> needed<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.490> partner<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.780> know<00:02:58.900> and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
really needed a partner you know and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.650 
really needed a partner you know and
that's<00:02:59.830> why<00:03:00.070> is<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.400> dialer<00:03:00.790> plated<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.570> know

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
that's why is the dialer plated you know

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.990 
that's why is the dialer plated you know
and<00:03:01.900> that's<00:03:02.020> why<00:03:02.380> this<00:03:02.440> film<00:03:03.040> has<00:03:03.340> happened

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
and that's why this film has happened

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.500 
and that's why this film has happened
and<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:05.500> think<00:03:05.890> ideas<00:03:06.310> they<00:03:06.730> show<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.210> if<00:03:07.360> it's

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
and I think ideas they show that if it's

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.090 
and I think ideas they show that if it's
not<00:03:07.690> cholera<00:03:07.900> then<00:03:08.110> I<00:03:08.320> probably<00:03:08.530> just<00:03:08.800> keep<00:03:08.980> it

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
not cholera then I probably just keep it

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.790 
not cholera then I probably just keep it
aside<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.640> keep<00:03:10.390> going<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:11.020> was<00:03:11.200> sooner<00:03:11.560> or

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
aside and keep going it was sooner or

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.740 
aside and keep going it was sooner or
wait<00:03:12.040> next<00:03:12.820> all<00:03:13.360> right
