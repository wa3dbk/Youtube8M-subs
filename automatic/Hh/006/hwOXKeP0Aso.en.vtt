00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
a long time I've been dropped shy him

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.390 
a long time I've been dropped shy him
for<00:00:19.119> 15<00:00:20.119> years<00:00:20.510> 17<00:00:21.170> years<00:00:21.410> since<00:00:22.010> I<00:00:22.190> first

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
for 15 years 17 years since I first

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.859 
for 15 years 17 years since I first
started<00:00:22.550> drop<00:00:22.970> shotting<00:00:23.240> so<00:00:23.510> I<00:00:23.539> have<00:00:23.660> a<00:00:23.690> lot

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
started drop shotting so I have a lot

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.019 
started drop shotting so I have a lot
experience<00:00:23.960> doing<00:00:24.560> it<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:24.920> growing<00:00:25.820> up<00:00:25.910> in

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
experience doing it and growing up in

experience doing it and growing up in
California<00:00:27.160> you<00:00:28.160> had<00:00:28.369> to<00:00:28.460> drop<00:00:28.640> shot<00:00:28.939> it<00:00:29.240> was

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
California you had to drop shot it was

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.870 
California you had to drop shot it was
the<00:00:29.510> right<00:00:29.689> place<00:00:29.930> for<00:00:29.960> it<00:00:30.260> but<00:00:30.670> we<00:00:31.670> have<00:00:31.850> a

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
the right place for it but we have a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.110 
the right place for it but we have a
brand<00:00:32.629> new<00:00:32.689> rod<00:00:32.960> it's<00:00:33.559> a<00:00:33.739> new<00:00:34.250> your<00:00:34.399> he2

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
brand new rod it's a new your he2

x-series it's just f f3 611 drop-shot
rod<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:42.350> it's<00:00:42.710> a<00:00:42.829> little<00:00:43.010> bit<00:00:43.160> heavier<00:00:43.520> it's

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
rod and it's a little bit heavier it's

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.680 
rod and it's a little bit heavier it's
going<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:43.910> be<00:00:44.110> good<00:00:45.110> for<00:00:45.440> like<00:00:45.770> 7<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.670> 8<00:00:46.879> perfect

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
going to be good for like 7 to 8 perfect

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.020 
going to be good for like 7 to 8 perfect
for<00:00:47.870> that<00:00:48.010> make<00:00:49.010> it<00:00:49.129> throw<00:00:49.280> shaky<00:00:49.550> how<00:00:49.730> if<00:00:49.940> you

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
for that make it throw shaky how if you

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.840 
for that make it throw shaky how if you
want<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.420> I<00:00:50.450> already<00:00:50.930> have<00:00:51.280> but<00:00:52.280> it's<00:00:52.460> it's<00:00:52.730> a

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
man it's not like I'm known for drop

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.470 
man it's not like I'm known for drop
shiny<00:00:54.980> lots<00:00:55.219> and<00:00:55.370> using<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:55.969> really<00:00:56.239> light

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
shiny lots and using that really light

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.090 
shiny lots and using that really light
stuff<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:57.050> know<00:00:57.140> they<00:00:57.289> had<00:00:57.440> that<00:00:57.620> super

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
stuff you know they had that super

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.490 
stuff you know they had that super
finesse<00:00:58.610> and<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.539> know<00:00:59.629> most<00:00:59.870> time<00:01:00.110> it's<00:01:00.379> not

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
finesse and you know most time it's not

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.869 
finesse and you know most time it's not
like<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:00.980> most<00:01:01.190> time<00:01:01.399> you<00:01:01.489> go<00:01:01.610> out<00:01:01.699> there<00:01:01.850> and

Kentucky<00:01:06.889> wherever<00:01:07.159> you're<00:01:07.310> at<00:01:07.340> that's<00:01:07.759> kind

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:07.999 
Kentucky wherever you're at that's kind

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:09.190 
Kentucky wherever you're at that's kind
of<00:01:08.029> what<00:01:08.149> you<00:01:08.209> do<00:01:08.329> most<00:01:08.479> times<00:01:08.810> it's<00:01:08.959> raw<00:01:09.079> it's

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
of what you do most times it's raw it's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.800 
of what you do most times it's raw it's
perfect<00:01:09.590> for<00:01:09.619> that<00:01:10.149> it's<00:01:11.149> you<00:01:11.509> know<00:01:11.600> if<00:01:11.659> you're

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
perfect for that it's you know if you're

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.149 
perfect for that it's you know if you're
getting<00:01:11.869> that<00:01:12.109> really<00:01:12.319> finesse<00:01:12.709> stuff<00:01:12.979> it's

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
getting that really finesse stuff it's

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.800 
getting that really finesse stuff it's
going<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.369> be<00:01:13.459> slightly<00:01:13.789> heavy<00:01:14.149> for<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:14.539> I

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
going to be slightly heavy for that I

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.779 
going to be slightly heavy for that I
would<00:01:15.380> use<00:01:15.499> a<00:01:15.590> different<00:01:15.679> mega<00:01:16.100> bass<00:01:16.310> rod<00:01:16.549> for

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
would use a different mega bass rod for

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.059 
would use a different mega bass rod for
that<00:01:16.969> which<00:01:17.689> I'm<00:01:17.869> working<00:01:18.020> on<00:01:18.259> for<00:01:18.649> next<00:01:18.770> year

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
that which I'm working on for next year

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.339 
that which I'm working on for next year
but<00:01:19.969> for<00:01:20.149> this<00:01:20.209> year<00:01:20.420> we<00:01:20.539> have<00:01:20.689> just<00:01:20.869> a<00:01:21.020> more

00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:21.349 
but for this year we have just a more

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:24.010 
but for this year we have just a more
average<00:01:22.099> can<00:01:22.399> good<00:01:23.090> drop<00:01:23.329> shot<00:01:23.359> rod<00:01:23.689> and<00:01:23.959> he

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
average can good drop shot rod and he

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.300 
average can good drop shot rod and he
can<00:01:24.139> throw<00:01:24.439> I<00:01:24.469> just<00:01:24.679> find<00:01:24.829> anything<00:01:25.069> that<00:01:25.159> went

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
can throw I just find anything that went

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.239 
can throw I just find anything that went
on<00:01:25.399> it's<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:25.609> good<00:01:25.759> span<00:01:25.969> ROM<00:01:26.179> 6:11<00:01:27.069> got<00:01:28.069> a<00:01:28.099> lot

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
on it's a good span ROM 6:11 got a lot

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:30.839 
on it's a good span ROM 6:11 got a lot
backbone<00:01:28.759> but<00:01:29.270> it's<00:01:29.389> got<00:01:29.539> a<00:01:29.569> nice<00:01:29.689> soft<00:01:30.020> tip<00:01:30.289> on

00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:30.849 
backbone but it's got a nice soft tip on

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:33.489 
backbone but it's got a nice soft tip on
I'm<00:01:31.849> again<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:32.090> can't<00:01:32.359> really<00:01:32.450> show<00:01:32.569> you<00:01:32.840> too

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
I'm again I can't really show you too

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.080 
I'm again I can't really show you too
much<00:01:33.679> about<00:01:33.829> through<00:01:34.310> here<00:01:34.520> but<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:34.999> know

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
much about through here but you know

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.969 
much about through here but you know
it's<00:01:35.209> soft<00:01:35.450> but<00:01:35.990> it's<00:01:36.109> got<00:01:36.259> backbone<00:01:36.709> which<00:01:36.889> I

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
it's soft but it's got backbone which I

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.050 
it's soft but it's got backbone which I
like

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
like

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.300 
like
anytime<00:01:38.599> you're<00:01:38.770> throwing<00:01:39.770> like<00:01:39.859> seven<00:01:40.279> and

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
anytime you're throwing like seven and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.649 
anytime you're throwing like seven and
eight<00:01:40.429> pound<00:01:40.669> line<00:01:40.819> all<00:01:40.969> along<00:01:41.060> cast<00:01:41.479> as<00:01:41.630> a

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
eight pound line all along cast as a

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.870 
eight pound line all along cast as a
drop<00:01:41.899> shot<00:01:42.109> you<00:01:42.259> want<00:01:42.409> a<00:01:42.649> lot<00:01:43.099> of<00:01:43.219> backbone<00:01:43.609> so

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
drop shot you want a lot of backbone so

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.550 
drop shot you want a lot of backbone so
