00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.429
 so it will not be a box well and beautiful 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.580
 house well let's get down to 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.839
 start builds conclusion base 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.870
 but let's do it like this 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.000
 build new 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.300
 and ok you made the foundation of what we do 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.620
 Further, we put 10 8 blocks up 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.620
 time two three 4 5 6 8 10 m 8 here we put 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.130
 also 8 blocks up and here with these two 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.130
 stuff 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.920
 the knapsack here you wo n't stand here 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.920
 and here 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.820
 further attention guys need us 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.260
 make all the boards 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:10.640
 so here we deliver boards 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:17.540
 these are all four walls and well let's 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:20.180
 let's make a regiment here in four blocks 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.340
 up till we think once-two-three-four 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.880
 here we do exactly the same here 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.050
 We do it this way, because we build walls 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.540
 when we forced the walls 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.790
 attention guys we take and put here 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.270
 so time two three 4 chapter here then 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.820
 four blocks here then again and says 4 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:47.090
 1 to 5 blocks that is, we put and while 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:49.520
 we will not have that full roof 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.470
 we've got some kind of roof further 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.420
 what can we do I will dilute the bottom 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.200
 here and so see your doing so 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.970
 can we can circle hydrogen around the house 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.090
 Well , I got a cool roof 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.760
 what we do next the next we take 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.980
 the needle here so here we do here 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.820
 the doors and now we have at least 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.069
 some house 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.040
 Further look guys so we need 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.739
