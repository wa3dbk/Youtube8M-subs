00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
today I would like to talk to you about

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:19.640 
today I would like to talk to you about
becoming<00:00:06.990> an<00:00:07.350> analyst<00:00:17.000> or<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.539> be<00:00:18.690> exact<00:00:19.080> what

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
becoming an analyst or to be exact what

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.029 
becoming an analyst or to be exact what
goes<00:00:19.890> into<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.369> good<00:00:21.029> analysis<00:00:21.990> now<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.859> is

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
goes into a good analysis now this is

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.890 
goes into a good analysis now this is
actually<00:00:23.640> something<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> tricky<00:00:24.570> subject

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
actually something of a tricky subject

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.460 
actually something of a tricky subject
because<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> definition<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.460> good<00:00:26.970> is

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
because the definition of good is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.439 
because the definition of good is
subjective<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.039> good<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.609> some<00:00:29.910> might

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
subjective what is good to some might

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.450 
subjective what is good to some might
not<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:31.109> interesting<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> others<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
not be interesting to others and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.940 
not be interesting to others and
vice-versa<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.809> all<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> can't<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.590> provide

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
vice-versa so all I can't really provide

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.270 
vice-versa so all I can't really provide
any<00:00:35.190> hard<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.880> fast<00:00:36.120> rules<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.260> give<00:00:37.950> some

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
any hard and fast rules I can give some

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.639 
any hard and fast rules I can give some
suggestions<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.239> observations<00:00:39.989> things<00:00:40.500> that

equal<00:00:49.710> analyzing<00:00:50.670> let's<00:00:51.270> go<00:00:51.420> ahead<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> get

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
equal analyzing let's go ahead and get

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.170 
equal analyzing let's go ahead and get
this<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> way<00:00:52.710> right<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
this out of the way right now there is a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360 
this out of the way right now there is a
difference<00:00:54.930> between<00:00:55.079> reviewing<00:00:55.829> an<00:00:55.920> episode

difference between reviewing an episode

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.270 
difference between reviewing an episode
and<00:00:56.960> analyzing<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> reviewing<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.039> when<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and analyzing it reviewing is when you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.520 
and analyzing it reviewing is when you
take<00:00:59.460> an<00:00:59.609> episode<00:01:00.059> talk<00:01:00.600> about<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.079> happened

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
take an episode talk about what happened

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.410 
take an episode talk about what happened
in<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.829> say<00:01:02.219> what<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.550> liked<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.120> didn't<00:01:03.390> like

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
in it say what you liked and didn't like

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.560 
in it say what you liked and didn't like
and<00:01:03.989> maybe<00:01:04.650> make<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> few<00:01:05.070> jokes<00:01:05.489> guys<00:01:06.119> I'm
