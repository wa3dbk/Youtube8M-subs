every once in a while an idea comes
along<00:00:39.490> that's<00:00:39.700> so<00:00:40.030> simple<00:00:40.570> but<00:00:40.900> yet<00:00:41.080> makes<00:00:41.350> so

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
along that's so simple but yet makes so

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.560 
along that's so simple but yet makes so
much<00:00:41.830> sense<00:00:41.860> that<00:00:42.760> you<00:00:42.910> just<00:00:43.060> wonder<00:00:43.390> why<00:00:43.540> you

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
much sense that you just wonder why you

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.360 
much sense that you just wonder why you
didn't<00:00:43.930> think<00:00:44.020> about<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.590> bam<00:00:44.830> holsters

these mountable magnet mounts gun mounts

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.820 
these mountable magnet mounts gun mounts
and<00:00:53.770> they're<00:00:54.309> super<00:00:54.700> strong<00:00:55.650> here's<00:00:56.650> the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
and they're super strong here's the

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.090 
and they're super strong here's the
magnet<00:00:57.250> it's<00:00:57.850> on<00:00:58.090> a<00:00:58.120> plastic<00:00:58.809> base<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.949> can

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
magnet it's on a plastic base you can

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.380 
magnet it's on a plastic base you can
kind<00:01:00.250> of<00:01:00.280> see<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.520> coming<00:01:00.820> through<00:01:00.910> here<00:01:01.270> and

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
kind of see it coming through here and

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.630 
kind of see it coming through here and
then<00:01:01.900> it's<00:01:02.050> completely<00:01:02.470> covered<00:01:03.100> in<00:01:03.250> a

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
then it's completely covered in a

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.490 
then it's completely covered in a
rubberized<00:01:04.150> coating<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:04.809> this<00:01:04.960> keeps<00:01:05.260> it

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
rubberized coating and this keeps it

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.530 
rubberized coating and this keeps it
from<00:01:05.950> getting<00:01:06.100> marred<00:01:06.520> your<00:01:06.670> pistol<00:01:07.210> martyr

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
and one of the things about this holster

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.330 
and one of the things about this holster
system<00:01:12.759> is<00:01:12.940> that<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:13.869> attaches<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.619> your

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
system is that it attaches to your

firearm<00:01:16.440> but<00:01:17.440> yet<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:17.890> mounts<00:01:18.460> anywhere<00:01:19.090> that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
firearm but yet it mounts anywhere that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.330 
firearm but yet it mounts anywhere that
you<00:01:19.540> can<00:01:19.690> screw<00:01:20.020> in<00:01:20.170> screws<00:01:20.530> now<00:01:21.190> these

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
you can screw in screws now these

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.330 
you can screw in screws now these
magnets<00:01:21.940> are<00:01:22.119> super<00:01:22.600> strong<00:01:22.930> in<00:01:23.259> fact<00:01:23.649> this<00:01:24.130> is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
magnets are super strong in fact this is

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.070 
magnets are super strong in fact this is
the<00:01:24.490> Magnum<00:01:24.940> mount<00:01:25.149> and<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.540> will<00:01:25.630> hold<00:01:25.780> up<00:01:25.899> to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
the Magnum mount and it will hold up to

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.280 
the Magnum mount and it will hold up to
30<00:01:26.410> pounds<00:01:26.800> of<00:01:27.220> weight<00:01:27.450> which<00:01:28.450> is<00:01:28.630> far<00:01:29.080> more

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
30 pounds of weight which is far more

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.660 
30 pounds of weight which is far more
than<00:01:29.350> you're<00:01:29.590> going<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.800> put<00:01:30.009> pressure<00:01:30.280> on<00:01:30.520> it

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
than you're going to put pressure on it

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.310 
than you're going to put pressure on it
using<00:01:30.850> a<00:01:31.030> firearm<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.630> just<00:01:31.960> happen<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.259> have

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
using a firearm I just happen to have

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.920 
using a firearm I just happen to have
this<00:01:32.500> 20-pound<00:01:33.100> dumbbell<00:01:33.250> not<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.360> 30<00:01:34.600> pound

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
this 20-pound dumbbell not the 30 pound

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.300 
this 20-pound dumbbell not the 30 pound
but<00:01:35.830> I<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:38.440> proves<00:01:38.649> this<00:01:38.800> point<00:01:38.920> right

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
but I think it proves this point right

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.590 
but I think it proves this point right
there<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:42.369> aside<00:01:42.700> from<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.970> Magnum<00:01:43.390> mount

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
there now aside from the Magnum mount

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.719 
there now aside from the Magnum mount
which<00:01:43.930> is<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.470> strongest<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.220> yet<00:01:45.460> it's<00:01:45.640> the

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
which is the strongest and yet it's the

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.880 
which is the strongest and yet it's the
smallest<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.450> then<00:01:47.320> we<00:01:47.440> have<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.680> rifle

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
smallest and then we have the rifle

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.640 
smallest and then we have the rifle
mount<00:01:48.310> which<00:01:49.210> is<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.600> thinnest<00:01:50.080> here<00:01:50.470> and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
mount which is the thinnest here and

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.260 
mount which is the thinnest here and
this<00:01:50.860> will<00:01:51.010> hold<00:01:51.159> a<00:01:51.220> shotgun<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.700> rifle<00:01:51.790> in

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
this will hold a shotgun a rifle in

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.330 
this will hold a shotgun a rifle in
place<00:01:52.510> and<00:01:52.810> then<00:01:53.290> we<00:01:53.409> have<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.650> handgun<00:01:54.070> mount

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
place and then we have the handgun mount

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.399 
place and then we have the handgun mount
the<00:01:55.060> rifle<00:01:55.420> mount<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.750> stronger<00:01:56.170> than<00:01:56.290> the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
the rifle mount is stronger than the

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.289 
the rifle mount is stronger than the
handgun<00:01:56.799> mount<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.310> then<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.729> Magnum<00:01:58.180> is

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
handgun mount and then the Magnum is

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.300 
handgun mount and then the Magnum is
stronger<00:01:58.720> than<00:01:58.810> both<00:01:59.049> this<00:01:59.439> is<00:01:59.500> an<00:01:59.740> incredibly

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
stronger than both this is an incredibly

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.969 
stronger than both this is an incredibly
strong<00:02:00.760> magnet<00:02:01.450> system<00:02:01.869> but<00:02:02.439> this<00:02:02.619> is<00:02:02.770> really

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
strong magnet system but this is really

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.219 
strong magnet system but this is really
made<00:02:03.310> for<00:02:03.820> your<00:02:03.970> semi-automatic<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:04.960> fact

made for your semi-automatic in fact

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.380 
made for your semi-automatic in fact
they<00:02:05.530> recommend<00:02:06.040> not<00:02:06.189> to<00:02:06.250> use<00:02:06.430> revolvers<00:02:07.180> on

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
they recommend not to use revolvers on

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.840 
they recommend not to use revolvers on
the<00:02:07.630> pistol<00:02:08.019> mount<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:09.160> can<00:02:09.310> mount<00:02:09.489> it<00:02:09.640> either

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
the pistol mount you can mount it either

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.960 
the pistol mount you can mount it either
from<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.149> side<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.370> top<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.760> going<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:12.910> be

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
from the side on the top is going to be

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.520 
from the side on the top is going to be
a<00:02:13.060> little<00:02:13.299> more<00:02:13.480> difficult<00:02:13.989> because<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.320> these

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
a little more difficult because of these

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.490 
a little more difficult because of these
sights<00:02:14.799> but<00:02:15.070> on<00:02:15.190> this<00:02:15.310> small<00:02:15.580> Magnum<00:02:16.030> mount<00:02:16.500> it

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
sights but on this small Magnum mount it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.039 
sights but on this small Magnum mount it
goes<00:02:17.739> between<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.220> sights<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.360> you're<00:02:19.900> able

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
goes between the sights so you're able

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.350 
goes between the sights so you're able
to<00:02:20.260> do<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.500> number<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.400> different<00:02:21.760> things<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.209> me

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
to do a number of different things to me

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.300 
to do a number of different things to me
honestly<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.900> really<00:02:23.200> like<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.620> Magnum<00:02:24.100> mount

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
honestly I really like this Magnum mount

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.060 
honestly I really like this Magnum mount
for<00:02:24.519> a<00:02:24.549> lot<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.760> reasons<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.450> then<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.470> trying

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
for a lot of reasons and then to trying

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.470 
for a lot of reasons and then to trying
to<00:02:27.130> pull<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.430> off<00:02:27.519> this<00:02:27.760> way<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.209> going<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.420> be

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
to pull it off this way is going to be

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.569 
to pull it off this way is going to be
pretty<00:02:28.690> difficult<00:02:28.959> when<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.530> can<00:02:29.709> do<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.010> but

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
pretty difficult when you can do it but

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.400 
pretty difficult when you can do it but
it's<00:02:30.730> pretty<00:02:30.880> strong<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.720> recommended<00:02:32.230> way

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
it's pretty strong the recommended way

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.289 
it's pretty strong the recommended way
to<00:02:32.440> remove<00:02:32.860> this<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:33.310> actually<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.790> twist<00:02:34.090> and

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
to remove this is actually to twist and

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.270 
to remove this is actually to twist and
pull<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.530> kind<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.709> takes<00:02:35.890> away<00:02:36.160> the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
pull and so it kind of takes away the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.220 
pull and so it kind of takes away the
magnetic<00:02:36.730> field<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.329> you're<00:02:37.930> able<00:02:38.079> to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
magnetic field and you're able to

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.930 
magnetic field and you're able to
retrieve<00:02:38.590> your<00:02:38.739> pistol<00:02:39.100> really<00:02:39.400> quickly<00:02:39.790> or

your rifle a shotgun included is a small

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:44.919 
bag of screws that you can use but these
