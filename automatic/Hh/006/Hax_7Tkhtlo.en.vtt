turn<00:00:21.780> on<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.200> unit<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.700> turn<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.120> on

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
turn on the unit here so I turn it on

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.830 
turn on the unit here so I turn it on
and<00:00:24.540> turning<00:00:25.380> up<00:00:25.530> the<00:00:25.680> volume<00:00:26.600> you're<00:00:27.600> going

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
and turning up the volume you're going

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.260 
and turning up the volume you're going
to<00:00:27.960> hear<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.590> sound<00:00:30.350> then<00:00:31.910> you're<00:00:32.910> going<00:00:33.150> to

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
to hear this sound then you're going to

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.350 
to hear this sound then you're going to
want<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.720> change<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:35.640> brightness<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.239> your

every soil type is going to be different

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.990 
every soil type is going to be different
and<00:01:14.659> also<00:01:15.110> depending<00:01:15.619> what<00:01:15.710> you<00:01:15.860> look<00:01:16.040> for<00:01:16.310> you

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
and also depending what you look for you

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.350 
and also depending what you look for you
may<00:01:17.149> have<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.479> change<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.990> delay<00:01:18.790> then<00:01:19.790> with

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
may have to change the delay then with

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.980 
may have to change the delay then with
everything<00:01:20.869> else<00:01:21.080> set<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.740> zero<00:01:22.390> I'm<00:01:23.390> going<00:01:23.899> to

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
everything else set to zero I'm going to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.790 
everything else set to zero I'm going to
at<00:01:24.080> this<00:01:24.229> point<00:01:24.820> move<00:01:25.820> my<00:01:26.000> interference<00:01:26.800> so

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
at this point move my interference so

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.800 
at this point move my interference so
that<00:01:27.830> I<00:01:28.039> no<00:01:28.190> longer<00:01:28.610> hear<00:01:29.300> this<00:01:29.539> high-pitched

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
that I no longer hear this high-pitched

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.730 
that I no longer hear this high-pitched
tone

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
tone

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.210 
tone
let<00:01:30.950> me<00:01:31.039> turn<00:01:31.220> up<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.460> volume<00:01:31.610> as<00:01:32.860> I<00:01:33.860> move<00:01:34.070> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
let me turn up the volume as I move the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:51.109 
let me turn up the volume as I move the
interference<00:01:34.880> button

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.370 

now<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.320> phone

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
now I have this phone

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.490 
now I have this phone
at<00:01:54.860> this<00:01:55.130> point<00:01:55.430> I<00:01:55.780> adjust<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.930> tone<00:01:57.140> with<00:01:57.409> the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
at this point I adjust the tone with the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.130 
at this point I adjust the tone with the
delay<00:01:58.900> so<00:01:59.900> that<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.170> becomes<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.799> slight<00:02:01.460> hum

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
delay so that it becomes a slight hum

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.120 
delay so that it becomes a slight hum
like<00:02:03.140> this

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
like this

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.270 
like this
at<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.700> point<00:02:06.259> I'm<00:02:07.259> gonna<00:02:07.409> bring<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.770> down<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
at this point I'm gonna bring it down to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.170 
at this point I'm gonna bring it down to
the<00:02:08.369> ground<00:02:09.560> double-check<00:02:10.560> my<00:02:10.740> settings<00:02:11.190> and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the ground double-check my settings and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.710 
the ground double-check my settings and
if<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:12.840> need<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.470> can<00:02:13.530> then<00:02:13.920> tune<00:02:14.220> out<00:02:14.550> or<00:02:15.390> tune

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
if I need to I can then tune out or tune

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.930 
if I need to I can then tune out or tune
in<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.110> little<00:02:16.410> more<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.100> signal<00:02:17.489> with<00:02:17.819> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:26.440 
in a little more of the signal with the
interference<00:02:18.330> button<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:20.940> quiet

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.880

one of the helpful tips when operating
the<00:02:57.659> Black<00:02:57.870> Hawk<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.349> this<00:02:58.890> ticking<00:02:59.310> sound

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
the Black Hawk is this ticking sound

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.270 
the Black Hawk is this ticking sound
when<00:03:00.569> it's<00:03:00.780> sticking<00:03:01.049> approximately<00:03:01.950> like<00:03:02.069> it

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
when it's sticking approximately like it

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.130 
when it's sticking approximately like it
is<00:03:02.370> right<00:03:02.580> now<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:03.330> says<00:03:03.599> that<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.930> ground

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
is right now this says that the ground

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.009 
is right now this says that the ground
balance<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.709> very<00:03:04.769> good<00:03:05.720> depending<00:03:06.720> what<00:03:06.840> you

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
balance is very good depending what you
