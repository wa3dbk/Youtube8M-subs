00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
actually different types of wheels you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.620 
actually different types of wheels you
can<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:44.130> now<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.790> thought<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.360> were<00:00:45.450> just

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
can get now I thought that were just

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.410 
can get now I thought that were just
different<00:00:45.960> types<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.740> our<00:00:46.950> ribs<00:00:47.790> that<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.239> can

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
different types of our ribs that you can

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.479 
different types of our ribs that you can
get<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:48.900> they're<00:00:49.170> actually<00:00:49.370> changing<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
get but they're actually changing the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.750 
get but they're actually changing the
wheel<00:00:50.730> type<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.720> if<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.200> off-road<00:00:52.760> they

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
wheel type so if you go off-road they

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.400 
wheel type so if you go off-road they
are<00:00:54.120> actually<00:00:54.330> for<00:00:54.690> offroad<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.230> they're

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
are actually for offroad so they're

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.320 
are actually for offroad so they're
bigger<00:00:55.680> wheels<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.520> shorter<00:00:56.940> rebels

called<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:18.090> picked<00:01:18.300> it<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.480> randomly

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
called but I just picked it up randomly

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.260 
called but I just picked it up randomly
and<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.470> how<00:01:19.620> it<00:01:19.710> slides<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.220> lot<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.730> gonna

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
and see how it slides a lot I'm gonna

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.890 
and see how it slides a lot I'm gonna
can't<00:01:21.540> grip<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:21.900> well<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:23.479> basically<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.720> can

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
can't grip as well so basically you can

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140 
can't grip as well so basically you can
make<00:01:25.050> any<00:01:25.350> car<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> game<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.460> off-road<00:01:26.850> it
