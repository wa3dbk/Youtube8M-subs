and<00:01:10.200> they're<00:01:10.650> all<00:01:10.799> edible<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.360> much

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and they're all edible so with that much

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.179 
and they're all edible so with that much
information<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.260> could<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.650> walking<00:01:13.830> across

the<00:01:14.460> middle<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.760> Asia<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> plant<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the middle of Asia see a plant that

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.780 
the middle of Asia see a plant that
you've<00:01:16.350> never<00:01:16.500> seen<00:01:16.680> before<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.430> go

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
you've never seen before and go

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.810 
you've never seen before and go
that's<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.299> mustard<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.350> eat<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.820> so

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that's a mustard I know I can eat it so

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.580 
that's a mustard I know I can eat it so
that's<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> value<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> patterns

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that's really the value in the patterns

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.070 
that's really the value in the patterns
method<00:01:23.009> or<00:01:23.130> looking<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> these<00:01:24.600> family

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
method or looking at the these family

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.170 
method or looking at the these family
patterns<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.610> teach<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> lot

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
patterns is that it can teach you a lot

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.630 
patterns is that it can teach you a lot
about<00:01:27.240> plants<00:01:27.930> without<00:01:28.680> even<00:01:29.070> having<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.520> know

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
about plants without even having to know

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.539 
about plants without even having to know
the<00:01:29.790> individuals<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.430> that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the individuals and so because of that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.490 
the individuals and so because of that
