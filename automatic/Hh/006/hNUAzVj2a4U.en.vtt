hurry Utah you've got to destroy the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.690 
hurry Utah you've got to destroy the
reactor<00:00:43.380> before<00:00:43.559> they<00:00:43.860> fire<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.280> fermion

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
reactor before they fire the fermion

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:55.479 
reactor before they fire the fermion
cannon

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.170 

that's<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.360> fermion<00:00:56.809> reactor<00:00:57.350> in<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.649> center

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
that's the fermion reactor in the center

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.760 
that's the fermion reactor in the center
there<00:00:59.180> are<00:00:59.300> four<00:00:59.570> colliders<00:01:00.079> surrounding<00:01:00.649> it

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
there are four colliders surrounding it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.390 
there are four colliders surrounding it
that<00:01:00.800> accelerate<00:01:01.520> charged<00:01:01.910> particles<00:01:03.400> if

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
that accelerate charged particles if

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.010 
that accelerate charged particles if
they<00:01:04.640> disable<00:01:05.119> each<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.540> their<00:01:05.720> control

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
they disable each of their control

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.010 
they disable each of their control
systems<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:07.490> should<00:01:07.880> cause<00:01:08.090> an<00:01:08.270> overload<00:01:08.659> and

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
systems it should cause an overload and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:49.109 
systems it should cause an overload and
stop<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.650> reactor

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.789 

the<00:01:50.119> collider<00:01:50.450> control<00:01:50.960> systems<00:01:51.439> are<00:01:51.619> in<00:01:51.740> the

the collider control systems are in the

the collider control systems are in the
areas<00:01:52.219> indicated<00:01:52.880> with<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.060> marker
