 alexander viktorovicha i have new 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.770
 I have a question I would like to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.789
 hear your our goalkeeper school 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.849
 soviet which is these factors profession 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.580
 the enemy of the Artsakh issue is literally two 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.920
 words explained seventies 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.059
 each team above the line almost 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.090
 surname will call him korea above the line 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.870
 could be invited without any 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.090
 paki collection duel don't you think 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.090
 quickly that from manifestations 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:55.730
 Rinata Dasaev and here is his manner or 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.800

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.530
 finished our inner follows 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.259
 goalie school blame the absurd some 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:19.200
 but I but I will tell you this but you know how 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.079
 it was surprisingly amazing 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.479
 because Dosa's still drives 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:28.200
 let's say it made it a goalie to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.070
 invited to Moscow Spartak and drives 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.450
 before that he worked with ash and yash 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.049
 completely different 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.819
 manner of playing mace kicking so 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.770
 never played when site but i will explain 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.750
 why get home after the news 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.219
 be sure to talk later and we 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.569
 I would like to continue this track question 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:50.340
 need to get your horror opinion and year a 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.110
 dose of before the arrival of the recession as it 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.929
 there were very serious injuries to her there 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.090
 meniscus was not a problem with the magicians afterwards 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.640
 if you dosaev well remember when he 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.079
 passed he was tall yes but he didn't 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.119
 the answer was he was not athletic 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.939
 physique was here these houses click then 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.739
 there is a bullfight it is possible that he 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.849
 there was some kind of complex clean 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:14.340
 psychologically because of balance in the legs 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.959
 the attacker could do that there too 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.120
 seriously and there you get maybe 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.700
 here 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.129
 just these injuries 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.140
 he had them somehow influenced 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.909
 he has such a technique up to bow his knee 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.099
 hurt another for the volgar game and just 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:31.580
 also going to the striker meeting yes and 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.530
 so this could have affected him later 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.989
 quite high were there coordination 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.720
 movements it was easier for him to end feet 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.730
 consent to be formed you understand but it 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.349
 only the specifics is the specifics of the game so 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.940
 for a long time ask what is the connection between deliver 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.060
 and the decline of the alleged Russian question 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.470
 each padok on goalkeeper school went 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.530
 because of when the whole training system 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.829
 here destroyed and here came to power 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.280
 These businessmen bandits's unclear 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.280
 who and 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.209
 when I went to France 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.489
 eighties yes they already then st 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.700
 the leaders worked with the wonton 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.620
 special here and there i watched the whole 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.760
 method of preparation then when how 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.760
 as if chan there already worked with akinfeev 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.550
 could about yes again he has it 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.340
 also abroad was there saw everything and 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.830
 here we know we have a little bit 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.989
 late because Satan is not all the same 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.510
 not special worked generation 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.209
 just traders worked and of course 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.900
 maybe in this regard we are a little bit 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.790
 lagged behind 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.099
 but it does not know that we have now 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.430
 altar we do not have voluntary 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.520
 as well as promising young player too 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.700
 they don't want to work with them 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.640
 Legionnaire area is ready to buy yes 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.020
 where is another one where to earn than 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.730
 educate your player yes he will 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.710
 make mistakes young and there is no other way 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.290
 but now they do n't want to crave 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.840
 Immediately the results therefore the problems of those 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.670
 no less than a national team before a national team 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.520
 problems with the goalkeeper as there is no 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.860
 like no problem with goalkeepers in clubs in 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.840
 basically just legionnaires more 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.959
 trust but there 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.780
 also have for example see what the zenith 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.970
 For example, it hindered there were Russian 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.220
 pupils they Belarusian also 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.000
 used fat pot before that 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.280
 such yes such foams let you photos 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.860
 it hindered such an approach from she 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.880
 management mistakes and not what we have 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.740
 goalkeepers 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.110
 now there is no perspective here and work 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.970
 staff if possible because evgeny 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.530
 from Ivanovo wrote Alexander and for the second time 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.229
 Tell me what you think about Yuri Lodygin and 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.800
 so I specify yes he is still capable 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:49.729
 grow yes and what are its reserves a lot of whites 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:53.710
 if you compare it with the same few firms 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:57.970
 weaken or to compare such films 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.370
 firstly he is physically more powerful 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.260
 then he is what it is but malafeev he has long 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.479
 no less than the chances of akinfieva 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.520
 not inferior and I was surprised that 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.650
 cappella after those mistakes and 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.449
 psychological instability of akinfeev 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.669
 at the world championships he did not give him 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.300
 opportunities floods maybe this one 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.000
 out of error 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.729
 the same chapel could not be a 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.039
 that's exactly why now 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.860
 Lodygin especially as he and for 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.860
 abroad played that's practically 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.900
 got a lot of experience and practice 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.219
 in the overseas championship him Russian 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.229
 so lodygin in my opinion on my 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.919
 look no less than today 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.919
 Akinfeev's Day
