00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
across I'm going to use a technique of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
across I'm going to use a technique of
connecting<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> reader<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.920> my<00:01:08.430> hook<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939

I want to do this by presenting a
familiar<00:01:10.830> experience<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> common

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
familiar experience so this is a common

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.730 
familiar experience so this is a common
technique<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.049> writers<00:01:13.320> use<00:01:13.500> when<00:01:13.650> they

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
technique that writers use when they

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
this familiar experience so a car is

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:27.949 
this familiar experience so a car is
weaving<00:02:17.750> back<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.780> forth<00:02:22.670> speeding<00:02:23.670> up<00:02:26.959> then

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
weaving back and forth speeding up then

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.809 
weaving back and forth speeding up then
slowing<00:02:28.319> down<00:02:28.590> we've<00:02:29.010> all<00:02:29.160> seen<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.580> kind<00:02:29.790> of

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
slowing down we've all seen this kind of

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.990 
slowing down we've all seen this kind of
erratic<00:02:30.060> driving<00:02:32.599> or<00:02:33.599> suddenly<00:02:35.840> stopping

erratic driving or suddenly stopping

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.160 
erratic driving or suddenly stopping
okay<00:02:39.000> I'm<00:02:39.239> assuming<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.920> most<00:02:41.160> readers<00:02:41.579> have

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
okay I'm assuming that most readers have

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.380 
okay I'm assuming that most readers have
witnessed<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.349> so<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.340> distance<00:02:45.269> this

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
witnessed this so it's a distance this

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.020 
witnessed this so it's a distance this
is<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.599> really<00:02:45.870> good<00:02:46.019> technique<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:47.250> connecting

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
is a really good technique of connecting

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.140
