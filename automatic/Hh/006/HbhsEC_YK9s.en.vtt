00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:04.410
-	Hello all! We are at Kiev CyberSport Arena

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.660
Here’s Dendi sitting next to me.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.626
He’s just from the semifinal match.

00:00:07.626 --> 00:00:12.151
I’d like to ask you a question about Pudge hero.

00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:18.803
How did he appear in professional Dota? It’s for those who are not in.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.316
-	He appeared with difficulties.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.833
He managed to withstand all this I-won’t-pick-you stuff.

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:32.442
He is in Dota 2 since International.

00:00:34.428 --> 00:00:38.306
By that time there were very few heroes in Dota 2

00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:41.589
and very little counter against Pudge.

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.858
We decided to try him.

00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:46.787
For the first time we used him during

00:00:46.787 --> 00:00:50.084
the finals vs EHOME and it didn’t work.

00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:53.276
-	Did you pick it before?

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:57.480
And what about Chinese game vs DK? You picked Pudge and won then.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.216
-	Dota 1?

00:00:58.216 --> 00:00:59.148
-	Yep.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.337
-	We were just lucky.

00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:07.727
-	Was it an image pick or what?

00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:13.011
-	Let’s say we had nothing to lose and decided to use Pudge.

00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:16.214
-	Does anybody use Pudge except for you?

00:01:16.214 --> 00:01:16.846
I mean in Dota world.

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:17.968
-	Everybody does, I guess.

00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:20.511
-	Thanks to you?

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:22.659
-	I don’t know.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.166
-	And who counters Pudge in Dota 2?

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.609
-	Batrider copes very well with it.

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.623
It’s also not so pleasant to play against Borat and Doom.

00:01:34.623 --> 00:01:36.484
-	And in Dota 1?

00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:38.016
-	There are plenty of them.

00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:45.453
Invokers, Batrider, Shadow Demons… overchoise… it makes you dizzy.

00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:47.703
-	A new patch will be released soon.

00:01:47.703 --> 00:01:51.114
How will it influence on Pudge’s popularity?

00:01:51.114 --> 00:01:52.254
There’s lots of different invokers,

00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:54.912
shadow demons and the heroes you’ve mentioned there…

00:01:54.912 --> 00:02:00.631
-	Pudge is not so popular even now. He’ll be yet weaker.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.860
-	And the last question. What about Smile?

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.708
How do you like him as a part of team?

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:08.355
-	Perfectly.

00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:11.739
-	Did you play with him before Dota 2?

00:02:12.053 --> 00:02:16.395
-	No, I haven’t played with him before.

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.580
-	Ok. Now you’ll play finals vs The Retry.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.354
I won’t ask you a question. I’ll talk to someone else a bit later.

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:24.272
-	Despise them!

00:02:24.473 --> 00:02:27.115
-	Yep! Ok, good-bye. Give me a five!
