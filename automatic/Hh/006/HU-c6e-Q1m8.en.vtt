00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.450
 as a member of parliament I also know 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.879
 many parts of north rhine westfalen but 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.860
 My home is like that because I eat in 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.840
 I realize that I belong here 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.789
 born here grew up here 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.470
 this is my city i am burning for this 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.600
 city ​​for the people of this city and 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.060
 we show them again that it is 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.830
 it pays to show me 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.880
 well worth it for here in the 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.880
 to make city ​​politics 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.030
 I do not want our city 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.440
 do not fall apart in poor and rich 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.510
 who have the work and the work 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.940
 looking for a name already turned 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.590
 No, this city is one with yours 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.340
 many district with its many 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.330
 quarter with absolute will 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.330
 to make something of this city 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.720
 People deserve to be 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.960
 she straining that politics honestly 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.310
 stay careful and be careful 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.380
 Carefully handle taxpayers 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.380
 generate comfort distribute 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.060
 Success control is the municipal policy 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.610
 Immediately next morning 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.770
 baker is money unrecognized and immediately 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.990
 a feedback on a good decision 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.090
 has met or a bad 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.070
 I think that makes the attraction of politics 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.590
 from so know for whom to me that to 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.479
 we actually mention that and 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.070
 to say good on what's good 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.070
 was or what needs to be better 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.560
 expensive promises to go suddenly 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.720
 that is dubious 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.600
 but I can promise that we will 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.490
 work out common sense more 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.530
 fish reached that he humans 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.260
 bring together ideas and I am 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:02.479
 Certainly our city is full of good 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:06.080
 Idea 1 does not apply in our city 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.740
 whats what you can what then what 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.780
 are you something 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.440
 that has made our city strong and 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.820
 that will further strengthen our city 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.470
 that's why it's clear that people 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.930
 here, of course, in your neighborhoods 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.270
 But we all live together 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.720
 a big part of our wonderful 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.720
 city is
