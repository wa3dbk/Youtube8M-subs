00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
now I believe this is from series 2 and

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.430 
now I believe this is from series 2 and
I<00:00:08.639> caught<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.150> little<00:00:09.630> late<00:00:09.870> but<00:00:10.170> all<00:00:10.260> my

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
I caught this a little late but all my

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.959 
I caught this a little late but all my
stories<00:00:10.740> are<00:00:10.769> really<00:00:11.010> running<00:00:11.309> low<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
stories are really running low on the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.669 
stories are really running low on the
How<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.150> Train<00:00:12.240> Your<00:00:12.480> Dragon<00:00:12.540> figures<00:00:13.259> there

How to Train Your Dragon figures there

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.410 
How to Train Your Dragon figures there
was<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> lot<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.130> cool<00:00:14.309> figures<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.820> series<00:00:15.179> 1

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
was a lot of cool figures in series 1

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.000 
was a lot of cool figures in series 1
but<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.839> really<00:00:16.170> wasn't<00:00:16.320> able<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.619> pick<00:00:16.800> them<00:00:16.920> up

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
but I really wasn't able to pick them up

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.740 
but I really wasn't able to pick them up
because<00:00:17.160> they<00:00:17.369> were<00:00:17.460> all<00:00:17.580> sold<00:00:17.910> out<00:00:18.090> but<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.480> did

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
because they were all sold out but I did

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.599 
because they were all sold out but I did
see<00:00:18.960> some<00:00:19.230> for<00:00:19.500> series<00:00:19.740> 2<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.189> picked<00:00:20.520> up

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
see some for series 2 so I picked up

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.460

have him a little bit closer up you get

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.920

the<00:00:31.380> mouth<00:00:31.590> detail<00:00:32.279> there<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.690> know<00:00:33.780> this

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the mouth detail there and you know this

the mouth detail there and you know this
is<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.110> pretty<00:00:34.440> cool<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> back

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
is just pretty cool and here in the back

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.740 
is just pretty cool and here in the back
it<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.700> shows<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.030> display<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.540> how<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
it just shows you a display of how the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.389 
it just shows you a display of how the
figure<00:00:37.170> works<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.739> will<00:00:37.950> go<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
figure works but I will go with the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.740 
figure works but I will go with the
depth<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.239> won't<00:00:39.390> really<00:00:39.450> need<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
depth on that so we won't really need to

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.930 
depth on that so we won't really need to
look<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.140> too<00:00:40.379> much<00:00:40.590> alright<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:41.879> I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
look at that too much alright so here I

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.490 
look at that too much alright so here I
have<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.360> monstrous<00:00:42.840> nightmare<00:00:42.870> out<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the wings here just snap on from

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.470 
the wings here just snap on from
underneath<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.550> place<00:00:59.879> them<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.270> there

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
underneath you just place them on there

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.750 
underneath you just place them on there
and<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.780> pop<00:01:00.989> them<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:02.160> head<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.609> on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

and you just pop them on the head is on
there<00:01:03.439> already<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.250> to

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
there already and then you have to

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.520 
there already and then you have to
attach<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.729> tail<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.540> mean<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.200> stuff<00:01:07.409> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
attach the tail I mean all that stuff is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.740 
attach the tail I mean all that stuff is
fairly<00:01:07.860> easy<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.670> detail<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.150> these<00:01:09.450> figures

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
fairly easy the detail on these figures

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.539 
fairly easy the detail on these figures
look<00:01:09.900> pretty<00:01:10.140> good<00:01:10.290> when<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> head<00:01:10.950> sculpt<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
look pretty good when the head sculpt is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.120 
look pretty good when the head sculpt is
really<00:01:12.090> nice<00:01:12.409> looks<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.619> he<00:01:13.740> did<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
really nice looks like he did in the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.499 
really nice looks like he did in the
cartoon<00:01:14.640> well<00:01:15.030> your<00:01:15.479> CGI<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:17.270> really<00:01:18.270> love<00:01:18.479> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
cartoon well your CGI I really love that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.630 
cartoon well your CGI I really love that
face<00:01:18.900> mold<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.590> here<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> back<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.310> get

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
face mold and here on the back you get

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.600 
face mold and here on the back you get
the<00:01:20.700> scales<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.830> tell<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the scales and you can tell that the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.030 
the scales and you can tell that the
wings<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.150> kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.630> clipped<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.710> there

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
wings are kind of like clipped on there

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.749 
wings are kind of like clipped on there
but<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.150> mean<00:01:27.799> that's<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.189> figure<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
but I mean that's what this figure is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.149 
but I mean that's what this figure is
but<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.600> wings<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:31.140> like<00:01:31.320> scales<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
but the wings have like scales and you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.830 
but the wings have like scales and you
know<00:01:32.280> mix<00:01:32.520> definitely<00:01:33.060> looks<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> dragon

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
know mix definitely looks like a dragon

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230 
know mix definitely looks like a dragon
it's<00:01:34.530> hard<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> get<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.009> guy<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.939> shop

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it's hard to get this guy in the shop

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.230 
it's hard to get this guy in the shop
the<00:01:36.450> whole<00:01:36.659> time<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.520> he<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:39.000> so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the whole time because he is just so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.170 
the whole time because he is just so
long<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.170> back<00:01:40.350> legs<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.820> are<00:01:41.970> not

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
long the back legs here they are not

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.999 
long the back legs here they are not
articulated<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.140> they<00:01:43.259> are<00:01:43.470> kind<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
articulated but they are kind of the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.490 
articulated but they are kind of the
soft<00:01:44.340> rubber<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.509> move<00:01:46.049> them<00:01:46.200> so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
soft rubber so that you can move them so

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.340 
soft rubber so that you can move them so
are<00:01:46.710> these<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.070> spikes<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> top<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:49.049> so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
are these like spikes on the top here so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.160 
are these like spikes on the top here so
the<00:01:49.530> gimmick<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.189> guy<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.990> like

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the gimmick on this guy is you can like

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.569 
the gimmick on this guy is you can like
move<00:01:52.350> his<00:01:52.590> arms<00:01:54.619> if<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.799> flop<00:01:56.070> them<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
move his arms if you flop them like this

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.249 
move his arms if you flop them like this
they<00:01:56.880> kind<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.299> flap<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.810> his<00:01:57.899> head<00:01:58.049> goes

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
they kind of like flap and his head goes

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.060 
they kind of like flap and his head goes
down<00:01:58.469> or<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.460> go<00:01:59.549> slow<00:01:59.939> they<00:02:00.899> go<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.409> if

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
down or you go slow they go like that if

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.840 
down or you go slow they go like that if
you<00:02:02.159> move<00:02:02.340> his<00:02:02.460> head<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.450> wings<00:02:03.689> go<00:02:03.960> down

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
you move his head here the wings go down

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.130 
you move his head here the wings go down
so<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.000> kind<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.960> it's

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
so it's kind of like you know it's

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.749 
so it's kind of like you know it's
flying<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.649> there<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.220> pretty<00:02:08.459> cool<00:02:08.729> thing

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
flying to there it's a pretty cool thing

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.790 
flying to there it's a pretty cool thing
that<00:02:09.599> they've<00:02:09.750> done<00:02:09.780> there<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.379> wings<00:02:10.590> are

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
that they've done there the wings are

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.000 
that they've done there the wings are
really<00:02:11.099> heavy<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.849> know<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.390> they're<00:02:12.569> so

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
really heavy you know and they're so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.890 
really heavy you know and they're so
that<00:02:13.519> I<00:02:13.549> think<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.120> know<00:02:14.150> kind<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.689> them

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
that I think it you know kind of them

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.750 
that I think it you know kind of them
bogs<00:02:15.439> down<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.890> head<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.069> little<00:02:16.250> bit<00:02:16.549> since

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
bogs down the head a little bit since

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.910 
bogs down the head a little bit since
this<00:02:16.939> is<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.420> kind<00:02:17.629> of<00:02:17.659> like<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> saw<00:02:18.260> plastic

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
this is just kind of like a saw plastic

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.770 
this is just kind of like a saw plastic
here<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.489> then<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.700> wings<00:02:19.939> are<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.480> little<00:02:20.689> bit

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
here and then the wings are a little bit

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.600 
here and then the wings are a little bit
harder<00:02:21.079> plastic<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:21.890> there's<00:02:22.069> not<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.400> same

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
harder plastic so there's not the same

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.670 
harder plastic so there's not the same
but<00:02:23.090> yeah<00:02:23.360> that's<00:02:23.689> pretty<00:02:23.870> much<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.379> gimmick

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
but yeah that's pretty much the gimmick

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.520 
but yeah that's pretty much the gimmick
there<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.790> underbelly<00:02:26.329> here<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.349> see

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
there the underbelly here you can see

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.530 
there the underbelly here you can see
the<00:02:27.650> mechanism<00:02:28.189> there<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.819> then<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.360> is

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
the mechanism there and then this is

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.780 
the mechanism there and then this is
these<00:02:29.900> just<00:02:30.200> snap<00:02:30.590> right<00:02:30.620> into<00:02:31.250> there<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:31.700> to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
these just snap right into there so to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.399 
these just snap right into there so to
make<00:02:31.970> sure<00:02:32.090> they're<00:02:32.239> good<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:33.019> I<00:02:33.079> want<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.290> say

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
make sure they're good so I want to say
