is phenomenal you won't have any sort of
straightaways<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:43.649> you'll<00:00:43.920> constantly<00:00:44.430> be

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
straightaways but you'll constantly be

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.790

curve or some sort of challenge to you

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.420 
curve or some sort of challenge to you
so<00:00:49.320> even<00:00:49.559> though<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> double<00:00:50.039> wide<00:00:50.190> which

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
so even though it's a double wide which

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.549 
so even though it's a double wide which
a<00:00:50.640> lot<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> people<00:00:51.120> find<00:00:51.239> easy<00:00:51.539> there's<00:00:52.350> still

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
a lot of people find easy there's still

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.490 
a lot of people find easy there's still
an<00:00:52.739> element<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.870> difficulty<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.140> because

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
an element of difficulty to it because

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.290 
an element of difficulty to it because
you're<00:00:55.739> constantly<00:00:56.250> battling<00:00:56.730> some<00:00:57.000> sort<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
you're constantly battling some sort of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.420 
you're constantly battling some sort of
turn<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.570> some<00:00:57.899> sort<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.199> angle<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.370> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
turn or some sort of angle so it's a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.740 
turn or some sort of angle so it's a
little<00:00:59.760> bit<00:01:00.030> more<00:01:00.149> difficult<00:01:00.539> than<00:01:00.570> your

island now one of my favorite parts of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.580 
island now one of my favorite parts of
this<00:01:27.210> track<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.630> coming<00:01:27.930> right<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.259> here<00:01:28.439> on

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
this track is coming right up here on

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.609 
this track is coming right up here on
the<00:01:28.619> second<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:30.000> uuhh<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.350> love<00:01:31.500> this

thing<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.100> come<00:01:32.250> around<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.670> this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
thing so you come around here on this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.010 
thing so you come around here on this
corner<00:01:33.000> right<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.450> you'll<00:01:33.540> notice<00:01:33.600> it

corner right here and you'll notice it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
corner right here and you'll notice it
right<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.470> there's<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.130> little<00:01:35.340> bit<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.490> an

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
right here there's a little bit of an

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.999 
right here there's a little bit of an
alligator<00:01:35.880> slash<00:01:36.270> sea<00:01:36.540> monster<00:01:36.960> thing<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.409> I

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
alligator slash sea monster thing and I

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.319 
alligator slash sea monster thing and I
love<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.520> thing<00:01:38.820> looks<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.180> going

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
love the way that thing looks and going

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.730 
love the way that thing looks and going
around<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.540> corner<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.170> hard<00:01:40.500> right

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
around this corner it is a hard right

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.140 
around this corner it is a hard right
turn<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.250> you'll<00:01:41.340> move<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.820> slight

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
turn and then you'll move to this slight

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.870 
turn and then you'll move to this slight
left<00:01:42.390> however<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.799> an<00:01:43.950> angle<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.759> a

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
left however it's on an angle so it's a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.010 
left however it's on an angle so it's a
little<00:01:45.119> bit<00:01:45.210> more<00:01:45.329> difficult<00:01:45.780> than<00:01:45.930> you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
little bit more difficult than you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.170 
little bit more difficult than you
traditionally<00:01:46.770> think<00:01:46.799> also<00:01:47.460> he's<00:01:47.610> put<00:01:47.820> little

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
traditionally think also he's put little

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.569 
traditionally think also he's put little
tiny<00:01:48.479> details<00:01:48.930> now<00:01:49.470> there<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> gravity<00:01:50.369> zone

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
tiny details now there is a gravity zone

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.530 
tiny details now there is a gravity zone
there<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.210> one<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> those

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
there and this is just one of those

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.030 
there and this is just one of those
details<00:01:51.689> you'll<00:01:52.020> notice<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.560> next<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
details you'll notice that next to the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.880 
details you'll notice that next to the
sinking<00:01:53.430> ship<00:01:53.720> these<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:55.110> particles<00:01:55.590> from

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
sinking ship these little particles from

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.230 
sinking ship these little particles from
the<00:01:55.979> gravity<00:01:56.460> zone<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:56.969> makes<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.210> look

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the gravity zone actually makes it look

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.149 
the gravity zone actually makes it look
like<00:01:57.360> they're<00:01:57.570> water<00:01:57.810> splashes<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.590> just

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
like they're water splashes and just

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.160 
like they're water splashes and just
detail<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.759> really<00:02:00.509> sells<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> map

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
detail like that really sells the map

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.380 
detail like that really sells the map
makes<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.590> feel<00:02:01.770> very<00:02:01.799> more<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.939> makes<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> more

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
makes it feel very more it makes it more

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.510 
makes it feel very more it makes it more
thematic<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.950> don't<00:02:05.070> know<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.280> stuff

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
thematic and I don't know just stuff

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.160 
thematic and I don't know just stuff
like<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.790> really<00:02:06.119> makes<00:02:06.540> me<00:02:06.689> enjoy<00:02:06.810> maps

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
like that really makes me enjoy maps

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.690 
like that really makes me enjoy maps
like<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.469> way<00:02:07.770> more<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.190> they're<00:02:08.310> not<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.520> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
like this way more so they're not just a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.510 
like this way more so they're not just a
traditional<00:02:08.849> floating<00:02:09.739> racetrack<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.459> you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
traditional floating racetrack so if you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.800 
traditional floating racetrack so if you
want<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> check<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.910> out<00:02:12.000> something<00:02:12.300> download

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
want to check it out something download

want to check it out something download
