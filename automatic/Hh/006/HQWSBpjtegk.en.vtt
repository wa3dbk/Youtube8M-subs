because it was a lot of stuff that you
got<00:06:23.339> accomplished<00:06:23.819> tool<00:06:24.060> and<00:06:24.210> you<00:06:24.270> could<00:06:24.389> buy

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
got accomplished tool and you could buy

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.019 
got accomplished tool and you could buy
stuff<00:06:24.900> with<00:06:25.080> your<00:06:25.560> will<00:06:25.919> on<00:06:26.219> the<00:06:26.610> card<00:06:26.819> points

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:27.029 
stuff with your will on the card points

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:29.659 
stuff with your will on the card points
so<00:06:27.419> I<00:06:27.599> think<00:06:28.319> every<00:06:28.650> game<00:06:28.830> that<00:06:28.860> your

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
so I think every game that your

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.450 
so I think every game that your
mentality<00:06:30.000> changes<00:06:30.319> during<00:06:31.319> mw3<00:06:31.800> I<00:06:31.979> think<00:06:32.310> it

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
mentality changes during mw3 I think it

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.680 
mentality changes during mw3 I think it
was<00:06:32.580> a<00:06:32.909> lot<00:06:33.150> more<00:06:33.830> social<00:06:34.830> as<00:06:34.949> well<00:06:34.979> because

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
was a lot more social as well because

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.659 
was a lot more social as well because
you<00:06:36.690> really<00:06:36.990> you<00:06:37.500> really<00:06:37.529> needed<00:06:38.310> a<00:06:38.430> partner

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
you really you really needed a partner

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:39.980 
you really you really needed a partner
