everything<00:01:10.650> maybe<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.100> HTC<00:01:11.549> logo<00:01:11.760> could<00:01:12.030> have

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
everything maybe the HTC logo could have

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.280 
everything maybe the HTC logo could have
been<00:01:12.240> placed<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:12.930> differently

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
been placed a little bit differently

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.499 
been placed a little bit differently
where<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> home<00:01:14.070> buttons<00:01:14.430> there<00:01:14.670> instead<00:01:15.330> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
where the home buttons there instead of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.050 
where the home buttons there instead of
the<00:01:15.720> HTC<00:01:16.470> logo<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:16.950> otherwise<00:01:17.130> really<00:01:17.670> loving

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the HTC logo but otherwise really loving

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.310 
the HTC logo but otherwise really loving
the<00:01:18.150> build<00:01:18.299> quality<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.020> kind<00:01:19.229> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the build quality here and it's kind of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.410 
the build quality here and it's kind of
reminiscent<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> droid<00:01:20.580> DNA<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
reminiscent at the droid DNA just in the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.910 
reminiscent at the droid DNA just in the
way<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.659> curved<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.590> overall<00:01:22.890> shape

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
way it's curved and the overall shape

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.800 
way it's curved and the overall shape
but<00:01:23.310> what<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> love<00:01:23.790> about<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> curve<00:01:24.659> in

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
but what I love about it is the curve in

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
but what I love about it is the curve in
the<00:01:24.900> back<00:01:25.049> makes<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:25.860> easy<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.640> fit<00:01:26.880> in

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the back makes it really easy to fit in

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.550 
the back makes it really easy to fit in
your<00:01:27.210> hand<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.810> got<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> nice<00:01:28.140> build

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
your hand so it's got a nice build

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.380 
your hand so it's got a nice build
quality<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.340> speakers<00:01:29.790> are<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> front

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
quality the speakers are on the front

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.940 
quality the speakers are on the front

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.460 
but HTC made a really bold marketing
move<00:02:53.730> when<00:02:53.940> they<00:02:54.030> went<00:02:54.240> from<00:02:54.390> megapixels<00:02:55.080> to

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
move when they went from megapixels to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.110 
move when they went from megapixels to
ultra<00:02:55.830> pixel<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.280> they're<00:02:56.400> marketing<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.940> as

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
ultra pixel so they're marketing this as

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.790 
ultra pixel so they're marketing this as
an<00:02:57.480> ultrapixel<00:02:57.900> camera<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.500> one<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.710> the
