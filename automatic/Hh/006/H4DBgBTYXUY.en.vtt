it<00:00:56.789> really<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.149> hope<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.629> he<00:00:57.840> just

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
it really what I hope is that he just

players I think it might be a myth but I

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.890 
players I think it might be a myth but I
heard<00:01:02.850> that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
he asked manchester city if he could

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.000 
he asked manchester city if he could
have<00:01:08.530> some<00:01:08.860> shares<00:01:09.550> in<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.420> in<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.560> scarf

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
have some shares in the in the scarf

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.120 
have some shares in the in the scarf
being<00:01:12.340> sold<00:01:12.670> at<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.940> club<00:01:13.210> shop<00:01:13.740> who<00:01:14.740> said<00:01:14.980> I

to<00:01:59.980> be<00:02:00.100> fair<00:02:00.280> probably<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:00.760> probably<00:02:01.150> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
to be fair probably that probably the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.450 
to be fair probably that probably the
poorest<00:02:01.660> team<00:02:01.870> United<00:02:02.080> about<00:02:02.440> that<00:02:03.130> won<00:02:03.370> the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
league in its in the $19,000 but they've

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.460 
league in its in the $19,000 but they've
been<00:02:09.520> proved<00:02:09.820> in<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.119> areas<00:02:10.480> that<00:02:10.510> Italy<00:02:11.320> knew

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
been proved in the areas that Italy knew

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.030 
been proved in the areas that Italy knew
they<00:02:12.280> needed<00:02:12.600> improvement<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:14.890> guys

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
they needed improvement so so you guys

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.500 
they needed improvement so so you guys
think<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.550> them<00:02:15.700> they're<00:02:15.910> obviously<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.330> main

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
think of them they're obviously the main

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.990 
think of them they're obviously the main
the<00:02:17.020> main<00:02:17.050> guys<00:02:17.410> again<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:17.920> Chelsea<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:18.850> do

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
the main guys again and Chelsea you do

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.940 
the main guys again and Chelsea you do
is<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.150> good<00:02:19.420> size<00:02:19.600> obviously<00:02:19.840> sorry<00:02:20.620> Torres

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
is a good size obviously sorry Torres

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.310 
is a good size obviously sorry Torres
I'll<00:02:21.070> probably<00:02:21.310> come<00:02:22.239> good<00:02:22.450> within<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:22.900> this

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
I'll probably come good within this this

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.670 
I'll probably come good within this this
season<00:02:23.530> house<00:02:23.830> or<00:02:24.160> settled<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.959> don't<00:02:26.620> know

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
season house or settled it I don't know

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.150 
season house or settled it I don't know
something<00:02:26.980> with<00:02:27.070> us<00:02:27.220> nothing

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
something with us nothing

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.340 
something with us nothing
so<00:02:28.850> really<00:02:29.030> those<00:02:29.390> were<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.720> three<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.050> think

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
so really those were the three I think

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.980 
so really those were the three I think
City<00:02:30.650> United<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.340> Chelsea<00:02:31.450> we're<00:02:32.450> three<00:02:32.810> and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
City United and Chelsea we're three and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.330 
City United and Chelsea we're three and
it<00:02:33.260> really<00:02:33.470> just<00:02:33.650> depends<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.310> know

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
it really just depends you know

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.770 
it really just depends you know
Liverpool<00:02:34.820> have<00:02:34.970> made<00:02:35.240> some<00:02:35.420> cracking

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
Liverpool have made some cracking

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.540 
Liverpool have made some cracking
signage<00:02:36.140> as<00:02:36.230> well<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:36.710> I<00:02:36.890> think<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.370> avatar

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
signage as well so I think the avatar

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.220 
signage as well so I think the avatar
for<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.120> be<00:02:38.210> honest<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.540> think<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.780> table<00:02:39.140> that

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
for to be honest I think the table that

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.720 
for to be honest I think the table that
sought<00:02:39.410> for<00:02:39.650> this<00:02:39.800> season<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.370> know<00:02:40.490> it's
