00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
so then you know again you just slide it

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.120 
so then you know again you just slide it
from<00:00:12.980> okay

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
from okay

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.800 
from okay
slide<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.940> from<00:00:15.030> one<00:00:15.269> ball<00:00:15.509> joint<00:00:17.510> one<00:00:18.510> side

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
slide it from one ball joint one side

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.470 
slide it from one ball joint one side
and<00:00:19.710> then<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.010> outside<00:00:20.400> now<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
and then the outside now you have that

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.500 
and then the outside now you have that
attached<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.920> then<00:00:23.070> now<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.510> place

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
attached and then now you can place

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.400 
attached and then now you can place
these<00:00:24.689> ones<00:00:24.960> back<00:00:25.140> these<00:00:25.710> pieces<00:00:25.949> back

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:44.790 

[Music]

[Music]

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.029 

assemble<00:00:49.289> right<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:51.680> okay<00:00:52.680> now<00:00:52.860> we're

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
assemble right here that okay now we're

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.569 
assemble right here that okay now we're
gonna<00:00:53.100> attach<00:00:53.520> um<00:00:54.329> hook<00:00:55.170> right<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:56.010> upper

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
gonna attach um hook right here upper

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.760 
gonna attach um hook right here upper
torso<00:00:57.320> hook<00:00:58.320> okay

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
torso hook okay

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.969 
torso hook okay
basically<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.930> flat<00:01:04.229> part<00:01:04.470> right<00:01:04.650> here

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
basically this flat part right here

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.539 
basically this flat part right here
should<00:01:05.939> line<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.180> with<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.439> top<00:01:07.680> black<00:01:08.250> part

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
should line up with the top black part

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.969 
should line up with the top black part
right<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.840> top<00:01:10.140> black<00:01:10.590> part<00:01:10.890> right

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
right here it's top black part right

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.200 
right here it's top black part right
here<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.250> line<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.790> top<00:01:11.970> right

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
here will line up with the top right

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.810 
here will line up with the top right
here<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:16.220> line<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:19.820> Center

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
here so what you do is line it up Center

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.250 
here so what you do is line it up Center
it<00:01:21.200> and

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.060 

there<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.980> go<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.000> well<00:01:27.690> that<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.410> sort

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
there you go that is well that is sort

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.500 
there you go that is well that is sort
of<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.280> that's<00:01:29.760> a<00:01:29.850> very<00:01:30.060> precarious

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
of like that's a very precarious

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.540 
of like that's a very precarious
connection<00:01:31.410> because<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> thought<00:01:31.980> all<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.400> is

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
connection because I thought all it is

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.750 
connection because I thought all it is
is<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> Lego<00:01:33.560> these<00:01:34.560> Lego<00:01:34.860> bits<00:01:35.160> connecting

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
is the Lego these Lego bits connecting

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.030 
is the Lego these Lego bits connecting
together<00:01:35.910> so<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.930> order<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.200> stabilize<00:01:37.830> that

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
together so in order to stabilize that

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.480 
together so in order to stabilize that
as<00:01:38.910> I<00:01:39.300> mentioned<00:01:39.660> before<00:01:39.750> those<00:01:40.260> those<00:01:41.040> arms

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
as I mentioned before those those arms

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.860 
as I mentioned before those those arms
you<00:01:41.970> take<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:45.240> notice<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.880> arm<00:01:48.180> folds

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
you take this you notice this arm folds

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.100 
you take this you notice this arm folds
over<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.400> attach<00:01:50.400> this<00:01:50.580> like<00:01:50.760> that<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
over and attach this like that and the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.890 
over and attach this like that and the
same<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.650> one<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.250> folds<00:01:53.640> up

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
same with this one this one folds up

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.330 
same with this one this one folds up
over<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.520> attaches<00:01:56.520> right<00:01:57.710> now<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.770> figure

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
over and attaches right now the figure

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.540 
over and attaches right now the figure
is<00:02:00.290> what<00:02:01.290> most<00:02:01.500> part<00:02:01.770> pretty<00:02:02.100> stable<00:02:02.310> because

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
is what most part pretty stable because

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.140 
is what most part pretty stable because
I<00:02:02.730> can<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:04.590> know<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.580> doesn't<00:02:05.880> want<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
I can you know I can it doesn't want to

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.650 
I can you know I can it doesn't want to
fall<00:02:06.300> apart<00:02:06.660> right<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:08.820> now<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.570> know

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
fall apart right so so it's now you know

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.600 
fall apart right so so it's now you know
held<00:02:10.020> together<00:02:10.140> pretty<00:02:10.380> well<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:11.280> notice

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
held together pretty well you notice

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.750 
held together pretty well you notice
these<00:02:11.820> right<00:02:12.570> here<00:02:12.780> these<00:02:13.740> help<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.430> support

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
these right here these help to support

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.530 
these right here these help to support
the<00:02:14.850> arms

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the arms

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.660 
the arms
they<00:02:16.170> don't<00:02:16.350> actually<00:02:16.560> attach<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> arms

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
they don't actually attach to the arms

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.190 
they don't actually attach to the arms
but<00:02:18.000> they're<00:02:18.300> just<00:02:18.480> sort<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.660> like<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.990> place

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200
