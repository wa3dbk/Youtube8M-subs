00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 
some grammar okay we've looked at

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.690 
some grammar okay we've looked at
already<00:00:16.260> all<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.890> language<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.580> vocabulary

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
already all the language and vocabulary

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.060 
already all the language and vocabulary
we<00:00:18.330> need<00:00:18.540> today<00:00:19.290> we're<00:00:19.500> going<00:00:19.620> to<00:00:19.710> look<00:00:19.890> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
we need today we're going to look a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.340 
we need today we're going to look a
little<00:00:20.490> bit<00:00:20.640> closely<00:00:21.210> at<00:00:21.390> some<00:00:21.690> very<00:00:22.050> very

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
little bit closely at some very very

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.160 
little bit closely at some very very
important<00:00:23.220> grammar<00:00:23.610> structures<00:00:24.360> for<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.020> to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
important grammar structures for you to

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.980 
important grammar structures for you to
learn<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.590> your<00:00:25.710> IELTS<00:00:26.600> specifically<00:00:27.600> we're

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
learn for your IELTS specifically we're

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.280 
learn for your IELTS specifically we're
going<00:00:28.020> to<00:00:28.410> look<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:28.770> relative<00:00:29.430> clauses<00:00:30.290> okay

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
going to look at relative clauses okay

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.810 
going to look at relative clauses okay
do<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.529> know<00:00:31.680> what<00:00:31.800> relative<00:00:32.220> clauses<00:00:32.490> are

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
do you know what relative clauses are

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.040 
do you know what relative clauses are
okay<00:00:33.720> well<00:00:34.560> relative<00:00:35.280> clauses<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.970> a<00:00:36.060> way<00:00:36.780> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
okay well relative clauses are a way of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.300 
okay well relative clauses are a way of
a<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:38.130> can<00:00:38.220> use<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.640> grammar<00:00:38.970> to<00:00:39.360> combine<00:00:40.310> two

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
a we can use this grammar to combine two

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.470 
a we can use this grammar to combine two
simple<00:00:42.180> sentences<00:00:42.329> together<00:00:43.020> okay<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> for

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
simple sentences together okay so for

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.050 
simple sentences together okay so for
example<00:00:45.540> you<00:00:46.020> might<00:00:46.500> write<00:00:46.800> two<00:00:47.250> very<00:00:47.640> simple

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
example you might write two very simple

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.800 
example you might write two very simple
sentences<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.710> IELTS<00:00:50.130> you<00:00:50.730> want<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.210> show

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
sentences but in IELTS you want to show

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.860 
sentences but in IELTS you want to show
the<00:00:52.560> examiner<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.700> can<00:00:53.880> write<00:00:54.150> longer

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the examiner that you can write longer

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.360 
the examiner that you can write longer
more<00:00:55.860> complicated<00:00:56.520> sentences<00:00:57.470> so<00:00:58.470> we<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.220> use

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
more complicated sentences so we can use

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.510 
more complicated sentences so we can use
relative<00:00:59.880> clauses<00:01:00.240> to<00:01:00.990> put<00:01:01.410> two<00:01:01.860> sentences

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
relative clauses to put two sentences

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.859 
relative clauses to put two sentences
into<00:01:03.060> one<00:01:03.900> sentence<00:01:04.439> okay<00:01:05.330> another<00:01:06.330> way<00:01:06.540> we

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
into one sentence okay another way we

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.740 
into one sentence okay another way we
might<00:01:07.020> use<00:01:07.259> relative<00:01:07.590> clauses<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.570> have

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
might use relative clauses is if we have

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.289 
might use relative clauses is if we have
a<00:01:10.080> number<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.220> different<00:01:11.490> pieces<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
a number of different pieces of

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.679 
a number of different pieces of
information<00:01:12.830> about<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.729> variable<00:01:15.450> what

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
information about the variable what

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.210 
information about the variable what
we're<00:01:15.840> describing<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.650> say<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:16.979> example

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
we're describing that say for example

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.149 
we're describing that say for example
it's<00:01:17.700> hamburger<00:01:17.999> consumption<00:01:18.990> okay<00:01:19.619> you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it's hamburger consumption okay you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.859 
it's hamburger consumption okay you
might<00:01:20.369> want<00:01:20.579> to<00:01:20.670> add<00:01:20.850> two<00:01:21.329> pieces<00:01:21.749> of

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
might want to add two pieces of

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.620 
might want to add two pieces of
information<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:23.070> hamburger<00:01:24.060> consumption

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
information about hamburger consumption

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.230 
information about hamburger consumption
from<00:01:24.929> the<00:01:25.109> graph<00:01:25.369> for<00:01:26.369> example<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.090> might

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
from the graph for example you might

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.739 
from the graph for example you might
want<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.630> say<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.380> rising<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.749> you

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:30.749 
want to say that it is rising and you

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:33.440 
want to say that it is rising and you
might<00:01:30.929> also<00:01:31.170> want<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.649> say<00:01:31.920> how<00:01:32.460> many<00:01:32.670> grams<00:01:33.090> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
might also want to say how many grams it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.529 
might also want to say how many grams it
started<00:01:33.479> at<00:01:34.319> and<00:01:34.560> how<00:01:35.039> many<00:01:35.280> grams<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.969> ended

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
started at and how many grams it ended

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.489 
started at and how many grams it ended
at<00:01:36.659> ok<00:01:37.469> so<00:01:37.829> you're<00:01:38.009> giving<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.429> rise<00:01:39.359> with<00:01:40.049> some

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:40.499 
at ok so you're giving a rise with some

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:43.550 
at ok so you're giving a rise with some
numbers<00:01:40.859> some<00:01:41.520> amounts<00:01:42.030> okay<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.780> some

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
numbers some amounts okay and some

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.830 
numbers some amounts okay and some
relative<00:01:43.950> clauses<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.490> help<00:01:44.819> us<00:01:44.999> put<00:01:45.600> these

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
relative clauses can help us put these

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.349 
relative clauses can help us put these
two<00:01:46.289> pieces<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.100> information<00:01:47.369> into<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
two pieces of information into a

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.649 
two pieces of information into a
sentence<00:01:48.869> basically<00:01:49.740> we're<00:01:50.520> adding<00:01:51.030> extra

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
sentence basically we're adding extra

detail about the the variable that we're

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.109 
detail about the the variable that we're
describing<00:01:56.039> ok<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> how<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.819> going<00:01:59.969> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
describing ok so how are we going to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.239 
describing ok so how are we going to
look<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.359> this<00:02:00.539> well<00:02:01.439> first<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.889> all<00:02:01.950> we're

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
relative clauses first of all we will

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.980 
relative clauses first of all we will
look<00:02:07.109> at<00:02:07.259> defining<00:02:07.920> relative<00:02:08.280> clauses

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
look at defining relative clauses

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.470 
look at defining relative clauses
defining<00:02:09.990> relative<00:02:10.110> clauses<00:02:10.440> are<00:02:11.480> closes

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
defining relative clauses are closes

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.910 
defining relative clauses are closes
which<00:02:12.870> are<00:02:13.110> necessary<00:02:14.150> ok<00:02:15.150> now<00:02:15.900> when<00:02:16.740> we're

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
which are necessary ok now when we're

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.040 
which are necessary ok now when we're
describing<00:02:17.250> something<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:18.450> example<00:02:18.840> again

hamburger consumption there might be

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.880 
hamburger consumption there might be
more<00:02:21.659> information<00:02:22.470> about<00:02:22.730> hamburger

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.730 
we're describing people we might need to
say<00:02:29.410> which<00:02:29.860> people<00:02:30.550> we're<00:02:31.120> talking<00:02:31.330> about<00:02:31.810> so

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
say which people we're talking about so

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.220 
say which people we're talking about so
if<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.940> don't<00:02:34.209> have<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.600> relative<00:02:34.990> clause

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
if you don't have the relative clause

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.460 
if you don't have the relative clause
and<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.860> reader<00:02:36.270> doesn't<00:02:37.270> know<00:02:37.540> which<00:02:38.050> or

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
and the reader doesn't know which or

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.370 
and the reader doesn't know which or
what<00:02:39.010> you're<00:02:39.370> talking<00:02:39.790> about<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.140> need

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
what you're talking about so you need

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.070 
what you're talking about so you need
the<00:02:41.410> relative<00:02:41.920> Clause<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:43.420> tell<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.840> reader

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
the relative Clause to tell the reader

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.820 
the relative Clause to tell the reader
which<00:02:45.040> or<00:02:45.430> what<00:02:45.850> we're<00:02:46.060> talking<00:02:46.480> about<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:47.020> we

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
which or what we're talking about and we

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.250 
which or what we're talking about and we
use<00:02:48.070> defining<00:02:48.910> relative<00:02:49.060> clauses<00:02:49.390> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
use defining relative clauses the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.010 
use defining relative clauses the
relative<00:02:50.680> Clause<00:02:50.860> defines<00:02:51.840> what<00:02:52.840> we're

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
relative Clause defines what we're

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.620 
relative Clause defines what we're
talking<00:02:53.380> about<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:54.130> gives<00:02:54.400> us<00:02:54.630> important

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
talking about it gives us important

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.500 
talking about it gives us important
information<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:57.730> we'll<00:02:57.880> take<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.090> look<00:02:58.300> at

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
information then we'll take a look at

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.020 
information then we'll take a look at
the<00:02:59.290> opposite<00:02:59.739> which<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.030> non-defining

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
the opposite which is non-defining

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.810 
the opposite which is non-defining
relative<00:03:01.060> clauses<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.769> this<00:03:02.920> case<00:03:03.160> this

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
relative clauses and in this case this

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.259 
relative clauses and in this case this
is<00:03:04.060> extra<00:03:04.750> information<00:03:05.310> which<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:06.340> not<00:03:06.850> one

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
is extra information which is not one

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.650 
is extra information which is not one
hundred<00:03:07.420> percent<00:03:07.800> necessary<00:03:08.800> but<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:10.180> is

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
hundred percent necessary but it is

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.949 
hundred percent necessary but it is
giving<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.350> reader<00:03:11.470> some<00:03:11.920> extra<00:03:12.610> detail<00:03:13.180> okay

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
giving the reader some extra detail okay

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.580 
giving the reader some extra detail okay
the<00:03:14.739> reader<00:03:14.980> will<00:03:15.340> understand<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:17.350> point

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
the reader will understand the point

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.810 
the reader will understand the point
without<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:19.330> extra<00:03:19.840> information<00:03:20.820> however

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
without the extra information however

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.080 
without the extra information however
you<00:03:22.420> want<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.690> add<00:03:22.989> extra<00:03:23.440> information<00:03:24.090> to

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
you want to add extra information to

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.390 
you want to add extra information to
make<00:03:25.239> it<00:03:25.390> more<00:03:25.510> interesting<00:03:25.830> okay<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.890> make<00:03:27.220> it

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
make it more interesting okay to make it

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.360 
make it more interesting okay to make it
more<00:03:27.580> detailed<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.510> for<00:03:29.290> this<00:03:29.590> type<00:03:29.860> of<00:03:29.890> idea

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
more detailed and for this type of idea

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.259 
more detailed and for this type of idea
we<00:03:30.700> have<00:03:31.260> non-defining<00:03:32.260> relative<00:03:32.290> clauses

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
we have non-defining relative clauses

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.949 
we have non-defining relative clauses
okay<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:35.670> then<00:03:36.670> we're<00:03:36.820> going<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.030> take<00:03:37.150> the

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
okay and then we're going to take the

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.300 
okay and then we're going to take the
relative<00:03:38.350> clauses<00:03:38.560> that<00:03:38.739> we've<00:03:38.950> looked<00:03:39.130> at

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
relative clauses that we've looked at

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.759 
relative clauses that we've looked at
and<00:03:39.670> we're<00:03:40.570> going<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.840> see<00:03:41.049> how<00:03:41.079> we<00:03:41.290> use<00:03:41.590> them

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
and we're going to see how we use them

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.699 
and we're going to see how we use them
with<00:03:42.070> prepositions<00:03:42.870> okay<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.320> using

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
with prepositions okay so using

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.520 
with prepositions okay so using
prepositions<00:03:45.459> in<00:03:45.640> relative<00:03:46.480> clauses<00:03:46.720> first

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
prepositions in relative clauses first

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.610 
prepositions in relative clauses first
of<00:03:47.650> all<00:03:47.709> thinking<00:03:48.070> about<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.400> word<00:03:48.579> order<00:03:48.880> and

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
of all thinking about the word order and

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.400 
of all thinking about the word order and
also<00:03:50.620> using<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:51.700> key<00:03:51.970> key<00:03:52.450> preposition<00:03:53.110> the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
also using this key key preposition the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.780 
also using this key key preposition the
word<00:03:53.590> with<00:03:54.100> okay<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:56.200> let's<00:03:57.190> take<00:03:57.400> a<00:03:57.430> look<00:03:57.670> at

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
word with okay so let's take a look at

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.180 
word with okay so let's take a look at
some<00:03:58.000> examples<00:03:58.750> now<00:03:59.170> with<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.590> examples<00:04:00.070> i'm

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
some examples now with the examples i'm

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.940 
some examples now with the examples i'm
going<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.519> give<00:04:00.700> you<00:04:01.079> first<00:04:02.079> of<00:04:02.200> all<00:04:02.380> i'm<00:04:02.590> going

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
going to give you first of all i'm going

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.509 
going to give you first of all i'm going
to<00:04:03.070> give<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.250> two<00:04:04.120> separate<00:04:04.959> sentences<00:04:05.519> okay

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
to give you two separate sentences okay

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.289 
to give you two separate sentences okay
and<00:04:06.870> these<00:04:07.870> two<00:04:08.410> separate<00:04:08.920> sentences<00:04:09.160> will<00:04:10.150> be

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
and these two separate sentences will be

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.140 
and these two separate sentences will be
sentences<00:04:11.140> which<00:04:11.920> give<00:04:12.430> us<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.880> information

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
sentences which give us the information

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.810 
sentences which give us the information
that<00:04:13.720> we<00:04:14.049> want<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.769> reader<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.160> understand

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
that we want the reader to understand

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.229 
that we want the reader to understand
however<00:04:16.750> if<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.950> give<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.250> in<00:04:18.370> two<00:04:18.579> separate

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
however if you give it in two separate

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.680 
however if you give it in two separate
sentences<00:04:19.510> it's<00:04:20.500> probably<00:04:20.859> too<00:04:21.400> simple<00:04:21.940> it's

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
sentences it's probably too simple it's

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.529 
sentences it's probably too simple it's
too<00:04:22.960> easy<00:04:23.039> okay<00:04:24.039> and<00:04:24.250> we're<00:04:24.940> going<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.180> look<00:04:25.390> at

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
too easy okay and we're going to look at

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.260 
too easy okay and we're going to look at
a<00:04:25.780> sentence<00:04:26.740> which<00:04:27.039> brings<00:04:27.640> these<00:04:28.030> two

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
a sentence which brings these two

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.980 
a sentence which brings these two
sentences<00:04:28.600> into<00:04:29.229> one<00:04:29.860> okay<00:04:30.580> so<00:04:31.030> combining<00:04:31.600> the

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
sentences into one okay so combining the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.469 
sentences into one okay so combining the
sentences<00:04:32.560> together<00:04:32.800> using<00:04:33.640> a<00:04:33.940> relative

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
sentences together using a relative

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.900 
sentences together using a relative
Clause<00:04:34.720> first<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.590> all<00:04:35.710> we're<00:04:36.280> going<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.550> look

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
Clause first of all we're going to look

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.089 
Clause first of all we're going to look
at<00:04:37.740> specifically<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.580> structure<00:04:40.180> of

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
at specifically the structure of

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.640 
at specifically the structure of
defining<00:04:42.099> relative<00:04:42.460> clauses<00:04:43.080> okay<00:04:44.080> let's

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
defining relative clauses okay let's

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.230 
defining relative clauses okay let's
take<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.860> look<00:04:45.070> at<00:04:45.220> our<00:04:45.280> first<00:04:45.550> examples<00:04:46.210> now<00:04:48.240> we

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
take a look at our first examples now we

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.630 
take a look at our first examples now we
can<00:04:49.419> take<00:04:50.110> this<00:04:50.320> sentence<00:04:50.800> for<00:04:51.010> example<00:04:51.490> a

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
can take this sentence for example a

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.779 
can take this sentence for example a
certain<00:04:52.360> number<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:52.930> people<00:04:53.530> owned<00:04:53.830> a<00:04:54.280> mobile

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
certain number of people owned a mobile

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.089 
certain number of people owned a mobile
phone<00:04:55.180> okay<00:04:55.840> this<00:04:56.050> sentence<00:04:56.500> doesn't<00:04:56.800> tell<00:04:57.070> us
