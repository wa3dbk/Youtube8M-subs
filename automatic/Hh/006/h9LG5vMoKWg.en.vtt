it<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:05.180> i'm<00:03:05.330> guessing<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.780> white<00:03:06.230> end<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:06.709> the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
it so i'm guessing the white end is the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.290 
it so i'm guessing the white end is the
end<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.190> goes<00:03:07.370> on<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.610> power<00:03:07.820> supply<00:03:08.090> and

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
end that goes on the power supply and

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.460 
end that goes on the power supply and
the<00:03:08.510> other<00:03:08.660> end<00:03:08.870> is<00:03:08.989> e<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.110> that<00:03:09.320> goes

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
the other end is e and that goes

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.280 
the other end is e and that goes
somewhere<00:03:09.680> else<00:03:09.799> oh<00:03:09.950> there's<00:03:10.459> your<00:03:10.610> extra<00:03:10.970> pen

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
somewhere else oh there's your extra pen

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.820 
somewhere else oh there's your extra pen
there's<00:03:12.290> two<00:03:12.680> PCIe<00:03:13.220> there's<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.660> few<00:03:15.410> of<00:03:15.590> three

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
there's two PCIe there's a few of three

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.930 
there's two PCIe there's a few of three
by<00:03:15.950> status<00:03:16.340> look<00:03:16.459> at<00:03:16.580> that<00:03:16.700> they<00:03:16.820> include

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
by status look at that they include

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.960 
by status look at that they include
different<00:03:17.269> lengths<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.080> they<00:03:18.200> even<00:03:18.380> like

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
different lengths and they even like

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.430 
different lengths and they even like
that<00:03:19.970> they<00:03:20.090> even<00:03:20.209> like<00:03:20.480> label<00:03:20.900> them<00:03:21.049> for<00:03:21.290> you

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
that they even like label them for you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.759 
that they even like label them for you
so<00:03:21.650> you've<00:03:21.799> got<00:03:21.830> four<00:03:22.370> or<00:03:22.519> three<00:03:22.670> by<00:03:22.790> status<00:03:23.769> 22

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
so you've got four or three by status 22

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.460 
so you've got four or three by status 22
by<00:03:25.010> mole<00:03:25.310> X's<00:03:25.730> one<00:03:26.090> with<00:03:26.360> an<00:03:26.540> exhilarating<00:03:26.810> and

by mole X's one with an exhilarating and

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.810 
by mole X's one with an exhilarating and
then<00:03:27.590> you've<00:03:27.709> got<00:03:27.739> some<00:03:27.890> cable<00:03:28.400> ties<00:03:28.430> and

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
then you've got some cable ties and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.720 
then you've got some cable ties and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
expected to see black screws although

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.949 
expected to see black screws although
with<00:03:37.430> their<00:03:37.610> cases<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:38.299> if<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:38.480> pair<00:03:38.690> this<00:03:38.810> up

design<00:04:03.799> logo<00:04:04.310> very<00:04:04.579> clean-looking<00:04:04.850> I<00:04:05.299> really

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
design logo very clean-looking I really

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.720 
design logo very clean-looking I really
like<00:04:05.900> their<00:04:06.110> logo<00:04:06.410> it's<00:04:06.590> like<00:04:07.160> I<00:04:07.250> said<00:04:07.459> very

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
like their logo it's like I said very

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.550 
like their logo it's like I said very
clean-looking<00:04:08.000> on<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.780> top<00:04:08.930> again<00:04:09.140> you<00:04:09.380> see<00:04:09.530> a

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
clean-looking on the top again you see a

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.910 
clean-looking on the top again you see a
fractal<00:04:09.920> design<00:04:10.040> logo<00:04:10.540> very<00:04:11.540> stylish<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.260> on

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
fractal design logo very stylish and on

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.320 
fractal design logo very stylish and on
the<00:04:13.070> other<00:04:13.160> side<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.579> see<00:04:13.760> it's<00:04:13.879> capable<00:04:14.270> of

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
the other side you see it's capable of

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.790 
the other side you see it's capable of
riding<00:04:14.569> up<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.810> nine<00:04:15.050> hundred<00:04:15.349> and<00:04:15.379> sixty

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
riding up to nine hundred and sixty

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.279 
riding up to nine hundred and sixty
watts<00:04:16.010> of<00:04:16.250> its<00:04:16.430> total<00:04:16.959> thousand<00:04:17.959> watt<00:04:18.109> output

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
watts of its total thousand watt output

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.819 
watts of its total thousand watt output
on

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
on

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.229 
on
12<00:04:19.069> volt<00:04:19.250> rail<00:04:19.400> so<00:04:19.579> it's<00:04:19.669> a<00:04:19.729> little<00:04:19.879> lower<00:04:20.120> than

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
12 volt rail so it's a little lower than

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.570 
12 volt rail so it's a little lower than
we've<00:04:20.539> seen<00:04:20.569> on<00:04:21.019> some<00:04:21.739> power<00:04:21.949> supplies<00:04:22.370> that

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
we've seen on some power supplies that

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.860 
we've seen on some power supplies that
are<00:04:22.610> capable<00:04:22.849> of<00:04:23.120> almost<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.539> whole<00:04:23.629> thing

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
are capable of almost the whole thing

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.499 
are capable of almost the whole thing
however<00:04:24.259> I<00:04:24.530> can't<00:04:25.099> imagine<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.970> scenario<00:04:26.180> where

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:26.509 
however I can't imagine a scenario where

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.719 
however I can't imagine a scenario where
you<00:04:26.720> would<00:04:26.930> actually<00:04:26.960> need<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.889> draw<00:04:28.490> a

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
you would actually need to draw a

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.850 
you would actually need to draw a
thousand<00:04:29.449> watts<00:04:29.629> from<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.199> 12<00:04:30.439> volt<00:04:30.530> rail

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
thousand watts from the 12 volt rail

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.219 
thousand watts from the 12 volt rail
itself<00:04:31.699> it<00:04:31.939> is<00:04:31.969> a<00:04:32.060> single<00:04:32.449> rail<00:04:32.629> power<00:04:32.900> supply

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
itself it is a single rail power supply

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.390 
itself it is a single rail power supply
so<00:04:33.379> you<00:04:33.439> don't<00:04:33.590> really<00:04:33.650> have<00:04:33.770> to<00:04:33.949> think<00:04:34.099> about

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
so you don't really have to think about

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.119 
so you don't really have to think about
what<00:04:35.000> you're<00:04:35.150> plugging<00:04:35.560> alright<00:04:36.560> so<00:04:36.800> here<00:04:37.039> we

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:37.129 
what you're plugging alright so here we

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.249 
what you're plugging alright so here we
are<00:04:37.250> guys<00:04:37.400> looking<00:04:37.849> at<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.259> permanently

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
are guys looking at the permanently

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.050 
are guys looking at the permanently
attached<00:04:39.560> cable<00:04:39.919> so<00:04:40.039> it's<00:04:40.159> a<00:04:40.219> semi<00:04:40.520> modular

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
attached cable so it's a semi modular

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.360 
attached cable so it's a semi modular
power<00:04:41.210> supply<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:42.139> got<00:04:42.289> a<00:04:42.319> 20<00:04:42.500> +<00:04:42.830> 4<00:04:43.099> pin

all<00:04:48.169> right<00:04:48.729> moving<00:04:49.729> right<00:04:49.849> along<00:04:50.150> we've<00:04:50.780> got

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
all right moving right along we've got

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.550 
all right moving right along we've got
what<00:04:52.430> do<00:04:52.580> we<00:04:52.729> have<00:04:52.849> here<00:04:52.909> okay<00:04:53.900> we've<00:04:54.080> got<00:04:54.259> a<00:04:54.289> 4

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
what do we have here okay we've got a 4

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.740 
what do we have here okay we've got a 4
plus<00:04:54.740> 4<00:04:54.949> pin<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.400> that<00:04:55.729> is<00:04:55.909> a<00:04:55.940> long<00:04:56.270> cable<00:04:56.479> look

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
plus 4 pin and that is a long cable look

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.399 
plus 4 pin and that is a long cable look
at<00:04:56.840> that<00:04:57.430> it's<00:04:58.430> almost<00:04:58.610> one<00:04:59.060> Linus<00:04:59.750> arm<00:05:00.110> length

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
at that it's almost one Linus arm length

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:01.990 
at that it's almost one Linus arm length
long<00:05:00.770> pretty<00:05:01.129> much<00:05:01.310> it<00:05:01.430> is<00:05:01.550> one<00:05:01.789> line<00:05:01.969> a

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
long pretty much it is one line a

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.610 
long pretty much it is one line a
certain<00:05:02.330> length<00:05:02.449> long<00:05:02.690> right<00:05:03.199> to<00:05:03.319> the<00:05:03.409> armpit

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
certain length long right to the armpit

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.230 
certain length long right to the armpit
thing<00:05:03.949> so<00:05:04.400> that<00:05:04.550> should<00:05:04.729> be<00:05:04.759> able<00:05:05.000> to<00:05:05.060> reach

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
thing so that should be able to reach

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.939 
thing so that should be able to reach
pretty<00:05:05.449> much<00:05:05.719> no<00:05:05.900> matter<00:05:06.020> what<00:05:06.440> case<00:05:06.710> you're

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
pretty much no matter what case you're

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:08.950 
pretty much no matter what case you're
using<00:05:07.190> it<00:05:08.030> also<00:05:08.330> comes<00:05:08.509> with<00:05:08.629> two

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
using it also comes with two

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.219 
using it also comes with two
pre-attached<00:05:09.620> 6<00:05:10.400> plus<00:05:10.639> 2<00:05:10.909> plus<00:05:11.300> 6<00:05:11.569> plus<00:05:11.629> 2<00:05:11.990> so

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
pre-attached 6 plus 2 plus 6 plus 2 so

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.830 
pre-attached 6 plus 2 plus 6 plus 2 so
dual<00:05:12.500> 6<00:05:12.889> plus<00:05:13.129> 2<00:05:13.340> connectors<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:14.000> like<00:05:14.599> this

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
dual 6 plus 2 connectors I like this

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.149 
dual 6 plus 2 connectors I like this
design<00:05:15.139> personally<00:05:15.650> it<00:05:15.740> means<00:05:15.889> you<00:05:16.009> don't

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
design personally it means you don't

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.490 
design personally it means you don't
have<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.520> run<00:05:16.729> as<00:05:16.909> many<00:05:17.539> cables<00:05:18.080> up<00:05:18.259> to<00:05:18.379> your

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
have to run as many cables up to your

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.379 
have to run as many cables up to your
graphics<00:05:18.860> card<00:05:18.919> you<00:05:19.159> just<00:05:19.310> run<00:05:19.490> one<00:05:19.819> per

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
graphics card you just run one per

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.059 
graphics card you just run one per
graphics<00:05:20.840> card<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.379> then<00:05:21.529> it<00:05:21.650> splits<00:05:21.919> out

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
graphics card and then it splits out

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.459 
graphics card and then it splits out
from<00:05:22.279> there<00:05:22.490> so<00:05:23.419> those<00:05:23.840> are<00:05:23.870> your<00:05:23.990> included

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 
from there so those are your included

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.649 
from there so those are your included
ones<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:24.919> then<00:05:25.069> optional<00:05:25.940> stuff<00:05:26.180> so<00:05:26.360> you<00:05:26.419> can

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
ones and then optional stuff so you can

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.409 
ones and then optional stuff so you can
attach<00:05:26.960> those<00:05:27.379> additional<00:05:28.099> two<00:05:28.310> PCIe<00:05:28.879> s<00:05:29.150> or

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
attach those additional two PCIe s or

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.200 
attach those additional two PCIe s or
