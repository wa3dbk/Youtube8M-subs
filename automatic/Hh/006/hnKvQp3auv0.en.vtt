Hi I'm Donna Wolfe from naztazia.com Today I'm going to show you how to make infinity

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.480
scarves from t-shirts.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.890
These are easy and fun to do. The first
type of infinity scarf I'll show you is

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.330
one that you just wrap around your neck
once. To do this you'll need a child size

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.880
t-shirt like a small, medium, or large. Cut
the bottom hem off the tee shirt first.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.090
Next make a cut across the shirt right
under the sleeves. Use just this lower

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.629
section of the t-shirt. Open up the
t-shirt and really stretch it. And there

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.129
you have it... easy

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.110
infinity scarf! I like to take a couple
of t-shirts, cut them the same way and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.309
layer them together.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.110
Add a pin for a complete look. If you
like your infinity scarf longer, I'd

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.109
suggest going with a larger size t-shirt -
such as a 5x. And it's the same process -

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.600
start by cutting off the bottom hem.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.100
Sometimes it helps to fold the t-shirt
in half before cutting under the arms to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.350
get a really straight cut. Stretch it out
good and then wrap it twice to wear

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.580
around your neck.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.799
By the way, you can get more information
at my website naztazia.com The next

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.420
scarf I'll show you has a fringe on the
end. You'll start off the same way with

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.850
cutting off the bottom seam - then cutting
across right underneath the sleeve area.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.189
Keep this top section for other t-shirt
video projects of mine. To add fringe at

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.720
the bottom of the scarf,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.150
use your scissors to cut through both
layers of fabric.  You can make small

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.130
fringe or large fringe.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.340
Once completed, stretch each piece of
fringe to lengthen it.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.280
If you want you can add some beads to
the end of your fringe - pony beads work

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.390
great for this. Insert a bead or two - or
three - onto the fringe then tie a knot or

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
two at the end to secure the bead.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.990
Another option is to cut fringe on both
sides of your scarf - the top opening and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.730
the bottom opening. And if you want - you
can add beads to the ends as well.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.900
