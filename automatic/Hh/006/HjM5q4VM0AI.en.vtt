00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.360
 since I have a pool I come 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:11.639
 proposing how to extend your period of 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.709
 use during the year because 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.379
 for many months it is simply 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.810
 an expensive ornament for the garden so my 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.550
 doubt was how can I with a price 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.010
 reasonable to enjoy three more months of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.420
 a pool I finally opted for the pump 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.500
 of heat and I 'll explain to you my 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.240
 experience heat pumps 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.430
 they work like air conditioners 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.199
 take advantage of the physical principles of 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.730
 free giant spending to capture heat 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.730
 from outside and pass it inside 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.899
 in fact the technicians explained in the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.519
 pumps you get to extract the 80 by 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.899
 cent of heat from the air 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.059
 outside while in the 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.440
 electric heaters 100% of the 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.309
 Temperature depends on the supply 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.629
 electrical the result a lot energy 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.030
 cleaner that reduces consumption 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:05.199
 electrical and something very important is is 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.199
 too quiet 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:26.899
 and my experience with the bill 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.270
 electrical responds to what I had 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.100
 planned you can use the pool from 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.130
 May until the end of September and that 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.140
 It costs me on average one euro a day with 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.530
 an electric heater would cost 5 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.530
 more times 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.270
 There are different pumps according to the size of 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.579
 the pool 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.649
 and it is also important to reduce even more 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.320
 consumption covering at night the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.429
 pool in the colder months I 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.130
 I spoke in a store with a seller 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.929
 specialized and he did the calculation me 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.619
 gave all kinds of recommendations and I 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.659
 offered an installation service with this 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.439
 method now the summer feeling we 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.439
 they last much longer
