00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.320
 never compared a car to a superhero 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.250
 they have superpowers but also points 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.760
 weak defects that still make them 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.760
 more real 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.490
 then they try to look normal for 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.910
 go unnoticed but not always there 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.910
 I can 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.780
 for me the m3 has always been the superhero 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.700
 made automobile in almost 30 years has not 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.490
 never lost his powers 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.560
 the motorone in front of the traction behind and 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.840
 that look less extreme than other cars 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.940
 sports that are really only showy 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.190
 the put on in so many years is due 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.530
 evolve adapting to new concepts 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.670
 of sportiness to a different clientele 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.670
 but not only 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.760
 there are many more enemies than the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.650
 time then need new weapons one of 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.220
 these is the 3-liter six-cylinder engine 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.040
 twinpower turbo with 431 horses with one 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.490
 pair of 550 newton meters the first 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.810
 propeller has not expired for the m3 is 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.140
 exaggerated both in the heart but also in the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.330
 look 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.009
 then these of an absurd hostile color 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.750
 to the metallic it is called but look 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.030
 even the muscles the front spoiler 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.590
 the one behind the power don on the bonnet le 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.240
 golden brake calipers and the roof in 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.930
 carbon that arrives for the first time 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.070
 on a m3 sedan impossible to pass 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.660
 unnoticed 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.520
 in fact now campora that who buys it 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.820
 had to prepare for a nice dose of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.460
 sel fi with unknown emeritus inside the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.250
 m3 very sporty but German 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.020
 which means sobriety attention for 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.800
 details like motorcycle sport stitching 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.670
 on the steering wheel carbon everywhere and many 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.670
 many 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.540
 you want another one the best here it is 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.720
 an illuminated m on the backrests 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.720
 front 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.330
 no 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.590
 and then the time comes to throw open the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.900
 gas and it soon becomes clear that the GMO does not 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.820
 I am there at random is that this German does not 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.640
 it's just spoiler talk and badge 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.520
 and that certainly does not want to hide the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.040
 his wings the other weapon so much electronic 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.910
 to be able to use the kitchen as a 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.940
 tailored suit 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.680
 it is enough to intervene on these keys 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.240
 find the ideal adjustments and maybe 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.730
 save your preferences on 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.410
 m1 and m2 steering wheel buttons 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.870
 better than that but for now we are leaving 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.910
 cautious with a configuration is it comes down 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.770
 for the comfort engine for the suspension 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.770
 and more comfort for the steering 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.739
 yes it is true the m3 tameable in 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.110
 past it was not possible to do it until 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.150
 this point if you want it soft le 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.370
 suspensions dampen well despite the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.409
 19-inch wheels that are optional 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.209
 the sound is more gentle as well 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.579
 engine delivery with gearboxes 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.709
 at very low revs while the steering is fine 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.299
 too soft but now we find ourselves 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.579
 in a very green area and with 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.930
 magnificent roads probably this m 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.090
 feels a little far from home 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.930
 so I take this opportunity to do it 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.930
 set a little bit better 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.960
 sport plus sports and sports in practice a 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.690
 mix that on the road makes this m a 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.510
 ground-land missile with that power e 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.190
 especially that couple never everything 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.590
 you have to do a little shake or 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.300
 better the foot is indeed a fury between 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.010
 the curves but sometimes you miss it 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.870
 of that amazing frankness of the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.820
 an old void that was more thirsty 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.780
 of this new twin turbo that wins over 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.150
 consumption 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.430
 the good or bad of this German is 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.440
 that will make you feel sometimes like a 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.660
 super hero because it allows unfair 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.180
 you will really struggle to get off one 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.040
 joust so because because the pleasure of 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.170
 drive a m again passes by a 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.180
 handling that will make driving dirty a 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.040
 game within the reach of many thanks to 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.110
 steering that sport is great and al 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.990
 differential m perfect to handle 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.940
 mister traverse inseparable friend who 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.380
 will oblige you to remain excellent 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.380
 relationships with your trusted tire dealer 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.479
 I chose to try this m3 and also 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.520
 for the structure compared to the m coupe 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.889
 in fact the sedan is slightly less 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.819
 rigid frame more enjoyable on the road 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.460
 in everyday use 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:58.610
 when you ask for double change 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.199
 dkg clutch he will follow you in each 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.740
 of its three adjustment from sporta to 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.740
 confort 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.360
 pity only for these palettes I would have them 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.979
 made a little bit bigger though they are 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.180
 attached to the steering wheel ends follow you 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.699
 always also in the curve 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.490
 the electronics also helps the sound in 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.289
 sport and sport plus the 6 cylinders of the 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.759
 mona returns to sing though 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.430
 personally I would have expected 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:25.659
 something more especially in the return 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.659
 my favorite notes 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.750
 if the half is back absolutely yes but 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.550
 as often happens for a dear friend who 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.320
 you haven't seen for years it took a while 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.480
 more recognize it because despite the 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.670
 incredible performance the adrenaline that 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.120
 transmits is less tied to the past and more 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.960
 to the technology that today is forced 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.330
 builds the DNA of these new ones 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.970
 sportswomen who have more and more anime in 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.980
 one body I don't think I'll be the only one 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.080
 but this m3 sedan I prefer it to 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.090
 m4 coupÃ© primarily for the name 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.550
 the original but also for his 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.440
 proportions and for its philosophy 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.150
 the previous four- door m3 indeed 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.920
 they have always had a charisma 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.170
 particular and if you had to choose between 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.480
 coupe sedans today I would take this one 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.680
 maybe in the yas navy blue coloring 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.450
 with manual gearbox 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.040
 then it also costs less than the m4 only 70 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.570
 6,750 euros with the most practicality 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.220
 of the two rear doors 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.020
 and if you make stories at home you can 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.420
 always pass it off as a family car 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.650
 to mask what can make 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.650
 like his powers only
