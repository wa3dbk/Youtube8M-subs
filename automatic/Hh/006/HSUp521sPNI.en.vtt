00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
I've heard of long tones and I did them

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.140 
I've heard of long tones and I did them
for<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.980> while<00:00:37.160> but<00:00:37.220> I<00:00:37.430> found<00:00:37.670> them<00:00:37.880> really

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
for a while but I found them really

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.410 
for a while but I found them really
boring<00:00:38.590> so<00:00:39.590> I'd<00:00:40.040> like<00:00:40.400> to<00:00:40.460> present<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:41.090> idea

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
boring so I'd like to present the idea

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.080 
boring so I'd like to present the idea
of<00:00:41.540> changing<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.079> idea<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.710> long<00:00:43.520> tones<00:00:43.850> the

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
of changing the idea of long tones the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.940 
of changing the idea of long tones the
actual<00:00:44.510> words<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:45.380> pure<00:00:45.860> tone<00:00:46.840> pure<00:00:47.840> tone<00:00:48.140> is<00:00:48.890> a

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
actual words to pure tone pure tone is a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.180 
actual words to pure tone pure tone is a
tone<00:00:49.310> that<00:00:49.520> isn't<00:00:49.910> rough<00:00:50.120> isn't<00:00:50.570> Airy<00:00:51.190> doesn't

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
tone that isn't rough isn't Airy doesn't

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.810 
tone that isn't rough isn't Airy doesn't
have<00:00:52.310> blurry<00:00:52.730> edges<00:00:54.130> one<00:00:55.130> of<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.340> things<00:00:55.640> that

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
have blurry edges one of the things that

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.580 
have blurry edges one of the things that
happens<00:00:56.239> when<00:00:56.420> someone<00:00:56.450> has<00:00:57.020> only<00:00:57.380> learned

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
happens when someone has only learned

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.130 
happens when someone has only learned
flute<00:00:57.920> in<00:00:58.160> band<00:00:58.489> or<00:00:58.820> has<00:00:59.540> self-taught

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
themselves over a number of years when

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.919 
themselves over a number of years when
they<00:01:02.809> don't<00:01:03.170> have<00:01:03.500> good<00:01:03.890> clear<00:01:04.519> tone<00:01:04.969> they

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:05.929 
they don't have good clear tone they

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.230 
they don't have good clear tone they
don't<00:01:06.229> notice<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:06.889> they<00:01:07.490> may<00:01:07.670> notice<00:01:07.939> it

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
don't notice it they may notice it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.569 
don't notice it they may notice it
eventually<00:01:08.869> but<00:01:09.679> because<00:01:10.039> so<00:01:10.340> many<00:01:10.460> people

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
eventually but because so many people

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.120 
eventually but because so many people
sitting<00:01:11.240> around<00:01:11.329> them<00:01:11.689> in<00:01:11.780> band<00:01:12.049> have<00:01:12.679> a<00:01:12.710> tone

sitting around them in band have a tone

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.289 
sitting around them in band have a tone
that<00:01:13.159> sounds<00:01:13.639> like<00:01:13.759> this<00:01:18.490> they<00:01:19.490> actually<00:01:20.090> are

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
that sounds like this they actually are

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.480 
that sounds like this they actually are
used<00:01:20.569> to<00:01:20.780> that<00:01:20.899> tone<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:21.530> they<00:01:22.039> don't<00:01:22.249> see

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
used to that tone and they don't see

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.940 
used to that tone and they don't see
anything<00:01:22.700> wrong<00:01:23.090> with<00:01:23.329> it<00:01:23.359> I've<00:01:24.289> even<00:01:24.709> seen

find<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.670> long<00:02:14.850> tones<00:02:15.210> look<00:02:15.570> really<00:02:16.020> boring

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
find the long tones look really boring

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.910 
find the long tones look really boring
on<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.800> page<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.540> they<00:02:18.540> just<00:02:19.080> come<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.710> say

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
on the page and they just come in I say

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.170 
on the page and they just come in I say
well<00:02:20.100> have<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.340> done<00:02:20.490> your<00:02:20.640> long<00:02:20.760> tones<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
well have you done your long tones and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.440 
well have you done your long tones and
they<00:02:21.300> say<00:02:21.510> yeah<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.370> say<00:02:23.580> okay<00:02:23.910> start<00:02:24.300> on

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
they say yeah and I say okay start on

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.620 
they say yeah and I say okay start on
low<00:02:24.690> B<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.380> let's<00:02:25.680> go<00:02:25.860> down<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.250> low<00:02:26.490> C<00:02:26.850> and

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
low B and let's go down to low C and

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:39.380 
low B and let's go down to low C and
they<00:02:27.990> go<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:38.430> they're<00:02:38.610> still<00:02:38.850> using

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
they go like this so they're still using

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.199 
they go like this so they're still using
the<00:02:39.510> very<00:02:39.750> Airy<00:02:40.050> breathy<00:02:40.650> tone<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.340> they

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
the very Airy breathy tone and they

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.510 
the very Airy breathy tone and they
haven't<00:02:42.510> quite<00:02:42.840> tweaked<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.739> idea<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.280> a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
haven't quite tweaked that the idea is a

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.590 
haven't quite tweaked that the idea is a
pure<00:02:45.180> tone<00:02:46.100> instead<00:02:47.100> they're<00:02:47.880> just<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.270> bored

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
pure tone instead they're just so bored

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.840 
pure tone instead they're just so bored
they<00:02:48.930> just<00:02:49.170> whip<00:02:49.440> through<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.860> exercise<00:02:50.430> just

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
they just whip through the exercise just

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.400 
they just whip through the exercise just
because<00:02:51.180> I'm<00:02:51.330> telling<00:02:51.570> them<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.870> do<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.230> but

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
because I'm telling them to do it but

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.690 
because I'm telling them to do it but
they<00:02:52.560> don't<00:02:52.800> really<00:02:52.950> hear<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.670> difference<00:02:54.560> so

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
they don't really hear the difference so

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.530 
they don't really hear the difference so
how<00:02:56.700> do<00:02:56.760> we<00:02:57.180> get<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.080> information<00:02:58.350> across

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
how do we get this information across

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.960 
how do we get this information across
what<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:01.110> pure<00:03:01.500> tone<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.160> how<00:03:02.430> do<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.670> do<00:03:02.820> it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
what is a pure tone and how do you do it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.449 
what is a pure tone and how do you do it
and<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.209> course<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.690> would<00:03:03.900> take<00:03:04.200> 20<00:03:05.100> videos

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
and of course this would take 20 videos

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.280 
and of course this would take 20 videos
if<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.880> was<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.180> cover<00:03:06.420> every<00:03:06.810> single<00:03:06.959> topic

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
if I was to cover every single topic

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.350 
if I was to cover every single topic
which<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.800> why<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.130> need<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.820> listen<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.180> your

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
which is why you need to listen to your

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.900 
which is why you need to listen to your
own<00:03:09.390> teacher<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.920> ask<00:03:11.250> questions<00:03:11.790> of

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
own teacher and really ask questions of

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.430 
own teacher and really ask questions of
your<00:03:12.030> own<00:03:12.180> teacher<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.840> get<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.050> live

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
your own teacher and get a live

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.600 
your own teacher and get a live
demonstration

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
demonstration

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.240 
demonstration
and<00:03:14.910> it's<00:03:15.390> especially<00:03:15.720> much<00:03:16.470> easier<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.070> get

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
and it's especially much easier to get

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.000 
and it's especially much easier to get
it<00:03:17.459> if<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.450> your<00:03:18.660> teacher<00:03:18.989> play<00:03:19.440> back<00:03:19.739> and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
it if you and your teacher play back and

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.660 
it if you and your teacher play back and
forth<00:03:20.640> back<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.570> forth<00:03:21.690> until<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.620> hear<00:03:23.370> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
forth back and forth until you hear the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.390 
forth back and forth until you hear the
difference<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.239> their<00:03:24.450> tone<00:03:24.980> one<00:03:25.980> of<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.190> cup

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
difference in their tone one of the cup

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.550 
difference in their tone one of the cup
most<00:03:26.700> common<00:03:27.150> mistakes<00:03:27.570> is<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.080> person

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
most common mistakes is the person

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.880 
most common mistakes is the person
playing<00:03:28.770> that<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.820> long<00:03:30.090> tones<00:03:30.560> really<00:03:31.560> short

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
playing that the long tones really short

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.730 
playing that the long tones really short
and<00:03:32.130> really<00:03:32.220> harsh<00:03:32.940> like<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:33.390> just

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
and really harsh like I just

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:41.260 
and really harsh like I just
demonstrated<00:03:39.280> they<00:03:40.280> just<00:03:40.550> don't<00:03:40.790> get<00:03:41.000> that

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
demonstrated they just don't get that

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.720 
demonstrated they just don't get that
the<00:03:41.390> point<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.230> have<00:03:42.410> an<00:03:42.590> improved<00:03:43.040> tone

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
the point is to have an improved tone

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.360 
the point is to have an improved tone
every<00:03:44.240> time<00:03:44.420> they<00:03:44.600> play<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.110> to<00:03:45.380> make<00:03:45.950> sure

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
every time they play and to make sure

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.030 
every time they play and to make sure
that<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.760> tone<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.150> improving<00:03:48.040> another

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
that the tone is improving another

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.790 
that the tone is improving another
really<00:03:49.430> common<00:03:49.700> problem<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.930> seems<00:03:51.320> for<00:03:51.560> about

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
really common problem it seems for about

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.150 
really common problem it seems for about
a<00:03:51.830> third<00:03:52.190> of<00:03:52.370> people<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.180> word<00:03:53.420> long<00:03:54.160> stops

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
a third of people is the word long stops

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.790 
a third of people is the word long stops
them<00:03:55.490> and<00:03:55.640> stops<00:03:56.540> them<00:03:56.810> from<00:03:56.840> interpreting

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
them and stops them from interpreting

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.520 
them and stops them from interpreting
the<00:03:58.130> exercise<00:03:58.670> correctly<00:03:58.940> they<00:03:59.600> think<00:04:00.170> that

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
the exercise correctly they think that

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.300 
the exercise correctly they think that
long<00:04:00.970> means<00:04:01.970> hold<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.900> note<00:04:03.170> as<00:04:03.470> long<00:04:03.920> as

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
long means hold the note as long as

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.640 
long means hold the note as long as
possible<00:04:04.640> so<00:04:05.420> what<00:04:05.570> they<00:04:05.750> actually<00:04:05.900> do<00:04:06.410> is

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
possible so what they actually do is

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.800 
possible so what they actually do is
they<00:04:07.130> play<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:08.000> note<00:04:08.180> until<00:04:08.480> they're

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
they play the note until they're

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.140 
they play the note until they're
completely<00:04:09.020> out<00:04:09.740> of<00:04:09.770> air<00:04:10.130> and<00:04:10.400> this<00:04:10.670> creates

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
completely out of air and this creates

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.860 
completely out of air and this creates
tension<00:04:11.920> collapse<00:04:12.920> of<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.640> air<00:04:13.910> breathing

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
tension collapse of the air breathing

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.140 
tension collapse of the air breathing
mechanism<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.680> for<00:04:16.310> many<00:04:16.459> people<00:04:16.850> throat

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
mechanism and for many people throat

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.510 
mechanism and for many people throat
tension<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.930> mouth<00:04:18.530> tension<00:04:19.100> and<00:04:19.280> jaw

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
tension and mouth tension and jaw

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.090 
tension and mouth tension and jaw
tension<00:04:19.820> so<00:04:20.390> they're<00:04:20.540> trying<00:04:21.170> to<00:04:21.560> hold<00:04:21.830> the

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
tension so they're trying to hold the

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:44.820 
tension so they're trying to hold the
note<00:04:22.280> impossibly<00:04:23.270> long<00:04:23.600> they<00:04:24.020> go<00:04:24.140> like<00:04:24.320> this

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.249 

it's<00:04:45.830> not<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.430> contest<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.360> see<00:04:47.569> who<00:04:47.840> can<00:04:48.050> hold

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
it's not a contest to see who can hold

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.920 
it's not a contest to see who can hold
the<00:04:48.410> note<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.710> longest<00:04:49.539> okay<00:04:50.539> so<00:04:50.599> those<00:04:50.870> are

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
the note the longest okay so those are

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.350 
the note the longest okay so those are
two<00:04:51.319> common<00:04:52.000> misrepresentations<00:04:53.000> of<00:04:53.120> what<00:04:53.330> a

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
two common misrepresentations of what a

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.790 
two common misrepresentations of what a
long<00:04:53.630> tone<00:04:53.900> is<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:55.430> third<00:04:56.150> mistake<00:04:56.569> is<00:04:57.110> that

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
long tone is the third mistake is that

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.110 
long tone is the third mistake is that
people<00:04:57.860> only<00:04:58.580> go<00:04:58.970> for<00:04:59.360> about<00:04:59.389> oh<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.590> don't<00:05:00.740> know

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
people only go for about oh I don't know

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.900 
people only go for about oh I don't know
40<00:05:02.120> seconds<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:03.229> then<00:05:03.949> they<00:05:04.130> get<00:05:04.310> bored<00:05:04.639> and

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
40 seconds and then they get bored and

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.240 
40 seconds and then they get bored and
they<00:05:05.330> go<00:05:05.509> back<00:05:05.750> to<00:05:05.990> playing<00:05:06.259> their<00:05:06.620> pieces<00:05:06.860> or

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
they go back to playing their pieces or

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.400 
they go back to playing their pieces or
their<00:05:07.460> studies<00:05:07.849> or<00:05:08.150> their<00:05:08.360> duets<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:09.050> they

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
their studies or their duets and they

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.710 
their studies or their duets and they

improvement has been heard so I'd like
to<00:05:15.169> just<00:05:15.530> show<00:05:16.389> what<00:05:17.389> a<00:05:17.570> real<00:05:17.900> long<00:05:18.199> time<00:05:18.500> I

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
to just show what a real long time I

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.339 
to just show what a real long time I
haven't<00:05:19.099> warmed<00:05:19.280> up<00:05:19.460> yet<00:05:19.699> today<00:05:20.060> so<00:05:20.900> what<00:05:21.320> a

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
haven't warmed up yet today so what a

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.650 
haven't warmed up yet today so what a
real<00:05:21.740> long<00:05:22.039> tone<00:05:22.400> sounds<00:05:23.000> like<00:05:23.240> when<00:05:23.509> it's

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
real long tone sounds like when it's

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.589 
real long tone sounds like when it's
improving<00:05:24.139> the<00:05:25.009> instructions<00:05:25.759> say<00:05:26.060> and<00:05:26.389> this

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
improving the instructions say and this

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.200 
improving the instructions say and this
is<00:05:26.780> from<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.080> Trevor<00:05:27.320> white<00:05:27.590> tone<00:05:27.919> book<00:05:28.220> that

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
is from the Trevor white tone book that

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.810 
is from the Trevor white tone book that
if<00:05:29.479> it<00:05:29.630> takes<00:05:29.870> you<00:05:30.110> 15<00:05:30.440> minutes<00:05:31.039> to<00:05:31.400> get<00:05:31.639> the

if it takes you 15 minutes to get the

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.480 
if it takes you 15 minutes to get the
most<00:05:32.030> glorious<00:05:32.690> be<00:05:33.380> natural<00:05:34.009> you've<00:05:34.190> ever

played in your life that's correct

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.589 
played in your life that's correct
so<00:05:38.870> you<00:05:39.650> don't<00:05:39.860> just<00:05:40.159> play<00:05:40.400> a<00:05:40.520> series<00:05:41.150> of<00:05:41.180> short

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
note so when I teach this we work a long

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.810 
note so when I teach this we work a long
time<00:06:11.360> on<00:06:11.719> getting<00:06:12.020> a<00:06:12.320> beautiful<00:06:12.710> B<00:06:13.280> natural

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
time on getting a beautiful B natural

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.890 
time on getting a beautiful B natural
and<00:06:14.270> I'll<00:06:14.389> cover<00:06:14.630> that<00:06:14.780> in<00:06:14.960> future<00:06:15.620> blog<00:06:15.979> posts

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
and I'll cover that in future blog posts

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.430 
and I'll cover that in future blog posts
one<00:06:17.900> more<00:06:18.139> point<00:06:18.380> before<00:06:18.650> I<00:06:18.889> go<00:06:19.280> I<00:06:20.229> once<00:06:21.229> had<00:06:21.380> a

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
one more point before I go I once had a

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.310 
one more point before I go I once had a
student<00:06:21.560> who<00:06:22.219> held<00:06:22.909> their<00:06:23.240> flute<00:06:23.539> down<00:06:23.990> at<00:06:24.229> an

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
student who held their flute down at an

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.800 
student who held their flute down at an
angle<00:06:24.820> whereas<00:06:25.820> they<00:06:26.060> held<00:06:26.330> their<00:06:26.539> flutes

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
angle whereas they held their flutes

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.310 
angle whereas they held their flutes
their<00:06:27.590> head<00:06:27.800> straight<00:06:28.280> and<00:06:28.840> when<00:06:29.840> they<00:06:30.050> play

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
their head straight and when they play

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.469 
their head straight and when they play
to<00:06:30.380> be<00:06:30.680> natural<00:06:31.250> they<00:06:31.460> could<00:06:31.820> not<00:06:32.060> get<00:06:32.330> it<00:06:32.449> to

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
to be natural they could not get it to

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:37.710 
to be natural they could not get it to
improve

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.320 

standing<00:06:38.230> across<00:06:38.650> from<00:06:38.770> them<00:06:39.250> I<00:06:39.520> could<00:06:40.030> see

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
standing across from them I could see

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.300 
standing across from them I could see
that<00:06:40.660> the<00:06:40.810> problem<00:06:41.260> was<00:06:41.470> is<00:06:41.740> that<00:06:41.920> their<00:06:42.130> mouth

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
that the problem was is that their mouth

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.720 
that the problem was is that their mouth
wasn't<00:06:43.000> actually<00:06:43.930> lined<00:06:44.410> up<00:06:44.620> with<00:06:45.220> the

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
wasn't actually lined up with the

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.670 
wasn't actually lined up with the
splitting<00:06:46.330> edge<00:06:46.600> in<00:06:46.870> the<00:06:47.050> middle<00:06:47.200> of<00:06:47.530> the

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
splitting edge in the middle of the

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:56.710 
splitting edge in the middle of the
flute

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.480 

so<00:06:57.720> the<00:06:57.870> very<00:06:58.140> first<00:06:58.500> step<00:06:58.710> for<00:06:59.130> a<00:06:59.190> lot<00:06:59.460> of

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
so the very first step for a lot of

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:16.390 
so the very first step for a lot of
people<00:07:00.030> is<00:07:00.240> looking<00:07:01.080> in<00:07:01.290> the<00:07:01.440> mirror

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.970 

so<00:07:17.400> that<00:07:17.610> they<00:07:17.910> can<00:07:18.510> be<00:07:18.660> taking<00:07:19.200> advantage<00:07:19.770> of

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980 
so that they can be taking advantage of

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.370 
so that they can be taking advantage of
the<00:07:20.250> fact<00:07:20.460> that<00:07:20.700> the<00:07:20.880> best<00:07:21.090> tone<00:07:21.510> comes<00:07:22.050> from

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 
the fact that the best tone comes from

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.620 
the fact that the best tone comes from
when<00:07:22.530> the<00:07:22.650> Airstream<00:07:23.340> goes<00:07:23.790> to<00:07:24.030> the<00:07:24.150> exact

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
when the Airstream goes to the exact

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.340 
when the Airstream goes to the exact
middle<00:07:24.990> of<00:07:25.190> the<00:07:26.190> far<00:07:26.490> splitting<00:07:27.030> edge<00:07:27.389> of<00:07:27.750> the
