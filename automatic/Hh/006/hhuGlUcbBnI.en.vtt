 to internet from our samsung galaxy s 4 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.210
 this can be very useful if we 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.000
 we found in a place where we do not have 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.310

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.310
 for this we go to applications 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.800
 settings 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.730

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.050
