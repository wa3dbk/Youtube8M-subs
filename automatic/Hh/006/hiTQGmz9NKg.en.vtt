now not writable today our dock is
covered<00:01:27.740> with<00:01:27.770> ice<00:01:28.570> so<00:01:29.570> we're<00:01:30.080> not<00:01:30.200> able<00:01:30.380> to

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
covered with ice so we're not able to

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.590 
covered with ice so we're not able to
write<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.040> we<00:01:31.160> can<00:01:31.340> fire<00:01:31.580> it<00:01:31.610> up<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.030> it's

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
write it we can fire it up and it's

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.490 
write it we can fire it up and it's
running<00:01:32.810> great<00:01:33.050> all<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.920> electrics<00:01:34.250> working

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.870 

we're<00:01:39.500> ready<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.740> rock<00:01:39.980> here's<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.520> Pingle

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
we're ready to rock here's the Pingle

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.970 
we're ready to rock here's the Pingle
fuel<00:01:41.120> valve<00:01:41.390> one<00:01:42.230> of<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.410> neat<00:01:42.590> things<00:01:42.620> about

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
fuel valve one of the neat things about

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.010 
fuel valve one of the neat things about
the<00:01:43.190> Pingle<00:01:43.520> fuel<00:01:43.730> valve<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.210> that<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.600> this

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
the Pingle fuel valve is that that this

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.870 
the Pingle fuel valve is that that this
valve<00:01:45.260> flows<00:01:45.620> three<00:01:45.950> times<00:01:46.160> as<00:01:46.370> much<00:01:46.520> fuel<00:01:46.790> as

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
valve flows three times as much fuel as

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.330 
valve flows three times as much fuel as
the<00:01:47.210> normal<00:01:47.540> valve<00:01:47.750> does<00:01:48.080> its<00:01:48.110> in<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.190> on

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
the normal valve does its in the on

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.870 
the normal valve does its in the on
position<00:01:49.370> right<00:01:50.090> now<00:01:50.770> that's<00:01:51.770> reserved<00:01:52.490> and

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
position right now that's reserved and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.800 
position right now that's reserved and
that's<00:01:53.840> off<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.340> we<00:01:55.850> deliberately<00:01:56.300> set<00:01:56.690> it

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
that's off and we deliberately set it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.870 
that's off and we deliberately set it
that<00:01:56.960> way<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.560> when<00:01:58.160> you<00:01:58.280> turn<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.520> valve

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
that way so that when you turn the valve

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.720 
that way so that when you turn the valve
off<00:01:59.830> if<00:02:00.830> somebody's<00:02:01.220> going<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.400> steal<00:02:01.610> your

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
off if somebody's going to steal your

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.190 
off if somebody's going to steal your
bike<00:02:01.940> they<00:02:02.150> can't<00:02:02.450> see<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.990> there's<00:02:03.140> a

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
bike they can't see that there's a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.710 
bike they can't see that there's a
handle<00:02:03.650> that<00:02:03.800> they<00:02:03.890> have<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.220> turn<00:02:04.460> like<00:02:05.450> this

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
handle that they have to turn like this

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.260 
handle that they have to turn like this
to<00:02:06.200> make<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.470> bike<00:02:06.620> go<00:02:06.830> so<00:02:07.550> they<00:02:07.820> may<00:02:08.000> be<00:02:08.060> able

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
to make the bike go so they may be able

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.570 
to make the bike go so they may be able
to<00:02:08.540> jump<00:02:08.960> on<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.230> and<00:02:09.350> hop<00:02:09.710> on<00:02:09.740> it<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.220> get<00:02:10.550> a

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
to jump on it and hop on it and get a

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.830 
to jump on it and hop on it and get a
few<00:02:10.730> miles<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.210> they're<00:02:11.300> not<00:02:11.390> going<00:02:11.630> very<00:02:11.660> far

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
few miles but they're not going very far

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.130 
few miles but they're not going very far
with<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.310> we<00:02:13.310> love<00:02:13.640> in<00:02:13.940> line<00:02:14.240> gas<00:02:14.540> filters<00:02:14.960> so

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
with it we love in line gas filters so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.480 
with it we love in line gas filters so
you<00:02:15.230> can<00:02:15.350> keep<00:02:15.470> an<00:02:15.590> eye<00:02:15.710> on<00:02:15.770> what's<00:02:16.070> going<00:02:16.340> on

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
you can keep an eye on what's going on

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.840 
you can keep an eye on what's going on
and<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.890> know<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.130> rest<00:02:19.160> of<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.490> bike<00:02:19.640> is

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
and you know the rest of the bike is

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.400 
and you know the rest of the bike is
just<00:02:21.310> as<00:02:22.310> perfect<00:02:22.940> as<00:02:23.209> we<00:02:23.330> can<00:02:23.480> get<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.780> the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
just as perfect as we can get it the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.400 
just as perfect as we can get it the
colors<00:02:24.740> are<00:02:24.920> better<00:02:25.160> than<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.459> original<00:02:25.520> and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
colors are better than the original and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.580 
colors are better than the original and
we<00:02:27.410> took<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.800> stock<00:02:28.190> shocks<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:30.230> wash

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
we took the stock shocks and we wash

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.580 
we took the stock shocks and we wash
them<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:30.920> acid<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.610> then<00:02:32.270> polish<00:02:32.720> them<00:02:32.959> so

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
them in acid and then polish them so

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.820 
them in acid and then polish them so
that<00:02:33.620> they<00:02:33.830> would<00:02:33.950> look<00:02:34.100> good<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.680> polish<00:02:36.680> the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
that they would look good and polish the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.730 
that they would look good and polish the
footrest<00:02:39.830> carrier

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.090 

around<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.860> back<00:02:47.300> let's<00:02:48.300> see<00:02:48.540> oh<00:02:48.750> we<00:02:49.740> painted

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
around the back let's see oh we painted

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.790 
around the back let's see oh we painted
the<00:02:50.130> rear<00:02:50.370> caliper<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.600> we<00:02:51.930> pay<00:02:52.110> they're<00:02:52.680> not

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
the rear caliper so we pay they're not

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.410 
the rear caliper so we pay they're not
normally<00:02:53.190> gloss<00:02:53.430> black<00:02:53.700> but<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> rest<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.330> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
normally gloss black but the rest of the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.040 
normally gloss black but the rest of the
frame<00:02:54.660> was<00:02:54.810> gloss<00:02:55.080> black<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:55.620> we<00:02:55.740> thought<00:02:55.860> the
