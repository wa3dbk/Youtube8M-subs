old winner booth yep yes so you're
launching<00:00:07.200> 64-bit<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.189> real<00:00:08.400> yeah<00:00:08.820> so

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
launching 64-bit this is real yeah so

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.879 
launching 64-bit this is real yeah so
we've<00:00:09.450> talked<00:00:09.660> about<00:00:09.750> 64-bit<00:00:10.469> for<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> while

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
we've talked about 64-bit for a while

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.110 
we've talked about 64-bit for a while
but<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.400> actually<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.759> first<00:00:11.880> time

we<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.880> promote<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:28.279> 64-bit

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
we are going to promote in a 64-bit

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.830 
we are going to promote in a 64-bit
system<00:00:29.960> because<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.880> market<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> nice

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
system because on the market is a nice

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.260 
system because on the market is a nice
miss<00:00:34.200> because<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> performance<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:36.059> much

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
miss because of the performance is much

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.530 
miss because of the performance is much
more<00:00:36.540> higher<00:00:36.750> comparing<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.129> 33<00:00:38.610> 32<00:00:39.210> pitch

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
more higher comparing with a 33 32 pitch

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.250 
more higher comparing with a 33 32 pitch
so<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:41.629> did<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.719> announce<00:00:42.899> all<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
details about the cores and which chord

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.310 
details about the cores and which chord
is<00:00:46.320> ten<00:00:47.160> scores<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> fifty<00:00:48.450> threes<00:00:48.750> so

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
is ten scores for for a fifty threes so

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.450 
is ten scores for for a fifty threes so
we're<00:00:49.469> looking<00:00:49.680> at<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> positioning<00:00:50.430> of

this we're looking at this is like the
most<00:00:52.800> cost-effective<00:00:53.789> entry-level<00:00:54.649> 64-bit

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
most cost-effective entry-level 64-bit

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.840 
most cost-effective entry-level 64-bit
solution<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> market<00:00:56.489> right<00:00:56.520> now

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.680 
yeah okay - Kay
a<00:02:17.510> 64<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.630> also<00:02:18.900> impressive<00:02:19.170> because<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.829> got

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
a 64 is also impressive because you got

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.500 
a 64 is also impressive because you got
h.265<00:02:21.750> hardware<00:02:22.260> decoding<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.730> gets<00:02:24.150> 4k

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
h.265 hardware decoding so it gets 4k

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.880 
h.265 hardware decoding so it gets 4k
decoding<00:02:24.900> but<00:02:24.959> for<00:02:25.110> something<00:02:25.260> like<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> tablet

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
decoding but for something like a tablet

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.770 
decoding but for something like a tablet
you're<00:02:26.160> probably<00:02:26.400> not<00:02:26.610> going<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:26.910> decoding

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
you're probably not going to be decoding

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.199 
you're probably not going to be decoding
4k<00:02:28.170> 4k<00:02:28.799> videos<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.459> screen<00:02:29.819> right<00:02:30.000> so

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
4k 4k videos on that screen right so

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.850 
4k 4k videos on that screen right so
what<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.450> actually<00:02:30.599> helps<00:02:30.989> us<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.680> know<00:02:31.769> if

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
what it actually helps us you know if

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.949 
what it actually helps us you know if
you<00:02:31.980> if<00:02:32.010> you're<00:02:32.519> downloading<00:02:33.269> streaming

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
you if you're downloading streaming

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.270 
you if you're downloading streaming
videos<00:02:34.230> from<00:02:34.379> Netflix<00:02:34.799> that<00:02:34.829> are<00:02:34.980> encoded

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
videos from Netflix that are encoded

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.550 
videos from Netflix that are encoded
h.265<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.269> tab<00:02:36.450> will<00:02:36.569> actually<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.470> know

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
h.265 this tab will actually you know

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.319 
h.265 this tab will actually you know
it'll<00:02:38.280> have<00:02:38.489> lower<00:02:38.700> power<00:02:38.940> consumption

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
it'll have lower power consumption

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.319 
it'll have lower power consumption
win-win<00:02:39.989> streaming<00:02:40.319> h.265<00:02:40.920> an<00:02:41.069> HDMI<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.970> 4k

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
win-win streaming h.265 an HDMI is 4k

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.890 
win-win streaming h.265 an HDMI is 4k
yeah<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:44.069> if<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.609> 4k<00:02:44.940> TV<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.389> cannot<00:02:45.630> put

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
yeah so if you have 4k TV you cannot put

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.190 
yeah so if you have 4k TV you cannot put
them<00:02:46.019> 4k<00:02:46.410> TV

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
them 4k TV

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.870 
them 4k TV
all<00:02:48.680> right<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.720> right<00:02:50.720> here<00:02:51.370> real<00:02:52.630> 64<00:02:53.630> bits
