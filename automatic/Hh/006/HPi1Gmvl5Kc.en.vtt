best<00:01:52.200> hopefully<00:01:53.009> I'll<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.250> more<00:01:53.310> time<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
best hopefully I'll have more time to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.100 
best hopefully I'll have more time to
burn<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.090> cuz<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.420> me<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.689> mash<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:54.960> got

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
burn it cuz like me and mash we got

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.660 
burn it cuz like me and mash we got
triple<00:01:55.380> kills<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.680> stuff<00:01:55.860> against<00:01:56.130> teams<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
triple kills and stuff against teams and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.219 
triple kills and stuff against teams and
it's<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.240> fun<00:01:57.509> having<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.110> much

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it's just really fun having so much

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.560 
it's just really fun having so much
mobility<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.920> think<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.700> biggest<00:01:59.939> troll<00:02:00.390> on

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
mobility I think the biggest troll on

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.429 
mobility I think the biggest troll on
our<00:02:00.719> team<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.320> probably<00:02:01.860> Chris<00:02:02.420> yeah<00:02:03.420> chris<00:02:04.409> is

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
our team is probably Chris yeah chris is

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.840 
our team is probably Chris yeah chris is
definitely<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.040> biggest<00:02:05.130> role<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.670> team

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
definitely the biggest role on the team

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.700 
definitely the biggest role on the team
I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.659> mash<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> biggest<00:02:07.469> troll

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
I think mash is the biggest troll

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.870 
I think mash is the biggest troll
impaler's<00:02:08.459> probably<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.849> biggest<00:02:09.000> rolling

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
impaler's probably the biggest rolling

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.470 
impaler's probably the biggest rolling

a fan of his I've watched a lot of his
replays<00:03:00.190> in<00:03:00.370> Korea<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.880> then<00:03:01.720> c9<00:03:02.230> because

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
replays in Korea and then c9 because

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.350 
replays in Korea and then c9 because
they're<00:03:02.860> strategically<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.490> best<00:03:03.670> team<00:03:03.880> i'm

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
they're strategically the best team i'm

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.620 
they're strategically the best team i'm
looking<00:03:04.780> forward<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.080> play<00:03:05.230> teammate<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.830> think

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
looking forward to play teammate I think

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.540 
looking forward to play teammate I think
TSM<00:03:07.630> would<00:03:07.840> be<00:03:07.960> a<00:03:08.040> strong<00:03:09.040> team<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.430> play

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
TSM would be a strong team to play

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.060 
TSM would be a strong team to play
against<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.350> teammate<00:03:11.350> would<00:03:11.530> be<00:03:11.650> pretty<00:03:11.860> fun

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
against and teammate would be pretty fun

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.620 
against and teammate would be pretty fun
to<00:03:12.190> play

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.160 

I<00:03:19.910> think<00:03:20.910> we're<00:03:21.030> gonna<00:03:21.120> win<00:03:21.570> two<00:03:21.810> best<00:03:22.020> of

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
I think we're gonna win two best of

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.070 
I think we're gonna win two best of
fives<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:23.040> qualify<00:03:23.460> on<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.390> scale<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.720> 1<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.050> 10

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
fives and qualify on a scale of 1 to 10

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.260 
fives and qualify on a scale of 1 to 10
I<00:03:25.500> would<00:03:25.590> say<00:03:25.860> we're<00:03:26.070> like<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.430> 9<00:03:26.670> out<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:26.880> 10<00:03:27.060> I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
I would say we're like a 9 out of 10 I

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.730 
I would say we're like a 9 out of 10 I
think<00:03:27.510> everybody<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:27.960> the<00:03:28.050> team<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.350> confident

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
think everybody on the team is confident

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.070 
think everybody on the team is confident
but<00:03:29.240> anything<00:03:30.240> can<00:03:30.330> happen<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.690> tournaments

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
but anything can happen in tournaments

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.950 
but anything can happen in tournaments
like<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.470> if<00:03:31.890> we<00:03:32.100> play<00:03:32.340> at<00:03:32.760> our<00:03:33.000> best<00:03:33.240> I<00:03:33.600> think

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
like this if we play at our best I think

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.350 
like this if we play at our best I think
we<00:03:34.290> can<00:03:34.440> easily<00:03:34.680> take<00:03:35.010> first<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.610> make<00:03:35.970> LCS

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
we can easily take first and make LCS

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.360 
we can easily take first and make LCS
without<00:03:36.450> going<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:36.930> losers<00:03:37.260> bracket<00:03:37.370> but

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
without going to the losers bracket but

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.770 
without going to the losers bracket but
even<00:03:38.550> if<00:03:38.670> we<00:03:38.790> make<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.060> losers<00:03:39.360> bracket<00:03:39.390> we

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
even if we make the losers bracket we

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.850 
even if we make the losers bracket we
still<00:03:39.960> have<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.110> really<00:03:40.410> good<00:03:40.500> chance<00:03:40.560> of
