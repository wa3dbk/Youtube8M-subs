 Hello Assassins! 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.260
 Gabe Graziani here, one of your community developers 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.309
 from Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Rogue. 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.650
 I have more Q &amp; A videos for you. 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.890
 We will make it short and sweet, because according to your feedback you would like to have that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.279
 I answer more than one question per video. 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.029
 So let's get started with the first question that comes out of the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.710
 forums 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.919
 by LotesDeOro, who wants to know: 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.950
 Is the use of two weapons in Assassin's Creed Rogue optional? 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.890
 It's sort of an option because it was used by Edward Kenway. 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.420
 Edward has with 2 cutlasses 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.270
 Fought, Shay can do that with other weapons. He is fighting 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.000
 a sword and a short sword that we call a "main gauche", 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.190
 what French is for "left hand". 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.320
 He can fight ambidextrous, but he can not be a sword at the same time 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.380
 and use a club or something. 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.079
 Everything follows the rules we have in previous Assassin's Creed games 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.130
 have set. The next question comes from 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.530
 Reddit or Limp_Hispanic_Thief who asks: Does Shay have anything 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.290
 like "the gift"? Something like the Eagle View? because he's her as an assassin 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.939
 has learned. 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.149
 The answer to both questions is "yes"! 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.450
 Shay has a command of eagle and he has it during his assassin training 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.039
 learned. 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.770
 It also proves to be very handy in assassin hunting. 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.759
 Surprise! Surprise! We have some material from our gameplay trailer, 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:25.859
 in which one sees, 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.149
 how Shay uses her as an assassin hunter. 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.299
 Our next question is also from Reddit, 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.959
 VictorShade1 wondering: Will there be a Templar base in Rogue, 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.469
 like the Assassin hiding places in the predecessors? Unfortunately for this question 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.889
 a little too early. We do not want everything yet 

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:49.649
 betray. But you will see a lot in the coming weeks 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.149
 experience. 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.529
 Maybe next week, assassins! In this rogue Q &amp; A we want you too 

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:00.619
 Two excellent graphics by Shay Patrick Cormac, by some of our favorite community artists 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:01.389
 imagine. 

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:04.529
 The one on the left is from sazienas, whose landmark 

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:07.729
 - the Chibi style - is always cute. And that on the right 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.300
 comes from the very talented and highly productive sunsetagain. 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.010
 As always, you'll find the links to both artists in our video description below, 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.480
 if you want to follow these artists. And you want that. 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.799
 Well, and now is the time we have for this 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.849
 Q &amp; A video available. See you soon 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.849
 next time. Bye!
