 google play store needs to have a 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.789
 release in the configuration before then 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:07.929
 Let me show you here if you come 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.910

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:14.349
 device is in this case here is the 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.500
 galaxy of the pattern is then came here in

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.900
 here unknown sources allow the 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.690
 off- pits application installation 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.540
 then it must be turned on if this option 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.760
 has been turned off, it will not let 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.190
 apply shock 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.300
 back here the application was installed 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.670
 successfully 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.670
 I'll complete my installation. 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.630
 concluded 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:57.430
 and came back here for my dropbox screen 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.330
 ok so now I'll close and now 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.840
 What am I going to do? 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:08.370
 Once installed, I 'll go here in the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:14.530

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:17.709

 of an insert already the option here what 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.610
 he was installed in that mold he does 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.620
 here is a question you told me is and let me know 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.930
 that this application has access to everything 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.130
 I type on keyboards including the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.120
 credit cards 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.730
 we have to rely on it is that is 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.459
 application to install this motto 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:45.370
 I already used it on my old or cell phone 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:47.950
 I never had a problem so dodo is a 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.459
 place the world's largest forum 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.950
 I do not think there would be any more problems. 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.220
 it's always good 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.640
 attentive to this information here 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:04.600

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.310
 here dialed in htc me mode and now 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.530
 How will I see it working? 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.920
 there's no pity that I have to 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:16.320
 keyboard for example here in the 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.880
 my browser here in the address bar 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.989
 it comes here and the option in the 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.750
 keyboard 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.340
 so up here when I came down to 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.080
 phone line 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.770
 I have to select a method of 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:36.280

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:37.449

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:48.580
 until this prediction here will not work 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:58.840
 It's time to enter the address, right? 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:05:04.349

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:16.120
 so it's there the keyboard is working 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.370
 until you navigate here on the blog page and 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.200
 Are you going to enter here or any other? 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.980
 in another research here for 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.740

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.060
