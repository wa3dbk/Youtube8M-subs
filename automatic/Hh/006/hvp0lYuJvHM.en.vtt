00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.610
 grandfather like three months we planned it 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.759
 it was not easy at all or he did not have 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.800

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.600
 coves were very large 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.190
 we also had the precaution that it 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.969
 do medical check-ups before traveling 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.079

 quality obviously supports you that maxi 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.430
 Young you are missing a couple of years 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.629
 still outside, I miss you so much 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.580

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:03.189
 them very far too and it puts what 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.930
 what is suffering suffers will be removed by 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:07.839
 more that they are having a great time and those who 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.870
 we are here is not a drink patterns 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:12.120
 Skype phone 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.760
 a life in the distance the Argentines 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.760
 we were raised so strange many 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.210
 the family I miss my work in their 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.540
 children and thank God I always have a 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.650
 place to work and I like it 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.540
 Obviously I do not win as a player 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.640
 of soccer but but I am a grateful 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.290
 of the work that I have in Argentina and what 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.980
 I value and I know how difficult it is today 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.870
 day because it's hard for everyone and me 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.820
 I want to work and I want to try 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.850
 fulfill all the jobs that I 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.040
 offer and things and I have as a 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.930
 social life here then it 's like it's 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.460
 much more difficult for me the contrast 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.380
 when I come back because the only thing 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.450
 I do is the same thing that I do charge is to be 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.210
 with the laws and with the family but 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.100
 all the lights like they turn me off and 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.670
 in that sense it 's like a fight 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.280
 constant that I live does not tell you max and 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:06.449
 nothing, the floor obviously I promised 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.759
 that was going to be up 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:12.270
 what is outside because obviously it is 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:15.300
 difficult of his career is shorter than 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.919
 the one that ours and today the villa paula 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.919

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.169

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.509
 what we do is like 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.669
 we always find a place and miss 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.529
 much the laburo was the most much more 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.210
 beyond the boys not because I think the 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.340
 raising kids 9 years 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.050
 work 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.150
 raising the kids but that you 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.540
 You can talk about ethical legal AIDS 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.160
 I hear from the 4 years I work 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.750
 beyond all the stupidities that 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.100
 they always say that if you're going to 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.810
 this with us four years ago that 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.430

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.229
 looking at us taking situations 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.360
 because we were full we started like 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:59.120
 playing and every time he came back obviously 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.550
