with the aviator helmet goggles and then

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.080 
with the aviator helmet goggles and then
I<00:00:35.730> made<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.480> little<00:00:36.840> piece<00:00:39.950> has<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.090> stud

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
I made this little piece has the stud

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.970 
I made this little piece has the stud
right<00:00:42.540> there<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:44.390> then<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.829> folded<00:00:46.829> over

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
right there and then it's folded over

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.850 
right there and then it's folded over
and<00:00:47.690> has<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.890> little<00:00:49.890> hole<00:00:50.160> right<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:51.860> just

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and has a little hole right there just

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:04.479 
and has a little hole right there just
like<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:54.710> then<00:00:55.710> you'll<00:00:55.920> need<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.520> 1<00:00:57.270> by<00:00:57.449> 1<00:00:58.100> stud

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.840 

then<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.820> need<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.210> little<00:01:06.479> piece<00:01:07.520> not<00:01:08.520> sure

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
then you need this little piece not sure

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630 
then you need this little piece not sure
what<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.150> called<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:10.010> it's<00:01:11.010> basically<00:01:11.520> just

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
what it's called but it's basically just

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.109 
what it's called but it's basically just
got<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.330> four<00:01:13.080> studs<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.710> there<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.400> then

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
got the four studs right there and then

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.770 
got the four studs right there and then
a<00:01:15.150> hole<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.810> rounded<00:01:16.290> off<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.420> at<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> top

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
a hole it's rounded off and at the top

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.359 
a hole it's rounded off and at the top
and<00:01:19.110> has<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> hole<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.650> there<00:01:21.920> two<00:01:22.920> by<00:01:23.070> three

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and has a hole right there two by three

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.200 
and has a hole right there two by three
I<00:01:23.400> think

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.530 

and<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:27.570> um<00:01:28.220> you'll<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.520> need<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:31.070> take<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
and then um you'll just need to take the

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.990 
and then um you'll just need to take the
head<00:01:33.540> off<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:35.009> minifig<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:37.189> take<00:01:38.189> this

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
head off of the minifig and take this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.429 
head off of the minifig and take this
little<00:01:39.240> piece<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:41.960> put<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.140> right<00:01:44.869> there<00:01:45.869> on

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
little piece and put it right there on

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.899 
little piece and put it right there on
the<00:01:47.310> neck<00:01:47.579> part<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> mini<00:01:49.500> thing<00:01:49.909> looks

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
