of<00:03:50.190> coding<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.700> because<00:03:51.650> one<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.680> like<00:03:53.010> the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
of coding it because one I like the

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.310 
of coding it because one I like the
texture<00:03:53.490> of<00:03:53.520> this<00:03:53.700> because<00:03:54.270> when<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:54.960> lay<00:03:55.170> the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
texture of this because when I lay the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.180 
texture of this because when I lay the
lace<00:03:55.530> stencil<00:03:56.250> down<00:03:56.700> its<00:03:57.570> it's<00:03:58.140> gonna<00:03:58.350> stick

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
lace stencil down its it's gonna stick

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.220 
lace stencil down its it's gonna stick
to<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.400> temporarily<00:04:00.210> while<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:00.690> work<00:04:00.960> with<00:04:01.110> the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
to it temporarily while I work with the

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.530 
to it temporarily while I work with the
powder<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.710> as<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.430> can<00:04:02.550> see<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:03.000> followed<00:04:03.450> a

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
powder and as you can see I followed a

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.720 
powder and as you can see I followed a
loose<00:04:03.750> scalloped<00:04:04.560> edge<00:04:04.770> but<00:04:05.190> it<00:04:05.370> doesn't<00:04:05.640> have

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
loose scalloped edge but it doesn't have

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.540 
loose scalloped edge but it doesn't have
to<00:04:05.820> be<00:04:05.940> perfect

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
to be perfect

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.970 
to be perfect
so<00:04:08.550> now<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:09.030> I've<00:04:09.210> got<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.750> lace<00:04:10.110> portion

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
piece once again we're gonna press it

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.809 
piece once again we're gonna press it
nice<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.150> tight<00:04:18.989> against<00:04:19.470> her<00:04:19.530> eye<00:04:20.450> okay

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
so now that we've got the lace in place

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.189 
so now that we've got the lace in place
this<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:25.620> our<00:04:25.860> stencil<00:04:26.569> we<00:04:27.569> are<00:04:27.690> going<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:27.990> add

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
this is our stencil we are going to add

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.830 
this is our stencil we are going to add
the<00:04:29.009> lightness<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.060> dark<00:04:30.240> actually<00:04:30.479> takes

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
the lightness so the dark actually takes

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.450 
the lightness so the dark actually takes
