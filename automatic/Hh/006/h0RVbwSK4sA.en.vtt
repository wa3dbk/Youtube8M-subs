but we didn't in the second game and
this<00:04:21.150> is<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.269> perfect<00:04:21.659> example<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:22.140> what<00:04:22.260> I'm

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
this is a perfect example of what I'm

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.899 
this is a perfect example of what I'm
talking<00:04:22.710> about<00:04:22.860> how<00:04:22.979> we<00:04:23.430> dominate<00:04:23.820> with

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
talking about how we dominate with

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.790 
talking about how we dominate with
possession<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.570> he<00:04:24.990> has<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.169> red

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
possession and he has a red

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.379 
possession and he has a red
team<00:04:26.069> is<00:04:26.280> not<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.520> best<00:04:26.669> team<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.060> other<00:04:27.210> two

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
team is not the best team the other two

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.029 
team is not the best team the other two
teams<00:04:27.599> we<00:04:27.840> have<00:04:27.870> we<00:04:28.139> came<00:04:28.319> against<00:04:28.680> but<00:04:28.830> great

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
teams we have we came against but great

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.770 
teams we have we came against but great
they<00:04:29.159> were<00:04:29.250> fine<00:04:29.280> Nazeri<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.330> stuff<00:04:30.539> in<00:04:30.690> the

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
they were fine Nazeri and stuff in the

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.559 
they were fine Nazeri and stuff in the
lineup<00:04:31.080> but<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.340> they<00:04:32.460> all<00:04:32.669> had<00:04:32.879> 100<00:04:33.210> can<00:04:33.389> but

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
lineup but and they all had 100 can but

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.990 
lineup but and they all had 100 can but
this<00:04:34.229> is<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.800> perfect<00:04:35.250> example<00:04:35.310> he<00:04:35.759> doesn't

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
this is a perfect example he doesn't

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.869 
this is a perfect example he doesn't
have<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.120> hundred<00:04:36.330> cam<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:37.250> all<00:04:38.250> he<00:04:38.460> needs<00:04:38.699> is<00:04:38.819> a

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
have a hundred cam and all he needs is a

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.460 
have a hundred cam and all he needs is a
corner<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.449> he's<00:04:39.569> pushing<00:04:39.900> back<00:04:40.050> against<00:04:40.409> the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
corner and he's pushing back against the

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.379 
corner and he's pushing back against the
ropes<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:41.069> real<00:04:41.610> life<00:04:41.909> as<00:04:42.060> well<00:04:42.210> if<00:04:42.300> you

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
ropes and in real life as well if you

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.029 
ropes and in real life as well if you
see<00:04:42.599> tiki-taka<00:04:43.110> teams<00:04:43.440> when<00:04:43.620> he<00:04:43.680> parked<00:04:43.979> the

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
see tiki-taka teams when he parked the

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.740 
see tiki-taka teams when he parked the
bus<00:04:44.250> you<00:04:44.729> can't<00:04:44.970> find<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.240> way<00:04:45.360> through<00:04:45.539> but

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
bus you can't find a way through but

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.149 
bus you can't find a way through but
this<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.110> perfect<00:04:46.440> example<00:04:46.500> there<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.979> go<00:04:47.129> I

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
this is a perfect example there you go I

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.219 
this is a perfect example there you go I
equalized<00:04:47.849> i<00:04:48.090> will<00:04:48.599> try<00:04:48.810> different

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
equalized i will try different

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.140 
equalized i will try different
formations<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:49.800> tactics<00:04:49.860> in<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.580> game<00:04:50.789> bring

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
formations and tactics in the game bring

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.969 
formations and tactics in the game bring
players<00:04:51.389> on<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:52.080> try<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:52.409> break<00:04:52.590> through<00:04:52.800> for

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
players on to try and break through for

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.339 
players on to try and break through for
example<00:04:53.039> Falcao<00:04:53.729> either<00:04:54.389> go<00:04:54.659> up<00:04:54.690> front<00:04:55.050> it's

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
example Falcao either go up front it's

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.839 
example Falcao either go up front it's
not<00:04:55.560> working<00:04:55.949> I<00:04:56.039> bring<00:04:56.190> on<00:04:56.310> someone<00:04:56.550> with<00:04:56.819> a

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
not working I bring on someone with a

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.339 
not working I bring on someone with a
better<00:04:57.090> aerial<00:04:57.479> threat<00:04:57.690> so<00:04:57.840> when<00:04:57.960> we<00:04:58.080> get<00:04:58.229> the

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
better aerial threat so when we get the

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.230 
better aerial threat so when we get the
cross<00:04:58.560> in<00:04:58.770> it'll<00:04:59.370> help<00:04:59.520> me<00:04:59.699> out<00:04:59.729> a<00:04:59.849> lot<00:05:00.030> more

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
cross in it'll help me out a lot more

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.490 
cross in it'll help me out a lot more
stuff<00:05:00.509> like<00:05:00.629> that<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:00.810> it's<00:05:01.020> a<00:05:01.080> really<00:05:01.379> fun
