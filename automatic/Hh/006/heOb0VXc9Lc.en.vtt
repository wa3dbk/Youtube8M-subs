00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 though 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.219
 welcome to this test from the publisher of 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.509
 e-monsite websites in this 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.460
 video we will introduce you 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.800
 quickly the strengths and 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.439
 weaknesses of this e-monsite tool 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.480
 has been around for 10 years now it's up to 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.880
 say long enough given the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.779
 speed with the internet is changing in the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.400
 retrospective 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.619
 you can see the evolution of the tool 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.970
 over the years but what we 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.579
 interested and what is proposed to us 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.220
 today we will discover 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.290
 if e-monsite managed to develop a 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.170
 easy to use site editor or 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.820
 if he reserves us a bad surprise 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.630
 the features without a lot of 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.760
 promises 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.010
 optimization for mobile interface 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.560
 friendly and simple editing 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.070
 with in addition an online store is 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.960
 a blog let's take a closer look 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.550
 Registration is quick and easy 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.560
 no need to enter your details 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.210
 bank for the free version 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.100
 the dashboard gives you a view 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.790
 overview of all activities on 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.010
 your site 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.570
 if you have an online store you 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.049
 there will see your latest orders and your 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.390
 receipts 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.909
 it also provides statistics this 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.880
 mr on your visitors comments and 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.469
 access to your messages before you can 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.869
 edit the content of the site 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.689
 you have to choose the layout for 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.020
 this we click on configuration then 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:25.389
 on appearance here we can see 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.180
 different categories like flatte or 

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:28.500
 tourism 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.480
 we advise you to choose a 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.550
 model based on the bootstrap framework 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.040
 in addition to being very modern 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.690
 these models are responsible it's up to 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.500
 say they are displayed perfectly on 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.690
 mobile devices 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.510
 we can further customize the setting 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.790
 on page in the custom menu for 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.970
 edit pages click on pages 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.070
 we thus reach an overview of 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.530
 latest activities on our pages for 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.300
 access other options click on 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.940
 page in the submenu 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.149
 we see here our homepage with 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.860
 other pages the link edit us 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.510
 brings to the page editor 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.490
 to display editor options 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.160
 we click on the text box 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.270
 the process is quite similar to that 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.420
 a traditional word processor 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.460
 like microsoft very simple word you 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.460
 can add pictures here 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.709
 you can add new ones 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.180
 columns and new lines and 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.269
 choose what content displayed 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.000
 we will incorporate a youtube video 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.360
 for that it is enough to copy the url is 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.160
 to set the size of the video 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.450
 do not forget to optimize the website 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.880
 for search engines like 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.250
 google under optimization of 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.990
 SEO met the meta 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.540
 classic information on the page 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.650
 we can even change the name of the eurl 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.650
 what is interesting 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.379
 the plug-in menu allows you to proceed 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.730
 other settings such as the 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.890
 setting a password 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.470
 but this option is only available 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.450
 in the pro pay formula if we 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.280
 had a translation of the content not 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.709
 could follow the same procedure and 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.160
 added a page in English to see the 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.980
 result 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.300
 we click on save 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.370
 unfortunately there is neither 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.849
 preview or cancel buttons 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.200
 stock 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.180
 if you make any changes 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.010
 important to your content 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.890
 do not forget to make a copy 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.349
 before here is the result 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.010
 to change the menu bar 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.739
 horizontal 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.190
 we click on configuration then on 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.099
 menu then we click on the link 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.569
 edit that is quite discreet one can 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.819
 then change the delirious order of 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.640
 navigation or delete it's the 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.410
 easy part however it is enough 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.739
 complicated to modify or add a 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.510
 internal link because it is impossible to 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.470
 move existing pages by 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.660
 drag and drop 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.910
 it's even harder to create a 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.489
 menu with sub levels happily 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.319
 e-monsite offers a tutorial step by step 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.329
 which explains the whole procedure 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.870
 but it's really not easy for 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.390
 beginners 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.049
 e-monsite also offers a shop 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.299
 online 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.739
 when the module is activated you 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.360
 can buy new products and 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.810
 set the settings for the options 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.690
 invoicing tax payment suppliers 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.769
 et cetera if you want to use a 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.720
 online shop with all 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.229
 functions you have to choose the formula 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.699
 pro shop the shop has all 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.270
 the features that we could 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.620
 expect 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.930
 although we would have preferred a 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.550
 secure ssl connection for better 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.110
 protect the personal data that 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.310
 customers provide during the 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.770
 order 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.440
 to finish let's take a look at blogs 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.890
 the overview is similar to that 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.980
 pages 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.080
 here we can modify or add 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.910
 tickets the publisher is also very 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.470
 similar we appreciate 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.050
 particularly the function of 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.310
 planning publications 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.630
 do not forget to provide meta 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.060
 information for the engines of 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.740
 search you can activate or 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.840
 disable the add function 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.840
 comment and here is the result 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.760
 e-mySite is a site editor 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.350
 really powerful internet especially 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.660
 in paid formulas 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.500
 but be careful before choosing a 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.440
 paid formula 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.390
 the domain name is not included there 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.060
 costs 35 euros extra per year 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.370
 e-monsite and therefore more expensive than what 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.260
 At first glance one can think of 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.670
 modern responsive models and the 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.440
 excellent optimization options 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.390
 SEO gives you the opportunity 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.070
 to maintain a professional website 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.520
 or an online store 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.680
 another advantage multilingual integration 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.960
 the main disadvantage lies in 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.970
 general ergonomics it is impossible 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.680
 to work on the fly you have to 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.300
 really know at the front what you 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.370
 want to do on your site where you 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.050
 may have a bad surprise 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.730
 as for navigation it is the most 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.010
 complicated that we have come across 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.210
 so far the written tutorials 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.040
 are of great help 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.580
 but we would have largely preferred a 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.080
 more intuitive editor e-monsite is a 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.030
 good solution for projects 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.010
 relatively complex if you want 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.300
 be operational soon do 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.220
 advise you to start with 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.640
 try other editors like jim 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.140
 of water or x to consult a table of 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.470
 comparison of different editors 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.980
 websites 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.080
 go on publishers pulled website 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.410
 web.fr and if this video has been 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.360
 useful 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.890
 do not forget to click on like on 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.700
 youtube and facebook 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.700
 thank you
