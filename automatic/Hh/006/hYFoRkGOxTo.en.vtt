00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
resident evil 4 for instance that you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910 
resident evil 4 for instance that you
had<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> hold<00:01:24.900> down<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.409> order<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> bring<00:01:25.770> up

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
had to hold down a in order to bring up

your arm and then hit B to shoot now you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.800 
your arm and then hit B to shoot now you
can<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.920> shoot<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.820> kind

zoom<00:05:01.340> case<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:02.360> this<00:05:02.840> is<00:05:03.170> also<00:05:03.320> there's<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.740> lot

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
zoom case so this is also there's a lot

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.790 
zoom case so this is also there's a lot
of<00:05:03.920> cases<00:05:04.520> out<00:05:04.820> there<00:05:05.110> for<00:05:06.110> DSI<00:05:06.440> and<00:05:06.620> like<00:05:06.770> i

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
of cases out there for DSI and like i

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.780 
of cases out there for DSI and like i
said<00:05:06.980> before<00:05:07.070> we<00:05:07.280> like<00:05:07.400> to<00:05:07.460> do<00:05:07.580> stuff<00:05:07.760> that's

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
said before we like to do stuff that's

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.490 
said before we like to do stuff that's
different<00:05:08.300> innovative<00:05:08.660> that<00:05:09.110> not<00:05:09.260> everybody

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
different innovative that not everybody

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.110 
different innovative that not everybody
else<00:05:09.620> has<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:10.310> this<00:05:10.460> is<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.610> protective<00:05:11.000> hard

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
else has so this is a protective hard

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.520 
else has so this is a protective hard
case<00:05:11.330> just<00:05:11.660> like<00:05:11.690> most<00:05:11.990> ones<00:05:12.200> you<00:05:12.260> find<00:05:12.350> on<00:05:12.470> the

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
case just like most ones you find on the

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.370 
case just like most ones you find on the
market<00:05:12.590> so<00:05:13.190> it'll<00:05:13.340> keep<00:05:13.490> your<00:05:13.670> DSi<00:05:14.630> safe<00:05:15.080> from

market so it'll keep your DSi safe from
scratches<00:05:15.560> and<00:05:15.980> such<00:05:16.100> but<00:05:16.760> you<00:05:17.360> can<00:05:17.480> see<00:05:17.630> here

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
scratches and such but you can see here

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.760 
scratches and such but you can see here
on<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:17.960> outside<00:05:18.200> of<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.320> case<00:05:18.500> there's<00:05:18.710> a

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
on the outside of the case there's a

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.290 
on the outside of the case there's a
mounting<00:05:19.220> clip<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.790> allows<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.180> attach

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
mounting clip that allows you to attach

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.340 
mounting clip that allows you to attach
this<00:05:20.930> 8<00:05:21.200> x<00:05:21.850> magnification<00:05:22.850> lens<00:05:23.300> so<00:05:24.170> when

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
this 8 x magnification lens so when

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.860 
this 8 x magnification lens so when
you're<00:05:24.470> using<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.830> camera<00:05:25.150> on<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.630> inside

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
you're using the camera on the inside

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.090 
you're using the camera on the inside
here<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.110> as<00:05:27.230> you've<00:05:27.380> noticed<00:05:27.650> the<00:05:27.920> point

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
here you as you've noticed the point

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.710 
here you as you've noticed the point
three<00:05:28.220> megapixel<00:05:28.310> camera<00:05:28.880> on<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.030> DS<00:05:29.210> is

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
three megapixel camera on the DS is

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.940 
three megapixel camera on the DS is
great<00:05:29.960> for<00:05:30.110> taking<00:05:30.320> a<00:05:30.350> little<00:05:30.440> candid<00:05:30.770> shots

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
great for taking a little candid shots

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.280 
great for taking a little candid shots
but<00:05:31.130> it's<00:05:31.220> not<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:32.090> best<00:05:32.270> for<00:05:32.600> taking<00:05:32.900> far

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
but it's not the best for taking far

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.540 
but it's not the best for taking far
away<00:05:33.440> distance<00:05:33.620> shots<00:05:34.010> or<00:05:34.190> anything<00:05:34.460> that's

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
away distance shots or anything that's

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.100 
away distance shots or anything that's
kind<00:05:34.790> of<00:05:34.820> close<00:05:34.910> up<00:05:35.180> on<00:05:35.420> it<00:05:35.510> for<00:05:35.660> detail<00:05:35.960> like

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
kind of close up on it for detail like

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.990 
kind of close up on it for detail like
text<00:05:36.410> or<00:05:36.500> anything<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:37.490> so<00:05:37.640> this<00:05:37.790> will

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
text or anything and so this will

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.670 
text or anything and so this will
increase<00:05:38.360> that<00:05:38.630> by<00:05:38.690> eight<00:05:39.020> times<00:05:39.260> and<00:05:39.590> then

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
increase that by eight times and then

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.290 
increase that by eight times and then
you<00:05:39.740> can<00:05:39.860> also<00:05:39.980> have<00:05:40.340> a<00:05:40.580> minor<00:05:40.880> adjustment

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
you can also have a minor adjustment

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.000 
you can also have a minor adjustment
focus<00:05:41.660> like<00:05:41.870> say<00:05:42.110> you're<00:05:42.230> shooting<00:05:42.860> something

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
focus like say you're shooting something

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.500 
focus like say you're shooting something
is<00:05:43.190> really<00:05:43.310> finite<00:05:43.730> or<00:05:44.000> text<00:05:44.330> that<00:05:44.360> you<00:05:44.480> want

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
is really finite or text that you want

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.820 
is really finite or text that you want
to<00:05:44.660> kind<00:05:44.780> of<00:05:44.870> focus<00:05:45.020> in<00:05:45.260> on<00:05:45.320> you<00:05:45.530> can<00:05:45.650> do<00:05:45.710> that

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
to kind of focus in on you can do that

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.460 
to kind of focus in on you can do that
as<00:05:45.980> well<00:05:46.010> it's<00:05:46.670> a<00:05:46.850> great<00:05:47.330> way<00:05:47.570> to<00:05:47.630> kind<00:05:48.350> of

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
as well it's a great way to kind of

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.900 
as well it's a great way to kind of
improve<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.950> camera<00:05:49.310> experience<00:05:49.550> with<00:05:49.850> the

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
improve the camera experience with the

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.300 
improve the camera experience with the
