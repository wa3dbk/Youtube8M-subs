00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.640
 maybe what are the first 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.640
 movements we live a simple AIDS 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.809
 I played laredo 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.189
 I tried to play with the backs 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:12.989
 he hugs you 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:16.539
 what took a long time according to versions of the press that is edited and stretched 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.279
 it is a pillar of win 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.609
 all this time treats second phase is the time that the pillars 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.089
 have for 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.139
 get for the contract to the defense that we talk about from the outside to the inside and 

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:30.150
 when they are closed 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.899
 caresse worked 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.010
 the optics of the return come back out 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.340
 now we start to float miami is still 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.290
 if there is something 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.220
 things that happen jean ping things 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.640
 but what to practice 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.100
 a little bit of slowness on the offensive part another decision today to the city 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.860
 he did not lie almond trees almendán and we said he is lying 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.870
 they cut us the advantage line 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.580
 the French again where are you going to play 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.760
 to channel 3 there it appears 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.820
 gonzález amorosino close and the players up 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 I was fine here 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.400
 and at the same time get to where it worked 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.250
 Libya is closed 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.250
 it is clearly the one that makes defensive coverage the first line 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.290
 loyal hat hole that's in there and now let's see when the ball 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.350
 Cadiz where we are and not totally turned towards 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.530
 with they took advantage to make it a gender sierra bossio canalizadoon silva 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
 I found it very interesting of the French as 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.659
 they used and manipulated the opposition these two the second time look now 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.720
 let's give an example this defense morente 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 pose as well as facing 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.520
 ginés they were bullfighting that comes out on tip but those three and be in 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.850
 float position 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.040
 that you're still smart 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.660
 there happened for time it forces up to the same amount in cardiac arrest 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.350
 I do not pass 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.320
 look close 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.320
 one two three but the last one that bursts 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.720
 that would do without mercy miguel angel ojeda 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.360
 Sale senatore de punta farías should have gone up also the health 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:14.499
 the hole 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.369
 the excellent execution 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:21.449
 the French team little chess party in defense that needs to be improved and 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.449
 they improve a time 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:30.319
 if you want active used this way they are totally why we wife gave all or 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.229
 we did not go out and explode but there was still as albor moment mix of 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.800
 players that come out on tip 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.099
 and then suddenly they stayed like this 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.469
