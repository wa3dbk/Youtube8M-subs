00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.290
 in theory the turbo is an air pump 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.420
 hot that forces the entrance of more 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.330
 air in the engine with more air the engine 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.890
 can work more efficiently 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.440
 increasing the power and reducing the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.119
 consumption and polluting emissions the 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.250
 turbo is installed in the system 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.490
 between engine exhaust manifold 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.499
 exhaust and the exhaust as it exits 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.540
 the engine gases meet the 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.579
 turbo exhaust turbine that makes 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.410
 turn the compressor wheel to compress 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.020
 the air that enters the engine 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.430
 the oil passes through the turbo 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.989
 providing lubrication in the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.420
 practice the turbo is a device 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.699
 highly sophisticated efficient and 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.340
 complex designed with tolerances of 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.680
 thousandths of a millimeter consists of a 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.010
 turbine and a compressor linked by an axis 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.690
 supported by a bearing system 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.239
 the turbo is moved by the energy 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.010
 excess exhaust gases the 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.260
 exhaust gases enter through the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.960
 Exhaust turbine spin the turbine 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.790
 and exit through the exhaust pipe 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.580
 temperatures reached in the exhaust 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.560
 they reach 900 degrees centigrade what 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.450
 which makes the use of materials necessary 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.219
 resistant to heat in the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.010
 or the escape and in the head of the 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.260
 turbine 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.690
 the revolutions and the torque of the engine 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.210
 determine how fast the rotor rotates 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.670
 with the engine idling the speed of the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.290
 rotor will be minimal when passing more gases to 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.540
 through the turbine the speed of the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.970
 rotor increases at maximum speed 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.820
 the rotor reaches 240 thousand 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.380
 revolutions per minute the wheel 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.330
 compressor a is connected to the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.130
 turbine using a steel shaft and it is 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.830
 moved by the speed generated by 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.050
 this air is attracted to the conch shell 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.850
 admission by the compressor wheel and 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.700
 compressed when rotating the blades to great 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.740
 speed the profile of the conch shell 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.050
 transforms intake air entering 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.330
 great speed and low air pressure at 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.110
 low speed and high pressure to the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 turbo output 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.910
 the air enters the intake conch shell 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.520
 at room temperature but it comes out at 200 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.289
 degrees centigrade by increasing the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.540
 air temperature decreases its 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.550
 density and we lose power for that 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.860
 we must use an intercooler that through 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.280
 of air or water lower the temperature 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.440
 of the air coming from the turbo 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.990
 the shaft that connects the turbine and the compressor 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.730
 rests on bearings lubricated by 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.500
 the engine oil the oil is 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.450
 presses through the body 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.580
 up to the bearings the bearing 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.530
 push and the rest of friction parts 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.930
 the oil also serves as 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.020
 coolant removes the heat generated 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.819
 by rotating the rotor and friction the 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.650
 bearings float on a film of 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.170
 oil that is formed between the shaft and the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.120
 Bearing and body and bearing 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.489
 tolerances of these oil films 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.470
 are critical at both ends of the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.480
 body we find segments that a 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.160
 difference from those we can find 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.900
 in the engine are designed to 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.910
 withstand the high temperatures and 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.500
 pressure generated by these points and 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.450
 avoid the passage of oil to the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.940
 turbine housing and the turbine housing 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.800
 admission a small turbine will have a 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.890
 magnificent response at low revolutions 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.959
 on the contrary at high revolutions it 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.420
 will go round and pressurize the 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.430
 excess motor to prevent this from 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.010
 Turbos have a built-in valve 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.660
 which controls the blowing pressure in the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.000
 moment that the pressure approaches the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.860
 maximum allowed the valve opens to 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.060
 allow leftover gases not to 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.160
 go through the 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.190
 and go directly to the exhaust pipe 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.560
 in a valve turbo we can use a 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.970
 small turbine with total safety and 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.170
 get a great response 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.480
 maintaining the power 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.340
 turbos with and without valve can be 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.690
 repaired without problems provided that 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.730
 follow the manufacturer's instructions 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.730
 and use original parts 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.569
 all reconditioned turbos and 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.700
 repaired by turbo master follow the 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.079
 manufacturer's recommendations always 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.079
 We use original parts 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.740
 in conventional turbos the flow 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.510
 of air supplied to the motor comes 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.730
 determined by the design of the turbine 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.170
 the compressor and its conches that is 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.120
 always a compromise between 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.569
 performance at high and low revolutions 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.850
 the motor 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.680
 to solve this problem and that the 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.120
 turbo maintain its performance during 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.039
 all engine regimes 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.350
 the geometry turbos appeared 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.009
 variable vgt 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.009
 in English 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.800
 depending on the manufacturer the turbos of 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.169
 Variable geometry act by moving 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.000
 alavÃ©s or nozzles according to the scheme 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.000
 Engine goes from low to high revolutions 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.310
 this allows us much more use 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.140
 efficient energy of the gases of 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.850
 exhaust that generates the air flow 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.370
 desired throughout all 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.050
 engine regimes this improvement of the 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.630
 response in all regimes of the 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.130
 engine reduces fuel consumption 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.720
 improves the engine brake and allows the 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.370
 manufacturers produce more engines 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.370
 small with the same power 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.410
 the first geometry turbos 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.389
 variable they used pressure valves or 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.350
 empty to regulate the position of the 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.350
 Blades or nozzles 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.290
 the most modern use valves 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.290
 electronic systems governed by the 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.030
 electronic engine control the 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.740
 complexity of geometry turbos 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.260
 variable makes it not possible 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.090
 repair them with full guarantee so 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.170
 we only supply units
