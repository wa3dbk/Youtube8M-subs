00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.680 
as well onto the tips what I like to do
is<00:04:36.320> just<00:04:36.350> outline<00:04:37.070> my<00:04:37.580> eye<00:04:37.610> first<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.360> do<00:04:38.540> the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
is just outline my eye first and do the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.720 
is just outline my eye first and do the
slick<00:04:38.900> later<00:04:39.140> but<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:39.860> can<00:04:40.010> do<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.160> whichever

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
slick later but you can do it whichever

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.610 
slick later but you can do it whichever
way<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:41.090> find<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:41.510> easy

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:54.120 

and<00:04:46.460> then<00:04:46.970> join<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.300> out<00:04:47.420> of<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.690> rest<00:04:47.840> device

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.020 

the<00:04:55.130> next<00:04:55.370> step<00:04:55.520> I<00:04:55.760> do<00:04:55.820> is<00:04:56.300> put<00:04:56.810> brown<00:04:57.140> eyeliner

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
the next step I do is put brown eyeliner

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.660 
the next step I do is put brown eyeliner
in<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.570> my<00:05:00.170> waterline<00:05:00.530> I<00:05:00.950> just<00:05:01.220> find<00:05:01.370> this<00:05:01.490> is<00:05:01.640> a

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
in to my waterline I just find this is a

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.300 
in to my waterline I just find this is a
really<00:05:02.000> subtle<00:05:02.240> way<00:05:02.420> of<00:05:03.080> using<00:05:03.620> it<00:05:03.830> in<00:05:04.040> your

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
really subtle way of using it in your

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.130 
really subtle way of using it in your
waterline<00:05:04.640> because<00:05:05.090> black<00:05:05.450> sometimes<00:05:05.780> can<00:05:06.080> be

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
waterline because black sometimes can be

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.650 
waterline because black sometimes can be
a<00:05:06.170> bit<00:05:06.320> harsh<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.860> you<00:05:06.890> want<00:05:07.070> more<00:05:07.220> of<00:05:07.280> a<00:05:07.430> hazy

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
a bit harsh and you want more of a hazy

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.080 
a bit harsh and you want more of a hazy
feel<00:05:08.660> with<00:05:08.870> this<00:05:08.990> like<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:10.310> that<00:05:10.700> color<00:05:10.910> we

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
feel with this like and that color we

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.900 
feel with this like and that color we
use<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.390> highlight<00:05:11.570> and<00:05:12.290> just<00:05:12.440> pop<00:05:12.620> that<00:05:12.910> along

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
use to highlight and just pop that along

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.190 
use to highlight and just pop that along
my<00:05:14.030> bottom<00:05:14.210> lashes

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.900 

and<00:05:20.200> then<00:05:20.290> I'm<00:05:20.500> using<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:21.310> mineral<00:05:21.550> infused

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
and then I'm using the mineral infused

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:32.850 
and then I'm using the mineral infused
mascara

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.649 

I<00:05:32.919> love<00:05:33.580> these<00:05:33.729> matte<00:05:33.939> lip<00:05:34.150> colors<00:05:34.479> they've

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
I love these matte lip colors they've

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.760 
I love these matte lip colors they've
been<00:05:34.780> really<00:05:34.930> precise<00:05:35.409> and<00:05:36.719> you<00:05:37.719> can<00:05:37.870> outline

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
been really precise and you can outline

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.379 
been really precise and you can outline
your<00:05:38.889> lip<00:05:39.039> gloss<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.580> really<00:05:39.969> fill<00:05:40.180> them<00:05:40.330> in

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
your lip gloss and really fill them in

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:46.589 
your lip gloss and really fill them in
as<00:05:40.509> well<00:05:40.689> so<00:05:44.400> the<00:05:45.400> final<00:05:45.699> step<00:05:45.909> that<00:05:45.939> we<00:05:46.389> need

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
as well so the final step that we need

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.480 
as well so the final step that we need
to<00:05:46.719> do<00:05:46.840> now<00:05:47.080> is<00:05:47.289> make<00:05:47.439> sure<00:05:47.469> that<00:05:47.650> this<00:05:48.310> all

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
to do now is make sure that this all

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.760 
to do now is make sure that this all
stays<00:05:48.729> there<00:05:49.060> all<00:05:49.330> night<00:05:50.050> and<00:05:50.289> what<00:05:50.650> we're

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
stays there all night and what we're

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.980 
stays there all night and what we're
going<00:05:50.889> to<00:05:50.919> use<00:05:50.979> is<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.699> elf<00:05:52.000> makeup<00:05:52.360> mist<00:05:52.569> and

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
going to use is the elf makeup mist and

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.959 
going to use is the elf makeup mist and
sand<00:05:53.229> and<00:05:53.800> I<00:05:53.860> could<00:05:54.099> use<00:05:54.280> this<00:05:54.490> just<00:05:54.759> because<00:05:54.939> I

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:54.969 
sand and I could use this just because I

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:56.369 
sand and I could use this just because I
know<00:05:55.120> all<00:05:55.449> my<00:05:55.569> makeup<00:05:55.750> is<00:05:55.930> gonna<00:05:56.080> stay<00:05:56.259> in
