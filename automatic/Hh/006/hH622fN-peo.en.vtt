00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:17.770 

I

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:17.780 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.260 

one<00:00:18.740> of<00:00:18.830> my<00:00:18.920> favorite<00:00:19.280> ways<00:00:19.370> to<00:00:19.430> cook<00:00:19.760> fish<00:00:20.000> is

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
one of my favorite ways to cook fish is

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.270 
one of my favorite ways to cook fish is
in<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.480> parchment<00:00:20.960> paper<00:00:21.140> packet<00:00:21.740> you<00:00:22.070> can<00:00:22.190> you

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 
in a parchment paper packet you can you

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.820 
in a parchment paper packet you can you
spoil<00:00:22.640> too<00:00:22.910> but<00:00:23.330> and<00:00:23.540> then<00:00:23.750> when<00:00:24.080> you<00:00:24.230> use<00:00:24.440> foil

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
spoil too but and then when you use foil

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.590 
spoil too but and then when you use foil
you<00:00:25.100> shouldn't<00:00:25.400> use<00:00:25.550> acidic<00:00:26.030> ingredients

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
you shouldn't use acidic ingredients

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.660 
you shouldn't use acidic ingredients
like<00:00:26.690> tomatoes<00:00:27.170> or<00:00:27.380> lemons<00:00:27.770> with<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:28.460> fish

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
like tomatoes or lemons with the fish

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.900 
like tomatoes or lemons with the fish
because<00:00:28.910> that<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.630> acid<00:00:30.020> in<00:00:30.260> those<00:00:30.910> fruits

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
because that the acid in those fruits

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.310 
because that the acid in those fruits
and<00:00:32.060> vegetables<00:00:32.480> will<00:00:32.630> react<00:00:32.930> with<00:00:33.050> the

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
and vegetables will react with the

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.830 
and vegetables will react with the
aluminum<00:00:33.950> foil<00:00:34.220> so<00:00:34.760> because<00:00:35.390> i<00:00:35.510> like<00:00:35.690> to<00:00:35.809> use

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840

thinly sliced down and we're going to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.310 
thinly sliced down and we're going to
make<00:01:28.909> basically<00:01:29.509> what's<00:01:29.659> a<00:01:29.750> little<00:01:30.020> bit<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.200> a

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
make basically what's a little bit of a
