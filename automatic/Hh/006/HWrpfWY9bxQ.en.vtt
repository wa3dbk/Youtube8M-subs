I've<00:00:43.329> his<00:00:43.570> ability<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.110> find<00:00:44.290> them<00:00:44.380> easier<00:00:44.649> in

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
I've his ability to find them easier in

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.200 
I've his ability to find them easier in
the<00:00:44.829> grass<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:46.590> let's<00:00:47.590> see<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:49.030> kind<00:00:49.180> of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
the grass and let's see what kind of

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.000 
the grass and let's see what kind of
ranges<00:00:49.480> we<00:00:49.630> can<00:00:49.780> get<00:00:49.930> this<00:00:50.200> blaster<00:00:50.620> does<00:00:50.770> have

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
ranges we can get this blaster does have

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.549 
ranges we can get this blaster does have
both<00:00:51.329> single<00:00:52.329> fire<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:52.660> slam<00:00:52.870> fire<00:00:53.110> so<00:00:53.380> we'll

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
both single fire and slam fire so we'll

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.270 
both single fire and slam fire so we'll
do<00:00:53.710> test<00:00:53.920> for<00:00:54.130> both<00:00:54.309> 10<00:00:54.730> shots<00:00:55.000> each<00:00:56.280> starting

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
do test for both 10 shots each starting

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:19.080 
do test for both 10 shots each starting
off<00:00:57.399> single<00:00:57.700> fire<00:01:16.439> here's<00:01:17.439> our<00:01:17.740> shots<00:01:18.130> single

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
off single fire here's our shots single

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.319 
off single fire here's our shots single
fire<00:01:19.389> a<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:21.159> bit<00:01:21.399> of<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.549> breeze<00:01:21.789> left<00:01:22.149> to

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
fire a little bit of a breeze left to

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.160 
fire a little bit of a breeze left to
right<00:01:22.509> so<00:01:23.439> that's<00:01:23.619> why<00:01:23.799> you're<00:01:23.979> seeing<00:01:24.189> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
right so that's why you're seeing a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.219 
right so that's why you're seeing a
little<00:01:26.170> bit<00:01:26.350> more<00:01:26.619> variation<00:01:27.490> in<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.880> vortex

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
little bit more variation in the vortex

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.649 
little bit more variation in the vortex
vortex<00:01:29.229> discs<00:01:29.709> than<00:01:29.920> normal<00:01:30.279> but<00:01:30.659> still

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
vortex discs than normal but still

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.249 
vortex discs than normal but still
pretty<00:01:32.499> consistent<00:01:33.569> got<00:01:34.569> our<00:01:34.689> lowest<00:01:35.079> shot

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
pretty consistent got our lowest shot

back so they're gonna be our top two and

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.889 
back so they're gonna be our top two and
we'll<00:01:58.389> walk<00:01:58.599> that<00:01:58.810> farthest<00:01:59.319> one<00:01:59.499> in<00:01:59.819> and

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
we'll walk that farthest one in and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.609 
we'll walk that farthest one in and
tapping<00:02:01.899> out<00:02:02.020> at<00:02:02.259> a<00:02:02.289> 68<00:02:03.069> feet<00:02:03.369> so<00:02:03.989> 68<00:02:04.989> feet<00:02:05.259> for

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
tapping out at a 68 feet so 68 feet for

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.010 
tapping out at a 68 feet so 68 feet for
the<00:02:05.829> new<00:02:06.310> Paragon<00:02:06.789> on<00:02:06.939> single<00:02:07.239> fire<00:02:07.389> let's<00:02:07.810> get

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
the new Paragon on single fire let's get

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.040 
the new Paragon on single fire let's get
reset<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.530> see<00:02:08.679> how<00:02:08.770> slamfire<00:02:09.039> does<00:02:09.989> okay<00:02:10.989> so

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
reset and see how slamfire does okay so

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.600 
reset and see how slamfire does okay so
once<00:02:11.740> again

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
once again

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.520 
once again
with<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.910> vortex<00:02:13.630> Paragon<00:02:14.080> we've<00:02:14.350> done

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
with the vortex Paragon we've done

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.750 
with the vortex Paragon we've done
single<00:02:14.920> fire<00:02:15.100> test

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
single fire test

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.460 
single fire test
now<00:02:16.150> we're<00:02:16.330> gonna<00:02:16.420> see<00:02:16.660> how<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.930> performs<00:02:17.230> in

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
now we're gonna see how it performs in

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.230 
now we're gonna see how it performs in
slamfire<00:02:17.740> mode<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:21.100> holding<00:02:21.820> down<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
slamfire mode so holding down the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:37.190 
slamfire mode so holding down the
trigger<00:02:32.790> hey<00:02:33.790> there's<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.330> time<00:02:34.540> shucks

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.990 

let's<00:02:38.200> walk<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.920> out<00:02:41.580> still<00:02:42.580> have<00:02:42.820> that

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
let's walk that out still have that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.580 
let's walk that out still have that
left-to-right<00:02:43.630> breeze<00:02:43.990> blowing<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:44.470> it

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
left-to-right breeze blowing but it

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.960 
left-to-right breeze blowing but it
seems<00:02:44.770> like<00:02:44.950> slam<00:02:45.250> fire<00:02:45.490> they<00:02:45.670> actually

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
seems like slam fire they actually

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.540 
seems like slam fire they actually
performed<00:02:46.450> more<00:02:47.200> like<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.410> normal<00:02:47.830> vortex<00:02:48.280> wood

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
performed more like a normal vortex wood

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.930 
performed more like a normal vortex wood
as<00:02:48.790> opposed<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:51.040> first<00:02:51.340> on<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.640> single

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
as opposed to that first on the single

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.840 
as opposed to that first on the single
fire<00:02:52.090> they're<00:02:52.270> a<00:02:52.300> bit<00:02:52.510> more<00:02:52.660> spread<00:02:52.930> out<00:02:53.850> okay

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
fire they're a bit more spread out okay
