00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
done to other Diaries but I thought

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.999 
done to other Diaries but I thought
you'd<00:00:12.420> get<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.570> bit<00:00:12.719> boring<00:00:12.929> view<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:13.620> me<00:00:13.769> just

cleaning my face every day and talking

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.029 
cleaning my face every day and talking
about<00:00:16.710> me<00:00:17.010> cleaning<00:00:17.250> my<00:00:17.400> face<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:19.039> really

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
about me cleaning my face I really

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.189 
about me cleaning my face I really
really<00:00:20.520> really<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.390> Clarisonic<00:00:21.930> brush

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
really really like the Clarisonic brush

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.290 
really really like the Clarisonic brush
I<00:00:22.560> don't<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.400> could<00:00:23.580> use<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.029> twice<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
I don't think you could use it twice a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.150 
I don't think you could use it twice a
day<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.840> think<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.140> would<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.710> too<00:00:25.920> harsh

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
day I think that would just be too harsh

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.450 
day I think that would just be too harsh
for<00:00:26.400> your<00:00:26.519> skin<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:27.060> my<00:00:27.359> opinion<00:00:28.070> and<00:00:29.070> I

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
for your skin in my opinion and I

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.980 
for your skin in my opinion and I
probably<00:00:29.670> wouldn't<00:00:29.970> even<00:00:30.090> use<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.539> once<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> day

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
probably wouldn't even use it once a day

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.200 
probably wouldn't even use it once a day
but<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.769> think<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> few<00:00:32.550> times<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.030> week<00:00:33.059> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
but I think for a few times a week to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.450 
but I think for a few times a week to
give<00:00:33.570> your<00:00:33.690> skin<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:33.960> really<00:00:34.190> amazing<00:00:35.190> clean

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
then this is fantastic it just really

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.000 
then this is fantastic it just really
really<00:00:39.600> draws<00:00:40.050> out<00:00:40.320> all<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.649> their

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
really draws out all of their

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.840 
really draws out all of their
deep-seated<00:00:41.550> dirt<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.450> oil<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.260> just

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
deep-seated dirt and oil and just

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.520 
deep-seated dirt and oil and just
general<00:00:44.850> crap<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.420> goes<00:00:45.570> into<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:45.930> skin<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
general crap that goes into your skin I

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.040 
general crap that goes into your skin I
did<00:00:47.160> find<00:00:47.460> after<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> first<00:00:48.059> few<00:00:48.360> times<00:00:48.570> that

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
did find after the first few times that

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.010 
did find after the first few times that
there's<00:00:49.289> quite<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> lot<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.719> redness<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
there's quite a lot of redness and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.600 
there's quite a lot of redness and
blemishes<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.680> kind<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.980> came<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
blemishes that kind of came up to the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.180 
blemishes that kind of came up to the
surface<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:55.079> disappeared<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> bit

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
surface but they disappeared with a bit

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.069 
surface but they disappeared with a bit
of<00:00:56.219> perseverance<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.960> was

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
of perseverance and I think that was

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.740 
of perseverance and I think that was
just<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.440> impurities<00:00:59.600> coming<00:01:00.600> out

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
just really impurities coming out

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.709 
just really impurities coming out
because<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.530> was<00:01:01.649> working<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.280> well<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.300> since

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
because it was working so well and since

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.450 
because it was working so well and since

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
using this to clean my face obviously

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.210 
using this to clean my face obviously
you<00:01:38.549> can't<00:01:38.790> use<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.390> eye<00:01:39.479> area<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
you can't use this on the eye area I

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.520 
you can't use this on the eye area I
tend<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.369> take<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:43.079> under<00:01:43.409> where

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
tend to just take it to just under where

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.480 
tend to just take it to just under where
the<00:01:44.240> boning<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> cheekbone<00:01:46.189> because<00:01:47.189> that

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the boning is the cheekbone because that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.639 
the boning is the cheekbone because that
skin<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.270> sensitive<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.409> wouldn't

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
skin is kind of sensitive so I wouldn't

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.819 
skin is kind of sensitive so I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:51.259> my<00:01:52.259> verdict<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
recommend that but my verdict is that

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.679 
recommend that but my verdict is that
this<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.189> very<00:01:53.310> good<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.939> well<00:01:54.149> worth<00:01:54.390> it's
