00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 autumn 2014 is just around the corner 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.519
 and the organizers have some 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.400
 come up with new ideas 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.559
 as a good use historical innovations 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.809
 affect the course 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.970
 we have adjusted the opening 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.890
 visitor stream that means now from 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.650
 Monday to Saturday at 11 o'clock here 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.760
 the terrain going on only small adaptation 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.090
 because in the visitors actually already 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.830
 but we have some around it 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.009
 Innovations how to improve 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.020
 lighting in the entrance areas 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.640
 additional way for a bit 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.200
 designed the emergency exit situation 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 further improved that are so small 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.260
 innovations 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.270
 yes, but in the sum again 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.219
 contribute to that here yet 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.510
 it feels more comfortable and safer 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.879
 Of course , the innovations on the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.309
 The supply sector is new 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.750
 Rides with family tree of a forerunner 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.420
 for example, great families 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.280
 ride around the ride we are looking forward to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.320
 Looking forward to the updates it's nice for us 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.219
 again we succeeded here that we 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.670
 a bit tense 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.700
 but bring in also well-tried 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.470
 the wild mouse is again permanently super 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.570
 that the traditionalists are not the same 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.790
 need to ask a table before the visitors 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.010
 the new rides like the beach 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.619
 jumper the great gaudi the big one 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.689
 ghost train and the funny world however 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.580
 can try it applies to the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.740
 First of all, a parking lot too 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.330
 Find 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.729
 guy is just the official park 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.530
 We also follow the signposting guidance system 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.750
 specially for the fallfest with 1 attached 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.590
 if you follow it does not come very well 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.799
 rightly the construction site is the situation 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.880
 today so we are now with care 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.890
 there is more steam unfortunately 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.840
 has restricted less with the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.790
 Construction sites on the streets to do but 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.960
 josef must place the building site 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.060
 Unfortunately, we do not allow the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.670
 but to hold services is 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.979
 less dramatic because we pack one 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.079
 can dodge and there also one 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.830
 great location we have 2010 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.620
 ever 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.240
 have used on the visitor rush 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.910
 the organizers are great 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.070
 yes there is that he agrees 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.450
 years of safety concept that together 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.160
 worked out with the city of Rosenheim year 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.130
 That was always going on from year to year 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.380
 Year after year, it always tries 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.490
 still the individual adjusting screws too 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.020
 turn and you can do something like that 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.460
 improve where you maybe that something 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.620
 change what else can you do 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.270
 that is a process we are just like us 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.980
 are set up in total with all 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.140
 involved on a good way and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.820
 We also have good concept like 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.320
 we think we all hope so 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.840
 that it is never used that one 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.720
 it does not need it but we are happy 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.350
 of course, all accordingly 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.270
 to be prepared 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.360
 and what is the personal highlight 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.940
 the project manager klaus rotter in 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.620
 This year clearly on the opening 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.209
 so it's like we already have 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.730
 but they have different highlights 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.190
 really say on the opening but know 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.880
 always very special tingle is in 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.410
 The city ​​must be infected correctly, but 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.030
 Everyone is happy that finally 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.990
 and go 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.730
 of course we have the high tension 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.350
 that is exactly what is missing then of course 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.290
 even if it works once but happy 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.060
 this feeling just go in and go 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.640
 it is all prepared word and word 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.950
 everyone is really looking forward to it 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.630
 that for me a very colorful final spurt 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.269
 so while waiting for the 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.280
 Rosenheimer Herbstfest 2014 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.280
 Let's go on 30 august
