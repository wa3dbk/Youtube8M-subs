guide<00:00:44.100> lines<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.610> says<00:00:44.820> foam<00:00:45.090> tape<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.410> that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
guide lines it says foam tape so that

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.380 
guide lines it says foam tape so that
would<00:00:46.680> simply<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.910> peel<00:00:48.120> off<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> adhesive

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
would simply you peel off the adhesive

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.959 
would simply you peel off the adhesive
and<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.230> put<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.500> right<00:00:49.620> there<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.850> other

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and you put it right there the other

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.610 
and you put it right there the other
piece<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.239> foam<00:00:51.510> tape<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.960> gonna<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
piece of foam tape is gonna go on the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.729 
piece of foam tape is gonna go on the
wedge<00:00:53.539> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.840> how<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.260> piece<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.590> foam

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
wedge you can see how this piece of foam

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.340 
wedge you can see how this piece of foam
tape<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.239> contoured<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.750> fit<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.989> shape<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
tape is contoured to fit the shape of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.119 
tape is contoured to fit the shape of
our<00:00:58.469> wedge<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.969> would<00:01:00.090> go<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.270> there<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
our wedge so that would go on there and

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.759 
our wedge so that would go on there and
those<00:01:02.129> two<00:01:02.280> pieces<00:01:02.489> would<00:01:03.000> go<00:01:03.180> together<00:01:03.769> now

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
those two pieces would go together now

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.929 
those two pieces would go together now
we're<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> take<00:01:05.339> our<00:01:05.549> extended

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
we're going to take our extended

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.300 
we're going to take our extended
telomere<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:07.049> slide<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.500> over<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.979> mirror

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
telomere and slide it over the mirror

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.450 
telomere and slide it over the mirror
that's<00:01:08.460> attached<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.909> our<00:01:09.000> truck<00:01:10.280> well<00:01:11.280> make

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
that's attached to our truck well make

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.910 
sure that we have it pushed on all the
way<00:01:13.909> then<00:01:14.909> we'll<00:01:15.030> take<00:01:15.180> our<00:01:15.210> wedge<00:01:15.680> we<00:01:16.680> want<00:01:16.860> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
way then we'll take our wedge we want to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.740 
way then we'll take our wedge we want to
make<00:01:17.009> sure<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> side<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> hole<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
make sure that the side with the hole is

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.770 
make sure that the side with the hole is
the<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.049> sticking<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.560> towards<00:01:20.189> us<00:01:20.780> just

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the one sticking out towards us just

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.170 
the one sticking out towards us just
slide<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.200> place<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.790> can<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:24.090> from

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
slide that in place and you can see from

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.609 
slide that in place and you can see from
this<00:01:24.360> side<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> disappears<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.500> on

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
this side it kind of disappears but on

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.859 
this side it kind of disappears but on
the<00:01:25.710> other<00:01:25.830> side<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.820> sucks<00:01:27.150> up<00:01:27.299> next<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the other side it sucks up next to the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.210 
the other side it sucks up next to the
mirror<00:01:28.080> that's<00:01:28.200> attached<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> our<00:01:28.680> truck<00:01:28.979> so

mirror that's attached to our truck so
with<00:01:29.700> our<00:01:29.850> wedge<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.180> place<00:01:30.390> we'll<00:01:30.900> go<00:01:30.930> ahead

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
with our wedge in place we'll go ahead

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.069 
with our wedge in place we'll go ahead
and<00:01:31.140> take<00:01:31.259> our<00:01:31.470> screw<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.689> screw<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.810> into<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
and take our screw and screw it into the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.380 
and take our screw and screw it into the
hole<00:01:34.759> this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> apply<00:01:36.299> pressure

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
hole this is going to apply pressure

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
hole this is going to apply pressure
against<00:01:37.079> our<00:01:37.170> wedge<00:01:37.380> which<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
against our wedge which is going to
