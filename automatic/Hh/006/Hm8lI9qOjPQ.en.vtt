00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.950 
but I just hated that the hair quality
would<00:02:06.009> deteriorate<00:02:06.460> within<00:02:07.210> i<00:02:07.420> would<00:02:07.810> say

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
would deteriorate within i would say

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.690 
would deteriorate within i would say
probably<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.440> third<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:09.190> second<00:02:09.579> or<00:02:09.670> third

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700

the<00:02:52.860> fenders<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.430> work<00:02:53.670> with<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.910> get<00:02:54.180> a

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
the fenders that I work with and get a

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.760 
the fenders that I work with and get a
sense<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.570> them<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.990> she<00:02:55.380> seems<00:02:55.620> like<00:02:55.710> a

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
sense of them and she seems like a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.440 
sense of them and she seems like a
really<00:02:56.010> down-to-earth<00:02:56.220> person<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.240> if<00:02:57.330> you

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
really down-to-earth person so if you

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.120 
really down-to-earth person so if you
ever<00:02:57.600> have<00:02:57.810> any<00:02:57.840> palms<00:02:58.320> with<00:02:58.560> anything<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
ever have any palms with anything in the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.370 
ever have any palms with anything in the
hair<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.550> think<00:03:00.120> definitely<00:03:00.720> being<00:03:01.110> able<00:03:01.260> to

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
hair I think definitely being able to

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
hair I think definitely being able to
communicate<00:03:01.620> with<00:03:01.950> her<00:03:02.070> should<00:03:02.280> be<00:03:02.370> a

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
communicate with her should be a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.630 
communicate with her should be a
relatively<00:03:02.970> easy<00:03:03.300> thing<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.720> do<00:03:04.010> ok<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.070> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
relatively easy thing to do ok so the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.010 
relatively easy thing to do ok so the
one<00:03:05.820> downside<00:03:06.240> I<00:03:06.300> will<00:03:06.510> have<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.690> say<00:03:06.930> about

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
one downside I will have to say about

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.690 
one downside I will have to say about
this<00:03:07.230> hair<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:08.130> fact<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:08.670> is

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
this hair is the fact that it is

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.550 
this hair is the fact that it is
shedding<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:09.420> nobody's<00:03:09.990> business<00:03:10.230> like

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
shedding like nobody's business like

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.470 
shedding like nobody's business like
it's<00:03:10.920> not<00:03:11.040> tangling<00:03:11.520> really<00:03:11.880> but<00:03:12.330> it's

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
it's not tangling really but it's

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.680 
it's not tangling really but it's
majorly<00:03:12.990> majorly<00:03:13.740> shedding<00:03:14.300> so<00:03:15.300> much<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.660> that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
majorly majorly shedding so much so that
