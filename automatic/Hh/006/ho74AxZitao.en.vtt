what's interesting about this so you

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.530 
what's interesting about this so you
look<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> scales<00:00:34.980> they're<00:00:35.340> not<00:00:35.550> smooth

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
look at the scales they're not smooth

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.680 
look at the scales they're not smooth
they're<00:00:36.870> keeled<00:00:37.820> these<00:00:38.820> scales<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.480> some

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
they're keeled these scales have some

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.970 
they're keeled these scales have some
dimension<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.140> them<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.469> they<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> keel

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
dimension to them and they have a keel

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.430 
dimension to them and they have a keel
running<00:00:41.340> alongside<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:42.239> which<00:00:43.079> tells<00:00:43.350> me

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
running alongside them which tells me

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.240 
running alongside them which tells me
that<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.950> probably<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:45.030> neuro<00:00:45.989> dia<00:00:46.289> or<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that this is probably a neuro dia or a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.760 
that this is probably a neuro dia or a
nature<00:00:47.610> scene<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.910> some<00:00:48.059> kind<00:00:48.559> but<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.680> you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
nature scene of some kind but if you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
nature scene of some kind but if you
look<00:00:49.950> at<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.219> scales<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.789> its<00:00:50.910> eyes<00:00:53.300> now

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.490 
look at the scales on its eyes now
you'll<00:00:54.449> notice<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:54.960> got<00:00:55.079> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.379> a

detail the geography is rather

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.330 
detail the geography is rather
interesting<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> used<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.119> things<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.450> are

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
interesting so used to things that are

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.890 
interesting so used to things that are
incredibly<00:01:20.340> flat<00:01:21.590> when<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.680> actually<00:01:23.900> it's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
incredibly flat when you actually it's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.819 
incredibly flat when you actually it's
an<00:01:25.020> interesting<00:01:25.259> terrain<00:01:25.939> quite<00:01:26.939> nice<00:01:27.829> spent

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
an interesting terrain quite nice spent

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
a bit of time in South Carolina and this

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.700 
a bit of time in South Carolina and this
is<00:01:31.100> not<00:01:32.100> what<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.400> looks<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:33.530> Blue<00:01:34.530> Ridge

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710

snakes which I find prettier than the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.389 
snakes which I find prettier than the
Florida<00:01:43.200> water<00:01:43.470> snakes<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.280> too

-<00:04:40.240> even<00:04:40.510> captivity<00:04:40.870> which<00:04:41.230> was<00:04:41.380> real<00:04:41.530> nice<00:04:42.270> but

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
- even captivity which was real nice but

you<00:04:43.540> know<00:04:43.660> when<00:04:43.780> snakes<00:04:44.020> are<00:04:44.200> stressed<00:04:44.470> they

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
you know when snakes are stressed they

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.200 
you know when snakes are stressed they
just<00:04:44.830> won't<00:04:44.980> eat<00:04:45.160> that's<00:04:45.400> one<00:04:45.610> of<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:45.790> reasons

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
just won't eat that's one of the reasons

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
that these won't eat in captivity is

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.680 
that these won't eat in captivity is
because<00:04:49.090> they<00:04:49.240> just<00:04:49.480> want<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.810> go<00:04:51.540> let's<00:04:52.540> see

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
because they just want to go let's see

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.120 
because they just want to go let's see
right<00:04:52.720> now<00:04:53.020> actually<00:04:53.470> what<00:04:53.590> I'm<00:04:53.740> doing<00:04:54.010> right

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
right now actually what I'm doing right

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.890 
right now actually what I'm doing right
now<00:04:54.190> is<00:04:54.490> they're<00:04:54.610> doing<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:54.940> technique<00:04:55.660> that

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
now is they're doing a technique that

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.480 
now is they're doing a technique that
makes<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.320> snake<00:04:56.590> think<00:04:56.860> that<00:04:57.010> she's<00:04:57.220> getting

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
makes the snake think that she's getting

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.750 
makes the snake think that she's getting
away

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
away

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.910 
away
and<00:04:58.690> she's<00:04:58.990> think<00:04:59.200> she's<00:04:59.320> getting<00:04:59.560> away<00:04:59.650> she's

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
and she's think she's getting away she's

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.160 
and she's think she's getting away she's
not<00:05:00.100> gonna<00:05:00.250> turn<00:05:00.460> over<00:05:00.760> and<00:05:00.940> bite<00:05:01.090> me<00:05:01.270> because

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
not gonna turn over and bite me because

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.990 
not gonna turn over and bite me because
she's<00:05:02.680> moving<00:05:02.830> through<00:05:03.100> my<00:05:03.190> hands<00:05:03.550> she<00:05:03.730> thinks

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
she's moving through my hands she thinks

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.520 
she's moving through my hands she thinks
she's<00:05:04.180> moving<00:05:04.510> along<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:04.810> know<00:05:05.110> she's<00:05:05.350> making

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
she's moving along you know she's making

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.830 
she's moving along you know she's making
progress<00:05:05.680> but<00:05:06.370> in<00:05:06.490> fact<00:05:06.760> I<00:05:07.060> keep<00:05:07.480> pulling<00:05:07.660> her

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
progress but in fact I keep pulling her

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.160 
progress but in fact I keep pulling her
back<00:05:07.870> each<00:05:08.200> time<00:05:09.540> these<00:05:10.540> are<00:05:10.690> colubrids

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
back each time these are colubrids

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.150 
back each time these are colubrids
similar<00:05:12.100> to<00:05:12.280> the<00:05:12.520> rat<00:05:12.970> snake<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:13.480> corn<00:05:13.690> snake

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
similar to the rat snake and corn snake

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.110 
similar to the rat snake and corn snake
but<00:05:15.160> they're<00:05:15.280> most<00:05:15.460> similar<00:05:15.670> to<00:05:15.790> things<00:05:16.060> like

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
as far as different species you have

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.030 
as far as different species you have
different<00:05:22.960> like<00:05:23.080> speckled<00:05:23.500> racers<00:05:23.860> in

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
different like speckled racers in

iridescent<00:06:05.250> quality<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.270> those<00:06:06.389> scales

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
iridescent quality to those scales

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.640 
iridescent quality to those scales
versus<00:06:07.229> the<00:06:08.150> the<00:06:09.150> black<00:06:09.389> racer<00:06:09.780> which<00:06:10.440> is

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
versus the the black racer which is

mostly black as you can see you can see

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.420 
mostly black as you can see you can see
the<00:06:14.069> texture<00:06:14.430> the<00:06:14.520> scales<00:06:14.789> very<00:06:14.879> smooth<00:06:15.780> I

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
the texture the scales very smooth I

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.020 
the texture the scales very smooth I
mean<00:06:17.430> they<00:06:17.490> almost<00:06:17.610> look<00:06:17.819> like<00:06:17.879> they're

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
mean they almost look like they're
