favorite part of this case has to be

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.470 
favorite part of this case has to be
something<00:00:44.010> pretty<00:00:44.129> simple<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.820> would

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
something pretty simple and that would

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
something pretty simple and that would
be<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> buttons<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.770> these<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:47.010> plastic

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.119 
they do feel like metal and they work
great<00:00:52.140> these<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.590> probably<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> best

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
great these are probably the best

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.400 
great these are probably the best

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
buttons I know it's a small thing but

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.000 
buttons I know it's a small thing but
something<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.449> really<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.650> case

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
something I really like about this case

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.800 
something I really like about this case
now<00:01:05.700> another<00:01:05.880> small<00:01:06.210> thing<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.510> makes<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.689> big

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
now another small thing that makes a big

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.600 
now another small thing that makes a big
difference<00:01:07.200> would<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> back<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.490> got

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
difference would be the back it's got

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.820 
difference would be the back it's got
the<00:01:08.700> kind<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.970> perforated<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:10.020> dotted<00:01:10.619> or
