00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:16.860
 Growth survey is a tool to know rice and listen to the voice of rice 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:22.740
 Coefficient survey grass height survey 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:29.560
 And the example survey is the representative survey method 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:35.780
 Rice will continue to put out the leaves one by one to six days from five days until the flood 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:38.370
 Therefore , it is ideal to conduct a growth survey once a week 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.440
 At this time the coefficient 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 Examine the grass height example together 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.570
 Coefficient survey 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:55.290
 That is, how to count divisions 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:59.750
 If it is one piece of one's own beach from the sheath of teeth, it counts with one 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.750
 I will record the coefficient of the stock 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:19.270
 It is a photograph of the ripening stage of 3 element test using rice 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:25.360
 The leftmost is no fertilizer, but in the paddy field it will grow to such an extent that even six materials will be included in the water 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:30.040
 There is a big difference compared to the next adoption speed 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.030
 The rice which does not do the nitrogen in the middle grows badly 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.580
 The leaves have turned yellow 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.630
 Food that did not do next phosphoric acid 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.820
 The blue color is darker tillering less teeth 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.580
 It is a feature that the product does not come true 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.880
 If you do not borrow the rightmost 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.880
 The lower leaves are dead and yellow 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:06.010
 This is a comparison of 3 elements and 9 toms of rice 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.920
 6 right choking is beach yellow 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.920
 The condition is also extremely low 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.190
 uh 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.090
 In rice fields that do not collect straw, there are concerns such as floating rings, etc. 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.260
 Fog the length of al the 15 cm 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.159
 Slow down the rotary speed in late work 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.360
 That Sato-chan when even the basic 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:49.250
 pto plow at speed 380 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.250
 Hara will be plowed clean 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:03.510
 And because in the incoming water from puddling three days before La firmly water 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.510
 There is no worry of the float, etc. 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.370
 Hmm 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:19.400
 Originally a rice field has been made to the guys moist land, such as seep water from the mountains 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.720
 Such a traditional kite 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:29.430
 It is called wet field 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:31.670
 Fish and frogs on the street etc. are creatures that have grown up in this misstep and the small waterways around it 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.670
 is 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:42.710
 However, the wet field gets wet 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.710
 The work of Thailand is of course one 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:52.780
 If this is a well drained rice field soybeans or vegetables instead of dogs 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:59.110
 You can also make a mock game 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:01.700
 To rice fields that can control the ugly nature so that it can be dried anytime after the war by actual measurement 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.190
 Remodeling has started 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.910
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:15.760
 I say this exploration Tanda 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:15.760
 A number of benefits have been brought about, such as the increase in the yield of rice by perfection
