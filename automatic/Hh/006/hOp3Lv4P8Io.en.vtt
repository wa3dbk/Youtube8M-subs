00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.560 
out there and then we have to think
about<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.710> we're<00:01:16.830> gonna<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.430> far<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
about what we're gonna do is far you

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
about what we're gonna do is far you
know<00:01:18.689> as<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> tank<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> square

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
know as the tank but I like the square

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.710 
know as the tank but I like the square
tanks<00:01:20.430> better<00:01:20.610> well<00:01:21.060> there<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> square<00:01:21.570> one

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
tanks better well there is a square one

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.880 
tanks better well there is a square one
too<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.020> put<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.619> run<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
too and put in there but if we run the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.280 
too and put in there but if we run the
square<00:01:23.100> tanks<00:01:23.430> we're<00:01:23.580> gonna<00:01:23.700> run<00:01:23.880> into<00:01:24.259> well

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
square tanks we're gonna run into well

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.200 
square tanks we're gonna run into well
engine<00:01:25.650> clearances<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.340> specific<00:01:26.970> tank

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
engine clearances for that specific tank

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.670 
engine clearances for that specific tank
yes<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.750> think<00:01:27.930> would<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> problem<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.590> we

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
yes I think would be a problem but if we

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.679 
yes I think would be a problem but if we
can<00:01:28.829> find<00:01:29.009> another<00:01:29.189> tank<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.820> was<00:01:29.939> really

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
can find another tank that was really

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.179 
can find another tank that was really
shallow<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.320> these<00:01:31.500> are<00:01:31.680> beside<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
shallow like these are beside the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.530 
shallow like these are beside the
squared<00:01:32.430> edges<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.970> think<00:01:33.270> it'd<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.390> better

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
squared edges I think it'd be better

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.700 
squared edges I think it'd be better
because<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.840> really<00:01:33.990> brings<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.320> Street

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
because it really brings out that Street

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.380 
because it really brings out that Street
track<00:01:34.950> look<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.430> rather<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.240> out<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
track look to it rather just go out and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.120 
track look to it rather just go out and
just<00:01:36.600> find<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.869> tank<00:01:37.049> modified<00:01:37.590> slate<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
just find a tank modified slate just to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.499 
just find a tank modified slate just to
make<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> fit<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.880> gonna<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.240> cut<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
make it fit not gonna have to cut it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.480 
make it fit not gonna have to cut it
