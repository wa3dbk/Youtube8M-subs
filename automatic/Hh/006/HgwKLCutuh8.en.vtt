while<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.680> ridiculous

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
while I do think it's a ridiculous

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.550 
while I do think it's a ridiculous
exercise<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.869> respect<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
exercise I do have a respect and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.130 
exercise I do have a respect and
understanding<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.939> takes<00:01:57.240> some<00:01:57.450> some

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
understanding for it it takes some some

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.289 
understanding for it it takes some some
good<00:01:58.350> mobility<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.430> takes<00:01:59.700> some<00:01:59.850> solid

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
good mobility it takes some solid

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.139 
good mobility it takes some solid
strength<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.860> some<00:02:02.159> ways<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
strength and in some ways it is it is a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.840 
strength and in some ways it is it is a
way<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.500> test<00:02:04.500> people<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.219> terms<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.640> their

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
way to test people out in terms of their

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.670 
way to test people out in terms of their
strength<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.420> mobility<00:02:06.689> kind<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.350> all<00:02:07.530> at<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
strength and mobility kind of all at the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.969 
strength and mobility kind of all at the
same<00:02:07.890> time<00:02:08.509> in<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.660> powerlifting<00:02:10.319> squat<00:02:10.679> you

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
same time in a powerlifting squat you

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.930 
same time in a powerlifting squat you
know<00:02:11.069> we're<00:02:11.220> going<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> much<00:02:11.700> wider

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
know we're going with a much wider

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.940 
know we're going with a much wider
stance<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.959> range<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.319> motion<00:02:13.530> is

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
stance the range of motion is

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.930 
stance the range of motion is
shortened<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.680> olympic-style<00:02:17.430> squat

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
shortened and in a olympic-style squat

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.610 
shortened and in a olympic-style squat
oftentimes<00:02:18.510> those<00:02:18.690> guys<00:02:18.930> are<00:02:19.110> lifting<00:02:19.410> raw

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
oftentimes those guys are lifting raw

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.009 
oftentimes those guys are lifting raw
and<00:02:19.950> they're<00:02:20.730> kind<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.030> rebounding<00:02:21.629> off<00:02:21.810> their

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
and they're kind of rebounding off their

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.199 
and they're kind of rebounding off their
own<00:02:22.140> body<00:02:22.440> taking<00:02:23.310> advantage<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.879> what<00:02:24.060> they

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
own body taking advantage of what they

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.820 
own body taking advantage of what they
can<00:02:24.390> take<00:02:24.540> advantage<00:02:24.599> of<00:02:25.230> while<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.560> power

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
can take advantage of while the power

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.259 
can take advantage of while the power
lifter<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.280> taking<00:02:26.640> advantage<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:27.120> their

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
lifter is taking advantage of their

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.479 
lifter is taking advantage of their
power<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.569> thing<00:02:27.840> here<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.290> going<00:02:28.980> out<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:29.430> a

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
power to thing here and going out with a

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.420 
power to thing here and going out with a
wider<00:02:29.700> stance<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.300> really<00:02:30.599> all<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
wider stance so really all it is the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.630 
wider stance so really all it is the
misunderstanding<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:35.130> know<00:02:35.220> can't<00:02:35.550> we

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
misunderstanding and you know can't we

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.040 
misunderstanding and you know can't we
all<00:02:35.790> just<00:02:35.819> get<00:02:36.090> along<00:02:36.150> as<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.720> Rodney<00:02:36.989> King

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
need to all stick together because there

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.690 
need to all stick together because there
ain't<00:02:49.170> really<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.410> many<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.980> us<00:02:50.130> not<00:02:50.549> that

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
ain't really that many of us not that

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.339 
ain't really that many of us not that
many<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.030> us<00:02:51.209> squat<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:51.810> deadlift<00:02:52.140> and

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
many of us squat and deadlift and

and so we all need to just stick

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.059 
and so we all need to just stick
together<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.880> band<00:02:57.090> together<00:02:57.239> if<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:58.410> if<00:02:58.920> you

things squat then do one and see how

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.530 
things squat then do one and see how
hard<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.319> neither<00:03:11.190> sport<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.880> either<00:03:12.060> easy

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
hard it is neither sport is either easy

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.170 
hard it is neither sport is either easy
they're<00:03:12.840> both<00:03:13.049> hard<00:03:13.319> they<00:03:13.530> both<00:03:14.030> have<00:03:15.030> their

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
they're both hard they both have their

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.530 
they're both hard they both have their
own<00:03:15.239> demands<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:17.000> again<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.299> think

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
own demands and again I just think

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.870 
own demands and again I just think
people<00:03:19.230> just<00:03:19.319> need<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.639> have<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:20.670> better

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
people just need to have a better

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.160 
people just need to have a better
understanding<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.630> them<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.870> only<00:03:22.019> way<00:03:22.109> to

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
understanding of them the only way to

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.990 
understanding of them the only way to
understand<00:03:22.709> them<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.100> actually<00:03:23.280> do<00:03:23.819> them

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
understand them is to actually do them

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.180 
understand them is to actually do them
so<00:03:24.870> if<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.079> want<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.410> talk<00:03:25.799> about<00:03:25.859> an

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
so if you want to talk about an

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.370 
so if you want to talk about an
Olympic<00:03:26.549> olympic-style<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.810> Olympic<00:03:28.200> style

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
Olympic olympic-style this Olympic style

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.220 
Olympic olympic-style this Olympic style
that<00:03:28.709> then<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:30.090> would<00:03:30.299> assume<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.079> would

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
that then I would assume that you would

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.509 
that then I would assume that you would
have<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.380> background<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.340> you've

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
have a background in it and that you've

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.490 
have a background in it and that you've
done<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.850> before<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.359> that's<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.230> only<00:03:34.410> way
