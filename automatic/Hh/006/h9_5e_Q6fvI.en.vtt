00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
okay tonight we're doing a little bit of

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.799 
okay tonight we're doing a little bit of
wiring<00:00:04.290> here<00:00:04.710> we've<00:00:04.890> got<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:08.450> battery<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.660> main

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
wiring here we've got a battery the main

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.270 
wiring here we've got a battery the main
battery<00:00:10.139> cable<00:00:10.440> coming<00:00:10.590> out<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.860> starter

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
battery cable coming out of the starter

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.749 
battery cable coming out of the starter
and<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:12.389> will<00:00:12.540> be<00:00:13.070> soldering<00:00:14.070> an<00:00:14.280> end<00:00:14.429> on<00:00:14.610> it

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and it will be soldering an end on it

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.200 
and it will be soldering an end on it
here<00:00:14.940> we've<00:00:15.330> got<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> 1<00:00:16.289> gauge<00:00:16.529> wire<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.210> 1

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
here we've got a 1 gauge wire and 1

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.689 
here we've got a 1 gauge wire and 1
gauge<00:00:18.439> copper<00:00:19.439> connector<00:00:20.010> that's<00:00:20.160> chrome

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
gauge copper connector that's chrome

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.880 
gauge copper connector that's chrome
plating<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> outside<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.960> we're<00:00:22.769> gonna

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
plating on the outside so we're gonna

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.890 
plating on the outside so we're gonna
solder<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:23.910> get<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.619> little<00:00:25.619> hole<00:00:25.830> cut

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
solder this on we get a little hole cut

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.769 
solder this on we get a little hole cut
in<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> connector<00:00:28.590> there<00:00:29.000> to<00:00:30.000> let<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> solder

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
in the connector there to let the solder

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.659 
in the connector there to let the solder
go<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.410> we'll<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.949> putting<00:00:32.130> heat<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
go in and we'll be putting heat on the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.440 
go in and we'll be putting heat on the
backside<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.700> to<00:00:35.700> pull<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> solder

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
backside of it and to pull the solder

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.880 
backside of it and to pull the solder
into<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.870> we'll<00:00:37.110> go<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.320> get<00:00:37.469> started<00:00:37.770> now

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
into this we'll go and get started now

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.479 
into this we'll go and get started now
also<00:00:38.640> got<00:00:38.790> some<00:00:38.969> heat-shrink<00:00:40.309> black<00:00:41.309> heat

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
also got some heat-shrink black heat

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.790 
also got some heat-shrink black heat
