the kitchen or whatever symbols you
could<00:00:41.910> use<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.390> know<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.690> cut<00:00:43.320> them<00:00:43.469> out<00:00:43.530> 2

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
could use I don't know I cut them out 2

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
could use I don't know I cut them out 2
6<00:00:44.010> 7<00:00:44.250> 8<00:00:44.579> 9<00:00:45.030> inches<00:00:46.370> they're<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> little<00:00:47.640> bit

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
6 7 8 9 inches they're a little bit

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.180 
6 7 8 9 inches they're a little bit
smaller<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.620> concentrate<00:00:49.829> on

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
smaller so that I'm I can concentrate on

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.340 
smaller so that I'm I can concentrate on
accuracy<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.059> well<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.989> were<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.170> take

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
accuracy as well if you were to take

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.900 
accuracy as well if you were to take
this<00:00:52.500> pad<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.100> turn<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> other<00:00:53.520> way<00:00:53.730> you

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
this pad and turn it the other way you

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.689 
this pad and turn it the other way you
get<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.510> face<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.949> design<00:00:56.370> that's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
get the face of the design that's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.369 
get the face of the design that's
actually<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> pad<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.870> wanted<00:00:58.230> this

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
actually on the pad I wanted this

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.960 
actually on the pad I wanted this
underside<00:00:59.180> the<00:01:00.180> pads<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.719> very<00:01:00.750> dead<00:01:04.909> let<00:01:05.909> me

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
underside the pads are very dead let me

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.940 
underside the pads are very dead let me
get<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.930> bounce<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.650> which<00:01:07.799> you'll

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
get one bounce out of it which you'll

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.679 
get one bounce out of it which you'll
get<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.400> almost<00:01:08.670> anything<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.450> drop<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
get out of almost anything you drop a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.050 
get out of almost anything you drop a
stick<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.200> even<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> pillow<00:01:10.799> bounce<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.939> little

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
stick on even a pillow bounce a little

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.020 
stick on even a pillow bounce a little
bit<00:01:12.950> but<00:01:13.950> they're<00:01:14.070> basically<00:01:14.400> dead<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.909> don't

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
bit but they're basically dead you don't

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.719 
bit but they're basically dead you don't
get<00:01:15.180> any<00:01:15.360> any<00:01:16.080> bounce<00:01:16.350> which<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.740> want<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.159> wanted

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
get any any bounce which I want I wanted

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.359 
get any any bounce which I want I wanted
that<00:01:17.909> something<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.630> was<00:01:18.780> very<00:01:19.020> dense<00:01:19.860> like

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that something that was very dense like

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.870 
that something that was very dense like
that<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:22.939> could<00:01:23.939> work<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.240> fingers<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
that so that I could work on fingers and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.630 
that so that I could work on fingers and
wrists<00:01:27.380> not<00:01:28.380> using<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> bounce<00:01:29.040> off<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> drum

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
wrists not using the bounce off a drum

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.810 
wrists not using the bounce off a drum
head<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.920> there's<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.979> snare<00:01:32.400> rim<00:01:32.640> you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
head at all and there's a snare rim you

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.490 
head at all and there's a snare rim you
can't<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> rim<00:01:33.540> or<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.049> drum<00:01:34.290> hoop

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
can't see the rim or just a drum hoop

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.560 
can't see the rim or just a drum hoop
it's<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.799> 13<00:01:35.159> inch<00:01:35.310> hoop<00:01:35.520> under<00:01:35.850> here<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.540> I

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it's a 13 inch hoop under here and I

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.929 
it's a 13 inch hoop under here and I
just<00:01:36.659> screwed<00:01:37.290> right<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> plywood<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
just screwed right to the plywood and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.789 
just screwed right to the plywood and
that<00:01:39.420> gets<00:01:39.659> something<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> snare<00:01:40.530> stand

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
that gets something for the snare stand

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.819 
that gets something for the snare stand
to<00:01:41.009> hold<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.329> bass<00:01:42.540> drum<00:01:42.899> pad<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.649> just

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
to hold on to the bass drum pad is just

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.380 
to hold on to the bass drum pad is just
like<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> 2<00:01:44.939> by<00:01:45.119> 6<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.689> couple<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.380> two<00:01:46.500> by<00:01:46.680> fours<00:01:47.040> I

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
like a 2 by 6 a couple of two by fours I

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.940 
like a 2 by 6 a couple of two by fours I
also<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.899> also<00:01:49.049> put<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.799> see

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
also have I also put on if you can see

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.380 
also have I also put on if you can see
in<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.159> video<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.549> there's<00:01:50.759> also<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.060> shelf

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
in the video but there's also a shelf

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.410 
in the video but there's also a shelf
bracket<00:01:51.780> there<00:01:52.250> which<00:01:53.250> kind<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.579> makes<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
bracket there which kind of makes it a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.450 
bracket there which kind of makes it a
little<00:01:54.540> more<00:01:54.720> stable<00:01:55.100> but<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.280> all

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
little more stable but it's just all

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
little more stable but it's just all
wood<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.939> was<00:01:57.060> hanging<00:01:57.299> around<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.899> pads

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
wood that was hanging around the pads

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.170 
wood that was hanging around the pads
are<00:01:59.719> weather<00:02:00.719> stripping<00:02:01.549> strips<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.909> cut

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
are weather stripping strips that I cut

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.749 
are weather stripping strips that I cut
and<00:02:03.420> there's<00:02:04.380> two<00:02:04.560> layers<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:05.009> them<00:02:05.369> with<00:02:05.549> some

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
and there's two layers of them with some

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
how I developed this idea I was out of

state I wanted to practice on something

state I wanted to practice on something
I<00:03:01.110> didn't<00:03:01.709> want<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.890> like<00:03:02.010> buy<00:03:02.280> anything<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:03.420> was

going<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.020> be<00:03:04.080> expensive<00:03:04.520> so<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.550> made<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.239> and

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
going to be expensive so I made this and

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.420 
going to be expensive so I made this and
I<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.590> take<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:07.980> around<00:03:08.280> like<00:03:08.370> a

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
I can just take this around like a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.979 
I can just take this around like a
suitcase<00:03:08.640> if<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.000> want<00:03:09.209> anywhere<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.570> go<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.900> it

suitcase if I want anywhere I go and it

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.630 
suitcase if I want anywhere I go and it
gives<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> range<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.739> motion<00:03:13.489> even<00:03:14.489> if<00:03:14.550> you

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
gives you a range of motion even if you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.400 
gives you a range of motion even if you
didn't<00:03:14.850> take<00:03:14.940> your<00:03:15.000> bass<00:03:15.270> drum<00:03:15.300> pedals<00:03:16.260> with

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
didn't take your bass drum pedals with

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.039 
didn't take your bass drum pedals with
you<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:17.280> still<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:17.820> know<00:03:17.850> work<00:03:18.630> out<00:03:18.810> your

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
you you still you know work out your

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:28.460 
you you still you know work out your
hands<00:03:26.600> so<00:03:27.600> that's<00:03:27.780> what<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:27.989> sounds<00:03:28.200> like<00:03:28.260> with

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
hands so that's what it sounds like with

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.300 
hands so that's what it sounds like with
five<00:03:28.680> days<00:03:29.450> these<00:03:30.450> are<00:03:30.600> five<00:03:30.780> bees<00:03:34.160> not<00:03:35.160> a--not

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
five days these are five bees not a--not

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.430 
five days these are five bees not a--not
if<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.489> can<00:03:35.670> see<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.030> indentation<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:37.019> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
if you can see the indentation that the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.020 
if you can see the indentation that the
stick<00:03:37.680> makes<00:03:37.950> then<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.280> comes<00:03:38.430> right<00:03:38.610> back<00:03:38.760> up

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
stick makes then it comes right back up

00:03:39.030 --> 00:04:01.589 
stick makes then it comes right back up
sounds<00:03:39.780> like<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.989> memory<00:03:40.320> foam

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.800 

so<00:04:02.599> that's<00:04:02.780> five<00:04:02.989> bees<00:04:04.120> these<00:04:05.120> are<00:04:05.299> two<00:04:05.450> bees<00:04:05.629> a

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
so that's five bees these are two bees a

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:32.830 
so that's five bees these are two bees a
little<00:04:06.109> heavier<00:04:29.169> okay<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.910> these<00:04:32.270> are<00:04:32.330> the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
little heavier okay and these are the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.020 
little heavier okay and these are the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.770 

and<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.210> might<00:04:41.360> hear<00:04:41.539> a<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.960> deeper<00:04:42.919> tone

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
and you might hear a a deeper tone

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
and you might hear a a deeper tone
because<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:44.960> weight<00:04:45.169> of<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.380> stick<00:04:45.620> but

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
because of the weight of the stick but

00:04:45.800 --> 00:05:19.200 
because of the weight of the stick but
it's<00:04:45.889> not<00:04:46.039> really<00:04:46.280> any<00:04:46.430> louder<00:05:17.620> here<00:05:18.620> you<00:05:18.680> go

but that doesn't mean

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.029 
but that doesn't mean
small<00:06:07.840> pads<00:06:08.139> earlier<00:06:08.499> but<00:06:08.650> that<00:06:08.680> doesn't<00:06:08.979> mean

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
small pads earlier but that doesn't mean

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.249
