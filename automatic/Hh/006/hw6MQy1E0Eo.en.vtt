 220 musicians and 70 dancers make up 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.520
 one of the school musical bands 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.530
 Mexico's most recognized marching 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.840
 high school dolphins band 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.029
 general 5 what to say of the members 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.100
 of this band belong to her is a 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.230
 unique experience that allows not only 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.630
 develop the musical aspect but 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.100
 also reinforce the values ​​good is 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.410
 a great experience because 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.350
 you represent your country more than anything is not 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.870
 a set of people who have to 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.270
 be always working by throwing 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.180
 you really want what I like is that 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.739
 we are all very close or in the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.780
 work has to be in a team so that 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.180
 things go well because it's a 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.070
 very unforgettable experience because 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.379
 apart from that you live with many 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.330
 people the band is already forming as 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.430
 if it was your family because it has been 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.530
 spent the longest time of life and your life 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.150
 can you say and I 'm going to 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.250
 finish as well as that more confidence and 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.379
 enjoyed a lot when you are with them 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.150
 and already outside the countries, we have 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.730
 traveled well in my case I have traveled to 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.890
 Holland 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.110
 Well, that 's very nice, apart from that 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.260
 you can not forget apart from that is 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.540
 very nice because you did not have that because 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.270
 you're always going with them and yes 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.810
 as if you were with your family as it has 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.190
 been a super father experience because 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.910
 here is more than anything what is 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.330
 the coexistence you find friends not only 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:35.110
 those of the school but others that then 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.690
 maybe they already left that they would throw many 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.450
 knowledge or you learn here 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.910
 countless things that is not just music 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.160
 maybe later you can learn values 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.050
 in addition the musical director of the band 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.180
 jesus emmanuel mendoza commented that 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.070
 they hope that they will be supported because not only is 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.260
 support the dolphin band but the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.120
 culture in general and contribute to 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.070
 young people do not do other things that 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.620
 deteriorate society for this moment 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.220
 an economic support 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.220
 there is not 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.690
 we are looking for a way to 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.750
 that they know what we are 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.590
 doing to see if you can give that 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.270
 support because they do not support anything else 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.490
 dolphins if they are not supporting the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.580
 culture because dolphins has been a 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.580
 platform for many schools to 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.550
 create bands and this becomes 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.580
 a habit for young people to 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.650
 come back and awaken your interest in this 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.980
 type of groupings and do not do other 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.420
 things that deteriorate society the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.190
 next trip they will make to 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.380
 alien will be california at 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.570

 very successful because it is really 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.420
