00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
because I have a wallet so I don't

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.610 
because I have a wallet so I don't
really<00:00:50.309> need<00:00:50.579> an<00:00:51.180> ID<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.930> don't<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.230> LAN

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
really need an ID and I don't have LAN

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.709 
really need an ID and I don't have LAN
yard<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:53.489> I'm<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:53.820> at<00:00:54.059> college<00:00:54.270> yet<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
yard because I'm not at college yet and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.060 
yard because I'm not at college yet and
apparently<00:00:54.989> that's<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.289> big<00:00:55.440> thing<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.800> do<00:00:55.920> in

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
apparently that's a big thing you do in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.849 
apparently that's a big thing you do in
college<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.640> maybe<00:00:56.969> I'll<00:00:57.149> pick<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.600> up<00:00:57.859> so

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
college so maybe I'll pick that up so

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.020 
college so maybe I'll pick that up so
that<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.780> puppy<00:01:01.260> fields<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.850> next

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that is in puppy fields so the next

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.710 
that is in puppy fields so the next
thing<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.300> got<00:01:03.329> when<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> went<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.680> mall<00:01:05.720> it's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
thing I got when I went to the mall it's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.270 
thing I got when I went to the mall it's
they're<00:01:06.990> bigger<00:01:07.260> mall<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> one

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
they're bigger mall so it's not the one

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.080 
they're bigger mall so it's not the one
closest<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.850> me<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.119> takes<00:01:09.390> about<00:01:09.570> an<00:01:10.020> hour<00:01:11.090> so

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
closest to me it takes about an hour so

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.570 
closest to me it takes about an hour so
to<00:01:12.119> get<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:14.100> has<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.280> Vera

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
to get to this one and it has a Vera

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.190 
to get to this one and it has a Vera
Bradley<00:01:14.909> store<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.810> I've<00:01:15.960> never

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.990 
Bradley store in it and I've never
really<00:01:16.500> been<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.070> severe<00:01:17.460> Bradley<00:01:17.850> that

much at least when I was in high school

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
much at least when I was in high school
because<00:01:19.920> all<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.939> patterns<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.600> like

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
because all the patterns and all like

the styles that I did see were very much

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.550 
the styles that I did see were very much
the<00:01:24.060> same<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.360> most<00:01:24.750> people<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.290> school

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the same like most people and my school

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.539 
had on the backpacks they always had
them<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.140> patterns<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.619> didn't<00:01:28.829> really<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
them in patterns I didn't really like I

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.819

had that for a while so I wasn't really
into<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.700> much<00:01:39.200> until<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.710> went<00:01:40.979> to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
into it that much until like I went to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.440 
into it that much until like I went to
the<00:01:41.189> actual<00:01:41.579> store<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.970> saw<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.240> there's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the actual store and saw that there's

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.700 
the actual store and saw that there's
different<00:01:42.780> things<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> went<00:01:43.590> online

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
different things and then I went online

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.020 
different things and then I went online
and<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.189> saw<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.490> there<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.759> even<00:01:45.000> more

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
and I saw that there is even more

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.380 
and I saw that there is even more
patterns<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.729> that's<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> really<00:01:48.149> started

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
patterns so that's when I really started

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.819 
patterns so that's when I really started
getting<00:01:48.509> into<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> that's<00:01:49.439> why<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> have

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
getting into it and that's why I have

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.980 
getting into it and that's why I have
all<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.130> stuff<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.149> back<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.840> point

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
all this stuff now so back to the point

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.560 
all this stuff now so back to the point
I<00:01:52.229> went<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.130> mall<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:54.060> wanted<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.420> get<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
I went to the mall and I wanted to get a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.530 
I went to the mall and I wanted to get a
case<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:56.280> phone<00:01:56.310> because<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.270> don't<00:01:57.420> really

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
case for my phone because I don't really

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.899 
case for my phone because I don't really
like<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.990> cases<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:58.530> come<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.280> I

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
like the cases that they come with and I

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.550

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
don't like just leaving it out because

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.100 
don't like just leaving it out because
the<00:02:01.710> maids<00:02:01.890> shipped<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.689> gets

set so I got the coin purse in the hope
garden<00:02:11.680> pattern<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.270> small<00:02:13.540> enough

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
garden pattern and it's small enough

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.030 
garden pattern and it's small enough
that<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.110> phone<00:02:14.290> just<00:02:14.440> fits<00:02:14.680> right<00:02:14.830> inside

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040

that the phone just fits right inside
really<00:02:15.550> snugly<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.630> then<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:17.200> the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
really snugly and then this is the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.080 
really snugly and then this is the
inside<00:02:17.680> pattern<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.130> didn't<00:02:18.370> show<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.880> um

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
because I turned 18 recently so I was

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.510 
because I turned 18 recently so I was
able<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.140> close<00:03:23.650> my<00:03:23.680> savings<00:03:24.160> account<00:03:24.280> and

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
then open up a checking account and so I

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.650 
then open up a checking account and so I
got<00:03:26.020> a<00:03:26.050> debit<00:03:26.260> card<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.489> was<00:03:27.660> really

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
got a debit card and so I was really

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.210 
got a debit card and so I was really
wanting<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:29.080> make<00:03:29.230> like<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.500> first<00:03:30.010> big

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
wanting to make like the first big

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.220

purchase<00:03:30.489> with<00:03:31.090> my<00:03:31.239> debit<00:03:31.420> card<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.020> thought

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
purchase with my debit card so I thought

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.199 
purchase with my debit card so I thought
why<00:03:32.470> not<00:03:32.530> go<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.250> Vera<00:03:33.459> Bradley<00:03:33.640> comm<00:03:34.180> and

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
why not go to the Vera Bradley comm and

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.240 
why not go to the Vera Bradley comm and
see<00:03:34.510> what<00:03:34.630> they<00:03:34.720> have<00:03:34.870> there<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:36.010> I

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
see what they have there and so I

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.310
