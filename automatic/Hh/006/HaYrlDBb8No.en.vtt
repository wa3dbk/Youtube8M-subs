you<00:01:48.860> don't<00:01:48.890> have<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.189> cut<00:01:49.340> them<00:01:49.430> in<00:01:49.520> half

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
you don't have to cut them in half

you don't have to cut them in half
before<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.060> slicing<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.479> can<00:01:50.600> put<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.840> full

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
before you slicing you can put the full

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.160 
before you slicing you can put the full
bits<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.500> cheese<00:01:51.710> on<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.189> wrong<00:01:52.720> feet<00:01:53.720> tray

the slices and then over here you set

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.229 
the slices and then over here you set

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
slices and how it works is your tray if

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.720 
slices and how it works is your tray if
you<00:02:35.269> put<00:02:35.540> your<00:02:35.720> tray<00:02:35.900> up<00:02:35.930> when<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.260> start<00:02:36.730> you

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
you put your tray up when you start you

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.860 
you put your tray up when you start you
set<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:39.950> first<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.340> two

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
set this and this is the first of two

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.229 
set this and this is the first of two
switches<00:02:41.870> your<00:02:42.350> other<00:02:42.500> switches<00:02:42.950> off<00:02:43.190> as<00:02:44.090> a

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
double start to pull this one up first

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.699 
double start to pull this one up first
because<00:02:47.209> when<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.780> meat<00:02:47.959> goes<00:02:48.200> down<00:02:48.440> this

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
because when the meat goes down this

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.180 
because when the meat goes down this
will<00:02:49.180> automatically<00:02:50.180> drop<00:02:50.480> down<00:02:50.859> slowly<00:02:51.859> with

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
will automatically drop down slowly with

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.509 
will automatically drop down slowly with
each<00:02:52.370> slice<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.269> stack<00:02:54.130> until<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.220> get<00:02:55.370> to

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
each slice and stack until you get to

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.550 
each slice and stack until you get to
the<00:02:55.609> amount<00:02:55.940> of<00:02:56.060> slices<00:02:56.840> you've<00:02:56.989> set<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.290> to

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
the amount of slices you've set it to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.500 
the amount of slices you've set it to
and<00:02:57.829> then<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.040> hits<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.000> switch<00:02:59.329> and

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
and then it hits that switch and

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.840 
and then it hits that switch and
automatically<00:03:00.230> shuts<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.650> Machine<00:03:00.680> off<00:03:01.220> so

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
automatically shuts the Machine off so

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.920 
automatically shuts the Machine off so
we're<00:03:02.000> going<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.150> do<00:03:02.269> right<00:03:02.480> now<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.810> we're

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
we're going to do right now is we're

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.360 
we're going to do right now is we're
going<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.079> start<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.470> up<00:03:03.560> we<00:03:03.739> have<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.100> switch

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
going to start it up we have that switch

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.699 
going to start it up we have that switch
up<00:03:04.549> we<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.819> your<00:03:04.970> table<00:03:05.150> up<00:03:05.450> over<00:03:06.319> here<00:03:06.530> is

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
up we have your table up over here is

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.580 
up we have your table up over here is
where<00:03:07.030> your<00:03:08.030> red<00:03:08.269> light<00:03:08.480> is<00:03:08.690> on<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.260> we're

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
where your red light is on and we're

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.130 
where your red light is on and we're
going<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.769> turn<00:03:09.950> on

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
going to turn on

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.600 
going to turn on
we're<00:03:12.770> gonna<00:03:12.860> watch<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.190> go<00:03:13.310> through<00:03:13.340> its

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
we're gonna watch it go through its

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.210 
we're gonna watch it go through its
process<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.300> you<00:03:14.360> can<00:03:14.480> see<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.780> table<00:03:15.260> as<00:03:15.560> it

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
process and you can see the table as it

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.160 
process and you can see the table as it
brings<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:17.120> meat<00:03:17.270> around<00:03:17.600> or<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.930> cheese

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
brings the meat around or the cheese

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.470 
brings the meat around or the cheese
it's<00:03:18.560> lat<00:03:18.800> slices<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.550> stacks<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:20.000> very<00:03:20.210> neatly

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
it's lat slices it stacks it very neatly

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.220 
it's lat slices it stacks it very neatly
these<00:03:21.440> things<00:03:21.680> work<00:03:21.860> great<00:03:22.160> on<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:23.720> tray<00:03:23.960> and

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
these things work great on the tray and

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.270 
these things work great on the tray and
the<00:03:24.290> new<00:03:24.410> tray<00:03:24.620> you'll<00:03:24.830> see<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.070> tray

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
the new tray you'll see the tray

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.470 
the new tray you'll see the tray
dropping<00:03:25.790> down<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:27.530> when<00:03:27.770> it<00:03:27.800> gets<00:03:28.070> down<00:03:28.250> to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
dropping down and when it gets down to

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.360 
dropping down and when it gets down to
the<00:03:29.480> number<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.870> slices<00:03:30.170> you've<00:03:30.530> said<00:03:30.830> here

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
the number of slices you've said here

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.760 
the number of slices you've said here
you'll<00:03:32.330> see<00:03:32.570> it<00:03:32.660> automatically<00:03:33.230> shuts<00:03:33.620> the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
you'll see it automatically shuts the

you'll see it automatically shuts the
Machine<00:03:33.800> off<00:03:35.170> very<00:03:36.170> efficient<00:03:36.770> now<00:03:37.310> what

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
Machine off very efficient now what

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.710 
Machine off very efficient now what
we'll<00:03:37.610> do<00:03:37.730> is<00:03:37.760> we'll<00:03:38.030> start<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.420> all<00:03:38.540> over

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
we'll do is we'll start it all over

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.270 
we'll do is we'll start it all over
again<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.170> you<00:03:39.380> can<00:03:39.530> see<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.830> Train<00:03:40.070> move
