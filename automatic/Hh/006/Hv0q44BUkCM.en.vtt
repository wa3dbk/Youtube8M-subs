00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
you had to mute the strings just the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.870 
you had to mute the strings just the
bass<00:02:56.060> strings<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:01.520> get<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:02.270> cursive<00:03:02.630> sound

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
bass strings to get that a cursive sound

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.090 
bass strings to get that a cursive sound
when<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:04.910> start<00:03:05.239> started<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.260> play<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.650> fun

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
when I start started to play that fun

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.729 
when I start started to play that fun
picking<00:03:07.400> style<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.910> think<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.330> just<00:03:08.780> did<00:03:08.930> this

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
picking style I think I just did this

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.810 
picking style I think I just did this
for<00:03:10.360> four<00:03:11.360> or<00:03:11.510> five<00:03:11.540> weeks<00:03:12.400> until<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.640> gets

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
for four or five weeks until it gets

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.000 
for four or five weeks until it gets
totally<00:03:14.030> automatic<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.170> can<00:03:15.380> talk<00:03:15.680> you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
totally automatic and you can talk you

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.270 
totally automatic and you can talk you
can<00:03:16.190> read<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.519> newspaper<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:18.100> you're<00:03:19.100> still

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
can read a newspaper and you're still

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.600 
can read a newspaper and you're still
able<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:20.150> do<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.480> okay<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:22.040> then<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.340> added

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
able to to do that okay and then I added

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:32.459 
able to to do that okay and then I added
some<00:03:23.799> like<00:03:24.799> just<00:03:25.220> one<00:03:25.459> note<00:03:25.670> at<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.000> time

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:32.469 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.250 

yeah<00:03:33.469> until<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.939> was<00:03:35.060> easier<00:03:35.420> than<00:03:35.480> out<00:03:36.079> of

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
yeah until that was easier than out of

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
yeah until that was easier than out of
second<00:03:36.620> note<00:03:43.810> okay<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:44.989> then<00:03:45.139> you<00:03:45.980> do<00:03:46.099> the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
second note okay and then you do the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:55.190 
second note okay and then you do the
syncopations

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.200 

here's<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.380> melody<00:03:56.710> without<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.280> bassline

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
here's the melody without the bassline

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:14.070 

I'm<00:04:05.960> pretty<00:04:06.230> simple<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.340> if<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.520> add<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.850> base

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.479 

yeah<00:04:15.080> almost<00:04:15.380> entirely<00:04:15.950> stay<00:04:16.250> in<00:04:16.370> the

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
yeah almost entirely stay in the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
this point you move your indexed year

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:33.910 
this point you move your indexed year
three<00:04:25.320> on<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:26.280> high<00:04:26.460> E<00:04:26.520> string<00:04:28.670> next<00:04:29.670> phrase
