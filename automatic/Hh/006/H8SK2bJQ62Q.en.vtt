until you know he's evaluated and I'm
sure<00:05:09.750> if<00:05:09.900> it<00:05:10.050> was<00:05:10.169> a<00:05:10.259> close<00:05:10.529> game<00:05:10.560> he<00:05:11.129> probably

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
sure if it was a close game he probably

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.050 
sure if it was a close game he probably
would<00:05:11.729> have<00:05:11.840> would<00:05:12.840> have<00:05:12.870> come<00:05:13.199> back<00:05:13.229> and<00:05:13.620> play

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
would have would have come back and play

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.809 
would have would have come back and play
but<00:05:15.060> again<00:05:15.389> you<00:05:15.900> know<00:05:16.020> tomorrow<00:05:16.800> will<00:05:17.039> be<00:05:17.789> a

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
but again you know tomorrow will be a

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.309 
but again you know tomorrow will be a
different<00:05:18.210> day<00:05:18.330> we'll<00:05:18.569> see<00:05:18.750> how<00:05:18.870> he<00:05:18.900> feels

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
different day we'll see how he feels

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.830 
different day we'll see how he feels
tomorrow<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:20.159> then<00:05:20.849> go<00:05:21.120> from<00:05:21.330> there<00:05:23.810> part<00:05:24.810> of

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
tomorrow and then go from there part of

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.369 
tomorrow and then go from there part of
me<00:05:24.960> I<00:05:25.940> have<00:05:26.940> no<00:05:27.089> idea<00:05:27.120> they<00:05:27.599> just<00:05:27.870> came<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.229> me

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 
me I have no idea they just came to me

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.079 
me I have no idea they just came to me
on<00:05:28.409> the<00:05:28.650> bench<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:29.129> said<00:05:29.490> that<00:05:29.729> his<00:05:29.819> back

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.089 
on the bench and said that his back

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:33.230 
on the bench and said that his back
stiffen<00:05:30.569> up<00:05:30.719> and<00:05:31.099> you<00:05:32.099> know<00:05:32.250> he<00:05:32.819> probably

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
stiffen up and you know he probably

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.540 
stiffen up and you know he probably
wouldn't<00:05:33.690> return<00:05:34.050> so<00:05:34.440> which<00:05:34.680> was<00:05:34.830> fine<00:05:35.069> the

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
wouldn't return so which was fine the

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.499 
wouldn't return so which was fine the
Lee<00:05:35.759> was<00:05:36.379> substantial<00:05:37.379> enough<00:05:37.560> that<00:05:37.770> we<00:05:37.919> could

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
Lee was substantial enough that we could

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.050 
Lee was substantial enough that we could
do<00:05:39.509> without<00:05:39.690> him
