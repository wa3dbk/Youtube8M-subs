00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.330
 We are now going back to Schiphol because there are still a few things that want 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.669
 for this demonstration site 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.619
 as you probably dec it is for a transport plane 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.169
 very important that it can continue as the 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.839
 landing will be canceled 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:24.179
 field well that is not that the f 27 extraordinary charity the operators 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.349
 now the control tower rules the holes 8 8 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:37.659
 punish anp stronger for the the man have a protest on her editors 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.280
 we left that under normal landing strip for a period of approximately 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.400
 160 kilometers just before the moment of landing 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.110
 in one go we now switch to the rising speed without clapping and bidding 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.570
 withdraw 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.640
 It is of course wise when the goal is, however, as quickly as possible 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.150
 withdraw them 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.450
 just nice to bring them with a strong position and would serve 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.430
 be withdrawn immediately 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.410
 in this case they both intentionally let out the remaining part by the 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.410
 increased prices 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.960
 and again it takes little effort the planes correctly the driver 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.750
 and I continue to predict job 23 percent 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.130
 during this landing we must see how quickly the aircraft came to a halt 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.799
 at the same time it is also a remark that it is possible to pay quickly 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.010
 an undisputed for the world small airports with high obstacles that 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010
 approach 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.490
 we will try to stand at the very beginning of the construction of countries and stand still 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 growth the first intervention 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.510
 of course these really beautiful walks have never been before 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.030
 but that is not expected 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.800
 finally try to imitate what people would do in an emergency in the weekend 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.499
 the total required decrease there probably is no more than 130 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:18.859
 up to 180 meters 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.859
 who still doubts about plane 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.049
 I hope I don't put everyone away 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.969
 let's switch off an engine, we just do that 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.909
 and only about starboard is it coming in 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.589
 in this case you can be charged for 8 euros while arriving on the platform 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:52.759
 that is also important to lay inland 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:56.789
 at not much time is played after the landing and it certainly decides as people 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:59.789
 change passengers without delay 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.229
 cure 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.209
 remarkable 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.349
 yes that will work 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.339
 I am often very curious about this demonstration chairman of the 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:34.359
 truck that scrapers
