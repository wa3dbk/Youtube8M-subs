00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
coil and all various other gubbins like

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.390 
coil and all various other gubbins like
it<00:02:24.170> all<00:02:24.260> seems<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:24.650> fairly<00:02:24.920> good<00:02:25.100> next

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
it all seems to be fairly good next

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.060

when done but coming up to the sound of

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.910 
when done but coming up to the sound of
the<00:02:46.670> live<00:02:46.850> showing<00:02:47.570> on<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:47.959> bit<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.769> alley

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
the live showing on this bit of alley

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.509 
the live showing on this bit of alley
and<00:02:49.730> then<00:02:49.850> give<00:02:50.060> me<00:02:50.360> crown<00:02:50.780> case<00:02:51.489> we've<00:02:52.489> got

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
and then give me crown case we've got

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.790 
and then give me crown case we've got
the<00:02:52.819> crank<00:02:53.360> case<00:02:53.420> split<00:02:53.840> as<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.470> other<00:02:54.650> half

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
the crank case split as the other half

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.710 
the crank case split as the other half
over<00:02:55.069> there<00:02:55.269> started<00:02:56.269> flipping<00:02:56.540> up<00:02:56.630> the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
over there started flipping up the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.630 
over there started flipping up the
inside<00:02:58.180> it's<00:02:59.180> about<00:02:59.299> half<00:02:59.540> done<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.810> think<00:03:00.640> got

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
inside it's about half done I think got

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.750 
inside it's about half done I think got
a<00:03:01.670> file<00:03:02.030> very<00:03:02.930> gently<00:03:03.380> over<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.709> top<00:03:03.950> made

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
a file very gently over the top made

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.970 
a file very gently over the top made
this<00:03:04.910> surface<00:03:05.660> flat<00:03:05.930> they<00:03:06.230> had<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:06.350> slight<00:03:06.709> Nick

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
this surface flat they had a slight Nick

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.580 
this surface flat they had a slight Nick
in<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.700> files<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.780> over<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.260> made<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.500> all

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
in it so files that over and made it all

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.890 
in it so files that over and made it all
flat<00:03:09.920> should<00:03:10.910> fit<00:03:11.060> back<00:03:11.180> together<00:03:11.299> perfect

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
flat should fit back together perfect

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.759 
flat should fit back together perfect
now<00:03:12.880> bearings<00:03:13.880> are<00:03:14.030> good<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.989> all<00:03:17.989> all<00:03:18.350> stays

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
now bearings are good and all all stays

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.949 
now bearings are good and all all stays
are<00:03:19.100> good<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.549> everything's<00:03:20.269> good<00:03:20.480> on<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.810> and

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
are good and everything's good on it and

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.210 
are good and everything's good on it and
it's<00:03:21.200> all<00:03:21.290> about<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.590> spark<00:03:21.920> we're<00:03:22.100> done

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
it's all about the spark we're done

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.190 
it's all about the spark we're done
through<00:03:22.459> cleaning<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:22.910> one<00:03:23.090> this<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.930> still

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
through cleaning this one this is still

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.860 
through cleaning this one this is still
a<00:03:24.230> little<00:03:24.380> bit<00:03:24.500> dirt<00:03:24.799> in<00:03:24.920> these<00:03:25.040> quarters<00:03:25.400> and

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
a little bit dirt in these quarters and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.550 
a little bit dirt in these quarters and
that'll<00:03:26.870> be<00:03:27.220> cleaned<00:03:28.220> octane<00:03:28.840> mini<00:03:29.840> Corrib<00:03:30.290> I

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
that'll be cleaned octane mini Corrib I

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.620 
that'll be cleaned octane mini Corrib I
like<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.610> call<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.850> mini<00:03:32.060> car<00:03:32.299> because<00:03:32.540> I'd

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
like to call it mini car because I'd

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.280 
like to call it mini car because I'd
clean<00:03:34.030> inside<00:03:35.030> anyway<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.660> outside<00:03:35.989> still

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
clean inside anyway the outside still

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.310 
clean inside anyway the outside still
needs<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.620> going<00:03:37.220> over<00:03:37.310> but<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:38.150> think<00:03:38.989> this<00:03:39.079> car

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
needs a going over but I think this car

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.290 
needs a going over but I think this car
will<00:03:39.500> be<00:03:39.530> temporary<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:40.310> then<00:03:40.430> I'll<00:03:40.579> get

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
will be temporary and then I'll get

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.360 
will be temporary and then I'll get
a<00:03:42.360> proper<00:03:43.230> three<00:03:43.470> years<00:03:43.710> one<00:03:43.860> put<00:03:44.070> on<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.250> later

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
a proper three years one put on it later

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.940 
a proper three years one put on it later

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
in the other side with the crank case

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.690 
in the other side with the crank case
with<00:03:50.430> Kristen<00:03:51.000> fitted<00:03:52.100> it<00:03:53.100> started<00:03:53.520> raining

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
not gonna bother taking this out or just

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.200 
not gonna bother taking this out or just
gonna<00:04:24.950> wrap<00:04:25.950> around<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.460> crank<00:04:26.670> case<00:04:26.910> and

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
gonna wrap around the crank case and

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.450 
gonna wrap around the crank case and
then<00:04:27.780> paint<00:04:28.110> this<00:04:28.260> lock<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.770> make<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.310> look

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
then paint this lock and make that look

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.670 
then paint this lock and make that look
good

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
good

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.710 
good
shine<00:04:31.680> it<00:04:31.860> up<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.940> then<00:04:33.060> slide<00:04:33.330> back<00:04:33.360> together

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
shine it up and then slide back together

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.189 
shine it up and then slide back together
hopefully<00:04:34.080> this<00:04:34.380> even<00:04:34.740> play<00:04:35.420> good
