00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:15.740
 from the company in small club waters 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:19.350
 station will try with the now in 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.210
 at least exotic and show 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.630
 I was with little prey and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.060
 grundfutter action series like me that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.530
 must and what all that all 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.710
 Well-known is very simply the first one 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:38.880
 the ingredient is our chapel the 9 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.950
 they are 2 mm big, glue really well 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:49.670
 and are therefore ideal for use 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:59.489
 with feathers or very good at cold 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:07.340
 Some of the water works 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:15.060
 matching and of course the coconut 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:17.729
 the tex mex and a few of the ten 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.189
 millimeter prey are so in handy 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.200
 200 grams of packages there are even five pop 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.939
 ups with you for those snowman 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.240
 between or like to boxe good hand of 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.240
 to 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.670
 and now I bring ours 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.909
 instantaction boosters eustatius 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.229
 so that he dissolves better in nothing 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.640
 I have a simple trick I suppose 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.850
 just a little water one 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.580
 drinking bottle or even in the glass how to 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.270
 would like or a bucket gives to the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.270
 amount of water then at least has to 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.080
 is working 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.710
 and let that be five minutes 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.640
 stand before I want to do then 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.710
 will handle and the food trap 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.650
 feed space schiesser or show you 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:56.130
 just as simple as the feed 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.540
 without fair upper edge of the big part 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.280
 put the little one on press both 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.560
 move together first on the top 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.340
 Part must have in the lower part of the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.280
 first ball 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.620
 and that's so much the advantage 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.520
 is the two then always the same size 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.920
 that means we can do it with the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.670
 lining then hurls only about 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.670
 shoot the same distance 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.880
 Another advantage is very much 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.180
 quickly with a guided two too 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.180
 do 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.670
 I do not have many photos so much now 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.680
 what still cold they would on now 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.680
 feeding place shoot on number 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:51.280
 have made with ingredients show what 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:55.530
 plastic, for example, with the 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.530
 incident with drag 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:10.350
 with the 10 mm coconut kiss and action 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.140
 series and the water very cold which 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.850
 to offer small plastic with 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:18.150
 he looks like this together 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:21.470
 and I have white power here 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.470
 thick board 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:35.660
 10 mm industries for even more people 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:50.120
 that is even the foot to come 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:50.120
 namely the bread molycorp inc 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.550
 k 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.590
 just watch 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.810
 Of course , park waters where the 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:33.330
 The cards are fed 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:39.000
 conditioned on it but the phs dix 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:42.320
 under a little tension that binds 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.320
 like a small explosion cloud 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:07.830
 two knots as you know it in the 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.830
 cut off the middle 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.270
 already a small tv stick with 15 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.530
 18 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:20.100
 accordingly blog effect direct 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.100
 lack of space
