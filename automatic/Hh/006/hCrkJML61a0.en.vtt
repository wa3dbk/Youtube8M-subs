let's<00:03:30.700> just<00:03:31.030> be<00:03:31.390> focused<00:03:31.900> let's<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:33.130> Comcast

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
let's just be focused let's to Comcast

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.450 
let's just be focused let's to Comcast
if<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.480> were<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:35.200> district-wide

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
if this were a district-wide

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.250 
if this were a district-wide
I<00:03:36.490> think<00:03:36.790> our<00:03:36.910> incident<00:03:37.390> rates<00:03:37.660> would<00:03:37.840> be<00:03:37.900> down

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
I think our incident rates would be down

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.250 
I think our incident rates would be down
I<00:03:38.650> also<00:03:39.370> think<00:03:39.940> our<00:03:40.120> attendance<00:03:40.600> rates<00:03:40.960> would

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
I also think our attendance rates would

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.820 
I also think our attendance rates would
go<00:03:41.350> up<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.190> test<00:03:42.580> scores<00:03:42.940> would<00:03:43.330> skyrocket

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
go up and I test scores would skyrocket

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.440 
go up and I test scores would skyrocket
because<00:03:44.830> our<00:03:45.400> students<00:03:46.000> would<00:03:46.150> have<00:03:46.330> an

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
because our students would have an

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.350 
because our students would have an
opportunity<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:47.380> learn<00:03:47.620> how<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:48.010> refocus<00:03:48.730> how

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
opportunity to learn how to refocus how

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.660 
opportunity to learn how to refocus how
to<00:03:49.420> re-energize<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:50.500> how<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:50.950> get<00:03:51.220> rid<00:03:51.430> of<00:03:51.460> the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
to re-energize and how to get rid of the

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.980 
to re-energize and how to get rid of the
negative<00:03:52.060> energy<00:03:52.210> there<00:03:52.840> has<00:03:52.960> definitely

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
negative energy there has definitely

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.050 
negative energy there has definitely
been<00:03:53.620> an<00:03:53.710> improvement<00:03:53.980> in<00:03:54.280> our<00:03:54.370> grades<00:03:54.700> our

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
be instituted in other schools because

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:33.670 
be instituted in other schools because
it<00:05:32.330> is<00:05:32.449> the<00:05:32.599> opposite<00:05:33.199> of<00:05:33.319> what<00:05:33.379> we

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
it is the opposite of what we

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.439 
it is the opposite of what we
experienced<00:05:34.370> in<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.580> schools<00:05:34.940> on<00:05:35.150> a<00:05:35.180> day<00:05:35.389> to

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
experienced in the schools on a day to

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.510 
experienced in the schools on a day to
day<00:05:35.569> basis<00:05:36.199> I<00:05:36.440> think<00:05:36.770> that<00:05:36.919> this<00:05:37.039> is<00:05:37.190> something

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
day basis I think that this is something

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.700 
day basis I think that this is something
that<00:05:37.550> most<00:05:38.509> schools<00:05:38.839> will<00:05:38.990> really<00:05:39.259> benefit

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
that most schools will really benefit

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.129 
that most schools will really benefit
from<00:05:39.770> as<00:05:40.250> we<00:05:40.430> try<00:05:40.699> to<00:05:40.759> bring<00:05:41.659> them<00:05:41.900> into

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
from as we try to bring them into

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.010 
from as we try to bring them into
solving<00:05:42.740> their<00:05:42.860> own<00:05:42.889> father's<00:05:43.400> in<00:05:43.490> a<00:05:43.580> calm

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
solving their own father's in a calm

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.390 
solving their own father's in a calm
amenable<00:05:45.020> way<00:05:45.169> we<00:05:45.860> all<00:05:46.009> have<00:05:46.219> this<00:05:46.339> ability

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
amenable way we all have this ability

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.019 
amenable way we all have this ability
inside<00:05:46.940> of<00:05:47.270> us<00:05:47.419> to<00:05:47.919> take<00:05:48.919> control<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:49.909> be

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:50.029 
inside of us to take control and to be

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:51.820 
inside of us to take control and to be
calm<00:05:50.240> and<00:05:50.270> to<00:05:50.539> be<00:05:50.659> kind<00:05:50.900> to<00:05:51.139> one<00:05:51.169> another<00:05:51.289> it's

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
calm and to be kind to one another it's

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.670 
calm and to be kind to one another it's
just<00:05:51.889> a<00:05:52.219> matter<00:05:52.550> of<00:05:52.690> can<00:05:53.690> we<00:05:53.779> access<00:05:53.930> that<00:05:54.319> and

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
just a matter of can we access that and

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.709 
just a matter of can we access that and
I<00:05:54.860> think<00:05:54.919> the<00:05:55.159> calm<00:05:55.370> classroom<00:05:55.789> activities

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:56.719 
I think the calm classroom activities

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:58.829 
I think the calm classroom activities
really<00:05:57.050> provide<00:05:57.469> us<00:05:57.589> an<00:05:57.710> opportunity<00:05:57.949> to

00:05:58.829 --> 00:05:58.839 
really provide us an opportunity to

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.090 
really provide us an opportunity to
engage

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
engage

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:15.730 
engage
it<00:06:00.850> works

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.800
