all right so basically we have covered

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.640 
all right so basically we have covered
rocker<00:00:02.340> in<00:00:02.610> reverse<00:00:02.790> camber<00:00:03.060> in<00:00:03.389> powder<00:00:04.230> skis

rocker in reverse camber in powder skis
now<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.430> question<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:05.879> how<00:00:06.180> do<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:06.390> take<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
now the question is how do we take the

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.720 
now the question is how do we take the
attributes<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.440> benefits<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.189> rocker

attributes and the benefits of rocker

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.430 
attributes and the benefits of rocker
reverse<00:00:09.210> camber<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.870> apply<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.349> an

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
reverse camber and apply it to an

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.310 
reverse camber and apply it to an
everyday<00:00:10.740> ski<00:00:11.210> okay<00:00:12.210> some<00:00:12.450> point<00:00:12.780> s-seven

starting<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> tip<00:00:32.540> we<00:00:33.540> had<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.840> early

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
starting at the tip we had this early

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.799 
starting at the tip we had this early
rise<00:00:34.469> which<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:35.910> hits<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> benefits

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
rise which you know hits on the benefits

rise which you know hits on the benefits
that<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:36.989> talked<00:00:37.230> about<00:00:37.350> earlier<00:00:37.800> non<00:00:38.040> hook

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
that we talked about earlier non hook

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.290 
that we talked about earlier non hook
enos<00:00:38.670> able<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.899> float<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.950> ease<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.940> ability

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
enos able to float that ease and ability

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
but sorry also we have a little bit of

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.760 
but sorry also we have a little bit of
this<00:00:53.969> reverse<00:00:54.390> side<00:00:55.020> cut<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
this reverse side cut here at the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.369 
this reverse side cut here at the
beginning<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.059> tip<00:00:57.270> right<00:00:57.539> now<00:00:58.199> that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
beginning of the tip right now that

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.889 
beginning of the tip right now that
again<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.699> did<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.059> spatula<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
again just as it did with the spatula it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.250 
again just as it did with the spatula it
reduces<00:01:01.500> hook<00:01:01.739> enos<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:03.030> increases<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
reduces hook enos and it increases the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.830 
reduces hook enos and it increases the
ability<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.949> easy<00:01:05.309> ease<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.299> turn

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
ability or the easy ease of turn

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.770 
ability or the easy ease of turn
initiation<00:01:07.439> right<00:01:07.830> okay<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:09.510> move<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
initiation right okay so now we move to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.990 
initiation right okay so now we move to
the<00:01:09.960> middle<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.439> ski<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.189> see<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:11.760> this

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
beginning of the tip which leads back

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.980

into a traditional side cut which allows

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.500 
into a traditional side cut which allows
for<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.710> you<00:02:35.830> know<00:02:35.920> easy<00:02:36.220> surf<00:02:36.610> enos<00:02:36.940> but

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
for that you know easy surf enos but

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.910 
for that you know easy surf enos but
then<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:37.780> have<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.080> stability<00:02:38.680> and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
then you have the stability and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.920 
then you have the stability and
dependability<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:40.120> underfoot<00:02:40.540> camber

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
dependability of this underfoot camber

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.410
