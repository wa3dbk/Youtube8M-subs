00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:09.100
Andrés, I guess that many of your footballer’s wishes have been fulfilled today?

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:30.100
Yes, this is a very special day: recognition for oneself, for our team, our season.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.100
Just being here is an award in itself. Apart from being an excellent player,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.300
you possess the virtue of being down to earth, an attribute much valued by the public.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:53.300
Each one of us has to be himself – on and off the field

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.400
Identifying with the public is fulfilling for me.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:12.900
We have to set a good example, particularly in today’s times

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.300
A timely goal can mean a lot. 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:29.100
Just how much did that Barcelona goal which allowed the team to beat so many records mean?

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:44.100
It meant a lot, not only for me, but also for the fans who roared their approval

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:58.100
It dignifies our profession when we play at that level.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.100
You were voted for by your peers in a secret ballot

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.100
That signifies recognition by your colleagues.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.700
I guess it must also be personally satisfying?

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:22.300
Yes, no question about that. Being appreciated by one’s colleagues is the ultimate form of recognition.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.800
What message do you have for the public during this Festive Season when everyone is wishing for something?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:38.100
I wish them good health and continuing enjoyment through football

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.100
Football is a great way of achieving happiness. 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.800
Congratulations and all the best for the coming year 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.200
Many thanks and the same to you.
