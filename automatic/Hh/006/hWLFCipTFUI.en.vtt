00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.080 

well<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.440> know<00:02:32.590> now<00:02:33.070> they<00:02:33.340> try<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.670> get<00:02:33.940> it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
well you know now they try to get it

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.230 
well you know now they try to get it
with<00:02:34.210> plugins<00:02:35.400> whether<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.640> an<00:02:36.760> equalizer

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
with plugins whether it's an equalizer

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.890 
with plugins whether it's an equalizer
that<00:02:37.690> then<00:02:37.990> we<00:02:38.200> use<00:02:38.410> microphones<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.870> a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
that then we use microphones to a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.450 
that then we use microphones to a
certain<00:02:41.260> extent<00:02:41.590> we<00:02:41.800> do<00:02:41.920> would<00:02:42.040> change<00:02:42.310> a

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
certain extent we do would change a

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.620 
certain extent we do would change a

bottom with guitar amps we probably went

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.500 
bottom with guitar amps we probably went
through<00:02:48.100> like<00:02:48.340> 12<00:02:48.670> microphones<00:02:49.300> all

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.330 
different type unfortunately you don't
have<00:02:52.180> 12<00:02:52.390> microphones<00:02:52.960> home<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:54.070> we're<00:02:54.220> going

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
have 12 microphones home so we're going

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.250 
have 12 microphones home so we're going
to<00:02:54.430> try<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.730> use<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.570> least<00:02:55.810> expensive

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
to try to use the least expensive

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.010 
to try to use the least expensive
microphones<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:58.150> still<00:02:58.540> can<00:02:58.810> make<00:02:58.990> a

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
microphones and you still can make a

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.110 
microphones and you still can make a
difference<00:02:59.260> in<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.740> sound<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.250> mean<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.090> think

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
difference in the sound I mean I think

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.700 
difference in the sound I mean I think
capacitor<00:03:02.050> condenser<00:03:02.650> mic<00:03:02.830> set<00:03:03.160> became<00:03:03.610> very

capacitor condenser mic set became very
inexpensive<00:03:05.710> now<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:06.210> mean<00:03:07.210> they're<00:03:07.450> not<00:03:07.600> going

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
inexpensive now I mean they're not going

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.290 
inexpensive now I mean they're not going
to<00:03:07.900> sound<00:03:08.110> like<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.860> 47<00:03:09.430> tubes<00:03:09.880> that<00:03:10.150> they

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
a small one of originally they say they

a small one of originally they say they
can<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:50.069> when<00:03:50.639> you<00:03:50.760> hear<00:03:50.939> the<00:03:51.060> difference

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
can but when you hear the difference

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.559 
can but when you hear the difference
you'll<00:03:51.900> see<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.349> they<00:03:52.499> can't<00:03:52.909> on<00:03:53.909> a<00:03:53.969> computer

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
you'll see that they can't on a computer

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.149 
you'll see that they can't on a computer
they're<00:03:54.719> just<00:03:54.900> not<00:03:55.079> there<00:03:55.349> yet<00:03:55.560> maybe<00:03:56.040> a

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
they're just not there yet maybe a

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.619 
they're just not there yet maybe a
couple<00:03:56.370> more<00:03:56.639> years<00:03:56.819> they'll<00:03:57.090> be<00:03:57.150> there<00:03:57.450> I

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
couple more years they'll be there I

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.500 
couple more years they'll be there I
think<00:03:58.409> they're<00:03:58.560> making<00:03:59.430> artificial<00:03:59.879> sounds

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
think they're making artificial sounds

they should know a little bit but if
their<00:04:46.320> beginnings<00:04:46.800> are<00:04:46.950> there<00:04:47.160> then<00:04:47.430> we'll

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
their beginnings are there then we'll
