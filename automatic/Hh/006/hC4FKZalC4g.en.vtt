 common money laundering 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.420

 that the politicians themselves find the 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.489
 way to do it this is a problem 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.500
 national and international are not the 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.080
 only nation where this kind of acts

 more wealthy are individualistic and see 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.010

 they need to do in order to get what 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.629
 what they want is vital to the resolution 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.129
 of the problem that those people 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.769

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.129
 incorruptible citizens who seek the

 collective good and that they are being 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.760
 guided by good values 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.069
 frequently people 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.180
 involve in exchange for an incentive 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.220

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.400
 economic benefit 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.690
 those corrupt people are a 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.940
 determining factor in the aspect 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.920
