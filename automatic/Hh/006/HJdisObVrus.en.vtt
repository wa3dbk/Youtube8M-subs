00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.440

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.250
 vegetable with a lot of vegetables stew 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.699
 for that we need three potatoes one 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.090
 onions, two or three oranges depending on 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.800

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.710
 either peeled tomatoes or 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.210
 Happened tomatoes will hopefully come 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.239
 take time which therefore is now 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.750
 I need peeled tomatoes oil 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.700
 We have two carrots and a few herbs 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.180
 I'll take the parsley here now 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.010
 outside something we are allowed to small the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.440
 onions and then she comes in the pot 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.079
 then we have the potatoes and that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.949
 whole vegetables the pieces can and something 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.289
 to be taller 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.960
 First with the goals with a little oil 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.039
 You can also sautÃ© under a bit 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.039
 take more 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.310
 then come the potatoes and carrots 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.310
 1 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.250
 that's only a bit competed 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.590
 so after all the church I do the whole 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.660
 now the peeled tomato port 8 there 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.300
 it comes to the whole thing and I want 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.250
 that not before i cut thomalla 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.330
 situational all comes in there 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.920
 that actually dissolves then I am 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.400
 I find the can with water and we 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.980
 The water will come in here again 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.520
 now you have smaller cans you have to 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:01.940
 just look that the water over the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.490
 half is that stir once 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.890
 then salt pepper will come and be 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.860
 then we leave that with the blanket 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.510
 covered for ten minutes to himself 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.209
 Cook 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.570
 after ten minutes the whole thing was on 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.490
 let yourself be super delicious then 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.940
 I would make-up once 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.459
 whether you like salt and for it 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.830
 you actually wanted to do and 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.550
 then they come herbs no i have 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.290
 parsley now arrive here like 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.850
 said in here and then I leave that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.920
 whole again for half an hour and 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.190
 finished it looks like this 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.730
 it would not be so fluid 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.769
 as in this fall would now can 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.120
 Do it all in the oven again 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.070
 I'm going to in no case so 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.450
 I do not like it fluently you can do it 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.610
 of course, but I want to eat 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:00.630
 are the formal ones then come that yet 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:03.230
 times at 24 alexander 15 minutes in the 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.630
 do not do it so well 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.120
 after 15 minutes is and satanic 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.940
 Greek according to the court I finished 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.430
 Of course it could also strike with cheese 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.840
 but sprinkle it over or parmesan 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.750
 or fat cheese 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.850
 So this creates we soon everyone does 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.549
 it is different but I think the turks 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.100
 We can do that too, so we like each other 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.120
 best like that and taste delicious then 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.120
