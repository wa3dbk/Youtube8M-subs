ever<00:00:10.219> since<00:00:10.430> the<00:00:10.549> first<00:00:10.730> telescope<00:00:11.420> was

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
ever since the first telescope was

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.000 
ever since the first telescope was
invented<00:00:11.600> and<00:00:12.230> we<00:00:12.379> learned<00:00:12.590> there<00:00:12.770> are<00:00:12.860> other

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
invented and we learned there are other

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.100 
invented and we learned there are other
worlds<00:00:13.250> out<00:00:13.520> there<00:00:13.580> people<00:00:14.269> have<00:00:14.599> dreamed<00:00:14.960> of

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
worlds out there people have dreamed of

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.320 
worlds out there people have dreamed of
going<00:00:15.440> to<00:00:15.620> them<00:00:15.800> of<00:00:16.430> course<00:00:16.670> we<00:00:16.910> now<00:00:17.090> know<00:00:17.300> that

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
going to them of course we now know that

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.359 
going to them of course we now know that
Mars<00:00:17.869> is<00:00:18.290> really<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:18.650> only<00:00:18.770> other<00:00:18.860> planet<00:00:19.310> in

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
Mars is really the only other planet in

Mars is really the only other planet in
the<00:00:19.490> solar<00:00:19.730> system<00:00:19.939> you'd<00:00:20.210> actually<00:00:20.360> want<00:00:20.540> to

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
the solar system you'd actually want to

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.689 
the solar system you'd actually want to
set<00:00:20.900> foot<00:00:21.080> on<00:00:21.140> but<00:00:22.010> what<00:00:22.100> would<00:00:22.220> it<00:00:22.250> take<00:00:22.460> to

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
set foot on but what would it take to

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.250 
set foot on but what would it take to
set<00:00:23.000> up<00:00:23.090> a<00:00:23.150> human<00:00:23.390> colony<00:00:23.750> on<00:00:23.779> Mars

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
set up a human colony on Mars

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.920 
set up a human colony on Mars
and<00:00:24.380> when's<00:00:24.920> it<00:00:25.039> likely<00:00:25.279> to<00:00:25.430> happen<00:00:25.930> it's

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
and when's it likely to happen it's

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.540 
and when's it likely to happen it's
certainly<00:00:27.470> easy<00:00:27.710> to<00:00:27.949> imagine<00:00:28.400> ourselves

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
certainly easy to imagine ourselves

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.810 
certainly easy to imagine ourselves
living<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:29.480> working<00:00:29.779> on<00:00:29.900> Mars<00:00:30.490> it<00:00:31.490> has<00:00:31.640> no

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
living and working on Mars it has no

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.090 
living and working on Mars it has no
oceans<00:00:32.180> or<00:00:32.330> life<00:00:32.540> but<00:00:33.110> in<00:00:33.199> many<00:00:33.440> ways<00:00:33.530> it's

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
oceans or life but in many ways it's

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.520 
oceans or life but in many ways it's
like<00:00:34.190> Earth<00:00:34.550> like<00:00:35.120> a<00:00:35.150> desert<00:00:35.390> area<00:00:35.629> we<00:00:36.379> have

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
like they did for the moon they're going

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.120 
like they did for the moon they're going
to<00:01:29.240> have<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.479> do<00:01:29.600> something<00:01:29.869> much<00:01:30.260> much<00:01:30.590> much

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
to have to do something much much much

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.420 
to have to do something much much much
more<00:01:31.430> difficult<00:01:32.979> one<00:01:33.979> of<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.130> better<00:01:34.340> ideas

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
more difficult one of the better ideas

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.520 
more difficult one of the better ideas
is<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:34.970> figure<00:01:35.780> out<00:01:35.930> what's<00:01:36.140> going<00:01:36.290> to<00:01:36.320> be

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
is to figure out what's going to be

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.170 
is to figure out what's going to be
there<00:01:36.740> when<00:01:37.070> we<00:01:37.220> get<00:01:37.369> there<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.790> how<00:01:37.940> do<00:01:38.000> you

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
there when we get there and how do you

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.240 
there when we get there and how do you
muse<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.659> can<00:01:39.050> live<00:01:39.259> off<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.590> land<00:01:39.619> kind<00:01:40.130> of

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
muse it can live off the land kind of

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.490 
muse it can live off the land kind of
strategy<00:01:40.610> for<00:01:41.180> example<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.780> atmosphere<00:01:42.290> of

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
strategy for example the atmosphere of

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.380 
strategy for example the atmosphere of
Mars<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:43.220> co2<00:01:43.630> 95%<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.869> co2<00:01:45.549> notably<00:01:46.549> has<00:01:46.820> o<00:01:47.000> in

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
Mars is co2 95% and co2 notably has o in

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.870 
Mars is co2 95% and co2 notably has o in
it<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.290> if<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.500> want<00:01:48.740> some<00:01:48.950> oxygen<00:01:49.549> you<00:01:49.850> have

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
it so if you want some oxygen you have

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.340 
it so if you want some oxygen you have
it<00:01:50.210> there<00:01:50.390> all<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.600> have<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.780> do<00:01:50.869> is<00:01:50.990> separate

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
it there all you have to do is separate

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.680 
it there all you have to do is separate
the<00:01:51.409> C<00:01:51.830> from<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.369> o2<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.180> can<00:01:53.299> breathe<00:01:53.509> it

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
the C from the o2 and you can breathe it

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.690 
the C from the o2 and you can breathe it
that<00:01:54.170> takes<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.380> little<00:01:54.470> bit<00:01:54.590> of<00:01:54.710> power<00:01:54.920> so

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
that takes a little bit of power so

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
question you've got to ask is is it all

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.119 
question you've got to ask is is it all
just<00:04:48.729> too<00:04:48.939> hard<00:04:49.240> it'll<00:04:49.930> be<00:04:50.110> much<00:04:50.289> cheaper<00:04:50.650> to

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
just too hard it'll be much cheaper to

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.700 
just too hard it'll be much cheaper to
forget<00:04:51.430> humans<00:04:51.909> and<00:04:52.120> only<00:04:52.719> send<00:04:52.990> robots<00:04:53.259> to

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
forget humans and only send robots to

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.820 
forget humans and only send robots to
Mars<00:04:53.830> but<00:04:54.789> Charlie's<00:04:55.180> not<00:04:55.300> convinced<00:04:55.839> for

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830

Mars but Charlie's not convinced for
example<00:04:57.309> one<00:04:57.669> of<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.789> most<00:04:57.909> interesting

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
example one of the most interesting

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.329 
example one of the most interesting
places<00:04:58.509> on<00:04:58.689> Mars<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.110> as<00:04:59.199> all<00:04:59.439> runners<00:04:59.830> cliff

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:02.670 
places on Mars and as all runners cliff
faces<00:05:00.639> so<00:05:01.389> how<00:05:01.689> do<00:05:01.749> you<00:05:01.870> get<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:02.020> robot<00:05:02.439> that<00:05:02.529> has

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
of a cliff not easily but we can do it

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.879

very difficult Charlie believes we will

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.769

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
be living on Mars and it may be sooner

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:17.399 
be living on Mars and it may be sooner
than<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.110> think

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
than you think

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.279 
than you think
well<00:05:17.860> plans<00:05:18.279> now<00:05:18.759> are<00:05:18.789> to<00:05:19.180> go<00:05:19.360> build<00:05:19.960> this<00:05:20.050> moon

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
well plans now are to go build this moon

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.519 
well plans now are to go build this moon
base<00:05:20.559> at<00:05:21.180> 2020<00:05:22.180> fell<00:05:22.449> about<00:05:22.689> 13<00:05:23.139> years<00:05:23.169> from

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:23.529 
base at 2020 fell about 13 years from

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.249 
base at 2020 fell about 13 years from
now<00:05:23.649> and<00:05:23.909> 10<00:05:24.909> years<00:05:25.120> later<00:05:25.180> maybe<00:05:25.719> onto<00:05:26.110> Mars

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
now and 10 years later maybe onto Mars

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.249 
now and 10 years later maybe onto Mars
so<00:05:26.559> 2030<00:05:27.370> 2040<00:05:28.149> is<00:05:28.330> probably<00:05:28.659> the<00:05:28.779> time<00:05:28.960> scale

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
so 2030 2040 is probably the time scale

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.179 
so 2030 2040 is probably the time scale
which<00:05:29.289> is<00:05:29.499> doable<00:05:31.169> what<00:05:32.169> we<00:05:32.319> need<00:05:32.529> is<00:05:32.800> another

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:33.189 
which is doable what we need is another

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.170 
which is doable what we need is another
spice<00:05:33.520> rice<00:05:33.789> I<00:05:34.680> think<00:05:35.680> a<00:05:35.830> lot<00:05:36.099> of<00:05:36.129> our<00:05:36.490> efforts

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
spice rice I think a lot of our efforts

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.149 
spice rice I think a lot of our efforts
to<00:05:37.300> go<00:05:37.419> to<00:05:37.479> outer<00:05:37.599> space<00:05:37.689> also<00:05:38.499> depend<00:05:38.919> on<00:05:39.039> our

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
to go to outer space also depend on our

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.670 
to go to outer space also depend on our
tribalism<00:05:39.729> here<00:05:40.120> so<00:05:40.659> okay<00:05:40.810> I'm<00:05:41.379> gonna<00:05:41.499> get

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
tribalism here so okay I'm gonna get

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.689 
tribalism here so okay I'm gonna get
there<00:05:41.800> first<00:05:41.889> no<00:05:42.039> I'm<00:05:42.219> gonna<00:05:42.370> get<00:05:42.490> there<00:05:42.610> first

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
there first no I'm gonna get there first

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.249 
there first no I'm gonna get there first
and<00:05:42.849> then<00:05:42.999> two<00:05:43.149> nations<00:05:43.360> start<00:05:43.749> competing<00:05:43.990> and

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
and then two nations start competing and

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:45.689 
and then two nations start competing and
then<00:05:44.379> boom<00:05:44.589> all<00:05:44.770> of<00:05:44.860> a<00:05:44.919> sudden<00:05:45.159> somebody<00:05:45.550> does

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
then boom all of a sudden somebody does

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.119 
then boom all of a sudden somebody does
it<00:05:45.849> as<00:05:46.419> long<00:05:46.659> as<00:05:46.810> we're<00:05:46.959> aggressive<00:05:47.949> and

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.129 
it as long as we're aggressive and

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.850 
it as long as we're aggressive and
antagonistic<00:05:48.699> towards<00:05:49.149> our<00:05:49.270> neighbors<00:05:49.860> reach

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
antagonistic towards our neighbors reach

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.800 
antagonistic towards our neighbors reach
for<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.370> stars

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810
