tires that are on the official Rock
Crawler<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.450> 939<00:01:53.110> 8<00:01:53.350> so<00:01:53.560> let's<00:01:53.590> see<00:01:53.950> how<00:01:54.100> this

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
Crawler the 939 8 so let's see how this

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.700 
Crawler the 939 8 so let's see how this
size-wise<00:01:55.450> compares<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.320> nine<00:01:56.470> three

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
size-wise compares to the nine three

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.530 
size-wise compares to the nine three
nine<00:01:56.740> eight<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.580> black<00:01:57.790> truck<00:01:58.150> there<00:01:58.390> is

nine eight so the black truck there is

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.870 
nine eight so the black truck there is
Madoka's<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.860> just<00:02:00.130> got<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.400> next<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.760> the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
Madoka's and I just got it next to the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.250 
Madoka's and I just got it next to the
nine<00:02:01.030> three<00:02:01.300> nine<00:02:01.330> eight<00:02:01.510> there<00:02:01.870> just<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.140> give

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
nine three nine eight there just to give

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.020 
nine three nine eight there just to give
you<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.380> size<00:02:02.650> perspective<00:02:02.860> but<00:02:03.640> they<00:02:03.790> both

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
you a size perspective but they both

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.570 
you a size perspective but they both
have<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.450> exact<00:02:04.810> same<00:02:04.900> tires<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:06.250> they're

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
have the exact same tires so they're

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.780 
have the exact same tires so they're
both<00:02:06.850> like<00:02:07.570> said<00:02:07.810> Madoka<00:02:08.259> calls<00:02:08.500> his<00:02:08.740> a<00:02:08.790> trial

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
both like said Madoka calls his a trial

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.250 
both like said Madoka calls his a trial
truck<00:02:10.119> but<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.420> more<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.750> rock<00:02:10.929> crawler

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
truck but it is more of a rock crawler

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.750 
truck but it is more of a rock crawler
and<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.500> just<00:02:11.709> got<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:11.980> next<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.340> nine<00:02:12.490> three

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
and I just got it next to nine three

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.070 
and I just got it next to nine three
nine<00:02:12.790> eight<00:02:12.940> there<00:02:13.270> see<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.600> get<00:02:13.690> an<00:02:13.780> idea<00:02:14.020> of

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
nine eight there see and get an idea of

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.980 
nine eight there see and get an idea of
the<00:02:14.200> size<00:02:14.410> perspective<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:15.190> it

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.020 

now<00:02:21.650> one<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.010> other<00:02:22.040> neat<00:02:22.340> features<00:02:22.370> about

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
now one of the other neat features about

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
now one of the other neat features about
the<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:24.020> black<00:02:24.380> one<00:02:24.620> there<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.130> how<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.730> has

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
the the black one there is how it has

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.750 
the the black one there is how it has
four-wheel<00:02:27.050> drive<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.100> let<00:02:28.280> me<00:02:28.370> show<00:02:28.520> you<00:02:28.580> how

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
four-wheel drive so let me show you how

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.220 
four-wheel drive so let me show you how
that<00:02:28.910> works<00:02:29.060> looking<00:02:29.540> underneath<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.020> here

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
that works looking underneath it here

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.840 
that works looking underneath it here
and<00:02:30.440> one<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.100> things<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.400> want<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.610> show<00:02:31.790> you

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
and one of the things I want to show you

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.850 
and one of the things I want to show you
is<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.630> does<00:02:32.810> not<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.320> particular

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
is that it does not this particular

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.910 
is that it does not this particular
model<00:02:34.070> does<00:02:34.400> not<00:02:34.970> use<00:02:35.210> differentials<00:02:35.960> it<00:02:36.740> uses

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
model does not use differentials it uses

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.160 
model does not use differentials it uses
just<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:41.000> knob<00:02:41.210> gears<00:02:41.630> meshed<00:02:41.990> together

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
just to the knob gears meshed together

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.150 
just to the knob gears meshed together
there<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.780> result<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.380> this<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.950> it

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
there and so the result of this is it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.180 
there and so the result of this is it
you<00:02:46.520> do<00:02:46.670> not<00:02:46.790> have<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.620> slippage<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:49.040> you

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
you do not have the slippage that you

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.190 
you do not have the slippage that you
experience<00:02:49.850> when<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.240> use<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> differential

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
experience when you use a differential

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.290 
experience when you use a differential
and<00:02:51.560> as<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.100> result<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.820> thing<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.240> very

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
and as a result this thing is very

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.930 
and as a result this thing is very
powerful<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:54.800> very<00:02:54.980> good<00:02:55.220> at<00:02:55.280> climbing

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
powerful and it's very good at climbing

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.880 
powerful and it's very good at climbing
and<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.300> very<00:02:56.840> good<00:02:56.990> at<00:02:57.230> going<00:02:57.380> over<00:02:57.740> obstacles

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
and is very good at going over obstacles

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.960 
and is very good at going over obstacles
so<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:58.850> like<00:02:59.630> how<00:02:59.900> it's<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.830> rock<00:03:01.160> climber<00:03:01.550> or<00:03:01.700> a

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
so I like how it's a a rock climber or a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.540 
so I like how it's a a rock climber or a
trial<00:03:02.390> truck<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.990> it's<00:03:03.440> got<00:03:03.620> very<00:03:03.980> good<00:03:04.100> power

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
trial truck and it's got very good power

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.190 
trial truck and it's got very good power
to<00:03:04.880> all<00:03:05.060> four<00:03:05.360> wheels<00:03:05.390> you're<00:03:05.870> not<00:03:05.990> going<00:03:06.140> to

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
to all four wheels you're not going to

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.930 
to all four wheels you're not going to
have<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.470> slippage<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:06.920> few<00:03:07.250> experience<00:03:07.790> when

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
have the slippage a few experience when

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.670 
have the slippage a few experience when
you<00:03:08.000> use<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.120> differential<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.050> without<00:03:09.500> any

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
you use a differential so without any

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.410 
you use a differential so without any
further<00:03:09.770> ado<00:03:10.070> guys<00:03:10.280> let's<00:03:11.000> see<00:03:11.150> how<00:03:11.270> this

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
further ado guys let's see how this

00:03:11.420 --> 00:06:14.120 
further ado guys let's see how this
thing<00:03:11.480> does<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:12.050> an<00:03:12.170> obstacle<00:03:12.470> course

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.190 

so<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.150> last<00:06:15.300> thing<00:06:15.480> I<00:06:15.600> want<00:06:15.750> to<00:06:15.810> show<00:06:15.960> you<00:06:16.050> is

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
so the last thing I want to show you is

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.290 
so the last thing I want to show you is
the<00:06:16.350> two-speed<00:06:16.830> shiftable<00:06:17.220> transmission<00:06:17.970> and

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
the two-speed shiftable transmission and

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.210 
the two-speed shiftable transmission and
it<00:06:18.750> you<00:06:19.020> can<00:06:19.140> shift<00:06:19.290> on<00:06:19.470> the<00:06:19.560> fly<00:06:19.740> so<00:06:19.770> here<00:06:20.130> we

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
it you can shift on the fly so here we

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.540 
it you can shift on the fly so here we
go

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
go

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.190 
go
so<00:06:20.790> this<00:06:20.940> is<00:06:21.120> in<00:06:21.240> the<00:06:21.300> low-speed<00:06:23.840> and<00:06:24.840> there<00:06:25.050> it

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
so this is in the low-speed and there it

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.290 
so this is in the low-speed and there it
goes<00:06:25.230> in<00:06:25.530> faster<00:06:25.920> speed<00:06:26.190> so<00:06:26.460> it's<00:06:26.670> it's<00:06:27.240> a

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
goes in faster speed so it's it's a

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.330 
goes in faster speed so it's it's a
little<00:06:27.330> difficult<00:06:27.930> to<00:06:27.990> see<00:06:28.260> but<00:06:31.220> do<00:06:32.220> it<00:06:32.250> in

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
little difficult to see but do it in

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.920 
little difficult to see but do it in
Reverse<00:06:32.640> here<00:06:32.940> and<00:06:33.180> we'll<00:06:33.330> just<00:06:33.360> shift<00:06:33.780> it

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
Reverse here and we'll just shift it

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.220 
Reverse here and we'll just shift it
back<00:06:34.140> into<00:06:34.350> low<00:06:34.650> gear<00:06:35.570> so<00:06:36.570> here<00:06:36.750> we<00:06:36.840> are<00:06:36.870> in<00:06:37.080> low

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
back into low gear so here we are in low

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:43.130 
back into low gear so here we are in low
gear<00:06:40.340> and<00:06:41.340> you<00:06:41.520> see<00:06:41.730> it<00:06:41.820> in<00:06:42.030> fast<00:06:42.330> gear<00:06:42.630> fast

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140 
gear and you see it in fast gear fast

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:51.879 
gear and you see it in fast gear fast
gear

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.129 

so<00:06:52.610> overall<00:06:52.849> guys<00:06:53.150> this<00:06:53.419> is<00:06:53.569> a<00:06:53.599> fantastic

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
so overall guys this is a fantastic

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.589 
so overall guys this is a fantastic
crawler<00:06:54.710> and/or<00:06:55.340> trial<00:06:55.669> truck<00:06:56.000> whichever<00:06:56.389> you

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 
crawler and/or trial truck whichever you

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.029 
crawler and/or trial truck whichever you
want<00:06:56.689> to<00:06:56.810> call<00:06:56.870> it<00:06:57.199> or<00:06:57.319> however<00:06:57.500> you<00:06:57.800> want<00:06:57.949> to

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 
want to call it or however you want to

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:00.129 
want to call it or however you want to
use<00:06:58.159> it<00:06:58.370> I'm<00:06:58.729> very<00:06:58.939> glad<00:06:59.090> that<00:06:59.180> I<00:06:59.389> found<00:06:59.780> it<00:06:59.990> and

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:00.139 
use it I'm very glad that I found it and
