floor was all caved in here so I added

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.040 
floor was all caved in here so I added
some<00:00:29.210> 8-inch<00:00:31.279> two<00:00:32.279> by<00:00:32.430> two<00:00:32.489> angle<00:00:32.940> iron<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:34.020> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
some 8-inch two by two angle iron to a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.959 
some 8-inch two by two angle iron to a
floor<00:00:34.790> as<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.059> see<00:00:36.300> I'm<00:00:36.930> not<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
floor as you can see I'm not the

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.959 
floor as you can see I'm not the
greatest<00:00:38.969> welder<00:00:40.219> but<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.520> gave<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
greatest welder but I gave it a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.139 
greatest welder but I gave it a
sledgehammer<00:00:42.270> test<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:42.989> hoping<00:00:43.290> that

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
sledgehammer test so I'm hoping that

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.770 
sledgehammer test so I'm hoping that
that<00:00:45.149> does<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.600> pretty<00:00:45.840> good<00:00:47.570> like<00:00:48.570> yeah

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that does it out pretty good like yeah

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
that does it out pretty good like yeah
the<00:00:50.149> when<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.270> replace<00:00:51.390> all<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:52.280> great<00:00:53.280> here

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
expensive so we got it pieces cut and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.870 
expensive so we got it pieces cut and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
this I'm going to end up using just

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.630 
this I'm going to end up using just
regular<00:01:50.759> farm<00:01:51.240> implement<00:01:51.720> paint<00:01:52.189> got<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.340> tied

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
regular farm implement paint got it tied

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.130 
regular farm implement paint got it tied
up<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:53.970> ceiling<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.869> doesn't

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
up to the ceiling there so it doesn't

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.980 
up to the ceiling there so it doesn't
fall<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.710> me<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.130> don't<00:01:56.250> trust<00:01:56.610> it

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
fall out on me there I don't trust it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.709 
fall out on me there I don't trust it
but<00:01:57.990> Daniels<00:01:58.469> i<00:01:58.619> did<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:59.180> tailgate<00:02:00.180> here's<00:02:00.420> my

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
but Daniels i did on tailgate here's my

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.530 
but Daniels i did on tailgate here's my
tractor<00:02:01.140> kept<00:02:01.350> running<00:02:01.680> through<00:02:02.329> that<00:02:03.329> great

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
tractor kept running through that great

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.830 
tractor kept running through that great
when<00:02:03.719> I'd<00:02:03.810> run<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.229> ramp<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.520> added

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
when I'd run it up the ramp so I added

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.150 
when I'd run it up the ramp so I added
these<00:02:06.840> little<00:02:06.899> pieces<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.710> i'm<00:02:07.829> hoping<00:02:08.129> that

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
these little pieces here i'm hoping that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.000 
these little pieces here i'm hoping that
just<00:02:08.429> gives<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.700> enough<00:02:09.000> no<00:02:09.840> support

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
just gives it enough no support

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.240 
just gives it enough no support

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
originally it stuck to the bottom of

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.800 
originally it stuck to the bottom of
this

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
this

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.660 
this
as<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:18.930> can<00:04:19.109> see<00:04:19.380> here<00:04:19.799> but<00:04:20.130> every<00:04:20.340> time<00:04:20.489> you

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
as you can see here but every time you

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.080 
as you can see here but every time you
back<00:04:20.880> up<00:04:21.150> you'd<00:04:21.359> end<00:04:21.510> up<00:04:21.600> crushing<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:22.140> plate

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
back up you'd end up crushing a plate

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.080 
back up you'd end up crushing a plate
yeah<00:04:24.090> just<00:04:24.690> looks<00:04:24.900> like<00:04:25.020> crap<00:04:25.230> so<00:04:26.090> hoping

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
yeah just looks like crap so hoping

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.170 
yeah just looks like crap so hoping
maybe<00:04:27.860> mount<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:28.980> right<00:04:29.040> here<00:04:29.460> weld<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:29.970> on

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
maybe mount it right here weld that on

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.880 
maybe mount it right here weld that on
and<00:04:32.570> that<00:04:33.570> should<00:04:33.750> do<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:33.930> trick<00:04:36.740> well<00:04:37.740> I'm

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
and that should do the trick well I'm

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.200 
and that should do the trick well I'm
thinking<00:04:37.920> about<00:04:38.310> show<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.610> guys<00:04:38.760> my<00:04:38.820> little

compound miter saw that a guy was thrown

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.640 
compound miter saw that a guy was thrown
out<00:04:44.370> because<00:04:44.600> it<00:04:45.600> broke<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.960> handle<00:04:46.140> off<00:04:46.440> it

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
out because it broke the handle off it

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.290 
out because it broke the handle off it
so<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:47.640> just<00:04:47.730> rigged<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.690> handle<00:04:49.050> one<00:04:49.230> and
