00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.350
 it was rather a table rosé rather 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.600
 as an aperitif in etc we rather want 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.380

 and especially a lot of freshness in 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.570
 final freshness is important for 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.979
 a rosé because that's what 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.979

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.220
 for a long time and in this property 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.880
 we have been producing wine from dozens 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.630
 of years ago there have been different producers 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.310
 more or less famous 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.780

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.520

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.500
 property which is 350 meters away

 during so there are all the qualities 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.210
 to make very good whites and 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.440
 very good rosés maybe also 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.340
 red but in any case for the rose and 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.340
