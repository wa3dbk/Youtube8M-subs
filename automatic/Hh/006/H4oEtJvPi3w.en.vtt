00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 feet of two models wearing sandals 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.020
 for pink the other is black she paraded 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.550
 in a room 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.550
 I celebrated Ana and the other blonde. 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.150
 hello my name is bad this is my signal 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.570
 I live in florianópolis and I'm deaf 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.820
 I graduated from the modeling course a long time ago. 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.680
 time we see that the deaf they 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.010
 are inserted in different contexts 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.679
 but in the context of fashion we do not 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.410
 there are not many deaf are just a few 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.260
 You can point it in the hand, for example in the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.090
 future, what we want is that one who 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.770
 south it is that age throughout and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.870
 anywhere he is 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.329
 then the fashion environment it is 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.260
 important also that several deaf people have this 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.829
 dream and came to me to perform 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.870
 discourse of other models and a 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.629
 wears beauty with black spots on a 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.640
 red laser ounce pattern pants 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.129
 jeans and thin heel sandal 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.500
 the brunette wears pink social shirt 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.049
 and black scarpin what my course has to 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.640
 different is the issue of adaptation to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.159
 sign language 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.799
 it is focused on the sign language then 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.150
 it strikes the deaf person that since the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.630
 deaf person to communicate in a way 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.580
 different from the 20 it needs 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.689
 feature that is the sign language then 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.570
 all contents as tag the tur 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.729
 parade then they are all 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.189
 adapted for sign language 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.259
 two models parade while some 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.259
 people observe at the end of the course 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.920
 they put one hand on the waist 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.000
 bending one knee give U-turn 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.950
 model of the ounce pattern 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.770
 tech body my name is the patrician my 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.409
 It's a good sign that I'm interested in 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.060
 the modeling area was for the first time 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.159
 experience that I had a lot of time 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.530
 ago because he had already participated in 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.659
 some some work as model 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.729
 and I think the deaf he is able to 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.140
 to be in this area as much as the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.790
 listener it can become a 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.920
 professional the same way I 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.929
 I participated in a model course for the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.120
 Vinci was very cool, I learned many 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.660
 What school is the teacher had? 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.880
 roads 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.290
 but the teacher spoke very quickly and 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.660
 I had no interpreter 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.240
 so all I learned was because one 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.030
 my friend passed me and I ended up 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.090
 coop year and cold imitating everything the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.910
 other models did and my perception 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.580
 It's totally visual then when I came 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.530
 This time I felt much better because it is 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.260
 that I'm in my peers 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.240
 the ruy teacher he is sueli is a user 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.310
 Sign language then to me. 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.650
 This course is much better because it 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.630
 is reaching my need that the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.550
 our issue is not deficiency of our 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.130
 question is efficiency his dream is 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.740
 able as much as or 20 so this is 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.330
 It is important to show society the 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.430
 male model dressed in shirt 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:04.870

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:06.550
 jeans and black sneakers parade my

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.410
 my interest in entering a course of 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.860
 models and found it very cool because I 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.540
 I saw the teacher and the bad teacher and he 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.190
 always working this out with the girls 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.540
 so I was interested in this area 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.190
 Maybe I know that the 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.040
 model profession she is complicated 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.519
 both for me for being a man and for people 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.590

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.810

 interest in this area is so that in the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.170
 future I become a professional
