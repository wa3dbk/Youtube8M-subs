00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 nine people the holidays are here already 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.470
 a bit longer and also the free one 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 time has already come to an end 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.889
 Most of us have to go back to school 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.880
 to work or to university 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.530
 and if it has not noticed 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.210
 we already have 2014 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.410
 happy new year as befits a 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.090
 Of course there is a new year 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.400
 countless people who called 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.630
 doing good things that means 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.580
 that one the change of the year numbers 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.800
 be a calendar as occasion takes 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.300
 to change lives because I mean that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 yes, at no other time 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.260
 possible how unrealistic it would be 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.570
 for example to say okay next week 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.579
 travel with the smoke or okay 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.430
 Tomorrow I will be standing at 16h instead of 16h 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.320
 at 14 o'clock or something like that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.390
 well i would have on technology rostock and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.879
 make yellow homework and what merkel 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.649
 unrealistic would that be so yes you 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.629
 be so from the first of january 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.390
 completely change everything to life 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.829
 good to turn around then the second 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.149
 january but i mean to break 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.250
 I would not be me if I did not 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.260
 The best tips would be how to do that 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.730
 At least it can prevent something 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.229
 partly the hands of you with it 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.060
 have meanwhile heard live 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.640
 we in the so-called digital age 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.930
 so to speak the facebook annoyed it 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.250
 is no longer important that 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.510
 you also keep things the others 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.869
 People say you do not understand what I mean 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.280
 my 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.710
 for example, a small example 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.240
 that people think that you are from 2014 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.130
 sport but of course makes you have such 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.840
 every normal 130 videos on the internet 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.580
 buys absolutely no boxing to 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.409
 So what are you doing best ? 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.390
 just you told a sweatpants 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.040
 a photo of it on instagram and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.079
 write something under it like first 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.820
 again training hashtags for 2014 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.170
 hashtag allofs Poland and you can 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.259
 eat chips and breakfast or that it 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.340
 somebody hears us second portals 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.750
 people want me to think that 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.040
 feed me healthy then just post 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.750
 a photo of a talking plate and 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.850
 write something below how true this 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.890
 vegan cake was so tasty hashtag for 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.149
 2014 and you can get tips for 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.100
 breakfast eat without anyone 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.390
 or you have the big one 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.740
 problem-they are on with your parents 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.270
 facebook wanted to be friends 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.770
 They think that their new year is finally over 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.759
 Something for the school does post 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.040
 simply a picture of a wakeboard 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.390
 college block with 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.290
 a pension formula on it the parents 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 probably do not understand anyway 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.570
 and does something like that 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.980
 math learn fun hashtag brainfood 2014 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.800
 and you can already have chips for breakfast 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.330
 eat without you feeling well 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.400
 you can just have chips and breakfast 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.900
 food so we are completely honest 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.950
 People will never be the ideal ones 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.480
 Conditions give to his life 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.920
 good and just because of yourself 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.000
 any payment calendar changes 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.500
 does not mean that the chances 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.150
 bigger are that you finally be now 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.190
 life can turn to the good 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.390
 it may not be much more important 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.460
 constantly talking about what you do 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.080
 just want to improve it 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.370
 to try what can go wrong 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.720
 if you liked the video then 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.430
 I would always think about a thumb 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.900
 up and if you still have 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.720
 you want to know how you like your ideas for 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.800
 2014 really can really keep up 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.330
 then you look down there I have you 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.160
 namely a video of the jsw 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.810
 lifestyle explain you the whole 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.090
 and if you want to know how here 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.680
 2014 can be even fitter than me 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.790
 anyway, then you are allowed to look 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.870
 in there I have for you back 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.459
 playlist ball will be in the back 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.470
 next days still very quite completely 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.400
 looks uploaded quite a lot of clichÃ©s 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.830
 look at that in any case 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.180
 and yes , thank you very much 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.300
