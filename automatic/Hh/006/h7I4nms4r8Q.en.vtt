00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.530
 fleming days of piano lessons 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.630
 now 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.139
 the last time and mundaka 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.199
 that day 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.319
 another of the basic elements 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.089
 of the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.130
 quito 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.099
 in the chopped battery 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.099
 percent the other element that we need 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.230
 Villa Lobos 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.619
 percent and finish putting together 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:27.710
 a group 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.499
 pretty basic percent 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.869
 but what 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.869
 in the event 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.850
 this music would be the hype 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.070
 and the hype normally p usually goes 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.590
 percent 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.160
 the traditional way their education 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.510
 in the second blow 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.060
 from part 3 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.210
 the act 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.260
 Porlamar clarified that the shoe center the key 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 the collapsed 3 2 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.710
 He passed 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.560
 the goalkeeper 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 and day 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.560
 yes 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.210
 second goal 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.210
 of the act 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.420
 if we did 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.010
 is together with the box 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.010
 Yesterday 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.460
 that group itself 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.460
 he already has the most basic elements 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.790
 necessary 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.790
 in ee little faster 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.319
 ee 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.329
 redon was developed in a little more 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.169
 and you usually touch 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.049
 many people just touch it 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.929
 percent 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.469
 palm 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.019
 based on the same 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.249
 this cut is said Slovenian clinically 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:33.019
 fair the pi 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.019
 to come p 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.129
 3 as 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.789
 quito 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.789
 the world 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.439
 what your choice 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.869
 some people 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.399
 thrust 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.209
 In addition to cutting 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.359
 first repeat it in the second not only in the 1st 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.359
 it's her 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.179
 that way so many in the first measure with the second 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.659
 that is an option the other option is to touch also 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.659
 the fourth 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:39.099
 if we achieve that way we are really doing 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.629
 percent ethically 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.759
 peaceful 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:44.679
 that is taking the country 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:46.559
 as basic soho 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:47.809
 zabalza 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.489
 this fair map 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.459
 the same the British actor 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.619
 that is wearing the bass so if people use it 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.199
 because he usually gives that projected 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.829
 efe 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.129
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.089
 anyway, if we are going to play sama 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.599
 you have to try percent 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.719
 watch out 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:12.829
 with the volume 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:13.760
 but 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.189
 portman minds usually happens 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:21.759
 what the trend especially for people coming the world 8 picasso 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.889
 roo photo 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.240
 efe the summit according to you very heavy 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:31.050
 and the group 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.150
 the sense 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.789
 it does not sound and also 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.789
 like overwhelming her too much as is logical 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:46.129
 most advanced dubner 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.129
 viedma peace 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.590
 start down there 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.879
 bamako what says so much 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.169
 because I have done 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.849
 all these elements that we are driving 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.849
 they are not in the mind of the battery 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.249
 are the expert clarified today then the key instrument 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.629
 read 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.629
 efe 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.289
 the shell like Miguel the day before 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.289
 percent p 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.229
 ap 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:32.309
 aeca 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.340
 11 get a little closer 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.050
 as well 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.599
 think usually touch 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.339
 on his side 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.509
 of the 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.509

 efe 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.509
 general peace 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:02.719
 It can also work 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:05.050
 l 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.570
 percent the hype really p 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.039
 p 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.809
 traditionally 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:14.790
 the states get more prisoners 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.270
 God 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.779
 very big umu 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:19.189
 plus 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:24.619
 So much force, because I think it's an efe 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:26.659
 that hype note 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.659
 this one that is 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.210
 It is usually done with your vote oo 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.960
 yes no return 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.770
 12 that does not have 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.259
 so much happens in the 4th field c always keep it same then there you have to 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:45.379
 make combinations today for some of the blows 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:48.379
 change it peace 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.129
 without any specific pattern but rather 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:06:59.990
 l 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.139
 focused little on music 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.610
 really should always be the music the twitter network 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:09.679
 which is appropriate to play depending on what the subjects are playing 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.579
