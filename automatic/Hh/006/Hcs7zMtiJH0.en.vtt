00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.350
 hello how about friends to be able to fight in 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.860
 this time we have the unboxing of 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.889
 alcatel one touch idol 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.559
 a mid -range smartphone that aspires to 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.910
 be the high-end team and that now 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.789
 we are also going to analyze here in the 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.919
 channel to be able to fight what do you think if 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.919
 we started to open the box 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.730
 this is the case of the alcatel one touch 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.360
 idol the smartphone that is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.780
 promoting Iusacell now very 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.780
 strongly 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.800
 social networks are your advertising in 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.500
 children in general 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.350
 in fact they do not have featured articles 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.350
 on univision.com and this is the smartphone 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.830
 the alcatel one touch idol as they can 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.370
 see they have a good screen size 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.320
 has a 4.7 inch screen that 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.020
 you will know more about the programmed 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.590
 let's remove the paper to leave it 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.590
 turning on 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.530
 and we are going to remove the back cover 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.390
 sleep in I was wrong has not 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.390
 I think it's a unibody design 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.390
 I'm a little pile if it's right there 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.990
 a little pile we go to the minute while 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.350
 we keep taking the rest of things out of the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.350
 box 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.120
 brings a screensaver like 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.800
 can see 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.570
 bring your classic manuals 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.570
 and telcel's classic stationery 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.720
 that as I say nobody cares 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.250
 I bring 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.140
 there are these some hearing aids 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.170
 the cartel mark alcatel that does not have 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.480
 nothing special is 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.290
 now that we tested 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.659
 we have the microusb cable installed and 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.810
 finally the recurring charger will 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:24.599
 it looks a lot like those of htc is a 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.069
 copy but a little one of the htc but 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.069
 this fact is more compact 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.310
 and well this is the alcatel one in the one 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.329
 I'm going to zoom in a little bit for 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.329
 who can appreciate it better 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.760
 and here is the alcatel 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.080
 As you can see, the screen has 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.870
 very good resolution 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.460
 if maybe it looks a little off we're going to 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.460
 see if we can raise a bit of brightness 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.480
 on the smartphone, it has a good 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.870
 design the finish of back we are going to 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.799
 remove this stamp 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.799
 this protector 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.829
 over here 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.530
 and the finish because it spends nothing wrong in the 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.319
 rear simulates being metal although in 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.549
 reality is polycarbonate now yes 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.140
 I want it to be published with you 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.490
 more like plastic 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.360
 do not feel anything else bed 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.650
 the camera has a small mismatch does not go 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.030
 to take out even more to see if we can 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.100
 reach to appreciate me it costs me a 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.470
 little charged down the camera not 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.290
 is completely focused on the 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.709
 part of the entity has its flashes 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.920
 it's the smartphone as you can see it brings 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:51.490
 then part of the parcel of 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.990
 trash apps from telcel 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.380
 I do not know why they insist on following 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.960
 installing but good excuse me 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.890
 phone 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.990
 now we are going to continue and the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.090
 screen has a pixel saturation 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.930
 pretty good that I did not expect to see from 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.150
 done in this team 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.459
 I'm really dying to try it for 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.319
 see really how much advanced alcatel 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.509

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.269
