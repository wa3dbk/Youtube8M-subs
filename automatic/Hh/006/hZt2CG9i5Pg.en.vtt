00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
okay so as far as the issue with when

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.650 
okay so as far as the issue with when
you<00:00:04.650> use<00:00:04.860> your<00:00:05.009> air<00:00:05.460> conditioners<00:00:06.060> are<00:00:06.360> taking

you use your air conditioners are taking

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.460 
you use your air conditioners are taking
up<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:07.319> lot<00:00:08.040> more<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.519> your<00:00:08.730> gas<00:00:09.320> when<00:00:10.320> you're

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:10.470 
up a lot more of your gas when you're

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.690 
up a lot more of your gas when you're
running<00:00:10.620> than<00:00:10.920> not<00:00:11.160> running<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.550> air

conditioner<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.900> not<00:00:13.080> true<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.830> I'll

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
conditioner that is not true and I'll

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.070 
conditioner that is not true and I'll
tell<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.670> why<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.120> not<00:00:15.179> true<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.719> I'll<00:00:15.809> show

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
tell you why it's not true and I'll show

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.929 
tell you why it's not true and I'll show
you<00:00:16.139> why<00:00:16.409> it's<00:00:16.619> not<00:00:16.710> true<00:00:17.099> here's<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:17.819> truck

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
you why it's not true here's my truck

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.870 
you why it's not true here's my truck
the<00:00:20.939> AC<00:00:21.439> has<00:00:22.439> freon<00:00:22.979> in<00:00:23.159> it<00:00:23.310> already<00:00:23.579> there's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the AC has freon in it already there's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.399 
the AC has freon in it already there's
an<00:00:23.970> evaporator<00:00:24.599> there's<00:00:24.929> all<00:00:25.079> types<00:00:25.289> of

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:25.409 
an evaporator there's all types of

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.639 
an evaporator there's all types of
little<00:00:25.649> things<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.640> here<00:00:27.089> is<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:28.439> AC

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
little things and this here is the AC

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.309 
little things and this here is the AC
compressor<00:00:29.249> and<00:00:29.729> you<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.050> running

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:31.319 
compressor and you see how it's running

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.840 
compressor and you see how it's running
on<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> belt<00:00:32.120> so<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.420> AC<00:00:33.690> compressor<00:00:34.230> is

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
on the belt so this AC compressor is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.060 
on the belt so this AC compressor is
always<00:00:35.850> spinning<00:00:36.269> no<00:00:36.750> matter<00:00:36.929> if<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> air

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
always spinning no matter if the air

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.060 
always spinning no matter if the air
conditioner<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.239> or<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:40.109> so<00:00:40.589> I'm<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:41.010> to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
conditioner is on or not so I'm going to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.979 
conditioner is on or not so I'm going to
turn<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> truck<00:00:41.609> on<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.120> I'm<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.690> show

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
turn the truck on and I'm going to show

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.369 
turn the truck on and I'm going to show
you<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.190> spinning<00:00:44.489> without<00:00:45.199> the<00:00:46.199> AC

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
you that it's spinning without the AC

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.259 
you that it's spinning without the AC
being<00:00:46.949> on<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.120> part<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:50.850> part<00:00:50.969> in

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
being on and then this part this part in

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.130 
being on and then this part this part in
the<00:00:51.390> middle<00:00:53.030> will<00:00:54.030> not<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.359> spinning<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the middle will not be spinning but the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.160 
the middle will not be spinning but the
pulley<00:00:55.469> itself<00:00:55.980> will<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.969> spinning<00:00:57.269> and<00:00:57.570> when

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
pulley itself will be spinning and when

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.630 
pulley itself will be spinning and when
you<00:00:58.260> turn<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.499> your<00:00:58.649> air<00:00:58.949> conditioner<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
you turn on your air conditioner the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.399 
you turn on your air conditioner the
only<00:01:00.269> thing<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.600> happens<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.109> there's<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
only thing that happens is there's a

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.049 
only thing that happens is there's a
cell<00:01:01.620> annoyed<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.370> it'll<00:01:02.850> click

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
cell annoyed in there and it'll click

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.050 
cell annoyed in there and it'll click
this<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.569> and<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.769> will<00:01:04.890> use<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.339> force<00:01:05.610> that's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
this on and it will use the force that's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.690 
this on and it will use the force that's
already<00:01:06.509> being<00:01:06.810> put<00:01:07.079> on<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.320> belt<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:08.369> spin

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
already being put on this belt to spin

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.670 
already being put on this belt to spin
this<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:09.990> compress<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
this and then this will compress the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.460 
this and then this will compress the
freon<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.399> you<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.630> other<00:01:13.020> stuff<00:01:13.290> can

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
freon and you know the other stuff can

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.990 
freon and you know the other stuff can
work<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.950> your<00:01:14.369> air<00:01:14.490> conditioner<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:14.970> going

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
work and your air conditioner is going

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.030 
work and your air conditioner is going
to<00:01:15.149> come<00:01:15.329> on<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.439> thing<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.740> already

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
to come on so this thing is already

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.319 
to come on so this thing is already
spinning<00:01:17.250> all<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.579> way<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.850> doesn't<00:01:18.030> take

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
spinning all the way it doesn't take

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.639 
spinning all the way it doesn't take
more<00:01:18.570> gas<00:01:18.840> mileage<00:01:19.469> it<00:01:19.710> may<00:01:20.490> take<00:01:20.939> about<00:01:21.649> just

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
more gas mileage it may take about just

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.100 
more gas mileage it may take about just
a<00:01:22.740> tiny<00:01:23.009> bit<00:01:23.340> more<00:01:23.399> force<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.420> get<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.869> whole

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
a tiny bit more force to get this whole

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.139 
a tiny bit more force to get this whole
thing<00:01:25.140> spinning<00:01:25.740> than<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.579> just<00:01:26.850> get<00:01:27.000> this

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
thing spinning than to just get this

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.840 
thing spinning than to just get this
pulley<00:01:27.420> spinning<00:01:27.899> where<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> belt<00:01:28.380> is

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
pulley spinning where the belt is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.649 
pulley spinning where the belt is
because<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.000> always<00:01:30.119> spinning<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
because it's always spinning all the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.709 
because it's always spinning all the
time<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.140> takes<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.439> tiniest<00:01:31.799> bit<00:01:32.100> more<00:01:32.719> to

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
time it takes the tiniest bit more to

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.840 
time it takes the tiniest bit more to
make<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.259> thing<00:01:34.439> spin<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.549> go<00:01:35.670> I'm

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
make this thing spin so here we go I'm

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.459 
make this thing spin so here we go I'm
going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.090> show<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:36.899> going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.140> turn<00:01:37.320> my

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.070 
the belt is spinning I'm going to turn
the<00:02:00.799> AC<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:01.159> now<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.939> you'll<00:02:02.600> just<00:02:02.750> see<00:02:02.930> that

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
the AC on now and you'll just see that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.820 
the AC on now and you'll just see that
the<00:02:03.170> belt<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.560> still<00:02:04.189> spinning<00:02:04.430> max<00:02:05.330> AC<00:02:05.830> I'm

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
the belt is still spinning max AC I'm

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:16.880 
the belt is still spinning max AC I'm
going<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.040> turn<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.220> all<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.340> way<00:02:07.430> up

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.650 

and<00:02:17.340> that's<00:02:17.790> what<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.060> looks<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.300> when<00:02:18.510> it's

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
and that's what it looks like when it's

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.870 
and that's what it looks like when it's
on<00:02:24.140> when<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.260> turn<00:02:25.440> your<00:02:25.650> AC<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.430> when<00:02:26.760> you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
on when you turn your AC on and when you

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.970 
on when you turn your AC on and when you
turn<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.210> fan<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.500> fans<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:28.920> are

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
turn this fan on that the fans that are

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.130 
turn this fan on that the fans that are
in<00:02:29.130> here<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.310> blows<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.240> air<00:02:30.390> out<00:02:30.660> it's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
in here that blows the the air out it's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.480 
in here that blows the the air out it's
not<00:02:31.350> using<00:02:31.680> gas<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:33.750> spin<00:02:34.140> because<00:02:35.130> it's

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
not using gas to spin because it's

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.120 
not using gas to spin because it's
already<00:02:35.820> spinning<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.450> there<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.950> an

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
more that it will take to make this

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
alternator always puts out more amps

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.090 
alternator always puts out more amps

runs your headlights it runs everything

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.670 
runs your headlights it runs everything
but<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.120> constantly<00:03:09.660> always<00:03:09.930> putting<00:03:10.530> out

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
but it's constantly always putting out

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.040 
but it's constantly always putting out
the<00:03:11.310> same<00:03:11.580> amount<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.060> amps<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:12.630> just<00:03:12.870> how

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
the same amount of amps it's just how

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.080 
the same amount of amps it's just how
many<00:03:13.110> amps<00:03:13.500> are<00:03:13.709> being<00:03:13.920> drawn<00:03:14.250> from<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.790> and

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
many amps are being drawn from it and

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.860 
many amps are being drawn from it and
this<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:15.930> an<00:03:16.020> electrical<00:03:16.620> thing<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.720> on

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
this is an electrical thing and it's on

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.280 
this is an electrical thing and it's on
the<00:03:18.989> belt<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.190> belt<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.550> always<00:03:20.820> spinning

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
the belt so the belt is always spinning

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.180 
the belt so the belt is always spinning
regardless<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.440> whether<00:03:22.590> or<00:03:22.680> not<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:23.010> have

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
regardless of whether or not you have

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.270 
regardless of whether or not you have
the<00:03:23.220> AC<00:03:23.580> on<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.350> I've<00:03:25.350> heard<00:03:25.830> people<00:03:25.950> say<00:03:26.250> that

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
the AC on and I've heard people say that

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.820 
the AC on and I've heard people say that
they<00:03:26.459> took<00:03:26.790> trips<00:03:27.120> one<00:03:27.420> way<00:03:27.630> with<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.110> AC<00:03:28.320> on

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
they took trips one way with the AC on

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.580 
they took trips one way with the AC on
one<00:03:29.670> way<00:03:29.880> with<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.360> AC<00:03:30.540> off<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.470> they

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
one way with the AC off and that they

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.820 
one way with the AC off and that they
got<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:32.519> little<00:03:33.120> bit<00:03:33.360> not<00:03:34.019> even<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.350> lot<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.530> little

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
got a little bit not even a lot a little

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.940 
got a little bit not even a lot a little
bit<00:03:35.130> better<00:03:36.060> gas<00:03:36.330> mileage<00:03:36.360> with<00:03:36.989> it<00:03:37.170> off<00:03:37.350> and

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
bit better gas mileage with it off and

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.199 
bit better gas mileage with it off and
I'm<00:03:38.070> talking<00:03:38.370> about<00:03:38.400> maybe<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.820> six<00:03:39.120> hundred

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
I'm talking about maybe a six hundred

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.960 
I'm talking about maybe a six hundred
mile<00:03:39.570> trip<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:40.340> they<00:03:41.340> might<00:03:41.580> have<00:03:41.610> gotten

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
mile trip and they might have gotten

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.160 
mile trip and they might have gotten
thirty<00:03:42.690> or<00:03:42.870> forty<00:03:43.350> miles<00:03:44.269> less<00:03:45.269> in<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.720> whole

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
thirty or forty miles less in that whole

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.500 
thirty or forty miles less in that whole
trip<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.709> that's<00:03:47.610> really<00:03:47.850> not<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.060> lot<00:03:48.150> and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
trip and that's really not a lot and

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.430 
trip and that's really not a lot and
plus<00:03:49.019> that's<00:03:49.200> not<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.470> very<00:03:49.860> scientific<00:03:50.130> test

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
plus that's not a very scientific test

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.410 
plus that's not a very scientific test
because<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.650> fact<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.910> driving

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
because of the fact that the the driving

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.990 
because of the fact that the the driving
conditions<00:03:55.410> are<00:03:55.530> going<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.769> be<00:03:55.890> different<00:03:56.340> so

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
conditions are going to be different so

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.259 
conditions are going to be different so
that's<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.350> that's<00:03:59.070> my<00:03:59.370> thing<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.060> had<00:04:00.239> a

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
that's a that's my thing and I had a

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.509 
that's a that's my thing and I had a
miles<00:04:00.540> per<00:04:00.810> gallon<00:04:01.170> gauge<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:02.190> I've<00:04:02.310> done

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
miles per gallon gauge and I've done

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.250 
miles per gallon gauge and I've done
that<00:04:02.670> I've<00:04:02.850> driven<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.360> highway<00:04:03.750> where

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
that I've driven on the highway where

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.390 
that I've driven on the highway where
there's<00:04:04.440> no<00:04:04.530> one<00:04:04.709> in<00:04:04.799> front<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.070> me<00:04:05.130> no<00:04:05.280> one

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
there's no one in front of me no one

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.330 
there's no one in front of me no one
behind<00:04:05.760> me<00:04:05.940> and

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
behind me and

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.460 
behind me and
and<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:08.510> you<00:04:08.569> know<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:08.989> I'll<00:04:09.050> look<00:04:09.200> at<00:04:09.319> the

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
and a you know and I'll look at the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.470 
and a you know and I'll look at the
instant<00:04:09.770> miles<00:04:09.950> per<00:04:10.160> gallon<00:04:10.520> and<00:04:10.670> then<00:04:11.330> I'll

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480
