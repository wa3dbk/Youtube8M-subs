 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.999
 new edition of the tennis europe racket 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.190
 test today , our bats report 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:15.030
 tester of the new wilson byrne 100 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.189
 with 16 19 pages with the introduction of the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.080
 wilson has new racket series 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.509
 some of these surprised 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.429
 powerfully born 100 with 16 19 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.210
 side image possesses like the bat of the 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.669
 playoff series 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.949
 the novel perel drilling technology 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.259
 around the sweet spot of the racket again 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.610
 so as not to be perfect 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.660
 hit waves even better 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.280
 counteract 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.720
 in addition, the bat was grabbed 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.540
 extended to even better lever action 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.160
 exercise while the wine trader 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.580
 the backhand still more leeway too 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.410
 Offer 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.810
 likewise the clip became narrower and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.700
 clearly rounded so that any grip 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.560
 change during a rally yet 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.330
 smoother proceeding test 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.760
 experiences with this racket i 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.650
 personally have the great especially 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.210
 power and the spins potential of 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.100
 very much enjoyed 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.470
 I had a bit of a problem with it 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.070
 because of the stiffness of the racket 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.390
 I would recommend for someone who 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.730
 Problems or elbows or wrist 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.710
 problems has a soft one in any case 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.090
 side maybe a ko polyester side 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.460
 to use 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.170
 even when it comes to the tension 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.409
 I would definitely not go 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.580
 hard for easy stiffness 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.600
 a bit against the racket 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.130
 to be able to act 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.570
 a similar impression of that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.330
 bats had chris he has committee 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.370
 feeling that the stiffness is something too 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.220
 That's why he was fiercely recommending 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.450
 to soft-string the bat 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.830
 However, he has in the feeling of the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.530
 Baseline has the good stability 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.270
 he also had the feeling that he had 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.800
 good in the spin could get out and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.620
 just a lot of pressure from the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.570
 could pull balls britney and kali 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.790
 also with this byrne 100 racket 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.280
 test were found the racket good 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.750
 but did not necessarily find him on hers 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.659
 tailored to the game 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.920
 both had the feeling of great power 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.320
 to get the bat out 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.270
 the problem sometimes was 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.450
 to keep control because of that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.930
 Both had maybe even said that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.399
 wilson of 100 usd spin technology too 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.200
 just use a bit more 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.090
 get control out of the frame 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.780
 in general, everyone had our bat 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.240
 tester a decent feel for people 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.130
 those with poor problems or too 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.290
 Wrist problems are grown 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.170
 or have difficulties with that 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.180
 All our racquets testers feel 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.800
 that with a soft side and also 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.270
 with a soft covering skits the 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.550
 strikes are raised for more 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.250
