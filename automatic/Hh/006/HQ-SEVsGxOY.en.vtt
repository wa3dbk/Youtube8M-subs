should already be there that's my one
right<00:03:05.740> there<00:03:06.090> now<00:03:07.090> I'm<00:03:07.180> going<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.360> record<00:03:07.480> this

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
right there now I'm going to record this

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.680 
right there now I'm going to record this
in<00:03:07.990> 1920<00:03:08.950> x<00:03:09.070> 1080<00:03:09.340> which<00:03:09.820> is<00:03:09.910> obviously<00:03:10.120> 1080p

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
in 1920 x 1080 which is obviously 1080p

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.600 
in 1920 x 1080 which is obviously 1080p
resolution<00:03:11.440> as<00:03:11.590> they<00:03:12.100> can<00:03:12.220> leave<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.490> aside

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
resolution as they can leave that aside

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.760 
resolution as they can leave that aside
if<00:03:12.880> you're<00:03:12.970> on<00:03:13.030> record<00:03:13.210> in<00:03:13.540> 720<00:03:14.290> put<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.650> as

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
if you're on record in 720 put that as

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.520 
if you're on record in 720 put that as
1280<00:03:15.370> by<00:03:15.580> 720<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.600> make<00:03:17.050> sure<00:03:17.080> you<00:03:17.260> leave<00:03:17.380> that

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
1280 by 720 and make sure you leave that

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.640 
1280 by 720 and make sure you leave that
aspect<00:03:17.950> ratio<00:03:18.220> on<00:03:18.400> 16<00:03:18.850> by<00:03:19.000> 9<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:20.530> can

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
aspect ratio on 16 by 9 and you can

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.770 
aspect ratio on 16 by 9 and you can
leave<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.130> downscaled<00:03:21.880> resolution<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.570> none

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
leave the downscaled resolution to none

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.300 
leave the downscaled resolution to none
that's<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.200> works<00:03:23.470> better<00:03:23.620> for<00:03:23.800> that<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:24.130> then

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
that's it works better for that and then

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.710 
that's it works better for that and then
the<00:03:24.489> FPS<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:24.970> can<00:03:25.090> obviously<00:03:25.180> choose<00:03:25.540> what

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
the FPS you can obviously choose what

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.840 
the FPS you can obviously choose what
everyone's<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.110> want<00:03:26.290> 30<00:03:26.830> or<00:03:27.070> 60<00:03:27.370> s<00:03:27.489> obviously

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
everyone's you want 30 or 60 s obviously

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.550 
everyone's you want 30 or 60 s obviously
the<00:03:27.940> way<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.120> go<00:03:28.330> for<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.660> let's<00:03:29.440> go<00:03:29.530> ahead

on screen you can see you can actually

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.160 
on screen you can see you can actually
minimize<00:04:01.330> that<00:04:01.480> I<00:04:01.540> could<00:04:01.750> be<00:04:01.810> going<00:04:01.930> around

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
minimize that I could be going around

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.479

here as well you can actually choose add

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.180 
here as well you can actually choose add
the<00:04:22.150> volume<00:04:22.570> of<00:04:22.690> your<00:04:22.810> mind

or whether you want this to muta in

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.750 
or whether you want this to muta in
general<00:04:25.200> as<00:04:25.350> in<00:04:25.590> see<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:25.890> had<00:04:26.100> them<00:04:26.250> muted<00:04:26.580> there

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
general as in see I had them muted there

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.330 
general as in see I had them muted there
but<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.180> can<00:04:27.960> change<00:04:28.140> this<00:04:28.350> is<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.650> system

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
but you can change this is the system

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.650 
but you can change this is the system
volume<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:29.880> for<00:04:30.030> example<00:04:30.090> if<00:04:30.390> you're<00:04:30.510> playing

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
volume so for example if you're playing

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.600 
volume so for example if you're playing
a<00:04:30.810> game<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.680> might<00:04:31.830> want<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.070> have<00:04:32.190> this<00:04:32.370> turn

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
a game you might want to have this turn

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.980 
a game you might want to have this turn
down<00:04:32.790> a<00:04:32.820> little<00:04:33.060> bit<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.420> maybe<00:04:33.630> your<00:04:33.810> voice

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
down a little bit and maybe your voice

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.270 
down a little bit and maybe your voice
up<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.260> little<00:04:34.410> bit<00:04:34.500> more<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:34.890> your<00:04:34.980> voice<00:04:35.130> can

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280

as you can see here you have a little

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.840 
as you can see here you have a little
kind<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.830> window<00:05:11.100> of<00:05:11.280> all<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.550> things<00:05:11.760> that

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
also did as well it works better if

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.510 
also did as well it works better if
you're<00:05:54.060> on<00:05:54.180> them<00:05:54.770> full<00:05:55.770> mode<00:05:55.980> not<00:05:56.190> windowed

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520

you're on them full mode not windowed
mode<00:05:56.640> as<00:05:56.820> well<00:05:56.850> but<00:05:57.060> as<00:05:57.180> you<00:05:57.510> can<00:05:57.600> see<00:05:57.720> you<00:05:57.810> can

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
mode as well but as you can see you can

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.080 
mode as well but as you can see you can
just<00:05:58.110> go<00:05:58.200> around<00:05:58.650> with<00:05:58.860> it<00:05:58.919> like<00:05:59.040> this<00:05:59.220> to<00:06:00.000> make

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
just go around with it like this to make

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.210 
just go around with it like this to make
sure<00:06:00.300> that<00:06:00.450> it<00:06:00.570> fits<00:06:00.600> the<00:06:01.260> right<00:06:01.590> size<00:06:01.860> for<00:06:01.980> you

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
and then that's basically it and then

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.690 
and then that's basically it and then
just<00:06:04.169> make<00:06:04.320> sure<00:06:04.350> that<00:06:04.620> you've<00:06:04.740> changed<00:06:05.340> the

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
output so i'll call the cs go to because

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.510 
output so i'll call the cs go to because

remember you already have a video called

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.700 
remember you already have a video called
csgo<00:06:11.910> so<00:06:12.090> just<00:06:12.390> overwrite<00:06:13.140> that<00:06:13.169> which<00:06:13.470> you<00:06:13.590> do
