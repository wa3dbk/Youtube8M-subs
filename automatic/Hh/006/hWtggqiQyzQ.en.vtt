00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.789
 when it's in an application 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.380
 energy saving 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.980
 this application is installed with the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.020
 modules after 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.270
 this I have and is the application 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.059
 stuck in my files 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.170
 I do them I wanted them I'm going to leave the 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.230
 link to download it on 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.340
 stable we are working with the three 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.810
 in 1900 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.810
 I have the application here 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.170
 you can see it 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.130
 for 13 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.220
 here we go will be like a freckle 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.699
 we wait 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.990
 there is already installed 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.990
 now we are going to restart this terminal 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.820
 since they remember that in order to be 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.940
 This technically phone application 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.470
 be rooted with the modules 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.470
 let's restart our phone 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.469
 let's wait a moment 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.229
 we wait 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.720
 I do not start 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.720
 let's go to the modules to activate the 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.720
 install 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.759
 and we put it here 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.310
 to activate in what is the module what 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:15.530
 we open let's install good let's 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:18.490
 apply this part down here that says 2 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.069
 well let's go here give us one of the 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.060
 warnings 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.060
 we want to proceed 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.630
 we hope that what is this 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.460
 user so that the permissions 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.690
 let's allow 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.690
 we wait a moment 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.640
 and we give it here is in force 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.460
 that we are going to come does not end again 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.840
 we hope you are already know that I use the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.709
 application something that is commented down to 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.709
 how it works 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.360
 I already started 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.150
 let's say let's go back here 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.260
 how can you see me here 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.180
 that 's that it's worth 9 energy 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.739
 we press here and you can see 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.819
 that the phone practically remains 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.819
 totally dark 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.370
 we are going to broadcast in various applications 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.470
 for you to see how it works we are going to 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.470
 do a power whatsapp after walking 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.489
 it's dark 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.489
 we are going to get in the face 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.320
 this standard 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.320
 I have to totally dark 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.310
 we have here also for you 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.310
 see 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.650
 everything here totally dark 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.199
 you can see 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.569
 everything that totally dark 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.360
 more meteors in internal 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.530
 you can see 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.530
 everything is totally dark 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.669
 we are going to give it to you 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.669
 as well 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.190
 we will put here we see again 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.960
 what is normal 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.780
 if you apply here in what is the 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.969
 application after I want to see it so 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.529
 several options 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.809
 what is an option that one goes to the 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:28.610
 store and buy the application so that 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:30.840
 it opens almost identically what is the 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.970
 sls 5 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.949
 with the same energy mode 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.310
 discovering the applications of things 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.310
 that can work 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.930
 but to do if they want to download with 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.270
 for the application that you the 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.570
 download and choose what would be this 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.570
 above 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.910
 I do not say it like that without buying that 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.070
 application 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.360
 because the phone can be this what 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.849
 what is this one 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.759
 how to explain it after cleaning up like this 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:04.510
 it can stay stuck is better 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:09.430
 only the steps that I did 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.690
 and there is an improvement if one can get into 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.529
 any application that one wants is going to 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:18.049
 go out with like this energy saving 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:19.449
 then explaining all the steps that 

00:06:18.049 --> 00:06:22.000
 I did 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:24.750
 and everything will work well 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.650
 we are working with a samsung galaxy 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.650
 13 in 1900 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.419
 they do not know what it is when he 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:45.380
 it also gets dark 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.930
 then to see also 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.930
 then it fills me very well 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.770
 I know what I said 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.960
 and again they put it on 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.340
 emergency or something like that to do the 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.480
 apps tricks could we go 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:14.150
 like the silver lining in this video 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.210
 live editor and subscribe to my channel and 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:20.080
 comment on how the application works 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.080
 good friends
