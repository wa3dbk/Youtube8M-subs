00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.469
 lautner comes to stand above the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.300
 sx in the range of suv mitsubishi and 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.070
 side of the pajero short or long which 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.230
 leans more towards the franchiser 4.4 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.359
 this third generation was launched 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.270
 end of 2012 and following the current trend 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.740
 is offered in 2 or 4 wheel drive 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.930
 the range includes a single gasoline block 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.400
 and one 2 liter diesel 250 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.449
 horses 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.680
 it's the latter who we try in 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.939
 four-wheel drive and with the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.300
 new six- speed automatic 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.399
 reports 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.350
 the double clutch box of the previous ones 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.200
 outlander disappeared with the new 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.340
 generation 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.930
 inside the presentation has 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.879
 largely evolved with a board of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 entirely new edge is far more 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.530
 flattering in perceived quality compared 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.850
 at the previous generation equipments 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.960
 has been enriched by a warning 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.930
 crossing of a line and even a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.250
 automatic braking in the city 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.649
 at the back the bench is sliding 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.449
 like on a minivan the game version 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.100
 in style in the office park the third 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.020
 row of seats but these are 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.180
 difficult to access and uncomfortable 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.250
 the chest reaches 500 of 6 cubic meters 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.100
 in 5 places well in absolute means 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.420
 for the first rounds category of 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.880
 wheels and already we say that progress 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.470
 in nationalization are not so much what 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.369
 new outlander and more civilized even 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.780
 if another high-end version 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.420
 with 18-inch wheels 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.549
 shown too firm at low speed 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.810
 then the comfort improves there is no 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.310
 sore body movements but when 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.979
 put in support taking roll remains 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.479
 mastered the 150 horses are largely 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.850
 enough to easily revive there 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.710
 included on highway the box auto 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.659
 gives all satisfaction by its speed 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.040
 to note the presence for the fighters 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.970
 a central differential lock 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.259
 with this new generation the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.759
 flanders made good progress 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.649
 especially in safety equipment or 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.850
 as a presentation which constitutes 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.450
 a weak point of the previous 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.310
 generation 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.990
 question tariff the range starts in 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.399
 diesel least another â‚¬ 30,000 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.130
 high-end version with 7 seats 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.930
 series exceeds 40 thousand euros that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.520
 starts to be expensive 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.240
 remains only with his real abilities 4.4 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.100
 and its dimensions 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.420
 this art lander does not compete 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.310
 really the tiguan at qashqai 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.830
 he would come rather bothered a nissan 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.330
 x-trail himself half way 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.330
 between them and followed is true 4 4 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.560
 he
