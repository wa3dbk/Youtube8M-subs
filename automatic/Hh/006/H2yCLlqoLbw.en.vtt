00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
not you're only going if you left it at

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.880 
not you're only going if you left it at
that<00:05:23.450> you<00:05:24.450> would<00:05:24.630> have<00:05:24.840> so<00:05:25.169> much<00:05:25.200> makeup

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
that you would have so much makeup

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.070 
that you would have so much makeup
running<00:05:26.130> down<00:05:26.310> there<00:05:26.760> because<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.479> remover

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
running down there because the remover

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.860 
running down there because the remover
would<00:05:28.260> start<00:05:28.560> to<00:05:28.650> seep<00:05:28.919> into<00:05:29.310> your<00:05:30.030> other<00:05:30.390> area

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
would start to seep into your other area

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
so it's like this is a good product but

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.080 
so it's like this is a good product but
they<00:05:34.229> almost<00:05:34.410> need<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.890> forewarn<00:05:35.430> people<00:05:35.910> to

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
they almost need to forewarn people to

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.029 
they almost need to forewarn people to
use<00:05:36.270> q-tips<00:05:36.630> because<00:05:37.139> if<00:05:37.260> you<00:05:37.380> use<00:05:37.590> it<00:05:37.770> alone

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.480 
use q-tips because if you use it alone
and<00:05:38.310> just<00:05:38.340> let<00:05:38.639> it<00:05:38.669> stay<00:05:39.060> there<00:05:39.590> you<00:05:40.590> know<00:05:40.770> the

weird<00:06:22.849> smudgy<00:06:23.569> line<00:06:23.839> down<00:06:24.169> there<00:06:24.409> so<00:06:24.949> that's

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:25.189 
weird smudgy line down there so that's

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:28.149 
weird smudgy line down there so that's
just<00:06:25.369> one<00:06:25.669> of<00:06:25.699> two<00:06:25.999> ways<00:06:26.439> could<00:06:27.439> you<00:06:27.619> just<00:06:27.679> use

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.159 
just one of two ways could you just use

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:30.790 
just one of two ways could you just use
the<00:06:28.339> puff<00:06:28.610> yes<00:06:29.269> but<00:06:29.899> it<00:06:30.110> can<00:06:30.289> sometimes<00:06:30.529> be

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
the puff yes but it can sometimes be

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.469 
the puff yes but it can sometimes be
hard<00:06:30.830> to<00:06:31.159> get<00:06:31.309> in<00:06:31.459> those<00:06:31.639> small<00:06:31.969> little<00:06:32.089> places

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
hard to get in those small little places

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.169 
hard to get in those small little places
so<00:06:33.409> that's<00:06:33.589> why<00:06:33.800> I<00:06:33.830> reserved<00:06:34.399> a<00:06:34.669> concealer

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:35.179 
so that's why I reserved a concealer

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:38.409 
so that's why I reserved a concealer
brush<00:06:35.449> for<00:06:35.779> small<00:06:36.139> areas<00:06:36.349> like<00:06:36.830> that<00:06:37.129> so<00:06:37.490> um

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
brush for small areas like that so um

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:39.850 
brush for small areas like that so um
you<00:06:38.779> know<00:06:38.899> this<00:06:39.110> is<00:06:39.289> just<00:06:39.469> one<00:06:39.649> of<00:06:39.679> those

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
you know this is just one of those

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.399 
you know this is just one of those
things<00:06:39.919> that<00:06:40.399> a<00:06:41.059> lot<00:06:41.089> of<00:06:41.360> people<00:06:41.479> ask<00:06:41.929> how<00:06:42.379> can

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
I've had a video out there for long

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.589 
I've had a video out there for long
lasting<00:06:51.259> lower<00:06:51.740> liner<00:06:52.129> and<00:06:52.430> I<00:06:52.969> stand<00:06:53.360> by<00:06:53.569> that

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 
lasting lower liner and I stand by that

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.509 
lasting lower liner and I stand by that
I<00:06:53.839> mean<00:06:53.990> I<00:06:54.110> really<00:06:54.289> believe<00:06:54.800> that<00:06:54.829> that<00:06:55.189> works

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:55.519 
I mean I really believe that that works

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:57.100

long day or you've been squinting or
looking<00:07:00.409> down<00:07:00.709> a<00:07:00.740> lot<00:07:01.159> or<00:07:01.490> you<00:07:01.939> know<00:07:02.029> any

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:02.269 
looking down a lot or you know any

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:05.199 
looking down a lot or you know any
number<00:07:02.659> of<00:07:02.689> things<00:07:02.779> can<00:07:03.169> provoke<00:07:03.879> your<00:07:04.879> liner

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:05.209 
number of things can provoke your liner

to<00:07:05.539> get<00:07:05.719> a<00:07:05.749> little<00:07:05.899> bit<00:07:06.169> smudge<00:07:06.499> they're<00:07:06.829> not

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:07.279
