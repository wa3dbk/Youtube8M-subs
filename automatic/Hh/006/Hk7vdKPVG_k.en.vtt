this this makes a video of actually make

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.850 
this this makes a video of actually make
much<00:02:25.780> more<00:02:25.870> sense<00:02:25.959> so<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:29.440> rate<00:02:29.650> at<00:02:29.830> which

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
much more sense so the the rate at which

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.740 
much more sense so the the rate at which
I<00:02:30.160> was<00:02:30.370> acquiring<00:02:30.910> them<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.120> farmed<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:31.600> for

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
I was acquiring them I farmed this for

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.090 
I was acquiring them I farmed this for
about<00:02:31.840> 30<00:02:32.110> minutes<00:02:32.380> straight<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:32.950> was

minutes you take the ten and then you

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.430 
minutes you take the ten and then you
convert<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.570> over<00:02:37.600> into<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.020> one<00:02:38.140> bracelet

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
give you an idea of what his eye level

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.040 
give you an idea of what his eye level
is<00:02:55.900> here<00:02:58.980> what<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.130> heck<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.900> moved<00:03:01.900> all<00:03:01.989> my

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
is here what the heck I moved all my

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.570 
is here what the heck I moved all my
stuff<00:03:02.170> over<00:03:02.620> debt<00:03:02.920> here<00:03:03.250> we<00:03:03.310> go

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
stuff over debt here we go

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.080 
stuff over debt here we go
uh<00:03:03.870> 373<00:03:04.870> 374<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.100> where<00:03:06.700> Darnell's

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
uh 373 374 so that is where Darnell's

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.520 
uh 373 374 so that is where Darnell's
sitting<00:03:07.420> as<00:03:07.540> far<00:03:07.720> as<00:03:07.870> his<00:03:08.080> eye<00:03:08.200> level<00:03:08.380> is

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
sitting as far as his eye level is

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.680 
sitting as far as his eye level is
concerned<00:03:08.880> for<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:09.940> most<00:03:10.090> part<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.420> just

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
concerned for the most part I just

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.060 
concerned for the most part I just
formed<00:03:10.930> these<00:03:11.050> hulking<00:03:11.290> abominations<00:03:11.800> this

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
formed these hulking abominations this

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.210 
formed these hulking abominations this
is<00:03:12.250> really<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:12.970> fastest<00:03:13.269> way<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.390> do<00:03:13.540> this

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
is really the fastest way to do this

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.620 
is really the fastest way to do this
they<00:03:15.220> have<00:03:15.370> really<00:03:15.850> really<00:03:15.880> high<00:03:16.090> drop<00:03:16.390> rate

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
they have really really high drop rate

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.840 
they have really really high drop rate
and<00:03:18.120> notice<00:03:19.120> if<00:03:20.049> you<00:03:20.200> guys<00:03:20.290> saw<00:03:20.620> me<00:03:20.860> doing<00:03:21.640> my

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
and notice if you guys saw me doing my

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.630

these things up because even though it's

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.860 
these things up because even though it's
like<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.640> know<00:03:36.730> what<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.269> hundred<00:03:37.660> yards<00:03:37.840> away

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
like you know what a hundred yards away

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.500 
like you know what a hundred yards away
it's<00:03:38.620> still<00:03:38.829> fastest<00:03:39.220> over<00:03:39.579> there<00:03:39.760> kill<00:03:40.390> it

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
it's still fastest over there kill it

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.660 
it's still fastest over there kill it
real<00:03:40.690> quick<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.260> then<00:03:41.650> mount<00:03:42.070> up<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.310> do<00:03:42.579> the

to see if that's like the stack max but

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.319 
to see if that's like the stack max but
it<00:03:54.220> doesn't<00:03:54.430> actually<00:03:54.489> say<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:55.090> unit

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
area farming stuff up and like I've

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.610 
area farming stuff up and like I've
already<00:05:43.880> tried<00:05:44.060> it<00:05:44.120> and<00:05:44.509> I've<00:05:44.990> timed<00:05:45.199> it<00:05:45.440> and

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
already tried it and I've timed it and

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.589 
already tried it and I've timed it and
you<00:05:46.130> just<00:05:46.460> don't<00:05:46.669> get<00:05:46.909> the<00:05:46.969> drops<00:05:47.360> that<00:05:47.509> you

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
you just don't get the drops that you

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.060 
you just don't get the drops that you
would<00:05:47.840> just<00:05:48.050> running<00:05:48.380> around<00:05:48.500> and<00:05:48.770> farming

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
would just running around and farming

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.469 
would just running around and farming
things<00:05:49.250> out<00:05:49.370> here<00:05:49.610> in<00:05:49.669> the<00:05:49.729> open<00:05:49.849> field<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.389> I

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
things out here in the open field and I

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:51.550 
things out here in the open field and I
think<00:05:50.509> a<00:05:50.690> lot<00:05:50.810> of<00:05:50.840> people<00:05:51.110> are<00:05:51.199> just<00:05:51.380> thinking

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
think a lot of people are just thinking

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.830 
think a lot of people are just thinking
that<00:05:51.800> Oh<00:05:51.979> more<00:05:52.550> equals<00:05:52.969> more<00:05:53.210> right<00:05:53.659> and

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
that Oh more equals more right and

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.640 
that Oh more equals more right and
that's<00:05:53.990> just<00:05:54.199> not<00:05:54.319> the<00:05:54.440> case

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
that's just not the case

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.219 
that's just not the case
so<00:05:55.460> that's<00:05:56.120> it<00:05:56.300> guys<00:05:56.449> hopefully<00:05:56.810> this<00:05:56.930> helps

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
so that's it guys hopefully this helps

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.959
