test<00:00:11.690> comparison<00:00:12.260> I<00:00:12.559> know<00:00:12.620> apps<00:00:13.490> aren't

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
test comparison I know apps aren't

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.670 
test comparison I know apps aren't
exactly<00:00:14.300> the<00:00:14.420> same<00:00:14.720> on<00:00:14.900> Android<00:00:15.260> as<00:00:15.410> they<00:00:15.559> are

exactly the same on Android as they are
on<00:00:15.769> iOS<00:00:16.189> but<00:00:16.460> it<00:00:16.610> is<00:00:16.760> important<00:00:17.470> consideration

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
no I'll just get rid of these apps now

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.630 
no I'll just get rid of these apps now
you<00:00:41.840> can<00:00:41.990> see<00:00:42.140> there<00:00:42.320> are<00:00:42.440> no<00:00:42.620> recent<00:00:43.190> apps<00:00:43.400> on

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
you can see there are no recent apps on

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.080 
you can see there are no recent apps on
there<00:00:43.820> running<00:00:44.560> I'd<00:00:45.560> double<00:00:45.860> tap<00:00:46.070> on<00:00:46.220> here<00:00:46.610> you

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
there running I'd double tap on here you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.910 
there running I'd double tap on here you
see<00:00:47.270> settings<00:00:47.780> is<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:47.990> only<00:00:48.350> one<00:00:48.500> running<00:00:48.650> on

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
see settings is the only one running on

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.690 
see settings is the only one running on
there<00:00:50.050> now<00:00:51.050> we'll<00:00:51.230> just<00:00:51.410> try<00:00:51.890> some<00:00:52.100> comparable

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
there now we'll just try some comparable

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.760 
there now we'll just try some comparable
apps<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.030> start<00:00:53.330> with<00:00:53.540> if<00:00:53.870> we<00:00:54.110> want<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.380> load<00:00:54.590> up

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
apps to start with if we want to load up

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.370 
apps to start with if we want to load up
messaging<00:00:55.310> for<00:00:56.180> instance<00:00:56.660> we<00:00:56.930> could<00:00:57.050> just<00:00:57.200> hit

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
messaging for instance we could just hit

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.990 
messaging for instance we could just hit
the<00:00:57.530> messages<00:00:58.010> on<00:00:58.130> both<00:00:58.310> I'll<00:00:58.550> try<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:58.850> do<00:00:58.910> it

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
the messages on both I'll try and do it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.780 
the messages on both I'll try and do it
at<00:00:59.090> the<00:00:59.180> same<00:00:59.360> time<00:01:02.410> you<00:01:03.410> see<00:01:03.739> I'll<00:01:04.519> let<00:01:04.699> you

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
at the same time you see I'll let you

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
at the same time you see I'll let you
judge<00:01:05.000> for<00:01:05.180> yourself<00:01:07.180> go<00:01:08.180> home

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
judge for yourself go home

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.469 
judge for yourself go home
and<00:01:09.619> if<00:01:09.799> we<00:01:10.009> go<00:01:10.249> to<00:01:10.749> something<00:01:11.749> like<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:13.479> see

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
and if we go to something like I see

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:27.350 
and if we go to something like I see
where<00:01:14.659> it's<00:01:14.899> a<00:01:14.960> Facebook<00:01:15.469> at<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.649> same<00:01:15.920> time

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.030 

that's<00:01:28.050> obviously<00:01:28.380> loading<00:01:28.860> because<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.130> data

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
that's obviously loading because of data

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.020 
that's obviously loading because of data
so<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.070> mean<00:01:32.250> they're<00:01:32.430> pretty<00:01:32.550> comparable

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
so I mean they're pretty comparable

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.570 
so I mean they're pretty comparable
speed<00:01:33.540> wise<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.170> wouldn't<00:01:34.860> say<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.340> was

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
speed wise I wouldn't say one was

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.370 
speed wise I wouldn't say one was
amazingly<00:01:36.270> faster<00:01:36.690> than<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> other

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
amazingly faster than the other

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
amazingly faster than the other
obviously<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.160> Android<00:01:38.490> handset<00:01:38.670> has<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
obviously the Android handset has got a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.940 
obviously the Android handset has got a
more<00:01:39.420> powerful<00:01:39.840> processor<00:01:40.050> but<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.560> needs<00:01:40.770> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
more powerful processor but it needs it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:59.600 
more powerful processor but it needs it
to<00:01:41.070> run<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> software<00:01:41.870> let's<00:01:42.870> go<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.110> Twitter

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.340 

see<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.360> Android<00:02:00.630> handset<00:02:00.810> seems<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
see that Android handset seems a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.230 
see that Android handset seems a
slightly<00:02:01.770> quicker<00:02:02.310> unless<00:02:02.550> I'm<00:02:02.760> tapping<00:02:03.030> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
slightly quicker unless I'm tapping it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.420 
slightly quicker unless I'm tapping it
slightly<00:02:03.480> first<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:04.110> don't<00:02:04.170> know<00:02:04.470> I'm<00:02:05.130> trying

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
slightly first I don't know I'm trying

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.700 
slightly first I don't know I'm trying
to<00:02:05.520> do<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.760> exactly<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.480> same<00:02:06.690> time<00:02:06.960> we<00:02:07.440> had<00:02:07.590> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
to do it exactly the same time we had to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.050 
to do it exactly the same time we had to
google<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.490> would<00:02:08.580> be<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:08.820> one<00:02:09.000> to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
google it that would be a good one to

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:19.260 
google it that would be a good one to
see

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.990 

yeah<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.230> looks<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:21.010> Nexus<00:02:21.460> is<00:02:21.610> loaded

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
yeah it looks like the Nexus is loaded

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.840 
yeah it looks like the Nexus is loaded
up<00:02:22.120> first

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.800 

yeah

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.520 

so<00:02:35.810> there<00:02:35.989> we<00:02:36.080> go

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
so there we go

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.530 
so there we go
there<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:36.799> have<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.190> mean<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.519> neither<00:02:38.299> of

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
there you have it I mean the neither of

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.570 
there you have it I mean the neither of
them<00:02:38.659> is<00:02:38.750> much<00:02:39.019> faster<00:02:39.260> than<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.650> other<00:02:39.799> you

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
them is much faster than the other you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.949 
them is much faster than the other you
can<00:02:40.730> choose<00:02:40.940> for<00:02:41.090> yourself<00:02:41.450> which<00:02:41.629> one<00:02:41.780> you

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
can choose for yourself which one you

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.809 
can choose for yourself which one you
think<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.799> going<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.580> be<00:02:43.670> bad<00:02:43.879> for<00:02:43.909> you<00:02:45.819> but

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
think is going to be bad for you but

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.940 
think is going to be bad for you but
there's<00:02:47.030> nothing<00:02:47.239> between<00:02:47.810> them<00:02:48.290> in<00:02:48.440> senses

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
there's nothing between them in senses
