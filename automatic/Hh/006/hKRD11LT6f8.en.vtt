00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:08.290
 Gundam is what you have to post a Gundam production videos 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.860
 This time is the last part of a master grade 100s version 2.0 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.050
 Will be 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.050
 I would like to manufacture weapons parts 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.660
 Here are 100s weapon parts 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:27.030
 Well, the beam rifle and Kraibazuka 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:31.770
 Then I cut out 3 kinds of weapons called beam saber 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:36.060
 In here because we want to do from the usual inking as 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:40.940
 I think that I want to do it by using the training by looking at Kamiya and 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:43.210
 One hundred formulas of production also finally be but went into the last category 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.420
 The heat of this gold is 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.960
 It It was very interesting 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.740
 It is inking is doing this now the most interesting was the is 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.110
 This Gold Girl 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:59.329
 Nice black and white 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:03.090
 I think I'm a pretty cool it is and Nord paint in the course 3 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.990
 So it's a hundred style exterior 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.840
 Finishing only with 3 was once but still 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.310
 It was quite fun to produce 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.080
 As violet is completed, I think that I want to spray é®­ on this part 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.659
 I will 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:26.870
 This parts matte spray wrote underneath to after the same 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:31.510
 I finished the coloring with the method Zaringmaster and also put the decals 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.510
 I think that I want to assemble the future in that 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.870
 3 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.180
 voodoo 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.430
 Had 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.430
 wh 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.430
 2 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.080
 of 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.080
 Hmm 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.620
 Udon 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.620
 Hmm 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.360
 r 5 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.470
 me 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.590
 Hmm 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.590
 I am 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.939
 par 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.630
 Beam rifle from it 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:50.500
 Kraibazuka and 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.500
 It is beam saber Japan and all assembly is completed 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.420
 None It is pretty cool 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.720
 Yup 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.040
 Though it is this beam saber 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.670
 The part of the handle is the same as the exterior gold and yellow 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:23.090
 I hope very parentheses charvel part and the match to 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:30.370
 Then Bazooka and the beam rifle are also my personal impression though 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:37.690
 It sounds good or because I have there is atmosphere, such as going to a whopping through sea otter of the day 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:38.650
 This is the next time because all of the parts of the 100s in this time with more than has completed assembly 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.590
 Funeral 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.590
 It will be 100s completed 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.580
