00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
we formed up a bulkhead to hold the bank

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.389 
we formed up a bulkhead to hold the bank
and<00:00:47.140> filled<00:00:47.559> it<00:00:47.739> with<00:00:47.769> concrete<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:51.100> laid<00:00:51.370> a

filled<00:00:54.640> it<00:00:54.850> with<00:00:54.879> concrete<00:00:58.409> we<00:00:59.409> then<00:00:59.619> set<00:00:59.920> the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
filled it with concrete we then set the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.899 
filled it with concrete we then set the
stones<00:01:00.399> in<00:01:00.699> mortar

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909

I<00:01:18.399> had<00:01:18.610> to<00:01:18.729> dig<00:01:18.909> a<00:01:18.940> trench<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.750> tank<00:01:20.020> and

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
I had to dig a trench to the tank and

I had to dig a trench to the tank and
under<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.830> bulkhead<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:23.409> use<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.770> dirt<00:01:23.979> taken

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
under the bulkhead we use the dirt taken

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.219 
under the bulkhead we use the dirt taken
from<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.640> hole<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:25.060> create<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.479> level<00:01:25.810> path

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
from the hole to create a level path

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.560 
from the hole to create a level path
around<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.799> septic<00:01:27.280> tank

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.630 

the<00:01:33.570> tank<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.960> bought<00:01:34.170> was<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> plastic<00:01:35.040> 1200

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.270 
the tank we bought was a plastic 1200
gallon<00:01:36.030> unit<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.320> more<00:01:37.590> expensive<00:01:37.770> than<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
gallon unit it was more expensive than a

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.850 
gallon unit it was more expensive than a
concrete<00:01:38.880> model<00:01:39.330> that<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> holds<00:01:40.229> more<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
concrete model that it holds more and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.240 
concrete model that it holds more and
will<00:01:41.100> last<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.580> centuries<00:01:41.790> underground<00:01:43.250> we

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
will last for centuries underground we

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.399 
will last for centuries underground we
then<00:01:44.430> installed<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> 3-inch<00:01:45.420> perforated<00:01:46.110> pipe

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
then installed a 3-inch perforated pipe

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.350 
then installed a 3-inch perforated pipe
ring<00:01:46.770> around<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> bottom<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> hole<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
covered it with a full foot of gravel

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.100 
covered it with a full foot of gravel
and<00:01:50.670> piped<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.600> out<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.960> trench<00:01:53.780> we<00:01:54.780> also

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
and piped it out the trench we also

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.109 
and piped it out the trench we also
piped<00:01:55.380> around<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.860> tank<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.310> expel<00:01:56.729> our<00:01:56.909> gray

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
piped around the tank to expel our gray

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.250 
piped around the tank to expel our gray
water<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> watershed

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.320 

he<00:02:02.260> returned<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.280> set<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.640> tank<00:02:03.909> down<00:02:04.090> in<00:02:04.240> the

hole<00:02:04.540> for<00:02:04.780> us<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:11.020> added<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.440> breather<00:02:11.709> pipe<00:02:12.040> to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
hole for us we added a breather pipe to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.470 
hole for us we added a breather pipe to
the<00:02:12.459> rear<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.820> tank<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.270> will

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
the rear of the tank that will

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.330 
the rear of the tank that will
eventually<00:02:13.780> vent<00:02:14.290> out<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.620> roof<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.190> new
