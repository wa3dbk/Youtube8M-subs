okay this is kind of a part two of
working<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.689> rebuilding<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:05.069> motor<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.730> a

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
working on rebuilding a motor this is a

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.709 
working on rebuilding a motor this is a
blade<00:00:07.319> motor<00:00:07.649> from<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.519> general<00:00:09.210> electric

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
blade motor from a general electric

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.990 
blade motor from a general electric
electric<00:00:10.559> mower<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.969> off<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.450> e<00:00:12.480> 15<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:14.000> so

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
electric mower is off the e 15 and so

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.390 
electric mower is off the e 15 and so
far<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.269> took<00:00:15.389> off<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.960> took<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.619> motor<00:00:16.830> off<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
far I took off I took the motor off the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.189 
far I took off I took the motor off the
deck<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.820> took<00:00:17.940> off<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.480> cap<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> cow

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
deck I took off the cap and the cow

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.890 
deck I took off the cap and the cow
mutator<00:00:19.760> the<00:00:20.760> bearing<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.359> end<00:00:21.600> looked

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
mutator the bearing on this end looked

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.200 
mutator the bearing on this end looked
good<00:00:22.230> but<00:00:22.949> i<00:00:23.010> think<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> trouble<00:00:23.760> was<00:00:23.880> up<00:00:24.060> in

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
good but i think the trouble was up in

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.120 
good but i think the trouble was up in
this<00:00:24.359> end<00:00:24.600> however<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.260> little<00:00:25.529> hub<00:00:25.710> holds

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
this end however this little hub holds

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
this end however this little hub holds
the<00:00:26.310> blade<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.449> couldn't<00:00:27.510> get<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.050> off

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the blade on and I couldn't get that off

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.109 
the blade on and I couldn't get that off
so<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> talked<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> couple<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.550> guys<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.029> they

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
so I talked to a couple of guys and they

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.020 
so I talked to a couple of guys and they
said<00:00:30.449> use<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> bearing<00:00:31.529> separator<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.820> got

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
said use a bearing separator so I got

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.880 
said use a bearing separator so I got
this<00:00:33.210> little<00:00:33.390> doohickey<00:00:33.690> rented<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.710> from

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
this little doohickey rented this from

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.819 
this little doohickey rented this from
the<00:00:34.980> hardware<00:00:35.190> store<00:00:35.340> put<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.829> around

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the hardware store put this on around

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.030 
the hardware store put this on around
under<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.910> hub<00:00:39.270> there<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.840> then<00:00:40.559> used<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
under that hub there and then used a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.510 
under that hub there and then used a
puller<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.410> top<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.980> push<00:00:44.219> down<00:00:44.489> on

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
puller to go on the top to push down on

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.500 
puller to go on the top to push down on
a<00:00:44.760> 5<00:00:45.090> 16<00:00:45.629> s<00:00:45.719> bolt<00:00:45.960> right<00:00:46.200> down<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> middle<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
a 5 16 s bolt right down the middle to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.090 
a 5 16 s bolt right down the middle to
pull<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.690> hub<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.410> lo<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.649> behold<00:00:49.770> it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
pull this hub up and lo and behold it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100 
pull this hub up and lo and behold it
actually<00:00:50.460> worked<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.879> i<00:00:50.910> guess<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> PB<00:00:51.690> Blaster

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
actually worked so i guess a PB Blaster

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.479 
actually worked so i guess a PB Blaster
at<00:00:52.260> every<00:00:52.469> day<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.800> last<00:00:52.860> week<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
at every day for the last week was a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.130 
at every day for the last week was a
good<00:00:53.910> thing<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:55.770> now<00:00:56.070> I've<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.690> bit<00:00:57.960> off

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
good thing so now I've got that bit off

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.700 
good thing so now I've got that bit off
and<00:00:59.149> I<00:01:00.149> should<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.570> able<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.020> start<00:01:01.410> pulling

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and I should be able to start pulling

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.820 
and I should be able to start pulling
this<00:01:01.829> thing<00:01:01.890> apart<00:01:04.220> ok<00:01:05.220> there's<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> armature

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
this thing apart ok there's the armature

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.190 
this thing apart ok there's the armature
once<00:01:07.830> i<00:01:07.979> got<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.280> hub<00:01:08.760> off<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.360> end<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:10.049> i

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
once i got that hub off the end here i

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.160 
once i got that hub off the end here i
was<00:01:10.770> able<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.310> very<00:01:11.700> gently<00:01:11.930> tap<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
was able to just very gently tap the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.370 
was able to just very gently tap the
shaft<00:01:13.439> down<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.600> whole<00:01:15.780> thing<00:01:16.110> kind

shaft down with the the whole thing kind

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.469 
shaft down with the the whole thing kind
of<00:01:16.590> held<00:01:17.340> over<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> edge<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> workbench

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
of held over the edge of the workbench

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.170 
of held over the edge of the workbench
here<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.080> then<00:01:19.920> i<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.580> able<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> get<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
here and then i was able to get the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.749 
here and then i was able to get the
armature<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.140> sure<00:01:22.380> enough<00:01:22.759> commutator

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
armature out and sure enough commutator

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.149 
armature out and sure enough commutator
doesn't<00:01:24.119> look<00:01:24.240> bad<00:01:24.530> bearing<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.860> fine

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
doesn't look bad bearing here is fine

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.380 
doesn't look bad bearing here is fine
but<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> bottom<00:01:27.000> end<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:30.030> bearing

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
but down on the bottom end that bearing

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.420 
but down on the bottom end that bearing
is<00:01:30.509> pretty<00:01:30.780> much<00:01:30.869> seized<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.500> its<00:01:31.770> little

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
is pretty much seized up its little

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.080 
is pretty much seized up its little
rusty<00:01:33.060> cover<00:01:34.100> rusted<00:01:35.100> right<00:01:35.340> off<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.970> i'm

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
rusty cover rusted right off so i'm

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.690 
rusty cover rusted right off so i'm
going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.479> pull<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.049> bearing<00:01:37.409> off

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
going to have to pull this bearing off

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.510 
going to have to pull this bearing off
replace<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.939> clean<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.509> shaft<00:01:40.340> clean<00:01:41.340> this

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
replace it clean up the shaft clean this

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.950 
replace it clean up the shaft clean this
all<00:01:41.729> up<00:01:41.759> maybe<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:44.149> polish<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> commutator

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
all up maybe a polish up the commutator

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.039 
all up maybe a polish up the commutator
but<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:47.939> that's<00:01:48.180> obviously

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
but that right there that's obviously

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.609 
but that right there that's obviously
the<00:01:49.170> reason<00:01:49.439> why<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:51.509> was<00:01:51.750> not<00:01:51.930> spinning

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the reason why this was not spinning

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.760 
the reason why this was not spinning
freely<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.909> next<00:01:54.180> step<00:01:54.360> replace<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.380> bearing

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
freely so next step replace that bearing

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.020 
freely so next step replace that bearing
I<00:01:55.860> don't<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.219> bearing<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.700> front<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.969> me

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
I don't have that bearing in front of me

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.459 
I don't have that bearing in front of me
so<00:01:57.210> you'll<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> wait<00:01:57.930> till<00:01:57.960> next<00:01:58.229> time

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
so you'll have to wait till next time

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.740 
so you'll have to wait till next time
and<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.369> bet<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.729> little<00:01:59.969> piece<00:02:00.149> here<00:02:00.180> came

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and I bet this little piece here came

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.440
