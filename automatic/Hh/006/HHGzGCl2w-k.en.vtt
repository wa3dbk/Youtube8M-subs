00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.890 
sensor calibration I'm going to stop the
video<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.400> this<00:01:59.550> point<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.270> pick<00:02:00.510> up<00:02:00.660> when

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
video at this point and we pick up when

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.390 
video at this point and we pick up when
our<00:02:01.380> test<00:02:01.620> is<00:02:01.770> passed<00:02:03.650> okay<00:02:04.650> so<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.160> see

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
our test is passed okay so you can see

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.920 
our test is passed okay so you can see
that<00:02:05.550> our<00:02:05.640> leak<00:02:05.820> test<00:02:06.150> has<00:02:06.360> passed<00:02:06.390> our

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
that our leak test has passed our

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.139 
that our leak test has passed our
circuit<00:02:07.320> compliance<00:02:07.800> test<00:02:08.039> has<00:02:08.220> passed<00:02:08.250> but

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
circuit compliance test has passed but

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.540 
circuit compliance test has passed but
we've<00:02:09.330> got<00:02:09.539> an<00:02:09.660> o2<00:02:09.840> sensor<00:02:10.349> calibration

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
we've got an o2 sensor calibration

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.130 
we've got an o2 sensor calibration
failure<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.240> reason<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.660> have<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.020> you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
failure the reason we have that is you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.540 
failure the reason we have that is you
guys<00:02:13.320> have<00:02:13.380> probably<00:02:13.650> seen<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:14.100> our<00:02:14.190> lab<00:02:14.370> which

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
guys have probably seen in our lab which

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.260 
guys have probably seen in our lab which
is<00:02:14.700> why<00:02:14.910> it

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
is why it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.340 
is why it
50<00:02:15.810> psi<00:02:16.320> air<00:02:16.740> source<00:02:17.960> make<00:02:18.960> sure<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
50 psi air source make sure in the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.930 
50 psi air source make sure in the
clinical<00:02:19.740> obviously<00:02:20.190> that's<00:02:20.370> hooked<00:02:20.640> up<00:02:20.820> to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
clinical obviously that's hooked up to

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.800 
clinical obviously that's hooked up to
50<00:02:21.240> psi<00:02:21.450> D<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.260> so2<00:02:22.890> okay<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.300> for<00:02:24.570> our<00:02:24.600> purposes

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
50 psi D is so2 okay so for our purposes

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.800 
50 psi D is so2 okay so for our purposes
we're<00:02:25.230> gonna<00:02:25.320> go<00:02:25.530> ahead<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.740> continue<00:02:25.950> here

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
we're gonna go ahead and continue here

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.370 
we're gonna go ahead and continue here
so<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.990> couple<00:02:28.680> other<00:02:28.860> things<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.520> vo<00:02:30.380> we

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
so a couple other things in the vo we

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.690 
so a couple other things in the vo we
want<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> set<00:02:31.830> up<00:02:31.950> our<00:02:34.190> patient<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.520> we're

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
want to set up our patient so we're

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.340 
want to set up our patient so we're
gonna<00:02:35.790> pick<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> patient<00:02:36.780> weight<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.200> can

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
gonna pick a patient weight and we can

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.530 
gonna pick a patient weight and we can
dial<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.740> our<00:02:37.860> patient<00:02:38.250> weight<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.700> our<00:02:38.910> ideal

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
dial in our patient weight to our ideal

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.770 
dial in our patient weight to our ideal
body<00:02:39.720> weight<00:02:39.870> are<00:02:40.050> predicted<00:02:40.440> body<00:02:40.590> weight<00:02:41.780> we

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
body weight are predicted body weight we

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.950 
body weight are predicted body weight we
can<00:02:43.050> input<00:02:43.380> what<00:02:43.980> size<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.550> ET<00:02:45.540> tube<00:02:45.750> we<00:02:45.930> have

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
can input what size of ET tube we have

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.800 
can input what size of ET tube we have
so<00:02:46.590> let's<00:02:46.710> say<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.010> an<00:02:47.100> 8<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.670> what<00:02:48.570> length

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
so let's say it's an 8 and what length

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.450 
so let's say it's an 8 and what length
it<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.320> if<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.500> let's<00:02:49.860> say<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.040> cut<00:02:50.310> your

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
it is so if you let's say you cut your

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.760 
it is so if you let's say you cut your
tube<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.780> decrease<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.230> little<00:02:52.410> bit<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.710> the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
tube to decrease a little bit of the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.570 
tube to decrease a little bit of the
dead<00:02:52.920> space<00:02:53.220> let's<00:02:54.180> say<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.390> cut<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.720> at<00:02:54.810> 26

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.710 

then<00:02:59.580> your<00:02:59.730> machine<00:02:59.820> can<00:03:00.150> get<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.360> little<00:03:00.570> bit

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
then your machine can get a little bit

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.290 
then your machine can get a little bit
more<00:03:00.960> intimate<00:03:01.800> with<00:03:02.010> your<00:03:02.310> ventilation

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
more intimate with your ventilation

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.420 
more intimate with your ventilation
strategy<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.320> we'll<00:03:04.440> go<00:03:04.530> ahead<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.740> say<00:03:05.040> set

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
strategy so we'll go ahead and say set

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.240 
strategy so we'll go ahead and say set
up<00:03:05.550> accept<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.530> if<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.620> want<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.890> select<00:03:08.040> your

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.130 
up accept and if you want to select your
modes<00:03:08.520> you<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:08.820> touch<00:03:09.030> in<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.270> top<00:03:09.510> left<00:03:09.870> here

can see down at the bottom all the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.090 
can see down at the bottom all the
parameters<00:03:30.480> actually<00:03:30.870> come<00:03:31.110> up<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.740> can<00:03:31.980> go

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
parameters actually come up so I can go

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.430 
parameters actually come up so I can go
ahead<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.550> set<00:03:33.240> my<00:03:33.420> parameters<00:03:33.660> let's<00:03:34.230> say<00:03:34.380> I

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
ahead and set my parameters let's say I

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.260 
ahead and set my parameters let's say I
wanted<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.860> set<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.070> respiratory<00:03:35.430> rate<00:03:35.610> of<00:03:35.850> 15<00:03:36.240> I

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
wanted to set a respiratory rate of 15 I

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.540 
wanted to set a respiratory rate of 15 I
would<00:03:36.540> touch<00:03:36.750> 15<00:03:37.320> it's<00:03:38.010> got<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> high<00:03:38.310> light

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
would touch 15 it's got a high light

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.690 
would touch 15 it's got a high light
blue<00:03:38.790> turn<00:03:39.630> my<00:03:39.840> rotary<00:03:40.230> wheel<00:03:40.580> until<00:03:41.580> I

blue turn my rotary wheel until I

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.430 
blue turn my rotary wheel until I
actually<00:03:41.910> get<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.450> desired<00:03:42.750> setting<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.260> want

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
actually get the desired setting I want

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
wanting your alarm scenarios to be once

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.620 
wanting your alarm scenarios to be once
you're<00:04:05.340> happy<00:04:05.490> with<00:04:05.730> all<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.240> you<00:04:06.330> can<00:04:06.480> go

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
you're happy with all that you can go

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.930 
you're happy with all that you can go
ahead<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:06.959> hit<00:04:07.110> mode<00:04:07.380> accept<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.670> you'll

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
ahead and hit mode accept and you'll

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.229 
ahead and hit mode accept and you'll
start<00:04:09.270> ventilating<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:11.640> this<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.880> what<00:04:12.030> the

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
start ventilating so this is what the

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.150 
start ventilating so this is what the
via<00:04:12.510> graphics<00:04:13.170> package<00:04:13.560> looks<00:04:13.800> like<00:04:13.980> when

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
via graphics package looks like when

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.550 
via graphics package looks like when
you're<00:04:14.280> in<00:04:14.430> ventilating<00:04:15.239> on<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.260> side

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
you're in ventilating on the side

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.050 
you're in ventilating on the side
there's<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.919> hard<00:04:17.220> key<00:04:17.459> here<00:04:17.700> if<00:04:17.790> you<00:04:17.880> hit

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
there's a hard key here if you hit

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.780 
there's a hard key here if you hit
screens<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:19.230> little<00:04:19.890> tab<00:04:20.100> will<00:04:20.310> come<00:04:20.489> up<00:04:20.640> and

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
screens a little tab will come up and

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.540 
screens a little tab will come up and
you<00:04:20.880> can<00:04:21.030> actually<00:04:21.180> choose<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.550> manipulate

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
you can actually choose to manipulate

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.610 
you can actually choose to manipulate
this<00:04:23.700> as<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.090> will<00:04:24.270> so

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
this as you will so

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.189 
this as you will so
going<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:24.949> monitors<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:26.240> can<00:04:26.270> see<00:04:26.870> all<00:04:27.080> the

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
going to monitors you can see all the

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.530 
going to monitors you can see all the
parameters<00:04:27.380> there<00:04:28.040> but<00:04:28.310> again<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:29.090> lose<00:04:29.300> the

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
parameters there but again you lose the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.320 
parameters there but again you lose the
scalars<00:04:30.110> on<00:04:30.320> this<00:04:30.500> instance<00:04:31.010> so<00:04:31.340> if<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.240> go

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
scalars on this instance so if you go

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.120 
scalars on this instance so if you go
back<00:04:32.479> in<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.780> screen<00:04:33.139> let's<00:04:33.500> say<00:04:33.680> you<00:04:33.740> want<00:04:34.040> to

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
back in the screen let's say you want to

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.920 
back in the screen let's say you want to
just<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.370> go<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.520> main<00:04:34.820> but<00:04:35.510> you<00:04:35.600> wanted<00:04:35.810> to

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
just to go to main but you wanted to

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.439 
just to go to main but you wanted to
change<00:04:36.169> one<00:04:36.470> of<00:04:36.500> your<00:04:36.620> read<00:04:37.610> parameters<00:04:38.300> so

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
change one of your read parameters so

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:39.610 
change one of your read parameters so
let's<00:04:38.600> say<00:04:38.720> I<00:04:38.750> didn't<00:04:38.960> really<00:04:39.169> need<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.410> look

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
let's say I didn't really need to look

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.770 
let's say I didn't really need to look
at<00:04:39.740> my<00:04:39.889> plateau<00:04:40.310> pressure<00:04:40.550> you<00:04:41.300> can<00:04:41.449> touch

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
at my plateau pressure you can touch

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.010 
at my plateau pressure you can touch
that<00:04:42.050> simply<00:04:42.470> by<00:04:42.620> just<00:04:42.650> pressing<00:04:43.040> on<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.400> and

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
that simply by just pressing on it and

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.420 
that simply by just pressing on it and
picking<00:04:45.020> whatever<00:04:45.320> you<00:04:45.530> want<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:45.979> say<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.220> want

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
picking whatever you want so say I want

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
these things this is how you would get

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.080 
these things this is how you would get
into<00:05:04.910> it<00:05:05.030> on<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.300> idea<00:05:06.520> other<00:05:07.520> things<00:05:07.910> that

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
into it on the idea other things that

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.700 
into it on the idea other things that
are<00:05:08.180> really<00:05:08.300> neat<00:05:08.630> about<00:05:08.780> this<00:05:09.110> ventilator

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
are really neat about this ventilator

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.159 
are really neat about this ventilator
it's<00:05:09.919> got<00:05:10.070> some<00:05:10.250> advanced<00:05:10.610> settings<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:11.660> some

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
it's got some advanced settings so some

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.960 
it's got some advanced settings so some
of<00:05:12.199> these<00:05:12.350> modes<00:05:12.650> or<00:05:12.889> premier<00:05:13.370> stored<00:05:13.610> on<00:05:13.789> the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
of these modes or premier stored on the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.050 
of these modes or premier stored on the
bottom<00:05:14.240> you'll<00:05:14.389> see<00:05:14.539> this<00:05:14.690> yellow<00:05:15.380> triangle

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
bottom you'll see this yellow triangle

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.490 
bottom you'll see this yellow triangle
anywhere<00:05:17.060> you<00:05:17.150> see<00:05:17.330> that<00:05:17.479> yellow<00:05:17.750> triangle

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
anywhere you see that yellow triangle

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.670 
anywhere you see that yellow triangle
you<00:05:19.250> can<00:05:19.400> touch<00:05:19.639> it<00:05:19.720> hit<00:05:20.720> advanced<00:05:21.110> settings

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
you can touch it hit advanced settings

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.310 
you can touch it hit advanced settings
and<00:05:21.949> there<00:05:22.880> will<00:05:22.970> be<00:05:23.000> things<00:05:23.750> in<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.110> back

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
and there will be things in the back

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.170 
and there will be things in the back
that<00:05:24.590> you<00:05:24.620> can<00:05:24.710> actually<00:05:25.039> set<00:05:25.490> so<00:05:25.729> you<00:05:25.820> can<00:05:25.850> set

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
that you can actually set so you can set

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.900 
that you can actually set so you can set
a<00:05:26.210> flow<00:05:26.510> cycle<00:05:26.960> instead<00:05:27.229> a<00:05:27.289> time<00:05:27.560> cycle<00:05:27.860> if<00:05:28.760> I

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
a flow cycle instead a time cycle if I

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.270 
a flow cycle instead a time cycle if I
set<00:05:29.240> my<00:05:29.270> inspiratory<00:05:30.229> pressure<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:30.860> can<00:05:31.099> look

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
set my inspiratory pressure I can look

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.659 
set my inspiratory pressure I can look
at<00:05:31.460> volume<00:05:32.000> limiting<00:05:32.690> those<00:05:32.840> breaths<00:05:33.639> or<00:05:34.639> I

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
at volume limiting those breaths or I

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.310 
at volume limiting those breaths or I
could<00:05:34.940> even<00:05:35.090> go<00:05:35.270> in<00:05:35.419> and<00:05:35.570> set<00:05:35.780> a<00:05:35.810> pressure

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
could even go in and set a pressure

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.909 
could even go in and set a pressure
