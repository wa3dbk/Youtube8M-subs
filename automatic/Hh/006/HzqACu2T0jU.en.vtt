00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.260
 hello very good everyone here street that 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:08.059
 is telling me a new video and good 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.980
 of the new game against all the truth 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.800
 which is a very very fine game here you see 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.540
 what happened to camera to fast camera is 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.160
 the only part of the game that happened 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.829
 to fast camera because they are 15 seconds 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.239
 that I do not do anything using nobody's bike and 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.009
 Well the truth is that very happy with 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.839
 the help of rockies of course 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.489
 with this kind of help is really 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.580
 when you grow up and when you have more and more 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:32.599
 I want to continue with the channel 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.120
 the truth that I do not expect to have or win 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.560
 500 subscribers, that is, I do not wait for you 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.570
 The only thing I want is for the 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.600
 subscribers that we want even if they are 50 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.040
 that are active is to say that the and 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.540
 subscribe to subscribe because they 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.120
 like because they like our way of 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.250
 talk about commenting on playing what 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.080
 I make them the cock or they like what 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.570
 what we do is the only thing that really 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.239
 we apologize if they have been what 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.430
 of the support but I'm very happy 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.629
 and that 's the only thing that you like 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.019
 you will also have to give 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.330
 your opinion is good or bad but 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.510
 that yes always without disrespect is 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.370
 the only and good thing already the subject 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.080
 that your memorandum went up call of duty 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.030
 basically 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.650
 basically we go up call of duty we are 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.330
 willing to upload many more things is 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.760
 say what you ask us jce or at least what 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.170
 we will try to upload what you want to slender 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.600
 it is learning and you want minecraft for 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.790
 minecraft you want fifa because fifa you want 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.150
 proposals but we really do not care 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.680
 the case is to make and upload videos that 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.470
 you like to have fun that 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.880
 after all, it 's the only thing 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.890
 we pretend on youtube is to amuse the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.090
 people and make them entertain I think 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.240
 that we got it we went up good 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.250
 departures to the channel 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.020
 and will say that close to those of co2 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.970
 rockies but that's impossible is 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.500
 impossible because you know rockies I want 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.820
 who have raised about 20 games as of 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.759
 100 casualties while we have 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.130
 uploaded 6 or 7 88 games as of 100 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.060
 lowers are good, too, but 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.840
 obviously not at all comparable with 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.490
 but it was only them that yes 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.130
 the games that we upload to the channel are 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.799
 very good so they are good games in 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.360
 white 50 and 52 in confirmed low there is 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.929
 a game as low low 100 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.849
 confirmed 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.069
 so well I think it's a channel 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.209
 that can draw attention 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.650
 I believe that you can improve together 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.500
 we also together 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.879
 you're worth it because the truth is that I 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.909
 on youtube since I'm learning 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.170
 many new things and basically 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.939
 our goal if what you received 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.489
 and that you learn together with us 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.409
 and we with you would like 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.110
 have a hot deal with our 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:37.080
 subscribers 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.820
 so if they comment that we play with 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.410
 them in the console that we talk to 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.590
 them on skype we do not have the slightest 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.160
 problem we will give likes with you all 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.600
 what you ask 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.370
 basically what they do with 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.440
 rockies but in our channel removing 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.080
 that kind of games that is outside of 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.480
 our reach so exaggerated and so 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.879
 usually clear 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.190
 so that's basically what we assume 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.080
 call of duty we also upload speed arts 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.870
 that so he does not know what it is because it is the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.519
 youtube channel background you do it 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.319
 youtube channel background an image you 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.500
 you want to add something you want to touch up 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.780
 you record everything with a program that 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.670
 call you sing, it's worth it 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.830
 I make the programs you record your 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.200
 little screen you record everything and then what 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.610
 you put on super mega fast camera you 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.930
 you put a background song and you upload it and 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.180
 that people like quite a lot 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.739
 a lot of work but he likes it and obviously 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.050
 you have to upload it that you like by the way 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.750
 you will see that the audio of this game 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.640
 you do not listen basically because I was 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.810
 commented on a video that I uploaded to the channel 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.580
 with which I had to remove the 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.620
 comment because I already deleted the game 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.420
 have had to change the hard drive by 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.610
 which I do not have to download from my 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.410
 own channel to pass it on so 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.430
 well basically that's why there's no audio 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.990
 in the rest of games 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:52.110
 There I'm shouting 10 there's audio but good 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.760
 also in others, the other part has 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.700
 quality will probably be a little better 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.860
 because when downloading it rock 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.810
 is from our video channel that 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.190
 let 's go on the link the quality is not going to 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.380
 be the same but we believe that the quality 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.360
 is in hd in fact we have the hd pvr 2 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.880
 so I think we have a channel 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.740
 pretty good and what I said before 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.450
 we do not expect to gain 500 thousand subscribers 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.250
 it's a way of speaking 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.690
 the only thing that we hope is that he likes to 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.880
 people what we do and what they are 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.560
 assets basically in arms 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.570
 and now already commenting if the game a 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.560
 little bit and to finish you'll see that 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.360
 during the whole game of being 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.740
 doing drop shots and I'll tell you 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.050
 something that maybe is a bit strange 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.180
 I do not have a configuration of the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.700
 buttons in tactics or I have it 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.520
 normal what happens is that since 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.250
 I started playing 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.259
 in the call of duty 5 I learned to do the 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.319
 drop shots if the configuration in 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.690
 tactic is to say I already do it and without 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:46.280
 think directly I give it at once and 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.919
 I bend over and for me it's something 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.560
 perfectly normal because I sometimes 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.729
 I cracked and crouched because it confused me 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.889
 I'm not used to square 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.199
 continuation to the button and syntactic as well 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.879
 that all the drones that I do is manual 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.210
 that is really for me is usual 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.319
 but it may be a bit strange 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.639
 so you 'll be back in the 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.870
 video I wanted to tell you all this 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.500
 thank you very much everyone is already 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.500
 approximate
