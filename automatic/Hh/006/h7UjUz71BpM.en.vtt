two<00:00:39.629> fans<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.739> will<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.950> an<00:00:41.040> extra

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
two fans on so that will be an extra

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.319 
two fans on so that will be an extra
video<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.790> see<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.059> they<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
video to see that they have the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.290 
video to see that they have the
temperature<00:00:42.750> difference<00:00:43.079> though<00:00:43.770> this

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
phones down on the bottom bar said it

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.330 
phones down on the bottom bar said it
didn't<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> most<00:01:49.860> hardware

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
didn't have the most hardware

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
white LED which actually you for me

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.870 
white LED which actually you for me
gives<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.590> really<00:01:58.799> nice<00:01:58.920> accent<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.700> quite

gives a really nice accent and I quite

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.999 
gives a really nice accent and I quite
like<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.329> when<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> radiators<00:02:01.560> installed<00:02:01.950> on

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009

like it when the radiators installed on
the<00:02:02.100> top<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.490> quite<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> look<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the top I quite like the look of it and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.389 
the top I quite like the look of it and

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
benchmarking actually we did also use

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.259 
benchmarking actually we did also use

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
we're benchmarking those chips week so

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.560 
we're benchmarking those chips week so
inherently<00:04:10.430> got<00:04:10.850> those<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.060> lot

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
inherently got those a lot

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.479 
inherently got those a lot
results<00:04:11.989> as<00:04:12.109> well<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:12.739> I<00:04:12.769> found<00:04:13.100> out<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:13.310> the

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
results as well so I found out that the

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.020 
results as well so I found out that the
lepton<00:04:14.329> 120<00:04:15.109> XL<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:16.340> one<00:04:16.459> we<00:04:16.579> checked<00:04:16.850> out

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
lepton 120 XL the one we checked out

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.480 
lepton 120 XL the one we checked out
here<00:04:18.669> was<00:04:19.669> around<00:04:20.390> about<00:04:20.510> 80<00:04:21.470> degrees

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
here was around about 80 degrees

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.969 
here was around about 80 degrees
with<00:04:22.639> both<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.120> CPU<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.539> GPU<00:04:23.740> SR<00:04:24.740> of<00:04:24.830> on

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
with both the CPU and GPU SR of on

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.270 
with both the CPU and GPU SR of on

however<00:04:28.669> it<00:04:29.000> was<00:04:29.090> actually<00:04:29.360> 75<00:04:29.900> degrees<00:04:30.289> which

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
however it was actually 75 degrees which

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.170 
however it was actually 75 degrees which
is<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.740> nice<00:04:30.889> comparison<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.639> be<00:04:31.729> able<00:04:31.789> to<00:04:31.940> say

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
is the nice comparison to be able to say

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.150 
is the nice comparison to be able to say
that<00:04:32.389> the<00:04:32.509> mapped<00:04:32.900> into<00:04:33.080> 40<00:04:33.500> M<00:04:33.590> is<00:04:33.740> definitely

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
that the mapped into 40 M is definitely

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.189 
that the mapped into 40 M is definitely
worth<00:04:34.430> it's<00:04:35.000> had<00:04:35.180> more<00:04:35.389> money<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.750> be<00:04:35.990> able<00:04:36.050> to

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
worth it's had more money to be able to

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.150 
worth it's had more money to be able to
get<00:04:36.319> that<00:04:36.470> little<00:04:36.650> bit<00:04:36.800> more<00:04:36.860> performance

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
get that little bit more performance

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.129 
get that little bit more performance
especially<00:04:38.030> if<00:04:38.449> you're<00:04:38.569> running<00:04:38.690> something<00:04:38.960> I

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
especially if you're running something I

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.659 
especially if you're running something I
can<00:04:39.349> name<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.650> chip<00:04:39.889> which<00:04:40.280> could<00:04:40.460> run

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
can name the chip which could run

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.580 
can name the chip which could run
considerably<00:04:41.389> hearts<00:04:41.840> especially<00:04:41.960> under

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
considerably hearts especially under

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.860 
considerably hearts especially under
loot<00:04:43.240> there<00:04:44.240> we're<00:04:44.330> gonna<00:04:44.389> be<00:04:44.539> taking<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.780> look

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
loot there we're gonna be taking a look

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.330 
loot there we're gonna be taking a look
at<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.139> pros<00:04:45.349> and<00:04:45.500> cons<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:45.889> in<00:04:46.069> just<00:04:46.250> a

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
at the pros and cons of this in just a

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.770 
at the pros and cons of this in just a
second<00:04:46.759> it's<00:04:47.030> just<00:04:47.180> they're<00:04:47.300> going<00:04:47.479> for<00:04:47.660> that

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
second it's just they're going for that

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.779 
second it's just they're going for that
so<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.740> pros<00:04:48.949> and<00:04:49.099> cons<00:04:49.160> of<00:04:49.460> this<00:04:49.610> are

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
so the pros and cons of this are

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.610 
so the pros and cons of this are
definitely<00:04:50.210> that<00:04:50.360> it's<00:04:50.509> very<00:04:50.720> stylish<00:04:51.169> in<00:04:51.470> my

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
definitely that it's very stylish in my

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.770 
definitely that it's very stylish in my
eyes<00:04:51.830> it's<00:04:52.460> got<00:04:52.610> an<00:04:52.699> amazingly<00:04:53.300> easily

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
eyes it's got an amazingly easily

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.960 
eyes it's got an amazingly easily
installation<00:04:54.710> and<00:04:54.889> it<00:04:54.979> has<00:04:55.099> some<00:04:55.250> great<00:04:55.430> temps

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
installation and it has some great temps

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.820 
installation and it has some great temps
the<00:04:56.419> only<00:04:56.599> cons<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:56.930> could<00:04:57.080> really<00:04:57.229> think<00:04:57.319> of<00:04:57.650> is

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
the only cons I could really think of is

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.800 
the only cons I could really think of is
that<00:04:58.009> high<00:04:58.340> rpm<00:04:58.759> as<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.060> fans<00:04:59.270> are<00:04:59.449> actually

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
that high rpm as the fans are actually

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.839 
that high rpm as the fans are actually
quite<00:05:00.050> load<00:05:00.349> so<00:05:01.069> improvements<00:05:01.699> on

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
quite load so improvements on

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.850 
quite load so improvements on
functionality<00:05:02.360> could<00:05:02.840> be<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.319> this<00:05:03.680> could

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
functionality could be the this could

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.010 
functionality could be the this could
have<00:05:04.069> some<00:05:04.280> software<00:05:04.699> to<00:05:05.659> be<00:05:05.780> able<00:05:05.840> to

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
have some software to be able to

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.990 
have some software to be able to
actually<00:05:06.319> you<00:05:06.409> know<00:05:06.440> change<00:05:07.340> up<00:05:07.580> some<00:05:07.639> of<00:05:07.909> the

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
actually you know change up some of the

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.790 
actually you know change up some of the
the<00:05:08.240> fan<00:05:08.449> settings<00:05:08.990> and<00:05:09.199> fan<00:05:09.380> curves<00:05:09.650> and

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
the fan settings and fan curves and

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.350 
the fan settings and fan curves and
stuff<00:05:10.009> which<00:05:10.430> would<00:05:10.520> be<00:05:10.639> quite<00:05:10.759> nice<00:05:10.970> to<00:05:11.180> see
