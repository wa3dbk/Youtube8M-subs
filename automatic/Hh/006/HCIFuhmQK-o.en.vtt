 participate and small fish and win real 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.500
 facts of the game world of tanks 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello to all my comrades 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.179
 okay and in today's release my 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.570
 the story we see how I promised t110 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.680
 e5 is a heavy tank level 10 but what about 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.890
 I went to him 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.090
 you ask m3 whether you started with it then 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.490
 T1 Heavy M6 2932 M103 and already finally 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.970
 universal tank level 10 in my 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.670
 hangar 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.850
 start of course sm3 guys explain why 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.040
 it was the only cancer ace in this 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.230
 branch because he has the right 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.719
 by the location of the guns a it was 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.480
 very uncomfortable in the early stages when i 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.219
 I started to play I did not understand how to 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.860
 leave how to substitute this weapon 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.719
 so she shot because in many 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.899
 situations then played i think will understand me 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.379
 yes it was a cactus tank but since t1 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.160
 heavy 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.969
 I have on all tanks from 68 there 6670 72 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.430
 percent win 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.550
 because it is universal tanchiki in 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.090
 any battle on almost any map they can 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.450
 drag t1 heavy his only minus 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.060
 for me it was a review of 330 meters nato 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.740
 by this tower why minus because 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.810
 that I played on medium tanks namely 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.990
 same American they have maximum 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.259
 the review is almost always on the level I am exactly 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.759
 because of this, I’m used to the fact that I’m still burning t1 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.070
 heavy me didn't give it but he gave me 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.180
 good frontal armor if you throw in 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.479
 you threw offtop 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.939
 you there cavalli but the gun is very ppm on 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.770
 this post something damage she wore this 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.880
 too was not enough but I understood that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.259
 the law level and on m6 is already waiting for me 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.810
 fully equipped guns with 240 single damage 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.310
 Of course, top guys and 160 punch 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.170
 it was very good because on 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.700
 sixth level you punched all even 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.140
 inhabited when hit if 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.329
 punching too punched 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.729
 and it was wonderful but what to say 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.280
 about armor top of course she became worse by 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.469
 towards your classmates you more often 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.020
 pierced you could not so well 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.329
 tank but review you too because of this 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.200
 gave 20 meters more and for that 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.420
 Of course a separate thank you go to t29 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.180
 guys 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.290
 could already use the s320 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.270
 one-time damage is good but there was 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.360
 such a nuance that if you played on gold 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.569
 then guns are tapping with 240 one-time 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.970
 damage dealt a lot more damage in 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.430
 minute and of course had such a breakdown 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.140
 the accuracy is even better 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.050
 prtopa smart goldie was playing at all 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.000
 Ice but those who had gold then 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.040
 yet there was no Serbian golda therefore only 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.590
 units used such awesome 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.550
 instrument and just if 2-20 ninth 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.350
 fight each other 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.739
 the one who has the pretop weapon i 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.480
 always won well tower you tower 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.910
 twenty-nine, too, played a role 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.090
 because it was due to her that 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.750
 very very much nank and it was 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.600
 Well, in general, I repeat the branch 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.600
 here this t110, those five are very cool 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.580
 because it is universal you could 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.920
 go into any battle on this heavy tank 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.110
 and feel like a king 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.459
 it depends on you win 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.459
 Exactly the battle but going to t 32 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.459
 this is the eighth level who do not understand you 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.380
 afigi wali from everything the first thing that was 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.320
 very wonderful 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.480
 This of course the tower she was not on as 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.170
 on t 29 which in board is permissible by someone 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.269
 made her karma she was incredible 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.670
 cast iron is unbelievable to it's so molten that 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.850
 just had to pierce her to pray 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.720
 choose and ask just for mercy also 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.470
 was stronger vld nld total armor was 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.890
 stronger 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.900
 Yes, and the circular is also quite good, so 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.989
 the guys could already try 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.120
 to pot at all from any point 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.940
 not just from the tower like it was at t 29 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.340
 precisely from all but minus in guns because 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.620
 that 198 total breaking through on top gun 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.310
 at the eighth level she was average 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.750
 accuracy and it was not ice 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.310
 the only thing I didn't like 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.430
 because maneuverability is everything else 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.100
 also superb but guys going to 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.200
 place 3 you probably understand when 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.780
 opened 10 level guns which will 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.500
 her fifth what awaits you 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.990
 solve dpm and the potential is exactly what 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.450
 you will do in battle tower of course 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.889
 and generally ninth level armor 73 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.570
 mediate on let's say take the same 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.350
 there are mushrooms for which now go away yes 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.090
 here he is tanking yes he has vld 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.400
 angles supplied at all with 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.950
 incredibly cool armor he has and 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.430
 a tower that breaks only in the lump 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.100
 but he unfortunately did not have all 3 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.380
 he was tanking harp he had 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.660
 tanking mask gun but its principle 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.300
 almost always even in the tower at the slightest 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.950
 let's punched he had a weapon 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.270
 under what he really had 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.960
 good and everyone appreciated it so and honeycomb 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.220
 look right now i need to leave 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.840
 op op op op op 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.750
 high-explosive he exploded with a blower that's yes 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.800
 going to t110 5 you already understood that 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.800
 such a 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.470
 but really universal tanchik and that 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.930
 one should expect from his game at first me 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.419
 there was damage somewhere 3,303,500 i.e. when 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.390
 I dragged when I understood how to play 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.700
 felt the situation but now i have 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.500
 Of course on it will be less somewhere 2 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.200
 eight hundred and seventy percent sara 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.960
 statistics keeps ie everything with this 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.789
 okay, havik, they leave now to watch 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.340
 give shots drive off 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.229
 I 'm taking the signal I'm terrible because 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.090
 that in the beginning I was punished by artillery on 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.770
 1000 but it is not the same guys this is my 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.229
 story basically i'm very much 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.380
 distracted and at 5 I want to say 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.690
 Excellent 10 weapons level which 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.750
 punches almost everyone if you aim there 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.910
 250 + punch it enough with head 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.669
 you have cumulative to shoot you 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.100
 there is an average speed you semi with you 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:07.130
 because you get armor itself 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.080
 he has no more precise there is even a tower well 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.360
 armored but vulnerable spot not 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.150
 forget it like a bump right on the very 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.160
 top you leave you just cram 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.229
 crammed under the tower if we assume forests 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.600
 tall tank with gold under the tower you 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:24.050
 shoots and punches or vld also 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.630
 pushes guslya to give them too 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.820
 it is well sewn, that is, the sides it tanks 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.680
 on dozens is not very clear if by you 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.870
 to survive some 8 or 9 level with 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.240
 a small break through something thick 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.430
 on his easy to breed well or later 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.420
 small angles more precisely even large 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.460
 towards enemies 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.200
 something will stand too 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.500
 vytankovyvat using the harp 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.810
 and 5 tanchik I really like and 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.990
 much more interesting than let's say m 3 all 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:53.630
 three full transition little tank order 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.390
 most guys you are preparing for this 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.370
 adulthood so guys about 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.990
 such my story repeat that percentage 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.970
 wins me on this thread from the wealthy 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.220
 the largest is 70 percent and 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.300
 fingers me these all really very very 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.030
 liked 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.460
 excluding of course and rely which was 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.340
 at the fourth level because i just 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.140
 bombed at the moment well and the guys with you 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.850
 was i was catching one if you wait to this 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.800
 the next issue is mine am 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.660
 which I have in the hangar now you

 comments as well if you parasat 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.810
 According to the release, it is my story that I do not 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.140
 talking about how i played fight it just 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.300
 fund then write about it in the comments and 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.640
