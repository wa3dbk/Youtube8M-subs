00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.859
 a dear subscribers who also carina 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.769

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.329

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.070

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.790
 interested because it looks really cute 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.010
 us cute that was just everything often should 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.630
 So I had to move to inch units 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.150
 I have translated into quasi 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.420
 centimeters but still it worked 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.250

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.500
 especially the dear carina show how 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.970
 because now this works with here 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.640

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:05.890

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.359
 There is a dying color in it or ever 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.369
