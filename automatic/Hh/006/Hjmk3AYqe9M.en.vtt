00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.430 
for about an hour and a half so i won't
fade<00:02:08.759> as<00:02:08.940> quickly<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.660> when<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.170> does<00:02:10.319> speak

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
fade as quickly and when it does speak

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.110 
fade as quickly and when it does speak
I'm<00:02:10.770> think<00:02:11.069> I'm<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.640> over<00:02:11.790> it

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
I'm think I'm just going to go over it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.920 
I'm think I'm just going to go over it
with<00:02:12.270> purple

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
with purple

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.660 
with purple
so<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.859> way<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:13.980> don't<00:02:14.069> have<00:02:14.159> to<00:02:14.250> bleach<00:02:14.519> it

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
so that way I don't have to bleach it

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.220 
so that way I don't have to bleach it
again<00:02:14.939> and<00:02:15.239> they'll<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.450> be<00:02:15.780> kind<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.049> like<00:02:16.170> a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
again and they'll just be kind of like a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.300 
again and they'll just be kind of like a
reddish<00:02:16.709> purple<00:02:18.319> so<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.560> doesn't<00:02:19.859> look<00:02:19.980> really

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
reddish purple so it doesn't look really
