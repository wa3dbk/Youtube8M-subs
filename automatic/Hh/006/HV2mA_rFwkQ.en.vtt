today<00:00:06.720> we<00:00:07.050> are<00:00:07.230> talking<00:00:07.440> about<00:00:07.770> hemp<00:00:08.280> which<00:00:08.580> we

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
today we are talking about hemp which we

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.030 
today we are talking about hemp which we
consider<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.360> superfood<00:00:10.050> now<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> first<00:00:10.860> thing

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
consider a superfood now the first thing

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.100 
consider a superfood now the first thing
people<00:00:11.190> generally<00:00:11.880> wonder<00:00:12.210> when<00:00:12.330> they<00:00:12.420> hear

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
people generally wonder when they hear

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.960 
people generally wonder when they hear
have<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.530> whether<00:00:13.860> hub<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.400> related<00:00:14.820> to

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:14.970 
have is whether hub is related to

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.670 
have is whether hub is related to
marijuana<00:00:15.180> well<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.020> reality<00:00:16.200> is<00:00:16.650> that

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
marijuana well the reality is that

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.890 
marijuana well the reality is that
marijuana<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.730> hemp<00:00:18.090> are<00:00:18.300> actually

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
marijuana and hemp are actually

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.960 
marijuana and hemp are actually
different<00:00:19.349> varieties<00:00:20.040> of<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.279> same<00:00:20.580> species

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
different varieties of the same species

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.810 
different varieties of the same species
of<00:00:21.390> plants<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.050> they<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.770> related<00:00:23.160> however

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
of plants so they are related however

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.330 
of plants so they are related however
hemp<00:00:24.660> does<00:00:24.960> not<00:00:25.170> cause<00:00:25.380> intoxication<00:00:25.650> it's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
hemp does not cause intoxication it's

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.599 
hemp does not cause intoxication it's
mostly<00:00:27.000> grown<00:00:27.240> for<00:00:27.480> its<00:00:27.510> seed<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:29.340> know<00:00:29.460> it

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
mostly grown for its seed so you know it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.130 
mostly grown for its seed so you know it
does<00:00:29.820> contain<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.210> little<00:00:30.480> bit<00:00:30.600> of<00:00:30.689> THC<00:00:30.960> which

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
does contain a little bit of THC which

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.960 
does contain a little bit of THC which
is<00:00:31.350> the<00:00:31.439> active<00:00:31.590> compound<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.340> marijuana<00:00:32.460> that

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
is the active compound in marijuana that

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.369 
is the active compound in marijuana that
makes<00:00:33.150> you<00:00:33.269> feel<00:00:33.449> a<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.690> bit<00:00:33.870> high<00:00:34.080> but

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
makes you feel a little bit high but

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.140 
makes you feel a little bit high but
it's<00:00:34.830> such<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.220> minuscule<00:00:35.699> amount<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.059> your

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
it's such a minuscule amount that your

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.360 
it's such a minuscule amount that your
body<00:00:36.360> won't<00:00:36.960> ever<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> difference<00:00:37.620> so

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
body won't ever know the difference so

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.670 
body won't ever know the difference so
we<00:00:38.879> consider<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.449> really<00:00:39.960> great<00:00:40.140> protein

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
we consider have a really great protein

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.469 
we consider have a really great protein
source<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.159> has<00:00:41.280> all<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.699> essential<00:00:42.030> amino

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:42.479 
source it has all of the essential amino

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.229 
source it has all of the essential amino
acids<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.379> need<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.400> a<00:00:44.489> great<00:00:44.640> plant

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
acids that we need so it's a great plant

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.390 
acids that we need so it's a great plant
source<00:00:45.540> of<00:00:45.720> protein<00:00:46.080> which<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.040> makes<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
source of protein which is it makes it a

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.710 
source of protein which is it makes it a
great<00:00:47.489> addition<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:47.909> vegetarian<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.690> vegan

great addition for vegetarian and vegan
diets<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.589> it<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.820> one<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.269> only<00:00:51.420> edible

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
fatty acids that we need for weight loss

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.350 
fatty acids that we need for weight loss
and<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:56.129> great<00:00:56.309> skin<00:00:56.699> i'm<00:00:57.089> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.269> be

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
and for great skin i'm going to be

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.939 
and for great skin i'm going to be
talking<00:00:57.540> about<00:00:57.750> essential<00:00:58.260> fatty<00:00:58.470> acids<00:00:58.860> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
talking about essential fatty acids a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.320 
talking about essential fatty acids a
lot<00:00:59.100> during<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.460> segment<00:00:59.670> because<00:00:59.970> it's

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
lot during this segment because it's

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.910 
lot during this segment because it's
such<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.540> great<00:01:00.720> source<00:01:01.080> and<00:01:01.290> basically

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
such a great source and basically

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.590 
such a great source and basically
they're<00:01:02.159> just<00:01:02.369> healthy<00:01:02.699> fats<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.269> our<00:01:03.360> body

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
they're just healthy fats that our body

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.299 
they're just healthy fats that our body
needs<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.229> our<00:01:04.530> body<00:01:04.769> doesn't<00:01:05.190> make

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
needs that our body doesn't make

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
needs that our body doesn't make
naturally<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:05.970> need<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.330> them<00:01:06.540> from

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
naturally so we need to get them from

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420 
naturally so we need to get them from
food<00:01:06.930> sources<00:01:07.409> which<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.010> why<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.310> recommend

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
food sources which is why we recommend

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.990 
food sources which is why we recommend
temp<00:01:08.940> it<00:01:09.869> has<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> great<00:01:11.039> protein<00:01:11.609> count<00:01:11.789> it's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
temp it has a great protein count it's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.300 
temp it has a great protein count it's
about<00:01:12.149> 50<00:01:12.359> to<00:01:12.600> 75<00:01:13.079> percent<00:01:13.500> more<00:01:13.799> protein<00:01:14.280> than

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
about 50 to 75 percent more protein than

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.039 
about 50 to 75 percent more protein than
flax<00:01:14.880> or<00:01:15.090> cheetah<00:01:15.329> which<00:01:15.479> makes<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.840> amazing

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
flax or cheetah which makes it amazing

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.870 
flax or cheetah which makes it amazing
but<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.890> doesn't<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.399> same<00:01:17.460> amount<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
but it doesn't have the same amount of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.999 
but it doesn't have the same amount of
fiber<00:01:18.149> so<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> recommend<00:01:18.930> mixing<00:01:19.380> things<00:01:19.710> up

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
fiber so I recommend mixing things up

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.950 
fiber so I recommend mixing things up
which<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.640> why<00:01:20.759> i<00:01:20.789> love<00:01:20.969> this<00:01:21.359> superfood

can<00:02:46.340> really<00:02:46.640> break<00:02:46.820> down<00:02:46.880> those<00:02:47.210> essential

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
can really break down those essential

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.180 
can really break down those essential
fatty<00:02:47.900> acids<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.440> we're<00:02:48.650> going<00:02:48.800> for<00:02:48.950> here

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
fatty acids that we're going for here

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.870 
fatty acids that we're going for here
and<00:02:49.580> it's<00:02:50.330> it's<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.110> closest<00:02:51.650> ideal<00:02:52.280> ratio<00:02:52.490> of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
and it's it's the closest ideal ratio of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.640 
and it's it's the closest ideal ratio of
your<00:02:53.060> omega<00:02:53.330> so<00:02:53.600> you're<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.750> fatty<00:02:53.960> acid<00:02:54.440> so

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
your omega so you're a fatty acid so

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.470 
your omega so you're a fatty acid so
again<00:02:54.890> great<00:02:55.430> source<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.850> can<00:02:55.880> sprinkle<00:02:56.270> it
