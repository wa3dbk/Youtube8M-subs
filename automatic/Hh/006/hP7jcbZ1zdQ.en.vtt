00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
electricity ones and then the rock ones

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.530 
electricity ones and then the rock ones
you<00:01:37.900> shove<00:01:38.170> one<00:01:38.350> but<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:39.850> only<00:01:39.970> do<00:01:40.329> this<00:01:40.479> for

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
one in the end it's kind of hard to

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.719 
one in the end it's kind of hard to
describe<00:01:46.780> but<00:01:47.079> they<00:01:47.950> have<00:01:48.159> these<00:01:48.400> for

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
describe but they have these for

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.240 
describe but they have these for
everyone<00:01:49.299> mix<00:01:49.600> so<00:01:49.840> in<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.470> like<00:01:50.920> kind<00:01:51.189> of

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
everyone mix so in the like kind of

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.380 
everyone mix so in the like kind of
tribe<00:01:52.060> or<00:01:52.390> whatever<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:52.869> is<00:01:52.960> so<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:54.610> there

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
tribe or whatever it is so this there

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.539 
tribe or whatever it is so this there
were<00:01:55.540> infertile<00:01:55.990> ones<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.799> little<00:01:57.070> guy<00:01:57.189> comes

were infertile ones the little guy comes
with<00:01:57.759> bulk<00:01:58.060> I<00:01:58.299> think<00:01:58.540> because<00:01:58.899> he<00:01:59.170> has<00:01:59.350> nooblet

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
with bulk I think because he has nooblet

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.859 
with bulk I think because he has nooblet
lesson<00:02:00.430> rounded<00:02:00.700> pieces<00:02:00.850> because<00:02:01.479> he's<00:02:01.689> not

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
lesson rounded pieces because he's not

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.280 
lesson rounded pieces because he's not
that<00:02:02.049> big<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.369> this<00:02:03.729> guy<00:02:03.939> comes<00:02:04.180> with<00:02:04.390> him<00:02:04.600> he

they put these in one of everyone I made

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.960 
they put these in one of everyone I made
even<00:02:26.120> more<00:02:26.860> cool<00:02:27.860> if<00:02:28.040> they<00:02:28.250> came<00:02:28.430> with<00:02:28.640> all<00:02:28.790> of

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
even more cool if they came with all of

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.750 
even more cool if they came with all of
them<00:02:29.120> but<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.570> think<00:02:30.230> it's<00:02:30.380> just<00:02:30.470> because<00:02:30.760> these

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
them but I think it's just because these

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.460 
them but I think it's just because these
are<00:02:31.970> unique<00:02:32.240> to<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.600> tribe<00:02:32.870> or<00:02:33.050> something<00:02:33.380> I

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
are unique to the tribe or something I

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.090 
are unique to the tribe or something I
don't<00:02:33.530> know<00:02:33.740> but<00:02:34.540> kind<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.630> weird<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.110> it's<00:02:36.920> a

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
don't know but kind of weird but it's a

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.120 
don't know but kind of weird but it's a
little<00:02:37.610> bonus<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.810> could<00:02:39.080> have<00:02:39.650> in

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
little bonus that you could have in

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.950 
little bonus that you could have in
there<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.840> now<00:02:42.020> let's<00:02:42.410> look<00:02:42.650> at<00:02:42.710> bulk<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.960> here

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
there so now let's look at bulk and here

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.770 
there so now let's look at bulk and here
he<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.310> he<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:48.160> kind<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.310> unique<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:50.450> just<00:02:50.630> have

so<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:25.190> don't<00:04:26.060> know<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.270> mixels<00:04:26.750> some<00:04:27.680> people

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
so I don't know the mixels some people

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.560 
so I don't know the mixels some people
are<00:04:28.070> just<00:04:28.100> using<00:04:28.400> four<00:04:28.669> pieces<00:04:28.910> because<00:04:29.539> the

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
are just using four pieces because the

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.650 
are just using four pieces because the
shows<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.860> really<00:04:31.160> big

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
shows that really big

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.460 
shows that really big
it's<00:04:32.110> kind<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.590> weird<00:04:34.890> nose<00:04:36.570> just<00:04:37.570> mixels

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
it's kind of weird nose just mixels

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.890 
it's kind of weird nose just mixels
isn't<00:04:38.710> that<00:04:38.860> big<00:04:39.160> I<00:04:39.490> think<00:04:40.210> this<00:04:40.390> line<00:04:40.630> is

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
isn't that big I think this line is

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.060 
isn't that big I think this line is
mainly<00:04:41.140> just<00:04:41.410> four<00:04:41.620> pieces<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:43.770> ideas<00:04:44.770> maybe

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
mainly just four pieces and ideas maybe

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.970 
mainly just four pieces and ideas maybe
I<00:04:45.430> don't<00:04:45.670> know<00:04:45.730> but<00:04:46.480> this<00:04:47.410> is<00:04:47.560> my<00:04:47.740> least
