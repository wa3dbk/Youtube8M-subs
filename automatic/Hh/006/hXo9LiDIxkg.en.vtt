once you leave here why 54 block
schedule<00:00:18.060> me<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.960> think<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:19.529> unique<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
schedule me I think it's unique in the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.679 
schedule me I think it's unique in the
sense<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.340> students<00:00:20.910> only<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.510> take

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
sense that students only have to take

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.359 
sense that students only have to take
four<00:00:22.109> courses<00:00:22.439> during<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> course<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
four courses during the course of a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.880 
four courses during the course of a
semester<00:00:24.199> and<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.350> gives<00:00:25.529> students<00:00:25.830> an

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
semester and it gives students an

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.200 
semester and it gives students an
opportunity<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.279> focus<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.670> those<00:00:26.760> four<00:00:27.000> core

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
opportunity to focus on those four core

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.660 
opportunity to focus on those four core
classes<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:27.900> opposed<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.349> maybe<00:00:28.500> five<00:00:29.220> or<00:00:29.369> six

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
classes as opposed to maybe five or six

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.970 
classes as opposed to maybe five or six
or<00:00:29.820> seven<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.960> also<00:00:31.109> gives<00:00:31.710> kids<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
or seven I think it also gives kids the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.920 
or seven I think it also gives kids the
opportunity<00:00:32.040> almost<00:00:32.969> find<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.270> major<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.780> high

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
opportunity almost find a major in high

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.139 
opportunity almost find a major in high
school<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.350> they<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.770> take<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.190> example<00:00:35.250> 8

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
school that they can take for example 8

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.060 
school that they can take for example 8
math<00:00:36.480> classes<00:00:36.750> or<00:00:37.079> eight<00:00:37.200> science<00:00:37.559> classes<00:00:37.770> or

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
math classes or eight science classes or

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.920 
math classes or eight science classes or
eight<00:00:38.190> drama<00:00:38.460> classes<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
eight drama classes I just think it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.569 
eight drama classes I just think it
affords<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> kids<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.770> lot<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.010> opportunities

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
affords the kids a lot of opportunities

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.389 
affords the kids a lot of opportunities
and<00:00:41.820> its<00:00:42.719> uniqueness<00:00:43.110> gives<00:00:43.440> our<00:00:43.559> kids<00:00:43.829> leg<00:00:44.219> up

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and its uniqueness gives our kids leg up

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.720 
and its uniqueness gives our kids leg up
I<00:00:44.520> think<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.820> people<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.360> other<00:00:45.480> schedules<00:00:46.730> do

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
I think on people on other schedules do

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.330 
I think on people on other schedules do
you<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:48.079> any<00:00:49.079> advice<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.469> new<00:00:49.829> students

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
you have any advice for new students

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.100 
you have any advice for new students
yeah<00:00:50.760> i<00:00:50.789> would<00:00:50.940> sell<00:00:51.300> students<00:00:51.780> nuisance

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
yeah i would sell students nuisance

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.750 
yeah i would sell students nuisance
especially<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:52.800> connected<00:00:53.039> figure<00:00:53.699> out

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
especially to get connected figure out

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.580 
especially to get connected figure out
something<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.449> interests<00:00:54.930> them<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.170> campus

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
something that interests them on campus

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.610 
something that interests them on campus
whether<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> club<00:00:56.879> or<00:00:57.239> sports<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.260> drama

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
whether it's a club or sports or drama

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
whether it's a club or sports or drama
but<00:00:59.309> i<00:00:59.340> think<00:00:59.520> students<00:00:59.850> who<00:00:59.940> are<00:01:00.000> connected

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
but i think students who are connected

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.340 
but i think students who are connected
to<00:01:00.449> school<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.930> feel<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.140> they<00:01:01.320> have

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
to school and feel like they have

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.630 
to school and feel like they have
something<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.800> common<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:02.100> other<00:01:02.219> students

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
something in common with other students

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.939 
something in common with other students
do<00:01:03.030> better<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.960> i<00:01:04.260> think<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> number

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
do better and i think that's the number

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.500 
do better and i think that's the number
one<00:01:05.040> reason<00:01:05.189> why<00:01:05.430> kids<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.299> well<00:01:06.450> in

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
one reason why kids do not do well in

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.330 
one reason why kids do not do well in
schools<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.380> they're<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.650> connected<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
schools because they're not connected so

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.899 
schools because they're not connected so
my<00:01:09.000> non-binding<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.350> either<00:01:10.470> schools

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
my non-binding you can either schools

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.460 
my non-binding you can either schools
well<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.299> kids<00:01:12.750> are<00:01:12.840> unique<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.290> think

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
well I think the kids are unique I think

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.600 
well I think the kids are unique I think
there's<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.650> certain<00:01:13.770> spirit<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
there's a certain spirit here that

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.039 
there's a certain spirit here that
exists<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.630> seen<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.900> other

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
exists that I have not seen in other

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.160 
exists that I have not seen in other
schools<00:01:16.320> kids<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:18.150> behind<00:01:18.509> things<00:01:18.900> here<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
schools kids get behind things here that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.630 
schools kids get behind things here that
behind<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> band<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:20.070> behind<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> sports

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
behind the band there behind the sports

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.300 
behind the band there behind the sports
teams<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.240> also<00:01:22.049> think<00:01:22.320> too<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.920> kids<00:01:23.130> are

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
teams I also think too that the kids are

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.399 
teams I also think too that the kids are
real<00:01:23.610> thoughtful<00:01:23.850> here<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.390> mean<00:01:24.720> I've<00:01:24.990> rarely

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
real thoughtful here I mean I've rarely

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.440 
real thoughtful here I mean I've rarely
run<00:01:25.740> into<00:01:25.920> kids<00:01:26.159> treating<00:01:26.640> each<00:01:26.850> other<00:01:26.970> unkind

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
run into kids treating each other unkind

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.660 
run into kids treating each other unkind
most<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.470> time<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.950> kids<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.369> treating

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
most of time I see kids are treating

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.910 
most of time I see kids are treating
each<00:01:29.880> other<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.150> respect<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.930> kindness<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
each other with respect and kindness and
