really helpful turned around questions
very<00:00:24.060> quickly<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:25.340> he's<00:00:26.340> an<00:00:26.490> engineer

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
very quickly and he's an engineer

both<00:00:27.539> these<00:00:27.720> lights<00:00:27.960> feature<00:00:28.400> what<00:00:29.400> he<00:00:29.550> calls

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
both these lights feature what he calls

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.590 
both these lights feature what he calls
a<00:00:30.230> conspicuity<00:00:31.230> clicker<00:00:32.239> which<00:00:33.239> when<00:00:33.510> you

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
a conspicuity clicker which when you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.889 
a conspicuity clicker which when you
look<00:00:33.840> at<00:00:33.960> them<00:00:34.140> head-on<00:00:35.510> appear<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.690> solid

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
look at them head-on appear to be solid

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.299 
look at them head-on appear to be solid
but<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.590> look<00:00:37.770> at<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> mount<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.129> your

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
but if you look at the mount of your

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
but if you look at the mount of your
peripheral<00:00:38.640> vision<00:00:38.960> they<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> very

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
peripheral vision they have a very

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.650 
peripheral vision they have a very
slight<00:00:40.649> flicker<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.250> them<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.730> obviously

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
slight flicker to them and obviously

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.440 
slight flicker to them and obviously
drawing<00:00:43.440> attention<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:44.040> your<00:00:44.160> bike<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:45.420> you

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
drawing attention to your bike and you

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
drawing attention to your bike and you
so<00:00:48.450> I'm<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.600> gonna<00:00:48.780> give<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> quick<00:00:49.559> review

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
so I'm just gonna give a quick review

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.680 
so I'm just gonna give a quick review
show<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.399> how<00:00:50.760> they're<00:00:50.940> installed<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
show you how they're installed on the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.430 
show you how they're installed on the
CBR<00:00:52.079> 250<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.010> show<00:00:53.730> them<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.090> action<00:00:54.440> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
CBR 250 and show them in action the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.580 
CBR 250 and show them in action the
flicker<00:00:55.710> effect<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.520> exaggerated<00:00:57.360> on

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
flicker effect is really exaggerated on

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.040 
flicker effect is really exaggerated on
this<00:00:58.590> video<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.270> assume<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
this video I assume it's because of the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.779 
this video I assume it's because of the
frame<00:01:01.320> rate<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.010> said<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.550> barely

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
frame rate but as I said you can barely

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.490 
frame rate but as I said you can barely
perceive<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.420> unless<00:01:03.870> you're<00:01:04.049> looking<00:01:04.140> at<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
perceive it unless you're looking at it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.210 
perceive it unless you're looking at it
your<00:01:04.890> peripheral<00:01:05.400> vision<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> we'll<00:01:07.920> start<00:01:08.159> at

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
your peripheral vision so we'll start at

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.160 
your peripheral vision so we'll start at
the<00:01:08.280> back<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:10.400> use<00:01:11.400> my<00:01:11.610> own<00:01:11.780> brackets<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:13.049> are

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the back I use my own brackets these are

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.530 
the back I use my own brackets these are
not<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> brackets<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.040> came<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> kit

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
not the brackets that came with the kit

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.890 
not the brackets that came with the kit
kit<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.830> well<00:01:17.340> put<00:01:17.549> together<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> it's

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
kit is really well put together so it's

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320 
kit is really well put together so it's
just<00:01:19.049> two<00:01:19.470> banks<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.860> LEDs<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.150> see

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
just two banks of LEDs which you can see

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.300 
just two banks of LEDs which you can see
here<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:24.409> that's<00:01:25.409> what<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:25.680> look<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
here and that's what they look like and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.980 
here and that's what they look like and
then<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.700> ran<00:01:26.909> them<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.270> under<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> tail

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
then I just ran them up under the tail

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.740 
then I just ran them up under the tail
and<00:01:28.369> drilled<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.670> really<00:01:30.119> small<00:01:30.390> hole

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and drilled a really small hole

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.550 
and drilled a really small hole
underneath<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:32.040> get<00:01:32.159> them<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:33.350> just<00:01:34.350> quickly

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
underneath to get them up just quickly

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.920 
underneath to get them up just quickly
show<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:34.950> what<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.310> looks<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.610> inside

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
show you what it looks like inside

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.630 
show you what it looks like inside
there's<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.560> controller<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.430> then

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
there's the controller and then

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.899 
there's the controller and then
basically<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.210> tap<00:01:39.509> into<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.990> tap<00:01:43.229> into

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
basically you tap into the you tap into

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.920 
basically you tap into the you tap into
really<00:01:44.909> easily<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.780> cut

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
really easily you don't have to cut

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.420 
really easily you don't have to cut
anything<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.560> did<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:46.920> come<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.189> posi

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
anything you did they come with posi

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.060 
anything you did they come with posi
taps

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
taps

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.399 
taps
you<00:01:49.310> can<00:01:49.490> tap<00:01:49.700> into<00:01:50.120> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.859

I'm not an engineer so but it took me no

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.319 
I'm not an engineer so but it took me no
time<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.789> this<00:02:01.520> then<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.640> at<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.759> front<00:02:03.060> we

time to do this then up at the front we

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.469 
time to do this then up at the front we

with<00:02:11.400> our<00:02:11.549> own<00:02:11.670> brackets<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:13.099> replace<00:02:14.099> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
with our own brackets that replace the

the bolt that is part of the bike and

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.100 
the bolt that is part of the bike and
then<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.900> run<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:20.090> behind<00:02:21.090> here<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:21.810> I

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
then I just run it up behind here and I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.100 
then I just run it up behind here and I
can<00:02:22.980> show<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.250> there's<00:02:23.580> another<00:02:24.110> controller

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
can show you there's another controller

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.130 
can show you there's another controller
which<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.440> mounted<00:02:25.799> down<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.160> there<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:27.140> you

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
which I mounted down in there and you

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.410 
which I mounted down in there and you
need<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.739> controller<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.519> get<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.849> the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
need the controller to get the the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.259 
need the controller to get the the
flicker<00:02:30.840> effect<00:02:31.730> that's<00:02:32.730> am<00:02:32.910> let's<00:02:33.120> go<00:02:33.209> ahead

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
flicker effect that's am let's go ahead

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.920 
flicker effect that's am let's go ahead
and<00:02:33.450> turn<00:02:33.569> on<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.810> bike<00:02:34.160> or<00:02:35.160> just<00:02:35.370> turn<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
and turn on the bike or just turn on the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.069 
and turn on the bike or just turn on the
power<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.110> any<00:02:37.170> case<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:42.299> again<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.780> flicker

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
power in any case so again this flicker

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.349 
power in any case so again this flicker
effect<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.739> is<00:02:44.220> exaggerated<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.090> video

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
effect is is exaggerated in the video

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.190 
effect is is exaggerated in the video
but<00:02:45.750> you'll<00:02:46.079> will<00:02:46.590> get<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.859> sense<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.220> it

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
but you'll will get the sense of it

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.170 
but you'll will get the sense of it
looks<00:02:49.200> like

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.490 

they're<00:02:52.780> very<00:02:53.049> bright<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:56.200> combination

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
they're very bright and in combination

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.580 
they're very bright and in combination
with<00:02:56.830> all<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.159> other<00:02:58.140> lights<00:02:59.140> in<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.379> front

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
with all the other lights in the front

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.210 
with all the other lights in the front
of<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.709> CBR<00:03:00.010> they<00:03:00.250> work<00:03:00.400> really<00:03:00.610> well<00:03:05.069> we<00:03:06.069> go

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
of the CBR they work really well we go

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.470 
of the CBR they work really well we go
to<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.400> rear<00:03:06.610> again<00:03:11.579> me<00:03:12.579> looking<00:03:12.940> at<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.180> you

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
to the rear again me looking at it you

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.270 
to the rear again me looking at it you
can<00:03:13.629> barely<00:03:13.870> perceive<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.470> flicker<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:15.129> it's

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
can barely perceive the flicker but it's

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.990 
can barely perceive the flicker but it's
exaggerated<00:03:15.879> very<00:03:16.629> bright<00:03:16.959> I<00:03:17.610> wanna<00:03:18.610> see<00:03:18.790> if<00:03:18.909> I

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
exaggerated very bright I wanna see if I

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.759 
exaggerated very bright I wanna see if I
can<00:03:19.150> get<00:03:19.329> show<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.870> how<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.110> break<00:03:20.379> pattern

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
can get show you how the break pattern

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:27.479 
can get show you how the break pattern
works<00:03:22.500> with<00:03:24.420> one<00:03:25.420> hand<00:03:25.810> hold<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.829> iPad<00:03:27.099> over

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
works with one hand hold the iPad over

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.020 
works with one hand hold the iPad over
here<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:29.049> try<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.010> press<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.430> brake<00:03:30.609> pad<00:03:30.819> and

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
here and try and press the brake pad and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.020 
here and try and press the brake pad and
you'll<00:03:31.120> see<00:03:31.359> I<00:03:34.859> reach<00:03:35.859> it<00:03:36.099> unfortunately<00:03:36.760> but

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
you'll see I reach it unfortunately but

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.800 
you'll see I reach it unfortunately but
it's<00:03:37.450> got<00:03:37.599> a<00:03:37.629> flash<00:03:37.930> pattern<00:03:39.299> that<00:03:40.299> flashes

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
it's got a flash pattern that flashes

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.199 
it's got a flash pattern that flashes
four<00:03:41.109> times<00:03:41.319> rapidly<00:03:41.620> four<00:03:42.220> times<00:03:42.430> slowly<00:03:42.819> and

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
four times rapidly four times slowly and

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.210 
four times rapidly four times slowly and
then<00:03:43.659> comes<00:03:43.900> unsalted<00:03:44.379> and<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:44.890> can<00:03:45.069> change

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
then comes unsalted and you can change

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.589 
then comes unsalted and you can change
that<00:03:45.340> that's<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.849> default<00:03:46.000> setting<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:49.420> nice

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
that that's the default setting the nice

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.319 
that that's the default setting the nice
thing<00:03:49.930> about<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.579> p3s<00:03:51.579> is<00:03:51.819> that<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.060> can<00:03:52.180> also

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
thing about the p3s is that you can also

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.009 
thing about the p3s is that you can also
use<00:03:52.930> them<00:03:53.349> as<00:03:53.440> hazards<00:03:54.690> I'll<00:03:55.690> show<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:55.930> how

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
use them as hazards I'll show you how

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.500 
use them as hazards I'll show you how
that<00:03:56.049> works

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
that works

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.430 
that works
so<00:03:58.510> if<00:03:58.599> you<00:03:58.660> turn<00:03:58.870> on<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.079> power<00:04:01.019> like<00:04:02.019> seven

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
so if you turn on the power like seven

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.870 
so if you turn on the power like seven
times<00:04:04.109> you'll<00:04:05.109> get

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.920 

typical<00:04:09.650> Hazzard<00:04:10.650> pattern<00:04:11.540> they<00:04:12.540> might<00:04:12.780> see

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
typical Hazzard pattern they might see

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.020 
typical Hazzard pattern they might see
on<00:04:13.020> a<00:04:13.050> car<00:04:13.319> or<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.709> bike<00:04:13.890> with<00:04:14.700> there<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:14.880> couple

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
on a car or a bike with there a couple

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:29.560 
on a car or a bike with there a couple
of<00:04:15.270> other<00:04:15.690> options

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.420 

like<00:04:30.570> eight<00:04:30.750> times<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:32.370> get<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.730> rapid<00:04:33.600> flash

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
like eight times you get the rapid flash

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.950 
like eight times you get the rapid flash
which<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.640> suspect<00:04:36.060> might<00:04:36.420> get<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:36.780> into

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
which I suspect might get you into

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.190 
which I suspect might get you into
trouble<00:04:37.080> with<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:38.720> authorities<00:04:39.720> if<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:40.050> use

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
trouble with the authorities if you use

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.220 
trouble with the authorities if you use
that<00:04:40.440> because<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:40.830> kind<00:04:40.920> of<00:04:41.040> looks<00:04:41.190> like<00:04:42.230> an

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
that because it kind of looks like an

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.680 
that because it kind of looks like an
emergency<00:04:43.770> vehicle

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.520 

and<00:04:47.780> then<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.620> last<00:04:48.860> one<00:04:49.930> with<00:04:50.930> nine<00:04:51.170> clicks

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
and then the last one with nine clicks

00:04:51.530 --> 00:05:08.770 
and then the last one with nine clicks
is<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:53.830> flash<00:05:06.310> there's<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.400> clock<00:05:07.610> flash<00:05:07.910> and

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
is a flash there's the clock flash and

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.270 
is a flash there's the clock flash and
you<00:05:09.170> know<00:05:09.260> trying<00:05:09.590> this<00:05:09.740> too<00:05:09.890> in<00:05:10.010> a<00:05:10.070> fairly

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
you know trying this too in a fairly

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.860 
you know trying this too in a fairly
bright<00:05:10.550> day<00:05:10.760> here<00:05:10.970> so<00:05:11.120> you<00:05:11.210> can<00:05:11.330> imagine<00:05:11.510> how

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
bright day here so you can imagine how

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.070 
bright day here so you can imagine how
bright<00:05:12.800> this<00:05:12.950> is<00:05:13.010> gonna<00:05:13.280> be<00:05:13.460> at<00:05:13.550> night<00:05:14.080> the

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
bright this is gonna be at night the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.870 
bright this is gonna be at night the
last<00:05:15.320> thing<00:05:15.530> you<00:05:15.680> can<00:05:15.890> do<00:05:16.070> you<00:05:16.340> can<00:05:16.490> change

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
last thing you can do you can change

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.400 
last thing you can do you can change
some<00:05:17.060> default<00:05:17.420> settings<00:05:17.810> change<00:05:18.140> some<00:05:18.290> other

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
some default settings change some other

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.170 
some default settings change some other
settings<00:05:18.800> but<00:05:18.920> one<00:05:19.400> nice<00:05:19.580> thing<00:05:19.610> is<00:05:19.880> if<00:05:20.030> you're

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
settings but one nice thing is if you're

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.640 
settings but one nice thing is if you're
ever<00:05:20.270> caught<00:05:20.510> out<00:05:20.690> in<00:05:20.810> fog<00:05:21.050> or<00:05:21.260> anything<00:05:21.410> like

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
ever caught out in fog or anything like

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.800 
ever caught out in fog or anything like
that<00:05:21.710> you<00:05:22.610> can<00:05:22.760> actually<00:05:22.910> set<00:05:23.300> the<00:05:23.330> lights<00:05:23.630> to

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
that you can actually set the lights to

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.140 
that you can actually set the lights to
be<00:05:23.960> on<00:05:23.990> permanent<00:05:24.350> high-intensity<00:05:25.280> sort<00:05:26.090> of

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
be on permanent high-intensity sort of

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.210 
be on permanent high-intensity sort of
like<00:05:26.270> like<00:05:26.810> a<00:05:26.840> fog<00:05:27.080> light<00:05:27.350> and<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:30.010> you<00:05:31.010> have

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
like like a fog light and that you have

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:40.060 
like like a fog light and that you have
to<00:05:31.430> click<00:05:31.790> 12<00:05:32.510> times

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.970 

so<00:05:40.400> I<00:05:40.430> can<00:05:40.760> have<00:05:40.910> a<00:05:40.940> look<00:05:41.150> at<00:05:41.240> that<00:05:44.740> I'm<00:05:45.740> not

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
so I can have a look at that I'm not

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
so I can have a look at that I'm not
sure<00:05:46.190> that<00:05:46.340> I<00:05:46.400> got<00:05:46.670> it<00:05:46.820> there<00:05:48.760> but<00:05:49.760> it's

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
sure that I got it there but it's

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.730 
sure that I got it there but it's
basically<00:05:50.360> just<00:05:50.480> just<00:05:50.960> as<00:05:51.200> I<00:05:51.350> said<00:05:51.410> it's<00:05:51.680> a

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
basically just just as I said it's a

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.690 
basically just just as I said it's a
clock<00:05:51.920> way<00:05:53.110> so<00:05:54.110> that's<00:05:54.230> a<00:05:54.320> quick<00:05:54.500> look<00:05:54.560> at<00:05:55.040> the

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
clock way so that's a quick look at the

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:06.860 
clock way so that's a quick look at the
p3s<00:05:58.700> on<00:05:59.030> the<00:05:59.150> rear

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:15.340 

and<00:06:07.169> the<00:06:10.250> photon<00:06:11.250> blasters<00:06:11.669> at<00:06:11.760> the<00:06:11.820> front<00:06:12.090> a

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.350 

lot
