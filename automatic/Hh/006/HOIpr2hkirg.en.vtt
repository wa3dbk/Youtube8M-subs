about<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.660> root<00:00:46.530> cellar<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.219> will<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.850> cave

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
about a root cellar if you will or cave

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.119 
about a root cellar if you will or cave
where<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> temperature<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.320> always<00:00:49.800> pretty

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
where the temperature is always pretty

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.150 
where the temperature is always pretty
much<00:00:50.340> level<00:00:51.149> are<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> same<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.680> essence

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
much level are the same in essence

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.459 
much level are the same in essence
that's<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.789> does<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.660> allows<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.260> tent

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
that's what this does it allows the tent

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.590 
that's what this does it allows the tent
it<00:00:55.590> allows<00:00:56.309> regulates<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> temperature<00:00:57.000> also

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
it allows regulates the temperature also

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
it allows regulates the temperature also
because<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.739> actually<00:00:58.890> pulling<00:00:59.340> moisture

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
because it's actually pulling moisture

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.150 
because it's actually pulling moisture
in<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.120> pushing<00:01:00.809> moisture<00:01:00.960> back<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.039> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
in and pushing moisture back out so it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
in and pushing moisture back out so it
has<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.370> lot<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> neat<00:01:02.910> properties<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> play

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
has a lot of neat properties of the play

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.740 
has a lot of neat properties of the play
in<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.890> respect<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.850> nice<00:01:06.420> looking

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
in that respect and it's nice looking

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.950 
in that respect and it's nice looking
finish<00:01:06.960> also<00:01:07.790> squit<00:01:08.790> was<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.840> the

product that is the non grain that this

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.380 
product that is the non grain that this
replaces<00:01:16.470> well<00:01:17.009> paint<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.759> instance<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.270> you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
replaces well paint for instance if you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.140 
replaces well paint for instance if you
take<00:01:18.600> any<00:01:19.110> paint<00:01:19.610> basically<00:01:20.610> has<00:01:20.790> what<00:01:21.119> they

novice owners what's VOCs

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.250 
novice owners what's VOCs
why<00:01:32.800> are<00:01:32.860> they<00:01:32.980> harmful<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:34.060> obviously<00:01:35.020> the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
why are they harmful and obviously the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.870 
why are they harmful and obviously the
advantages<00:01:35.800> in<00:01:35.950> fact<00:01:36.190> that<00:01:36.310> these<00:01:36.430> don't<00:01:36.670> have

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
advantages in fact that these don't have

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.180 
advantages in fact that these don't have
your<00:01:37.090> shirt<00:01:37.510> well<00:01:38.200> when<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:38.680> walk<00:01:38.950> in<00:01:39.130> a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
your shirt well when you walk in a

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.620 
your shirt well when you walk in a
freshly<00:01:39.520> painted<00:01:39.700> room<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.180> you<00:01:40.270> have<00:01:40.480> an

odor<00:01:41.290> if<00:01:41.680> you<00:01:41.920> will<00:01:42.070> that's<00:01:42.460> vo<00:01:42.760> see<00:01:43.090> basically

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
odor if you will that's vo see basically

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.140 
odor if you will that's vo see basically
it's<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.900> gas<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.500> what<00:01:45.130> happens<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.670> that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
it's a gas and what happens is that

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.900 
it's a gas and what happens is that
paint<00:01:46.570> dries<00:01:46.870> it<00:01:47.290> off<00:01:47.500> gases<00:01:48.100> another<00:01:48.730> example

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
paint dries it off gases another example

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.910 
paint dries it off gases another example
would<00:01:49.240> be<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.540> new<00:01:50.050> carpet<00:01:50.530> if<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:50.770> will

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
would be a new carpet if you will

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.150 
would be a new carpet if you will
sometimes<00:01:51.550> that<00:01:52.240> carpet<00:01:52.840> you'll<00:01:53.140> had<00:01:54.130> a

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
sometimes that carpet you'll had a

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.550 
sometimes that carpet you'll had a
strong<00:01:54.490> odor<00:01:54.790> it's<00:01:55.330> off<00:01:55.600> gassing<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.140> those

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
strong odor it's off gassing and those

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.860 
strong odor it's off gassing and those
are<00:01:56.770> valter<00:01:57.160> organic<00:01:57.730> compounds<00:01:58.360> basically

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
are valter organic compounds basically

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.080 
are valter organic compounds basically
not<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.800> healthiest<00:02:00.220> thing<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.820> cement

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
not the healthiest thing to cement

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.970 
not the healthiest thing to cement
Mexican<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.720> what's<00:02:01.930> what's<00:02:02.230> in<00:02:02.410> those<00:02:02.590> that

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
Mexican is what's what's in those that

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.520 
Mexican is what's what's in those that
makes<00:02:03.220> them<00:02:03.370> unhealthy<00:02:03.940> well<00:02:04.570> normal<00:02:05.410> it's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
makes them unhealthy well normal it's

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.250 
makes them unhealthy well normal it's
it's<00:02:05.770> unknown<00:02:06.580> organic<00:02:07.330> stuff<00:02:07.570> basically<00:02:07.869> so

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
it's unknown organic stuff basically so

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.100 
it's unknown organic stuff basically so
it<00:02:08.350> may<00:02:08.470> be<00:02:08.500> petroleum-based<00:02:09.570> things<00:02:10.570> that

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
it may be petroleum-based things that

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.140 
it may be petroleum-based things that
they<00:02:11.260> put<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.680> there<00:02:11.890> into<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.550> end<00:02:13.030> of

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
they put in there into in the end of

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.880 
they put in there into in the end of
paint<00:02:13.390> if<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:13.690> will<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.080> make<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.320> dry<00:02:14.560> quicker

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
paint if you will to make it dry quicker

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.620 
paint if you will to make it dry quicker
so<00:02:15.550> it's<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.820> chemical<00:02:16.030> base<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.630> paint's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
so it's a chemical base that the paint's

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.760 
so it's a chemical base that the paint's
other<00:02:20.440> products<00:02:21.250> have<00:02:22.140> well<00:02:23.140> if<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.320> fixin<00:02:23.709> to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
other products have well if I fixin to

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.390 
other products have well if I fixin to
build<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.100> new<00:02:24.130> home

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
build a new home

build a new home
I'm<00:02:25.459> thinking<00:02:25.790> about<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.150> process<00:02:26.769> how<00:02:27.769> do<00:02:27.829> I

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
I'm thinking about this process how do I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.369 
I'm thinking about this process how do I
get<00:02:28.010> started<00:02:28.689> they<00:02:29.689> can<00:02:29.870> do<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:30.049> two<00:02:30.170> ways<00:02:30.200> I

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
get started they can do it two ways I

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.649 
get started they can do it two ways I
mean<00:02:30.829> we<00:02:30.950> have<00:02:31.129> we<00:02:31.459> do<00:02:31.640> application<00:02:32.239> ourselves

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
mean we have we do application ourselves

bit<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:07.069> those<00:03:07.220> sure<00:03:07.670> but<00:03:08.000> good<00:03:08.269> you<00:03:08.510> bet<00:03:08.980> this

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
bit of those sure but good you bet this

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.559 
bit of those sure but good you bet this
is<00:03:10.189> what<00:03:10.489> we<00:03:10.609> would<00:03:10.790> consider<00:03:10.909> to<00:03:11.359> be<00:03:11.480> an

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
is what we would consider to be an

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.509 
is what we would consider to be an
antique<00:03:11.959> finish<00:03:12.200> if<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.530> will<00:03:12.799> basically<00:03:13.310> it

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
antique finish if you will basically it

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.879 
antique finish if you will basically it
has<00:03:13.700> two<00:03:14.480> different<00:03:14.629> colors<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.409> base<00:03:15.590> coat

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
has two different colors the base coat

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.440 
has two different colors the base coat
is<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.310> coat<00:03:16.519> process<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.180> you're<00:03:17.299> going<00:03:17.389> to

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
is a to coat process so you're going to

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.319 
is a to coat process so you're going to
have<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.599> base<00:03:17.810> coat<00:03:18.079> in<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.709> top<00:03:18.920> coat<00:03:19.189> the<00:03:20.150> base

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
have a base coat in a top coat the base

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.970 
have a base coat in a top coat the base
coat<00:03:20.599> would<00:03:20.750> be<00:03:20.900> one<00:03:21.109> particular<00:03:21.260> color<00:03:21.739> then

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
coat would be one particular color then

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.710 
coat would be one particular color then
that<00:03:22.430> would<00:03:22.609> dry<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:22.849> would<00:03:23.090> come<00:03:23.269> over<00:03:23.299> with

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
that would dry you would come over with

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.780 
that would dry you would come over with
a<00:03:23.750> top<00:03:24.049> coat<00:03:24.079> this<00:03:24.889> one<00:03:25.129> we've<00:03:25.310> left<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.639> little

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
a top coat this one we've left a little

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.240 
a top coat this one we've left a little
bit<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.269> should<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.379> base<00:03:27.530> coat<00:03:27.799> showing

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
bit of it should the base coat showing

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.490 
bit of it should the base coat showing
so<00:03:28.879> then<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.269> get<00:03:29.419> kind<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.750> an<00:03:29.840> antiquey<00:03:30.379> or

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
so then you get kind of an antiquey or

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.280 
so then you get kind of an antiquey or
an<00:03:30.620> old-type<00:03:31.129> finish<00:03:31.519> other<00:03:32.510> finishes<00:03:32.989> you

you guys are not doing tile these are
just<00:03:43.940> sampled<00:03:44.599> walking<00:03:45.049> that's<00:03:45.260> right<00:03:45.470> these

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
just sampled walking that's right these

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.589 
just sampled walking that's right these
are<00:03:45.739> actual<00:03:46.430> samples<00:03:46.909> but<00:03:47.000> we're<00:03:47.180> talking<00:03:47.329> the

are actual samples but we're talking the
whole<00:03:47.750> wall<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.379> of<00:03:48.530> course<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.889> would<00:03:49.010> be

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
whole wall and of course it would be

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.800 
whole wall and of course it would be
trialed<00:03:49.549> onto<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.849> wall<00:03:50.030> this<00:03:50.569> particular

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810

product is called maritimo we have 33

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.599 
product is called maritimo we have 33
actually<00:03:54.500> different<00:03:54.799> products<00:03:55.069> they<00:03:55.159> the

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
actually different products they the

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.819 
actually different products they the
same<00:03:55.790> kind<00:03:56.030> of<00:03:56.060> clay<00:03:56.359> one<00:03:57.139> has<00:03:57.409> it's<00:03:57.620> just<00:03:57.769> a

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
same kind of clay one has it's just a

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.289 
same kind of clay one has it's just a
different<00:03:58.010> aggregate<00:03:58.519> this<00:03:58.699> has<00:03:58.879> seashell

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
different aggregate this has seashell

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.580 
different aggregate this has seashell
aggregate<00:03:59.780> which<00:04:00.079> is<00:04:00.229> kind<00:04:00.409> of<00:04:00.470> interesting

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
aggregate which is kind of interesting

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.229 
aggregate which is kind of interesting
makes<00:04:01.129> it<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.310> little<00:04:01.519> harder<00:04:01.940> quite<00:04:02.209> frankly

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
makes it a little harder quite frankly

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.599 
makes it a little harder quite frankly
but<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.780> good<00:04:02.989> good<00:04:03.229> product<00:04:03.590> but<00:04:03.769> again<00:04:04.190> the

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
but a good good product but again the

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.939 
but a good good product but again the
finish<00:04:05.000> that<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:05.209> get<00:04:05.510> is<00:04:05.720> simply<00:04:06.319> how<00:04:06.889> you

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:06.949 
finish that you get is simply how you

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.740 
finish that you get is simply how you
work<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.340> plaster<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.150> finish

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
work the plaster and the finish

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.890 
work the plaster and the finish
and<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.410> color<00:04:09.680> is<00:04:09.920> integral<00:04:10.700> it's<00:04:11.060> basically

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
and the color is integral it's basically

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.460 
and the color is integral it's basically
pure<00:04:12.380> tent<00:04:12.710> that<00:04:13.670> we<00:04:13.820> put<00:04:14.060> in<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.570> plaster<00:04:15.350> as

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
pure tent that we put in the plaster as

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.949 
pure tent that we put in the plaster as
we<00:04:15.650> mix<00:04:15.920> it<00:04:16.100> so<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.880> colors<00:04:17.090> all<00:04:17.450> through<00:04:17.750> the

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
we mix it so the colors all through the

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.180 
we mix it so the colors all through the
platform

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
platform

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.800 
platform
you<00:04:20.760> talk<00:04:20.910> about<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.209> fact<00:04:21.390> that<00:04:21.480> this<00:04:21.630> stuff

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
you talk about the fact that this stuff

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.410 
you talk about the fact that this stuff
is<00:04:21.959> mold<00:04:22.290> resistant<00:04:22.980> and<00:04:23.250> moisture<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.210> Trust

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
is mold resistant and moisture and Trust

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.450 
is mold resistant and moisture and Trust
correct<00:04:24.720> yeah<00:04:25.350> it's<00:04:25.620> more<00:04:25.860> resistant<00:04:26.340> because

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
correct yeah it's more resistant because

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.940 
correct yeah it's more resistant because
the<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.240> plaster<00:04:27.780> actually<00:04:28.050> has<00:04:28.170> borax<00:04:28.500> in<00:04:28.920> it

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
the the plaster actually has borax in it

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.150 
the the plaster actually has borax in it
and<00:04:29.250> that<00:04:29.390> is<00:04:30.390> is<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.990> mole<00:04:31.170> retardant<00:04:31.770> agent

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
and that is is the mole retardant agent

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.610 
and that is is the mole retardant agent
that's<00:04:32.340> in<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.520> it<00:04:32.760> works<00:04:32.940> really<00:04:33.060> well<00:04:33.620> so

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
that's in it it works really well so

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.590 
that's in it it works really well so
that<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.010> that<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.580> know<00:04:35.700> borax<00:04:36.270> has<00:04:36.420> been

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
that and that you know borax has been

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.110 
that and that you know borax has been
used<00:04:36.810> for<00:04:36.960> all<00:04:37.140> kinds<00:04:37.170> of<00:04:37.590> things<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:37.950> was

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
used for all kinds of things it was

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.980 
used for all kinds of things it was
detergent<00:04:39.590> just<00:04:40.590> basically<00:04:41.280> used<00:04:41.670> to<00:04:41.930> as<00:04:42.930> a

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
detergent just basically used to as a

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.260 
detergent just basically used to as a
pesticide<00:04:43.440> if<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.160> will<00:04:44.340> so<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.790> it's<00:04:45.210> a

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
pesticide if you will so and it's a

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.610 
pesticide if you will so and it's a
natural<00:04:45.480> product<00:04:45.930> so<00:04:46.410> it's<00:04:46.620> it's<00:04:46.920> safe<00:04:48.230> as<00:04:49.230> far

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
natural product so it's it's safe as far

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.510 
natural product so it's it's safe as far
as<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:50.870> you're<00:04:51.870> asking<00:04:52.320> about<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:53.220> mole

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
as the you're asking about the mole

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.990 
as the you're asking about the mole
resistance<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.150> then<00:04:54.630> also<00:04:54.780> I'm<00:04:55.620> sorry<00:04:56.000> no

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
resistance and then also I'm sorry no

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.660 
resistance and then also I'm sorry no
resistance<00:04:57.540> II<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:58.020> moisture<00:04:58.740> yeah<00:04:59.220> moisture

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
resistance II and moisture yeah moisture

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.360 
resistance II and moisture yeah moisture
control<00:04:59.910> is<00:05:00.090> done<00:05:00.270> basically<00:05:00.690> because<00:05:01.170> of<00:05:02.100> the

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
control is done basically because of the

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.880 
control is done basically because of the
the<00:05:02.610> clay<00:05:03.180> clay<00:05:03.570> naturally<00:05:04.260> basically<00:05:04.680> has<00:05:04.860> a

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
the clay clay naturally basically has a

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.490 
the clay clay naturally basically has a
negative<00:05:05.190> ionic<00:05:05.700> charge<00:05:06.090> or<00:05:06.870> moisture<00:05:07.320> has<00:05:07.470> a

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
negative ionic charge or moisture has a

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.080 
negative ionic charge or moisture has a
positive<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.190> it's<00:05:08.370> going<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.580> track<00:05:08.910> the

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
positive so it's going to track the

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.300 
positive so it's going to track the
moisture<00:05:09.480> into<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.110> into<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.620> play<00:05:10.890> itself

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
moisture into the into the play itself

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.940 
moisture into the into the play itself
and<00:05:11.670> then<00:05:12.360> as<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.870> temperature<00:05:13.290> changes<00:05:13.740> it

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
and then as the temperature changes it

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.860 
and then as the temperature changes it
will<00:05:14.130> release<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:14.850> back<00:05:15.030> out<00:05:15.300> into<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.600> room

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
will release it back out into the room

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.570 
will release it back out into the room
so<00:05:16.500> that's<00:05:16.740> going<00:05:16.920> to<00:05:16.980> control<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.430> humidity

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
so that's going to control the humidity

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.390 
so that's going to control the humidity
into<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.330> room<00:05:18.540> in<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.110> room<00:05:19.290> itself<00:05:19.650> so<00:05:20.280> when

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
into the room in the room itself so when

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.920 
into the room in the room itself so when
you're<00:05:20.520> trying<00:05:20.670> to<00:05:20.760> close<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.180> sale<00:05:21.420> on<00:05:21.600> this
