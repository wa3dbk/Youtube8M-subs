 with farm fashion hunt well in this fashion 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.670
 you need to hide here among all these 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.699

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.390
 small animal and hide here so I 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.230
 chose a pig 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.350

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.079

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.200
 fearfully 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.180

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.830
 I feel like me now 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.260

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:52.270
 hoping not to check me yet 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.270
 45 seconds I'll drag 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.220
 one of these winnings is somehow strange 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.100
 that I have not checked in this place 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.860
 even very usually all these places 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:11.410
 checked here last time I always 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:11.410
 checked these places for another 25 seconds 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.440
 it is interesting that you yourself live two 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.300
 of animals 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.570
 I, for example, have never had this 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.570
 It was 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:36.740
 okay, we use the last salute 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:39.260
 use it already and that and we won 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.590
 straight tin tin thinkers 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.590

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:54.490
