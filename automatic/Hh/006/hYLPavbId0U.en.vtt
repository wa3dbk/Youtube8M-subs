00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.250 
in high school my friend who is an avid
gardener<00:00:44.809> suggested<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.230> our

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
gardener suggested that we do our

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.860 
gardener suggested that we do our
science<00:00:46.800> fair<00:00:46.860> project<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.700> studying<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
science fair project on studying the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.869 
science fair project on studying the
effects<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.410> different<00:00:49.590> fertilizers<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
effects of different fertilizers on the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.450 
effects of different fertilizers on the
growth<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> vegetables<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.860> arranged<00:00:53.399> for

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
growth of vegetables so we arranged for

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.090 
growth of vegetables so we arranged for
two<00:00:53.730> groups<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.809> had<00:00:55.020> our<00:00:55.350> synthetic

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
two groups we had our synthetic

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.630 
two groups we had our synthetic
fertilizer<00:00:56.820> group<00:00:57.180> which<00:00:58.050> was<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.640> popular

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
fertilizer group which was a popular

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.710 
fertilizer group which was a popular
synthetic<00:01:00.480> fertilizer<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.140> everyone

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
synthetic fertilizer that everyone

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.960 
synthetic fertilizer that everyone
probably<00:01:02.200> no<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.620> then<00:01:03.430> our<00:01:03.550> natural

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
probably no and then our natural

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.790 
probably no and then our natural
fertilizer<00:01:04.420> which<00:01:05.020> is<00:01:05.610> at<00:01:06.610> amador<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.590> we

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
fertilizer which is at amador so we

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.710 
fertilizer which is at amador so we
learn<00:01:09.010> these<00:01:09.370> two<00:01:09.640> groups<00:01:09.820> of<00:01:10.030> rashes<00:01:10.510> and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
learn these two groups of rashes and

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.780 
learn these two groups of rashes and
then<00:01:11.140> we<00:01:11.230> have<00:01:11.410> them<00:01:11.620> sent<00:01:12.220> off<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.760> a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
then we have them sent off to a

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.140 
then we have them sent off to a
laboratory<00:01:13.150> be<00:01:13.660> chemically<00:01:14.050> analyzed<00:01:15.150> what

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
laboratory be chemically analyzed what

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.690 
laboratory be chemically analyzed what
we<00:01:16.270> found<00:01:16.480> was<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.680> radishes<00:01:18.220> that<00:01:18.580> were

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
we found was the radishes that were

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.330 
we found was the radishes that were
grown<00:01:18.970> with<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.510> synthetic<00:01:19.780> fertilizer<00:01:20.530> were

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
grown with the synthetic fertilizer were

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.960 
grown with the synthetic fertilizer were
very<00:01:21.580> lacking<00:01:22.000> in<00:01:22.060> nutrients<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.970> radishes

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
very lacking in nutrients the radishes

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.510 
very lacking in nutrients the radishes
that<00:01:25.270> were<00:01:25.390> wrong<00:01:25.660> with<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.140> cow<00:01:26.650> manure<00:01:26.950> had

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
that were wrong with the cow manure had

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.080 
that were wrong with the cow manure had
lots<00:01:27.730> of<00:01:27.880> nutrients<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:30.130> other<00:01:30.280> kind<00:01:30.940> of

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
lots of nutrients the other kind of

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.180 
lots of nutrients the other kind of
disturbing<00:01:31.540> fact<00:01:31.840> was<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.470> ones<00:01:32.710> grow<00:01:32.920> with<00:01:33.100> a

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
disturbing fact was the ones grow with a

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.700 
disturbing fact was the ones grow with a
synthetic<00:01:33.430> fertilizer<00:01:34.150> had<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.750> lot<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.050> copper

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
synthetic fertilizer had a lot of copper

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.790 
synthetic fertilizer had a lot of copper
in<00:01:35.860> them<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:37.060> levels<00:01:37.450> were<00:01:37.570> very<00:01:37.600> high<00:01:37.900> higher

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
in them the levels were very high higher

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.620 
in them the levels were very high higher
than<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.220> FDA<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:40.090> Food<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.510> Drug

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
than the FDA the Food and Drug

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.980 
than the FDA the Food and Drug
Administration<00:01:40.750> would<00:01:41.740> advise<00:01:42.690> so<00:01:43.690> this

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
Administration would advise so this

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.740 
Administration would advise so this
project<00:01:44.530> made<00:01:44.710> me<00:01:44.860> consider<00:01:45.130> even<00:01:45.880> more<00:01:46.119> what

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
project made me consider even more what

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.950 
project made me consider even more what
I<00:01:46.780> was<00:01:46.960> eating<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.700> following<00:01:49.090> fall<00:01:49.330> my
