actually the Joker and he eventually

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.380 
actually the Joker and he eventually
confronted<00:01:29.460> her<00:01:29.520> trying<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> talk<00:01:30.150> some<00:01:30.329> sense

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390

into<00:01:30.810> her<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.619> she<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.070> fought<00:01:32.250> against<00:01:32.610> him

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
into her but she just fought against him

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.429 
into her but she just fought against him
so<00:01:32.939> he<00:01:33.060> eventually<00:01:33.180> decided<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.079> leave<00:01:34.290> her

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439

with<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> face<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.759> could<00:01:35.909> rot<00:01:36.180> in

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
with the face so that it could rot in
