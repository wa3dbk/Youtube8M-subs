using the full sheets on the sword

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.980 
using the full sheets on the sword
because<00:01:30.000> they<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> way<00:01:30.780> during

because they get in the way during
posing<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> knife<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
posing and if you have the knife or the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.090 
posing and if you have the knife or the
sword<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.689> taken<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.439> doesn't<00:01:34.650> look<00:01:34.920> good

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
sword is taken out it doesn't look good

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.800 
sword is taken out it doesn't look good
to<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> big<00:01:35.790> sheets<00:01:36.119> hanging<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.689> his

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.649 
to have the big sheets hanging on his
back<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.549> that's<00:01:38.549> why<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.509> this

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
back so that's why I do that with this

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.660 
back so that's why I do that with this
type<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.140> sort<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.890> older<00:01:41.159> instead<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
and it doesn't get in the way it all

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.970 
and it doesn't get in the way it all
doesn't<00:03:22.720> stick<00:03:22.900> out<00:03:23.050> too<00:03:23.230> much<00:03:23.410> on<00:03:23.590> his<00:03:23.740> back

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.000 
doesn't stick out too much on his back
just<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.430> little<00:03:24.700> bit<00:03:24.850> of<00:03:24.970> course<00:03:25.210> it<00:03:25.360> has<00:03:25.510> to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
just a little bit of course it has to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.580 
just a little bit of course it has to
but<00:03:27.010> um<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:28.000> there<00:03:28.240> you<00:03:28.720> can<00:03:28.840> still<00:03:29.080> use<00:03:29.320> the

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
but um it is there you can still use the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.620 
but um it is there you can still use the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.440 
flight stand hole in his back and the
swords<00:03:32.020> obviously<00:03:32.730> there's<00:03:33.730> nothing<00:03:34.120> left<00:03:34.300> to

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
swords obviously there's nothing left to

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.150 
swords obviously there's nothing left to
be<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.810> way<00:03:34.960> after<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.530> take<00:03:35.710> the<00:03:35.830> swords

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
be in the way after you take the swords

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.490 
be in the way after you take the swords
out<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:37.270> that's<00:03:37.720> really<00:03:37.900> what<00:03:38.110> I'm<00:03:38.200> going<00:03:38.470> for

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
out so that's really what I'm going for

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.700 
out so that's really what I'm going for
when<00:03:38.800> I<00:03:38.920> designed<00:03:39.280> those<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.380> think<00:03:41.620> it

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
when I designed those and I think it

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.960 
when I designed those and I think it
works<00:03:41.860> out<00:03:42.040> pretty<00:03:42.250> well<00:03:44.670> all<00:03:45.670> the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
works out pretty well all the

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.180 
works out pretty well all the
articulation<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:46.720> left<00:03:46.930> intact<00:03:47.380> aside<00:03:47.920> from

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
articulation is left intact aside from

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.070 
articulation is left intact aside from
the<00:03:48.430> shin<00:03:48.760> swivels<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.510> got<00:03:49.720> rid<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:49.930> those

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
the shin swivels I got rid of those

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.690 
the shin swivels I got rid of those
because<00:03:50.320> they're<00:03:50.620> not<00:03:50.770> necessary<00:03:51.340> it<00:03:51.520> just

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
because they're not necessary it just

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.280 
because they're not necessary it just
makes<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:51.970> harder<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.420> stand<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.930> figure

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
makes it harder to stand the figure

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.650 
makes it harder to stand the figure
stabili<00:03:53.950> so<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:54.700> went<00:03:55.000> ahead<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.300> got<00:03:55.420> rid<00:03:55.630> of

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
stabili so I went ahead and got rid of

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.430 
stabili so I went ahead and got rid of
that<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:56.340> trim<00:03:57.340> out<00:03:57.490> the<00:03:57.780> trigger<00:03:58.780> hole<00:03:59.110> the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
that I trim out the trigger hole the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.190 
that I trim out the trigger hole the
trigger<00:03:59.650> guards<00:04:00.520> for<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.360> rifle<00:04:01.780> so<00:04:02.050> that

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
trigger guards for the rifle so that

brushing<00:04:58.289> it's<00:04:58.440> something<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.889> little

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
brushing it's something a little

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.089 
brushing it's something a little
different<00:04:59.520> thing<00:04:59.910> I<00:05:00.060> do<00:05:00.120> for<00:05:01.099> simulated

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
different thing I do for simulated

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.010 
different thing I do for simulated
leather<00:05:02.280> for<00:05:02.789> the<00:05:02.910> brown<00:05:03.090> straps<00:05:03.570> at<00:05:03.780> semi

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
leather for the brown straps at semi

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.020 
leather for the brown straps at semi
glossy<00:05:04.620> so<00:05:04.830> it<00:05:04.949> kind<00:05:05.190> of<00:05:05.250> resembles<00:05:05.520> leather

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
glossy so it kind of resembles leather

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.400 
glossy so it kind of resembles leather
there<00:05:06.389> and<00:05:07.400> no<00:05:08.400> fur<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:08.820> seams<00:05:09.120> it's<00:05:09.570> also<00:05:09.780> the

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
there and no fur the seams it's also the

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.170 
there and no fur the seams it's also the
same<00:05:10.650> as<00:05:10.770> I've<00:05:10.889> done<00:05:11.039> for<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.430> past<00:05:11.639> Deadpool

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
same as I've done for the past Deadpool

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.830 
same as I've done for the past Deadpool
figures<00:05:12.570> it's<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.849> wire<00:05:14.849> insulation<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:15.750> I

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
figures it's the wire insulation that I

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.110 
figures it's the wire insulation that I
stripped<00:05:16.169> off<00:05:16.320> of<00:05:16.349> the<00:05:16.620> wire<00:05:16.800> using<00:05:17.370> my<00:05:17.580> exacto

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
stripped off of the wire using my exacto

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.649 
stripped off of the wire using my exacto
knife<00:05:18.409> so<00:05:19.460> that<00:05:20.460> creates<00:05:20.849> a<00:05:20.940> real<00:05:21.090> nice<00:05:21.300> effect

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
knife so that creates a real nice effect

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.029 
knife so that creates a real nice effect
I<00:05:21.780> think<00:05:21.810> instead<00:05:22.229> of<00:05:22.289> just<00:05:22.440> drawing<00:05:22.680> or

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
I think instead of just drawing or

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.370 
I think instead of just drawing or
painting<00:05:23.460> lines<00:05:23.820> on<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.270> figure<00:05:24.630> I'd<00:05:25.169> rather

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
painting lines on the figure I'd rather

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.290 
painting lines on the figure I'd rather
skull<00:05:25.860> have<00:05:26.069> them<00:05:26.220> sculpted<00:05:26.639> on<00:05:26.759> there<00:05:27.060> so

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
skull have them sculpted on there so

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.969 
skull have them sculpted on there so
that<00:05:27.330> you<00:05:27.539> have<00:05:27.690> some<00:05:27.870> more<00:05:28.080> texture<00:05:28.470> and<00:05:28.860> it

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
that you have some more texture and it

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.589 
that you have some more texture and it
looks<00:05:29.310> more<00:05:29.430> realistic<00:05:29.729> that<00:05:30.150> way<00:05:30.330> too

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
looks more realistic that way too

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.270 
looks more realistic that way too
so<00:05:31.560> that<00:05:32.370> is<00:05:32.699> the<00:05:33.120> new<00:05:33.650> armory<00:05:34.650> Deadpool

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280
