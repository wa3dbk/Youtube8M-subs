00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.890
 Hello everyone 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.060
 you have finished the qualifications that 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.010
 you need to know if your 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.620
 engine is in good condition for you 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.180
 allow to win your competition there 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.490
 are some essential points to 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.130
 monitor with the engine to be sure 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.810
 that reliability will be ac so bad once 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.970
 that the engine is obviously dismounted 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.160
 clean the first thing to do 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.400
 is checked the engine compression 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.470
 ie if the piston and the sindh 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.190
 are tight enough to give 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.739
 optimum performance a pretty system 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.050
 simple you catch the engine by the 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.510
 crankshaft and you check it 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.670
 support his own weight from it's 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.579
 a first element already which means that 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.199
 the engine is in good condition 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.809
 second thing we look through the light 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.420
 exhaust is checked that the piston 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.969
 be well lubricated it means that the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.739
 carburation and just you want to go 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.629
 a little further and be sure of all that 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.750
 the first thing to check 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.750
 the state of its candle it serves the candle 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.730
 and we look at how this one has 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.530
 worked the spiral must be 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:24.560
 absolutely center is as well as the aspect 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.360
 platinum shining candle like that 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.420
 is in good condition 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.490
 last element in 4 2 strong long 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.410
 feedback checked the game of its packaging 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.010
 for these it's very simple you 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:45.040
 keep the piston or put the piston in 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.040
 high position disassemble you 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.149
 the crankcase cap 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.600
 so we can also check that the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.799
 engine did not swallow dust 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.200
 up to dust in a first 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.200
 time is lodged in the bottom of the crankcase 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.930
 tomorrow the piston in high position 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.960
 turn on we go out and we look at 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.640
 interior 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.080
 the engine is well lubricated we can see 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.040
 a layer of oil on the cap of 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.790
 carburizing case and just if you 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.620
 see dirt or pigments 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.270
 especially of dust it is in this 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.860
 case there preferable profit to proceed 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.470
 to complete disassembly so as not to 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.610
 damage the engine 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.350
 last item we gently turn the 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.420
 crankshaft in the bearings on 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.190
 check that there is no size that 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.230
 means that the bearings are in good 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.959
 state then we check the game of the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.590
 connecting rod by slightly raising the 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.010
 piston and turning it 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.010
 slightly 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.370
 I see that there is no game the engine 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.680
 is in good condition 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.040
 it can be traced back you can go 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.040
 win your
