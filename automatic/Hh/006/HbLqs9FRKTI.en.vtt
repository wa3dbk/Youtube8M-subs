upon<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.019> make<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.170> boots<00:02:41.349> I've<00:02:41.560> come<00:02:41.739> up<00:02:41.889> with

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
upon to make the boots I've come up with

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.470 
upon to make the boots I've come up with
a<00:02:42.219> very<00:02:42.430> nice<00:02:42.519> alternative<00:02:42.670> it's<00:02:43.180> not<00:02:43.359> the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
a very nice alternative it's not the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.729 
a very nice alternative it's not the
best<00:02:43.599> for<00:02:43.689> playability<00:02:43.989> purposes<00:02:44.469> but<00:02:44.620> you'll

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
best for playability purposes but you'll

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.890 
best for playability purposes but you'll
need<00:02:44.859> these<00:02:44.980> two<00:02:45.189> little<00:02:45.579> round<00:02:45.639> squares<00:02:45.939> and

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
need these two little round squares and

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.449 
need these two little round squares and
Andy's<00:02:47.260> will<00:02:47.470> act<00:02:47.590> as<00:02:47.739> your<00:02:47.769> boots<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.220> you

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
Andy's will act as your boots so you

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.020 
Andy's will act as your boots so you
know<00:02:48.669> this<00:02:50.280> man<00:02:51.280> well<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.609> have<00:02:51.790> your<00:02:51.879> round

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
know this man well you have your round

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.360 
know this man well you have your round
boots<00:02:52.180> already<00:02:52.720> done<00:02:52.889> so<00:02:53.889> I<00:02:53.919> think<00:02:54.189> that's<00:02:54.310> a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
boots already done so I think that's a

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.009 
boots already done so I think that's a
little<00:02:54.430> extra<00:02:55.269> feature<00:02:55.389> there<00:02:55.569> we<00:02:55.870> probably

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
little extra feature there we probably

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.899 
little extra feature there we probably
took<00:02:56.290> anything<00:02:56.500> off<00:02:56.680> those<00:02:57.310> studs<00:02:57.700> obvious

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
took anything off those studs obvious

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.159 
took anything off those studs obvious
don't<00:02:57.969> come<00:02:58.120> with<00:02:58.239> him<00:02:58.359> but<00:02:58.510> anyway<00:02:59.019> some<00:02:59.139> a
