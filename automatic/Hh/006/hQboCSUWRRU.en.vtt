you<00:02:31.769> guys<00:02:31.980> as<00:02:32.190> well<00:02:32.690> we've<00:02:33.690> got<00:02:34.010> mellow<00:02:35.010> yellow

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489

you guys as well we've got mellow yellow
which<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.780> very<00:02:37.650> similar<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.099> Mountain<00:02:38.580> Dew<00:02:38.730> I

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940

think<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.510> made<00:02:39.840> by<00:02:40.050> coca-cola<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.300> this

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
think this is made by coca-cola and this

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.140 
think this is made by coca-cola and this
is<00:02:42.420> just<00:02:42.569> their<00:02:42.690> version<00:02:43.080> about<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.500> do<00:02:43.620> so
