two<00:00:26.430> different<00:00:26.730> camera<00:00:27.029> angles<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:28.410> we

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
two different camera angles because we

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.759 
two different camera angles because we
realized<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:30.080> angle<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> dangle<00:00:31.619> is

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
realized that the angle the dangle is

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.130 
realized that the angle the dangle is
equally<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.520> proportion<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.750> heat<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> the

equally in proportion to the heat of the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.760 
equally in proportion to the heat of the
meat<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:35.480> we're<00:00:36.480> giving<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.840> some<00:00:37.079> different

meat so we're giving you some different
angles<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> look<00:00:38.280> at<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.210> giving<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.690> some

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
angles to look at and giving you some

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.290 
angles to look at and giving you some
different<00:00:40.230> points<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> view<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
different points of view for you to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.959 
different points of view for you to
check<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.719> how<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> pull<00:00:43.850> obviously<00:00:44.850> we're

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
check out how to pull obviously we're

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.000 
check out how to pull obviously we're
both<00:00:45.149> doing<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.510> sumo<00:00:45.809> deadlift<00:00:46.379> we're<00:00:46.800> both

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
both doing a sumo deadlift we're both

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.090 
both doing a sumo deadlift we're both
trying<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.969> back<00:00:48.210> flat<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.770> shin

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
trying to get the back flat and the shin

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.299 
trying to get the back flat and the shin
vertical<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:51.230> not<00:00:52.230> put<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.530> shin<00:00:53.010> creep

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
vertical I not put that shin creep

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.180 
vertical I not put that shin creep
forward<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> knee<00:00:54.300> creep<00:00:54.629> forward<00:00:55.190> at

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
forward with that knee creep forward at

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.979 
forward with that knee creep forward at
the<00:00:56.309> bottom<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> lift<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> loss<00:00:57.809> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the bottom of the lift you see a loss of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.110 
the bottom of the lift you see a loss of
position<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> knee<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.820> kind<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
position in the knee and it kind of

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.819 
position in the knee and it kind of
usually<00:01:00.420> trickles<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> rest<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.649> body

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
usually trickles up the rest of the body

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.010 
usually trickles up the rest of the body
knee<00:01:02.640> hip<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.350> lower<00:01:04.830> back<00:01:06.020> also

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
knee hip and then lower back also

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.170 
knee hip and then lower back also
sometimes<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.560> see<00:01:07.770> Lawson<00:01:08.610> position<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
sometimes you see Lawson position in the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.719 
sometimes you see Lawson position in the
cankle<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.439> might<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> little

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
cankle so you might have to do a little

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.929 
cankle so you might have to do a little
bit<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.970> Kenko<00:01:12.390> mobility<00:01:13.490> before<00:01:14.490> before<00:01:14.729> you

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
bit of Kenko mobility before before you

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.399 
bit of Kenko mobility before before you
hit<00:01:15.119> some<00:01:15.330> deadlifts<00:01:15.720> especially<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
hit some deadlifts especially in a

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.890 
hit some deadlifts especially in a
conventional<00:01:16.740> deadlift<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.840> here's<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
conventional deadlift if you here's a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.980 
conventional deadlift if you here's a
good<00:01:19.080> angle<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.060> my<00:01:21.240> back<00:01:21.720> fat

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
good angle here so you get my back fat

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.760 
good angle here so you get my back fat
getting<00:01:22.710> nice<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:22.890> flat<00:01:24.500> what<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.619> think

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
getting nice and flat what do you think

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.410 
getting nice and flat what do you think
about<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.509> but<00:01:27.509> um<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> ankle<00:01:29.670> if

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
about that but um it with the ankle if

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.609 
about that but um it with the ankle if
you<00:01:30.570> work<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.229> bit<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.439> ankle

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you work on a little bit of ankle

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.560 
you work on a little bit of ankle
mobility<00:01:32.030> before<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.210> conventional

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
mobility before you do conventional

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.780 
mobility before you do conventional
poles<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.200> even<00:01:34.439> sumo<00:01:34.770> poles<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.250> more<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.670> in

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
poles or even sumo poles but more so in

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
poles or even sumo poles but more so in
a<00:01:35.880> conventional<00:01:36.180> you'll<00:01:37.140> notice<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.590> huge

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
a conventional you'll notice a huge

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
a conventional you'll notice a huge
difference<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.610> being<00:01:38.759> able<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
difference in being able to get to the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.920 
difference in being able to get to the
bar<00:01:39.740> in<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.860> much<00:01:41.040> better<00:01:41.070> position<00:01:41.930> because

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
bar in a much better position because

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.929 
bar in a much better position because
again<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.409> kind<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.740> works<00:01:44.159> upstream<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
again it kind of works upstream and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.219 
again it kind of works upstream and
downstream<00:01:45.409> from<00:01:46.409> where<00:01:46.890> your<00:01:47.070> tight<00:01:48.229> pretty

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
downstream from where your tight pretty

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.870 
downstream from where your tight pretty
good<00:01:49.350> formed<00:01:49.710> by<00:01:49.799> my<00:01:49.979> fat<00:01:50.189> little<00:01:50.369> self<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
good formed by my fat little self and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.069 
good formed by my fat little self and
you<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.090> see<00:01:51.270> how<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.720> trying<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you can see how I'm really trying to

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.410 
you can see how I'm really trying to
pull<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.619> weight<00:01:52.829> rather<00:01:53.490> than<00:01:53.729> yank<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.240> way

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
pull the weight rather than yank the way

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.590 
pull the weight rather than yank the way
you<00:01:54.750> watch<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> taco<00:01:55.259> truck<00:01:55.619> go<00:01:56.360> he's<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you watch the taco truck go he's like a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.020 
you watch the taco truck go he's like a
big<00:01:57.840> giant<00:01:58.110> retard<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.920> he<00:01:59.310> tries<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.610> yank
