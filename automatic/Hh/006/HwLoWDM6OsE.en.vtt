00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.230
 the meeting because it does not really reflect what we saw in the field 

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:08.190
 have made a purchase Lyonnaise Malian listen I do not know if Lyon is at 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.930
 the image of the show's league proposed for several weeks but 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:12.919
 very frankly 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.029
 meeting today for me it's just reward for mediocrity 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.570
 in two weeks I saw a team of lyon only zero 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.439
 No one against Paris and Nimes 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.769
 in a world 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.810
 dominated microfis dominated by montpellier 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.810
 the match statistics of the game 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.750
 of tonight the lion it's this desolate second what they do 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.000
 pending the number of successful passes the number of shots at the way 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.990
 which you control the game they are dominated that I am me I remember 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.290
 do not leave either ten years ago that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.120
 philippe lions dominated this controlled match 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.880
 there they come with a midfielder without creator 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.190
 they come undergoing the whole meeting that at the end we tear them off the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.040
 victory in the playoffs how chris and lovren do not go yet the 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.040
 Nazis but I have the impression that we left to hang an hour to say how 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.890
 lyon does with a defense as bad as how lyon we do with a game too 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.600
 poor how they did for 34 points in two years two weeks in 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.820
 playing too badly and also going to stop us all week they are 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.550
 third the others the authorities she would collect 3 0 lets come back 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.330
 up to our expectations the adverse effects of a lotto Saturday 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.670
 ing have no explanation it's hard to talk about it I agree 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.560
 with your statement is subordinate conceive and realize a second 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.280
 miracle further reduce to win like that as you say if five times leader 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.620
 this year already 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.030
 they are there they do not let go the first places 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.920
 when you see you go win as they won tonight ok it's sad that 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.200
 it's sad the league and I admire 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.170
 tradingsat com - the euro but the first place frankly for the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.240
 football is terrible this help to the horn 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.300
 pure coincidence 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.360
 so I grew up 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.799
 and that's because in reality on August 7th at the cinema 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.840
 she watched the game go home 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.689
 no no no no I do not know why but you can not 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.200
 you can not it's 1% to 41 10 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.340
 you start in lisbon have been seized 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.290
 at the 30th and in a sleep time 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.239
 at half time on coffee background 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.029
 at 60 and 16 hours north of Seychelles a great calamity league 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.109
 1 it's a different environment of peace are the first victims 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.370
 when but to an agreement in copenhagen 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.409
 from then on the team above all flat it still recognizes a sign of 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.260
 great innovative quality in the main courtyard and I just watched a 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.940
 program with the focus on fraud the most active guy in monaco a 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.020
 thing that's what's called that of the tumble the guy who spend themselves 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.939
 the fairest but it's the demand the mexico is the most 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.499
 it's guy lacombe 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.749
 I can only wonder the technique is already complete god thank you this is 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:45.049
 guy lacombe very current but it's not my friends it's crazy still not 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.469

 the hearings 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.899

 to get a sense of what it meant to send

 framework agreements be optimistic but I tell you when there are signs there are 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.559
 things that are notable 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.829
