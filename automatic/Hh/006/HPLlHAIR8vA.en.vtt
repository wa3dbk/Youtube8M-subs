00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
locked in a vault by himself on the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
locked in a vault by himself on the
Great<00:01:50.430> War<00:01:50.640> began<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.240> he<00:01:51.810> basically<00:01:52.079> started

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
Great War began and he basically started

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.170 
Great War began and he basically started
acting<00:01:52.799> out<00:01:52.890> scenes<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.460> puppets<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.000> stuff

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
acting out scenes with puppets and stuff

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.480 
acting out scenes with puppets and stuff
and<00:01:54.329> then<00:01:54.420> left<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.869> vault<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> was<00:01:56.159> kind<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
and then left the vault so I was kind of

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.190 
and then left the vault so I was kind of
confused<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> was<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.750> why<00:01:57.930> are<00:01:57.990> they

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
confused that I was like why are they

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.660 
confused that I was like why are they
promoting<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.799> puppet<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.280> stuff<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.549> it

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
promoting a puppet and stuff but it

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.889 
promoting a puppet and stuff but it
makes<00:01:59.820> sense<00:01:59.969> they<00:02:00.180> want<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.450> promote<00:02:00.630> this

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
makes sense they want to promote this

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.289 
makes sense they want to promote this
puppet<00:02:01.320> giveaway<00:02:01.649> at<00:02:01.860> their<00:02:02.399> thing<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.060> once

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
puppet giveaway at their thing but once

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.149 
puppet giveaway at their thing but once
again<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.229> connection<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.130> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
again this is a connection to a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.459 
again this is a connection to a
promotion<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:05.880> another<00:02:06.180> future<00:02:06.630> game<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.110> I

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
promotion with another future game and I

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.040 
promotion with another future game and I
wonder<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.160> these<00:02:08.310> slight<00:02:08.849> cameos<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.599> like

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
wonder if these slight cameos are like

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.900 
wonder if these slight cameos are like
our<00:02:10.440> kind<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.800> hinting<00:02:11.129> at<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.310> stuff<00:02:11.730> we'll
