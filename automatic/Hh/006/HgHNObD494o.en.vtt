00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.520 
weekly where we review five applications
in<00:00:08.400> 30<00:00:08.790> seconds<00:00:09.210> each<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.719> these<00:00:10.170> are<00:00:10.230> some<00:00:10.500> of

in 30 seconds each and these are some of
the<00:00:10.650> best<00:00:10.980> applications<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.849> we<00:00:11.969> found<00:00:12.179> on

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
the best applications that we found on

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:21.160 
the best applications that we found on
the<00:00:12.599> android<00:00:12.929> market<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:13.740> let's<00:00:13.950> get<00:00:14.099> started

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.779 

so<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.320> application<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:22.949> called<00:00:23.100> antigen

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
so this application is called antigen

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.580 
so this application is called antigen
and<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.180> free<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> android<00:00:25.050> market<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
has a few different control styles that

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.240 
has a few different control styles that
you<00:00:29.640> use<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.210> either<00:00:30.359> use<00:00:30.449> an<00:00:30.689> on-screen

you use you can either use an on-screen
d-pad<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.579> use<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> trackball<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.420> you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
d-pad you can use a trackball if you

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.270 
d-pad you can use a trackball if you
have<00:00:33.690> one<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:33.899> your<00:00:34.020> device<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.920> let's<00:00:35.130> get

use this on screen d-pad to move my

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.650 
use this on screen d-pad to move my
antigen<00:00:41.070> around<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:42.120> pretty<00:00:42.360> simple

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
antigen around and it's pretty simple

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
antigen around and it's pretty simple
all<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.559> rotate<00:00:44.010> your

free on the android market a cool thing
about<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.449> application<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.500> uses<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> x

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
about this application is it uses the x

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.849 
about this application is it uses the x
y&amp;z<00:00:56.789> coordinates<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> accelerometer<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
y&amp;z coordinates of the accelerometer to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.250 
y&amp;z coordinates of the accelerometer to
get<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> very<00:00:59.399> precise<00:00:59.879> level<00:01:00.480> measurement<00:01:01.170> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
get a very precise level measurement you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.290 
get a very precise level measurement you
can<00:01:01.379> also<00:01:01.559> use<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.070> x<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.430> y<00:01:02.579> coordinates<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
can also use the x and y coordinates to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.870 
can also use the x and y coordinates to
get<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> generic<00:01:04.409> bubble<00:01:04.739> level<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.850> 0

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
get a generic bubble level so at 0

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.730 
get a generic bubble level so at 0
degrees<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.290> also<00:01:07.439> change

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
degrees I can do that I can also change

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.679 
degrees I can do that I can also change
it<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> 45<00:01:08.700> degrees<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.450> want<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
it up to 45 degrees if I want to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.570 
it up to 45 degrees if I want to
position<00:01:09.900> something<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.439> an<00:01:10.560> angle<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.400> cool

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
position something on an angle the cool

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.830 
position something on an angle the cool
thing<00:01:11.610> about<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.390> change<00:01:12.630> some<00:01:12.810> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
thing about this you can change some of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.810 
thing about this you can change some of
the<00:01:12.930> settings<00:01:13.020> by<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.710> settings<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.310> can

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
the settings by going to settings I can

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
the settings by going to settings I can
change<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.270> background<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.080> also<00:01:16.200> show

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
change the background I can also show

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.340 
change the background I can also show
the<00:01:16.530> angle<00:01:16.979> show<00:01:17.250> pitch<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.020> many<00:01:19.020> different

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the angle show pitch and many different

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.740 
the angle show pitch and many different
other<00:01:19.470> features<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> dictionary

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
other features so this is the dictionary
