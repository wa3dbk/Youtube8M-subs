cameras we're gonna take little pieces
of<00:00:15.240> copper<00:00:15.509> tubing<00:00:16.520> hit<00:00:17.520> them<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> hammer

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
of copper tubing hit them with a hammer

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.290 
of copper tubing hit them with a hammer
and<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:19.039> since<00:00:20.039> they<00:00:20.100> don't<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:21.270> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
and a since they don't have a like a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.870 
and a since they don't have a like a
nail<00:00:21.539> set<00:00:21.779> we're<00:00:22.680> using<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.980> screwdriver<00:00:23.340> with

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
nail set we're using a screwdriver with

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.130 
nail set we're using a screwdriver with
plastic<00:00:24.269> handles<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.689> there's<00:00:24.840> odds<00:00:24.990> that

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
plastic handles so there's odds that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.290 
plastic handles so there's odds that
could<00:00:25.439> shove<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.880> but<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:26.970> put<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> little

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
could shove it but you put a little

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.640 
could shove it but you put a little
divot<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.930> screw<00:00:28.140> hole<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
divot and then you screw hole in it and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.169 
divot and then you screw hole in it and
then<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:29.070> pop<00:00:29.189> really<00:00:29.519> dangerous

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
then you can pop really dangerous

00:00:30.179 --> 00:01:22.950 
then you can pop really dangerous
