is pretty damn simple defeat 1z oMG on

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.230 
is pretty damn simple defeat 1z oMG on
this<00:00:18.020> long<00:00:18.289> asked<00:00:18.680> as<00:00:18.800> a<00:00:18.830> track<00:00:19.250> and<00:00:19.789> you<00:00:20.119> are

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
this long asked as a track and you are

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.140 
this long asked as a track and you are
given<00:00:20.570> 500<00:00:21.230> extra<00:00:21.680> cash<00:00:21.920> every<00:00:22.340> few<00:00:22.610> seconds

given 500 extra cash every few seconds

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.800 
given 500 extra cash every few seconds
or<00:00:23.300> so

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
or so

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.380 
or so
so<00:00:24.440> of<00:00:24.619> course<00:00:24.859> forms<00:00:25.369> are<00:00:25.520> essential<00:00:26.029> here

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
so of course forms are essential here

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.570 
so of course forms are essential here
because<00:00:27.020> there<00:00:27.230> is<00:00:27.260> no<00:00:27.500> way<00:00:27.710> you<00:00:27.770> can<00:00:28.160> defeat<00:00:28.310> a

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
because there is no way you can defeat a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.359 
because there is no way you can defeat a
seal<00:00:28.910> mg<00:00:29.420> with<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.779> passive<00:00:30.230> 500<00:00:30.949> cash<00:00:31.160> you

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
seal mg with the passive 500 cash you

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.549 
seal mg with the passive 500 cash you
earned<00:00:31.580> before<00:00:31.850> it<00:00:32.149> reaches<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.660> exit<00:00:32.870> which

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
earned before it reaches the exit which

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.200 
earned before it reaches the exit which
means<00:00:33.890> you<00:00:34.100> will<00:00:34.220> have<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.520> be<00:00:34.610> at<00:00:34.730> least<00:00:34.760> City

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
means you will have to be at least City

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.870 
means you will have to be at least City
level<00:00:35.540> 15<00:00:36.170> in<00:00:36.380> order<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:37.010> beat<00:00:37.160> this<00:00:37.370> special

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
level 15 in order to beat this special

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.110

mission<00:00:38.030> I<00:00:38.390> am<00:00:39.140> level<00:00:39.410> 16<00:00:40.070> here<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:40.969> this

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
mission I am level 16 here so this

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.420 
mission I am level 16 here so this
strategy<00:00:41.510> will<00:00:42.170> pretty<00:00:42.410> much<00:00:42.530> work<00:00:42.950> for<00:00:43.280> you

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
do first is to just straight up build

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.080 
do first is to just straight up build
all<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.410> farms<00:00:51.770> for<00:00:52.010> maximum<00:00:52.610> cash<00:00:52.879> at<00:00:53.059> the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
end which is for 2-0 farms in my case

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.430 
end which is for 2-0 farms in my case
get<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.440> for<00:00:57.980> 20<00:00:58.370> haha<00:00:59.149> that<00:00:59.629> was<00:00:59.660> totally<00:01:00.289> not

get it for 20 haha that was totally not

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.979 
get it for 20 haha that was totally not
intentional<00:01:01.280> then<00:01:01.910> start<00:01:02.329> building<00:01:02.809> up<00:01:02.930> your

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
intentional then start building up your

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.370 
intentional then start building up your
Moab<00:01:03.559> Mahler's<00:01:04.219> to<00:01:04.430> damage<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.059> Z<00:01:05.299> oMG<00:01:05.929> at

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
Moab Mahler's to damage the Z oMG at

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.260 
Moab Mahler's to damage the Z oMG at
that<00:01:06.649> point<00:01:07.009> it<00:01:07.189> will<00:01:07.340> already<00:01:07.520> be<00:01:07.880> at<00:01:08.060> the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
that point it will already be at the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.019 
that point it will already be at the
middle<00:01:08.569> of<00:01:08.689> its<00:01:08.810> second<00:01:09.259> bent<00:01:09.529> I<00:01:09.880> recommend<00:01:10.880> at

00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:11.029 
middle of its second bent I recommend at

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:13.629 
middle of its second bent I recommend at
least<00:01:11.090> 7<00:01:11.600> mothers<00:01:12.049> which<00:01:12.649> is<00:01:12.829> how<00:01:12.950> many<00:01:13.219> I<00:01:13.310> use

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:13.639 
least 7 mothers which is how many I use

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.699 
least 7 mothers which is how many I use
in<00:01:13.909> this<00:01:14.060> video<00:01:14.240> but<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.139> may<00:01:15.319> be<00:01:15.350> possible

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
in this video but it may be possible

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.089 
in this video but it may be possible
with<00:01:16.189> even<00:01:16.459> 6<00:01:16.729> I<00:01:16.969> also<00:01:17.840> use<00:01:18.349> a<00:01:18.380> village<00:01:18.920> to

00:01:19.089 --> 00:01:19.099 
with even 6 I also use a village to

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:21.489 
with even 6 I also use a village to
reduce<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.639> cost<00:01:19.880> of<00:01:20.149> all<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.450> bomb<00:01:20.689> towers

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
reduce the cost of all the bomb towers

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:23.499 
reduce the cost of all the bomb towers
it<00:01:21.679> may<00:01:21.979> not<00:01:22.159> be<00:01:22.219> essential<00:01:22.909> but<00:01:23.179> it<00:01:23.270> sure

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
it may not be essential but it sure

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.779 
it may not be essential but it sure
helps<00:01:23.899> quite<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.229> bit<00:01:24.560> especially<00:01:25.130> with<00:01:25.520> the

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
helps quite a bit especially with the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.809 
helps quite a bit especially with the
range<00:01:26.029> and<00:01:26.359> jungle<00:01:26.749> drums<00:01:27.049> upgrades<00:01:27.679> I<00:01:28.009> may<00:01:28.759> be

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
range and jungle drums upgrades I may be

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.179 
range and jungle drums upgrades I may be
a<00:01:28.939> little<00:01:29.209> ahead<00:01:29.299> of<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.749> video<00:01:30.049> but<00:01:30.619> normally

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
a little ahead of the video but normally

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.699 
a little ahead of the video but normally
you<00:01:31.219> should<00:01:31.609> expect<00:01:31.999> the<00:01:32.119> Z<00:01:32.450> oMG<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:33.259> finally

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
you should expect the Z oMG to finally

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.889 
you should expect the Z oMG to finally
be<00:01:33.859> popping<00:01:34.279> around<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:34.669> last<00:01:34.909> Bend<00:01:35.299> so

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
be popping around the last Bend so

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.839 
be popping around the last Bend so
there's<00:01:36.109> actually<00:01:36.319> not<00:01:36.829> much<00:01:36.889> room<00:01:37.369> for<00:01:37.429> error

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
there's actually not much room for error

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.539 
there's actually not much room for error
at<00:01:38.539> this<00:01:38.869> point<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:39.469> will<00:01:39.619> want<00:01:39.889> to<00:01:39.979> sell<00:01:40.279> all

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
at this point you will want to sell all

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.089 
at this point you will want to sell all
your<00:01:40.729> farms<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:41.419> prepare<00:01:42.139> for<00:01:42.349> the<00:01:42.439> 64

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
your farms and prepare for the 64

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.609 
your farms and prepare for the 64
ceramics<00:01:43.700> that<00:01:43.939> spawn<00:01:44.509> from<00:01:44.749> the<00:01:44.929> sale<00:01:45.139> of<00:01:45.169> G

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
ceramics that spawn from the sale of G

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.699 
ceramics that spawn from the sale of G
so<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:46.789> I<00:01:46.819> do<00:01:46.999> is<00:01:47.450> get<00:01:47.689> up<00:01:47.840> an<00:01:47.989> Arctic<00:01:48.409> wind

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
so what I do is get up an Arctic wind

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.999 
so what I do is get up an Arctic wind
paired<00:01:49.369> up<00:01:49.669> with<00:01:49.819> 2<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.270> 2<00:01:50.509> glue<00:01:50.779> Gunners<00:01:51.009> you

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
paired up with 2 to 2 glue Gunners you

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.249 
paired up with 2 to 2 glue Gunners you
