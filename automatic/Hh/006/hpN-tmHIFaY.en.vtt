 nice that you andreas did it earlier 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.440
 already said by all a great 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.020
 presence on a television show 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.020
 this song really is like that 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.600
 become popular and I believe factor 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.010
 know and how is that what is that for 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.650
 a feeling if you're in one now 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.320
 Great open air tour of this song 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.810
 votes and your feelings us yours 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.310
 thoughts with your fans partly how to go 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.650
 people on it and how do they go 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.330
 to 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.700
 There is quite a big sea of ​​tears 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:23.420
 many crocodile tears on the cheeks 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:25.190
 the décolleté a very, very run down 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.350
 special moment because the tax 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.440
 generally much more positive 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.180
 mood is shaped and so appreciate that 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.990
 then all the more that many many 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.810
 fans no matter where really then 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.780
 that moment pauses for her 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.150
 to give thought and that is something quite 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.610
 What a special long time was the song 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.050
 a very sad for me because of me 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.360
 just my daddy my little one 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.430
 sister lost but maybe 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.800
 it was just the music just this 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.600
 great stages and also these moments at 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.450
 the live concerts or like now in 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.070
 you in the show where you get that 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.140
 big audience then we really have 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.690
 again to be quiet to move 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.130
 can 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.890
 The reason somehow forward again 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.540
 to look and so is this song gave yes 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.880
 also a very hopeful and 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.340
 positive for everyone 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.630
 that's why it has to sing it's easy 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.180
 a big part of me 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:23.150
 that belongs to me that makes me 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.410
 that tells my life story and 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.600
 I say thank you for the great 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.240
 support and for these many 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.160
 reactions to these honest stories 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.100
 I think so too of many 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.400
 day reap many thousands of fans the 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.169
 many thousand cases 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.100
 the visit you at your 

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:42.690
 open-air tour these fans are 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.820
 numerically much more than that 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:47.220
 it was there at first 

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.810
 really small auditoriums facing you 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.250
 of course you have sung with you with the 

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.860
 same joy and the same fun 

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:55.110
 but I know you still have it 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.789
 some days can not believe what is there 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:00.620
 actually in recent years with 

00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:00.620
 Full throttle really happened and not
