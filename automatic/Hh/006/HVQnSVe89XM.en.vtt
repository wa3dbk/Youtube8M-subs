00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.410
 The first battle of April after issei team system enforcement 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.400
 Higashi Kogei 1191,732 of the new record that was donated in 1971 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.270
 Centimeter cutting place fracture line Kinki district between the fire source or Nagasaki Mr. 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.750
 A total of 31 slivers of 71,000 KDs at 101.6 cm 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.679
 A hugely popular hospital name doubts Mediterranean 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:32.940
 Many are 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.880
 It was made for this time 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.260
 The former one of the lecture was actually pointed out before that 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.830
 I'm trying to use the same thing as a concept 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.540
 We showed eco-activity 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.960
 I'm waiting for you in the computer 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.900
 Cut the outline of the degree 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.550
 It's just the relationship 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.300
 The rest is that infrastructure decides to calculate and move 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.130
 I am making a mechanism like this 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.690
 What kind of person from the whole form 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.980
 It is said that it should be fun and be able to form one by one 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.050
 program 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.700
 Well it's the same interactively 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.390
 While traveling with the computer Inao 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.810
 It is a combination of the part that the computer thinks about 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.720
 I was busy with a human being, but I'm working 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.060
 In a way 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.729
 There were three things that could be done at a very fast rate 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.160
 There is 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.790
 If it is clear when you have a small scratch on the air conditioner 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.810
 If we calculate one computer down, the computer 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.240
 If it was calculated at a tremendous speed 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.440
 Go through 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.259
 By the soaring boy 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.600
 f1 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.690
 Basically that architecture 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.870
 Female 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.689
 I told you how to make an agreement 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.950
 Kaya Tatsuya 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.030
 What is a little different 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.280
 While the prefecture north 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.390
 How to make the shape itself is the power of digitalinformation technology 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.799
 I wonder if it will change a lot 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.729
 There is a point that such a part also performs emergency surgery 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.730
 That we are characteristic 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.760
 This time is also possible wooden and 379 people 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.320
 And then 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.179
 Thought we want to do normally we have increased 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.719
 Nomiya bogey 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.710
 This time, different from what I used to do in the US 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.899
 Computer's 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.899
 As a tool or raw design- 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.769
 New usage as a tool 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.739
 Continue to the new north 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.289
 To challenge such things
