00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.320
 I imagine and the chevignon collection 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.730
 for the spring was 2013 it's 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.379
 to embody the ankle man and around 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.779
 photoreporter called ray charles 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.609
 point out and this photo reporter will leave 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.210
 in east africa in the footsteps of 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.789
 peter berg of american photographer who 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.119
 has long lived in mozambique and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.119
 Kenya 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.630
 the relationship actually with africa is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.190
 translated by a collaboration with 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.480
 floriane but skiing that was for me 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.760
 an artist who has embodied perfectly 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.770
 this mindset around 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.370
 the inspiration is original compared 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.829
 to photographers 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.960
 we talked peter burns a collaboration 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.629
 which is strong actor because it's a 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.329
 universe that I like is a universe of 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.149
 peter bar why actually created in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.489
 priority chart then decline not on 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.770
 T-shirts as and when 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.270
 sparks out the compositions are 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.270
 came on lignon trusted me 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.270
 I met audrey marnay the godmother 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.650
 of madame's children and there it was 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.360
 even stronger is that he gave 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.750
 for children who need it 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.640
 extremely important woman is a 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.280
 province in burkina faso and we take care 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.540
 from a small area so we do little 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.400
 but suddenly, how are really 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.800
 caring for them takes care of children in 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.030
 schooling in health the action cocheux 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.860
 vignon agreed to do with us by 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.630
 the zone of t-shirts and for us 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.400
 something fundamental because 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.640
 it will bring us funds that will 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.560
 be immediately reused for 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.390
 concrete projects for a clinic 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.340
 in your care we create a bone in 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.979
 a small village next door or here enough 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.700
 far from any health point of view so 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.700
 it's complicated for them
