00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
balance is almost perfect on paper and

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.219 
balance is almost perfect on paper and
in<00:04:43.800> practice<00:04:44.250> allows<00:04:44.580> me<00:04:44.849> to<00:04:45.030> control<00:04:45.360> the

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
in practice allows me to control the

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.529 
in practice allows me to control the
slide<00:04:46.560> just<00:04:46.919> with<00:04:47.759> a<00:04:47.819> little<00:04:48.030> flick<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.300> my

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
slide just with a little flick of my

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.330 
slide just with a little flick of my
foot<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:49.560> it<00:04:49.680> is<00:04:49.770> very<00:04:50.220> precise<00:04:52.099> so<00:04:53.099> you<00:04:53.159> could

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
foot so it is very precise so you could

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.870 
foot so it is very precise so you could
say<00:04:53.580> it's<00:04:53.970> mid<00:04:54.419> corner<00:04:54.720> breakaway<00:04:55.669> on<00:04:56.669> demand

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
say it's mid corner breakaway on demand

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.309 
say it's mid corner breakaway on demand

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.899 

now<00:05:04.319> huge<00:05:04.590> plus<00:05:04.830> is<00:05:04.979> that<00:05:05.099> it<00:05:05.190> has<00:05:05.310> very

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
now huge plus is that it has very

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.330 
now huge plus is that it has very
limited<00:05:06.150> body<00:05:06.599> roll<00:05:06.930> but<00:05:07.710> where<00:05:07.889> that<00:05:08.039> becomes

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
limited body roll but where that becomes

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.640 
limited body roll but where that becomes
a<00:05:08.490> little<00:05:08.669> bit<00:05:08.759> of<00:05:08.849> a<00:05:08.880> negative<00:05:09.060> is<00:05:09.780> right<00:05:10.470> now

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
a little bit of a negative is right now

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.800 
a little bit of a negative is right now
look<00:05:10.919> at<00:05:11.039> this<00:05:11.130> under<00:05:11.370> braking<00:05:11.550> as<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.419> brake<00:05:12.659> I

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
look at this under braking as I brake I

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.450 
look at this under braking as I brake I
brake<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.020> little<00:05:13.080> bit<00:05:13.380> late<00:05:13.620> I<00:05:13.830> actually

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
brake a little bit late I actually

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.809 
brake a little bit late I actually
almost<00:05:14.849> go<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.300> stop<00:05:15.479> the<00:05:15.630> car<00:05:16.069> it's<00:05:17.069> great<00:05:17.669> on

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
almost go and stop the car it's great on

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.490 
almost go and stop the car it's great on
a<00:05:17.849> knife-edge<00:05:18.360> whether<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.139> make<00:05:19.349> the

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
a knife-edge whether you make the

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.189 
a knife-edge whether you make the
corners<00:05:19.949> under<00:05:20.639> braking<00:05:20.849> and<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.419> attributed

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
corners under braking and I attributed

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.110 
corners under braking and I attributed
that<00:05:22.440> to<00:05:22.530> really<00:05:23.130> it<00:05:23.219> doesn't<00:05:23.400> dive<00:05:23.669> down<00:05:23.909> at

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
that to really it doesn't dive down at

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.820 
that to really it doesn't dive down at
all<00:05:24.300> at<00:05:24.509> the<00:05:24.599> front<00:05:24.870> so<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.530> have<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.740> be

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
all at the front so you have to be

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.850 
all at the front so you have to be
absolutely<00:05:26.150> perfect<00:05:27.150> on<00:05:27.990> your<00:05:28.440> breaking

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
absolutely perfect on your breaking

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.029 
absolutely perfect on your breaking
point<00:05:29.129> I<00:05:30.020> can<00:05:31.020> hear<00:05:31.169> you<00:05:31.259> now<00:05:31.289> saying<00:05:31.710> well<00:05:31.889> if

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
point I can hear you now saying well if

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.350 
point I can hear you now saying well if
you<00:05:32.159> were<00:05:32.310> into<00:05:32.639> perfect<00:05:32.940> you<00:05:33.030> wouldn't<00:05:33.240> have

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
you were into perfect you wouldn't have

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.010 
you were into perfect you wouldn't have
that<00:05:33.449> problem

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.200 

you<00:05:37.979> know<00:05:38.099> as<00:05:38.250> I<00:05:38.340> said<00:05:38.400> if<00:05:38.669> you<00:05:38.759> break<00:05:38.940> in<00:05:39.120> the

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
you know as I said if you break in the

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.330 
you know as I said if you break in the
right<00:05:39.360> spot<00:05:39.629> those<00:05:40.199> huge<00:05:40.710> front<00:05:41.009> brakes

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
right spot those huge front brakes

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.900 
right spot those huge front brakes
really<00:05:41.940> do<00:05:42.150> their<00:05:42.300> job<00:05:42.629> but<00:05:43.229> I<00:05:43.440> really<00:05:44.310> would

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
really do their job but I really would

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.270 
really do their job but I really would
love<00:05:45.210> to<00:05:45.270> be<00:05:45.509> trying<00:05:45.870> the<00:05:46.470> carbon<00:05:47.009> fiber

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
love to be trying the carbon fiber

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.610 
love to be trying the carbon fiber
brakes<00:05:47.580> which<00:05:47.789> are<00:05:48.000> a<00:05:48.180> very<00:05:48.330> expensive<00:05:49.050> option

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
brakes which are a very expensive option

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.770 
brakes which are a very expensive option
on<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:50.190> SLS<00:05:50.430> GT<00:05:50.580> but<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.389> think<00:05:51.569> on<00:05:51.690> the

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
on the SLS GT but I think on the

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.020 
on the SLS GT but I think on the
racetrack<00:05:52.099> there'd<00:05:53.099> be<00:05:53.250> that<00:05:53.400> little<00:05:53.699> missing

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
racetrack there'd be that little missing

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.140 
racetrack there'd be that little missing
ingredient<00:05:55.159> all<00:05:56.159> right<00:05:56.370> then<00:05:56.580> I'll<00:05:56.729> let<00:05:57.000> the

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
ingredient all right then I'll let the

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.070 
ingredient all right then I'll let the
car<00:05:57.479> cool<00:05:57.750> down<00:05:59.120> to<00:06:00.120> be<00:06:00.240> honest<00:06:00.509> if<00:06:00.840> you're

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
car cool down to be honest if you're

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.080 
car cool down to be honest if you're
driving<00:06:01.229> around<00:06:01.470> Beverly<00:06:02.039> Hills<00:06:02.250> or<00:06:02.580> whatnot

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
driving around Beverly Hills or whatnot

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.529 
driving around Beverly Hills or whatnot
it's<00:06:04.050> just<00:06:04.409> perfect<00:06:04.710> it's<00:06:05.129> a<00:06:05.220> Mercedes<00:06:05.849> but<00:06:06.419> if

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
it's just perfect it's a Mercedes but if

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.260 
it's just perfect it's a Mercedes but if
you<00:06:06.659> take<00:06:06.990> it<00:06:07.139> to<00:06:07.349> the<00:06:07.530> racetrack<00:06:07.789> then<00:06:08.789> you

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
you take it to the racetrack then you

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.680 
you take it to the racetrack then you
had<00:06:09.539> better<00:06:09.750> turn<00:06:10.080> up<00:06:10.139> with<00:06:10.800> your<00:06:11.099> a-game<00:06:14.690> now

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
had better turn up with your a-game now

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.120 
had better turn up with your a-game now
I've<00:06:15.750> been<00:06:15.870> on<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.139> edge<00:06:16.259> of<00:06:16.380> this<00:06:16.590> all<00:06:16.860> day<00:06:17.069> so

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
I've been on the edge of this all day so

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.120 
I've been on the edge of this all day so
I<00:06:17.669> might<00:06:17.909> as<00:06:18.030> well<00:06:18.060> do<00:06:18.300> it<00:06:18.680> you<00:06:19.680> know<00:06:19.800> what<00:06:19.979> it

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
I might as well do it you know what it

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.370 
I might as well do it you know what it
does<00:06:20.280> still<00:06:20.520> prove<00:06:20.909> that<00:06:21.690> it's<00:06:21.990> good<00:06:22.229> to<00:06:22.259> be

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
does still prove that it's good to be

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.409 
does still prove that it's good to be
king<00:06:22.650> by<00:06:22.860> that<00:06:23.039> I<00:06:23.069> mean<00:06:23.400> if<00:06:23.580> you've<00:06:24.000> got<00:06:24.060> the

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
king by that I mean if you've got the

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.719 
king by that I mean if you've got the
money<00:06:24.630> you<00:06:25.319> can<00:06:25.500> buy<00:06:25.530> a<00:06:25.740> car<00:06:26.159> that<00:06:26.190> will<00:06:26.520> put

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
money you can buy a car that will put

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.230 
money you can buy a car that will put
some<00:06:26.940> lead<00:06:27.270> in<00:06:27.539> your<00:06:27.840> pencil<00:06:28.759> also<00:06:29.759> well

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
some lead in your pencil also well

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.209 
some lead in your pencil also well
finally<00:06:30.539> there's<00:06:30.750> one<00:06:30.960> very<00:06:31.229> cool<00:06:31.530> detail<00:06:31.979> on

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:32.219 
finally there's one very cool detail on

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:34.339 
finally there's one very cool detail on
the<00:06:32.400> Munro<00:06:32.729> knee<00:06:32.789> and<00:06:33.180> that<00:06:33.330> is<00:06:33.509> it<00:06:33.870> tells<00:06:34.199> you

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349 
the Munro knee and that is it tells you

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:36.379 
the Munro knee and that is it tells you
that<00:06:34.500> if<00:06:34.710> you<00:06:34.889> own<00:06:35.099> this<00:06:35.310> car<00:06:35.550> you<00:06:36.000> will<00:06:36.120> spend

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:36.389 
that if you own this car you will spend

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:37.939 
that if you own this car you will spend
an<00:06:36.659> additional<00:06:37.199> seven<00:06:37.500> thousand<00:06:37.830> four

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
an additional seven thousand four

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.649 
an additional seven thousand four
hundred<00:06:38.099> dollars<00:06:38.310> over<00:06:39.030> the<00:06:39.060> course<00:06:39.330> of<00:06:39.449> five

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:39.659 
hundred dollars over the course of five

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:42.140 
hundred dollars over the course of five
years<00:06:39.960> compared<00:06:40.680> to<00:06:40.740> a<00:06:40.830> normal<00:06:41.099> car<00:06:41.310> in<00:06:41.819> terms

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
years compared to a normal car in terms
