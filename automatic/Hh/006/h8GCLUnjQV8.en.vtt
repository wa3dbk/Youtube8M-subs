now<00:01:50.250> another<00:01:50.610> thing<00:01:50.729> I've<00:01:50.970> noticed<00:01:51.150> is<00:01:51.510> this

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
now another thing I've noticed is this

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.960 
now another thing I've noticed is this
let's<00:01:52.740> say<00:01:53.010> I<00:01:53.040> open<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.670> few<00:01:53.850> windows<00:01:55.970> when

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
let's say I open up a few windows when

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.670 
let's say I open up a few windows when
there's<00:01:57.150> Explorer<00:01:59.119> Internet<00:02:00.119> Explorer<00:02:00.680> let's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
there's Explorer Internet Explorer let's

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.820 
there's Explorer Internet Explorer let's
say<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> go<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.430> paint<00:02:06.080> let's<00:02:07.080> say<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.259> choose<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
say I go to paint let's say I choose to

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.430 
say I go to paint let's say I choose to
move<00:02:07.950> paint<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> right-hand<00:02:08.880> side<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.450> I

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
move paint to the right-hand side so I

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.610 
move paint to the right-hand side so I
step<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.100> right<00:02:11.280> let<00:02:11.730> go<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.410> then<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
step it to the right let go and then the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.320 
step it to the right let go and then the
other<00:02:13.830> two<00:02:14.070> windows<00:02:14.430> will<00:02:14.610> come<00:02:14.820> up<00:02:15.000> saying

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
other two windows will come up saying

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.460 
other two windows will come up saying
which<00:02:16.170> one<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.709> want<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> left

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
which one do you want to be on the left

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.160 
which one do you want to be on the left
and<00:02:19.470> I'll<00:02:19.680> choose<00:02:19.980> Internet<00:02:20.489> Explorer<00:02:24.170> I'm

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
and I'll choose Internet Explorer I'm

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.150 
and I'll choose Internet Explorer I'm
not<00:02:25.709> sure<00:02:26.130> if<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.300> option<00:02:27.660> it's<00:02:28.160> it's

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
not sure if I like this option it's it's

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.699 
not sure if I like this option it's it's
cool<00:02:29.519> but<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.120> think<00:02:31.019> it's<00:02:31.380> going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.620> be

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
cool but I think it's going to be

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.220 
cool but I think it's going to be
confusion<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> lot<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.880> people<00:02:33.180> who<00:02:33.330> are

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
confusion to a lot of people who are

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.479 
confusion to a lot of people who are
just<00:02:34.440> getting<00:02:34.620> used<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.100> fact<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.340> you

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
just getting used to the fact that you

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.650 
just getting used to the fact that you
can<00:02:35.580> snap<00:02:35.820> something<00:02:36.120> from<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.330> left<00:02:36.540> or

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
can snap something from the left or

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.380 
can snap something from the left or

right or even the cornice and actually
as<00:02:39.540> an<00:02:39.690> added<00:02:39.989> note<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.790> think<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.910> would<00:02:42.060> like<00:02:42.269> to

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
as an added note I think I would like to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.620 
as an added note I think I would like to
see<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.870> when<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:47.060> stepped<00:02:48.060> out<00:02:48.239> over

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
see it so that when I stepped out over

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.250 
see it so that when I stepped out over
that<00:02:49.410> these<00:02:49.769> windows<00:02:50.610> simmer<00:02:51.329> like<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.079> do

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
that these windows simmer like you do

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.750 
that these windows simmer like you do

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.870 
around with this with two monitors what
it<00:03:00.269> doesn't<00:03:00.480> do<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:00.989> me<00:03:01.170> at<00:03:01.380> least<00:03:01.549> is<00:03:02.549> it

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
it doesn't do for me at least is it

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.410 
it doesn't do for me at least is it
doesn't<00:03:03.650> move<00:03:04.650> from<00:03:04.980> monitor<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.820> monitor

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
be like Windows 7 I does I have to

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.900 
be like Windows 7 I does I have to
manually<00:03:09.630> drag<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.140> from<00:03:10.320> one<00:03:11.130> monitor<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
other monitor then I can use the arrow

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.259 
other monitor then I can use the arrow
keys<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.600> windows<00:03:16.170> flag<00:03:16.380> key<00:03:16.680> to

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
left right top to bottom one thing I do

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.039 
left right top to bottom one thing I do
notice<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:24.540> different<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:26.870> before<00:03:27.870> on

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
notice that's different is before on

notice that's different is before on
windows<00:03:28.380> 7<00:03:28.620> or<00:03:28.829> 8<00:03:28.980> if<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.910> minimize<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:31.079> window

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
windows 7 or 8 if I minimize the window

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.509 
windows 7 or 8 if I minimize the window
I<00:03:32.540> couldn't<00:03:33.540> maximize<00:03:34.140> again<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.680> was<00:03:34.799> once

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
I couldn't maximize again it was once

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.640 
I couldn't maximize again it was once
the<00:03:35.640> window<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:35.910> our<00:03:36.180> focus<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:37.200> was<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.500> end

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
the window is our focus that was the end

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.580 
the window is our focus that was the end
of<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.890> but<00:03:38.880> now<00:03:39.030> by<00:03:39.239> pressing<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.870> up<00:03:40.049> arrow<00:03:40.079> I

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
of it but now by pressing the up arrow I

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.539 
of it but now by pressing the up arrow I
get<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.100> window<00:03:41.250> straight<00:03:41.700> back<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.269> if<00:03:42.329> I

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
get the window straight back so if I

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.270 
get the window straight back so if I
minimize<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.820> window<00:03:44.910> too<00:03:45.239> far<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:46.040> can<00:03:47.040> get<00:03:47.190> it

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
minimize the window too far I can get it

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.539 
minimize the window too far I can get it
back<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.780> think<00:03:48.780> this<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> great<00:03:49.470> feature<00:03:49.709> as

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
back I think this is a great feature as

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.120 
back I think this is a great feature as
I<00:03:51.450> say<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.780> had<00:03:52.049> problems<00:03:52.410> with<00:03:52.590> two<00:03:52.829> monitors

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
I say I had problems with two monitors

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.330 
I say I had problems with two monitors
that<00:03:53.519> could<00:03:53.730> be<00:03:53.910> just<00:03:54.150> my<00:03:54.209> system<00:03:55.190> but<00:03:56.190> I'm

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
that could be just my system but I'm

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.360 
that could be just my system but I'm
liking<00:03:56.640> what<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.000> was<00:03:57.180> seeing
