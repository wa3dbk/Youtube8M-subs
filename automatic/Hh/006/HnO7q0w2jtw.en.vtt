first<00:00:03.679> we're<00:00:03.859> going<00:00:03.949> to<00:00:04.009> go<00:00:04.130> over<00:00:04.359> removing

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
first we're going to go over removing

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.320 
first we're going to go over removing
and<00:00:05.509> replacing<00:00:05.930> the<00:00:06.589> fixed<00:00:07.009> cog<00:00:07.189> and<00:00:07.700> the

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
and replacing the fixed cog and the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.480 
and replacing the fixed cog and the
first<00:00:08.540> step<00:00:08.720> in<00:00:08.840> this<00:00:08.900> process<00:00:08.960> is<00:00:09.650> with<00:00:09.830> a<00:00:09.860> set

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
first step in this process is with a set

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.240 
first step in this process is with a set
of<00:00:10.640> lock<00:00:11.240> ring<00:00:11.510> pliers<00:00:12.410> you<00:00:12.800> have<00:00:12.950> to<00:00:13.070> loosen

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
of lock ring pliers you have to loosen

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.640 
of lock ring pliers you have to loosen
the<00:00:13.490> lock<00:00:13.640> ring<00:00:13.880> itself<00:00:14.300> and<00:00:14.660> please<00:00:15.470> note

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
the lock ring itself and please note

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.160 
the lock ring itself and please note
that's<00:00:15.830> the<00:00:15.980> reverse<00:00:16.309> thread<00:00:16.670> so<00:00:17.000> you'll<00:00:17.170> be

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
that's the reverse thread so you'll be

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.970 
that's the reverse thread so you'll be
loosening<00:00:18.560> it<00:00:18.650> in<00:00:18.740> a<00:00:18.770> clockwise<00:00:19.010> direction

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
loosening it in a clockwise direction

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.920 
loosening it in a clockwise direction
and<00:00:21.980> then<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:22.580> fixed<00:00:22.760> cog<00:00:23.090> but<00:00:23.450> if<00:00:23.630> it's<00:00:23.780> been

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
and then the fixed cog but if it's been

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.120 
and then the fixed cog but if it's been
written<00:00:24.140> at<00:00:24.289> all<00:00:24.410> it's<00:00:24.590> going<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:24.800> be<00:00:24.860> on<00:00:24.980> there

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
written at all it's going to be on there

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.769 
written at all it's going to be on there
very<00:00:25.160> very<00:00:26.030> hard<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:27.560> know<00:00:27.710> chain<00:00:27.980> whip<00:00:28.779> but

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
very very hard you know chain whip but

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.180 
very very hard you know chain whip but
that<00:00:29.990> in<00:00:30.110> place<00:00:30.350> that's<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.859> standard

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
that in place that's the standard

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.819 
that in place that's the standard
threading<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.359> it<00:00:32.570> will<00:00:33.199> come<00:00:33.410> off<00:00:33.590> in<00:00:33.770> a

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
threading so it will come off in a

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.970 
threading so it will come off in a
counterclockwise<00:00:34.160> direction<00:00:35.770> break<00:00:36.770> that

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
counterclockwise direction break that

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.970 
counterclockwise direction break that
free<00:00:37.450> and<00:00:38.450> then<00:00:38.570> you<00:00:38.600> can<00:00:38.810> just<00:00:38.960> rest<00:00:39.739> up<00:00:39.860> at

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
free and then you can just rest up at

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.760 
free and then you can just rest up at
you<00:00:40.070> can<00:00:40.220> take<00:00:40.340> off<00:00:40.489> by<00:00:40.700> hand<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.770> another

close up in this video is not maybe not
enough<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:46.309> help<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:46.610> but<00:00:46.760> if<00:00:47.000> you<00:00:47.210> pay

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
enough to help you but if you pay

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.610 
enough to help you but if you pay
attention<00:00:47.840> you'll<00:00:48.230> see<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.469> two<00:00:48.590> different

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
attention you'll see the two different

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.920 
attention you'll see the two different
steps<00:00:49.160> of<00:00:49.340> threads<00:00:49.760> one<00:00:50.059> for<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.300> cog<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:50.750> one

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
steps of threads one for the cog and one

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.160 
steps of threads one for the cog and one
for<00:00:51.200> the<00:00:51.260> fixed<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:52.190> lock<00:00:52.370> room<00:00:52.870> so<00:00:53.870> then<00:00:54.020> to

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
for the fixed the lock room so then to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.860 
for the fixed the lock room so then to
reinstall<00:00:54.680> just<00:00:55.010> simply<00:00:55.250> screw<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.790> cog<00:00:56.629> on

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
reinstall just simply screw the cog on

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.580 
reinstall just simply screw the cog on
being<00:00:57.200> very<00:00:57.379> careful<00:00:57.530> not<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:58.450> strip<00:00:59.450> you<00:00:59.600> mess

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
being very careful not to strip you mess

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.049 
being very careful not to strip you mess
up<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.829> threads<00:01:01.100> on<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.309> aluminum<00:01:01.430> pop<00:01:01.820> shell

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
up the threads on the aluminum pop shell

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.399 
up the threads on the aluminum pop shell
and<00:01:02.469> then<00:01:03.469> you'll<00:01:03.770> want<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:04.159> Snug<00:01:04.549> that<00:01:04.579> down

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
and then you'll want to Snug that down

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.219 
and then you'll want to Snug that down
well<00:01:06.409> with<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.070> chain<00:01:07.310> whip<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:08.750> will<00:01:08.900> tighten

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
well with the chain whip it will tighten

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.050 
well with the chain whip it will tighten
by<00:01:09.500> itself<00:01:09.860> when<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.159> ride<00:01:10.490> but<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:10.850> don't

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
by itself when you ride but you don't

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.670 
by itself when you ride but you don't
want<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:11.390> happen<00:01:11.630> because<00:01:12.170> then<00:01:12.560> it

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
want that to happen because then it

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.550 
want that to happen because then it
would<00:01:12.830> be<00:01:12.860> loose<00:01:13.630> against<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.750> locker<00:01:15.080> room

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
would be loose against the locker room

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.050 
would be loose against the locker room
it<00:01:15.710> wouldn't<00:01:15.920> be<00:01:16.010> tight<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.580> lock<00:01:16.729> ring<00:01:16.880> would

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
it wouldn't be tight the lock ring would

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.679 
it wouldn't be tight the lock ring would
not<00:01:17.229> be<00:01:18.340> in<00:01:19.340> place<00:01:19.610> correctly<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.299> now<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:20.510> put

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
not be in place correctly so now you put

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.660 
not be in place correctly so now you put
the<00:01:20.780> lock<00:01:20.930> ring<00:01:21.140> on<00:01:21.320> again<00:01:21.770> remember<00:01:22.189> reverse

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
the lock ring on again remember reverse

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.240 
the lock ring on again remember reverse
thread<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.080> tighten<00:01:24.470> it'll<00:01:24.650> be<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:24.830> a

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
thread so to tighten it'll be in a

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.420 
thread so to tighten it'll be in a
counterclockwise<00:01:25.729> position<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:27.130> here<00:01:28.130> again

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
counterclockwise position and here again

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.499 
counterclockwise position and here again

freewheel off this one's a little more

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.880 
freewheel off this one's a little more
straightforward<00:01:43.939> you'll<00:01:44.869> need<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.049> free<00:01:45.680> wheel

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
straightforward you'll need a free wheel

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.399 
straightforward you'll need a free wheel
puller<00:01:46.729> tool<00:01:47.240> for<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.689> particular<00:01:47.960> freewheel
