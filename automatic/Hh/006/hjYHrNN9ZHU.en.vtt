00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.960

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.080

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.700

 Soaked in water one night 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.880
 drain and I'll start the white beans 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.909
 Boil once with salt water and then 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 Close the lid and let it rest 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.009
 But I'll get you that way I have it 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.020
 water boiled off the white beans 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.689

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.939
 water be introduced screen and 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.340

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.869
 just turn the lid off and on 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.460

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.640
