00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
responsibility that goes with that we

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.330 
responsibility that goes with that we
want<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.779> not<00:00:24.930> just<00:00:24.960> train<00:00:25.439> medical<00:00:25.920> students

want to not just train medical students
we<00:00:26.490> want<00:00:26.640> them<00:00:26.849> graduates<00:00:27.420> who<00:00:27.750> diagnose<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
we want them graduates who diagnose and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
we want them graduates who diagnose and
treat<00:00:28.800> disease<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.609> also<00:00:29.849> understand

treat disease but can also understand

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.659 
treat disease but can also understand
that<00:00:30.869> scientific<00:00:31.800> process<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:32.489> can

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
that scientific process so they can

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.150 
that scientific process so they can
further<00:00:33.090> develop<00:00:33.899> new<00:00:34.230> treatments<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.890> new

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
further develop new treatments and new

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.770 
further develop new treatments and new
diagnostic<00:00:35.850> tests<00:00:37.879> so<00:00:38.879> medicine<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.420> indeed<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
diagnostic tests so medicine is indeed a

and that's very important it's very

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.590
