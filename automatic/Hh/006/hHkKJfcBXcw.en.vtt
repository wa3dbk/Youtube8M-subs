00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I LIKE TRAINS

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:13.500
Hey! Have you heard
of the I Like Trains kid?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000
He's pretty cool, but there might be
something wrong with him

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.580
I don't know if he's cursed
or if it's something with his brain

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.500
But the only thing he ever says is:
"I Like Trains."

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:31.500
I LIKE TRAINS

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.500
From birth the I Like Trains kid
never spoke a word

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.000
Not even to his parents,
not a single sound was heard

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.500
But on the first day of school the teacher
asked his name

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.000
All he did was smile as he said:
"I Like Trains"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I LIKE TRAINS

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
They put him on some Ritalin
to see if that would help

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The doctor found the perfect dose
and asked him how he felt

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.500
He stared at the doctor
with that little creepy smile

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.000
And the I Like Trains kid said:
"I feel great!"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500
He got a fancy job
and he straightened out his life

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.500
He met a nice girl
who he asked to be his wife

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.000
As they stood at the altar
and prepared to say their vows

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
He put a ring on her finger, and he said:

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I LIKE TRAINS

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.500
Got bad grades?

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.000
I LIKE TRAINS

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Awkward Date?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.500
I LIKE TRAINS

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.000
Don't like trains? ...

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:58.000
I LIKE TRAINS
