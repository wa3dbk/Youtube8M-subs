 need a pc there is no need to 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.880
 the root view application that previously 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.950
 had brought them and stayed in Chinese 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.730
 because he updated was an executable 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.019
 for pc 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.690
 which the application is left is no longer 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.930
 remains in English stays in Chinese and for 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.000
 that 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.730
 I bring you now what is the application 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.560
 without it simply 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.720
 download directly to the mobile 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.380
 they use roche care to check that 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.550
 it worked and it's all do not occupy anything else 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.620
 plus 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.690
 now let's what is the application 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.819
 so they can see what's working there 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.939

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.430
 roche curves and good reaches us to 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:56.909
 distinguish thanks to the camera of this 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.280
 device so bad and says so 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.829
 it is green not what is authorized 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.500
 here, if I want, I can deny it or 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.180
 I can leave it pending too 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.060
 directly from here you can 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.239
 uninstall the applications of 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.350
 system that I do not then already in this 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.060
 I can not install it any time 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.270
 because we had already installed them 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.850
 previously and if the root is installed another 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.680
 thing that I do not want to happen to me is that 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.820
 if you occupy you occupy to make valid the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.860
 warranty 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:34.069

 will erase all traces that you have used 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:43.099
 root to be valid your guarantee 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.080
 then it 's the insurance and once you 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.560
 you remove the robot if you no longer need it 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.870
 well you can not reinstall 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.060
 you simply install active and this does not 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.939
 occupy nothing else then any 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.400
 application that asks you root access with 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:01.039
 a single application is all on my part 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.479
