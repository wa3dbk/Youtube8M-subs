00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.060
 changes that Microsoft made in the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.289

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.500
 lack of information, then my 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.770
 Answer to you who did this 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.570

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:41.729
 new to send sms did not understand why 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.740
 What do you think I'm missing? 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.960
 information to an asshole 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.960
 let's see then let's see let's see then 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 Annotate buying bacon tomorrow you do not 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.420
 understood why I already knew this and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.310
 because he is an asshole he insists that he tried 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.780
 so besides being an asshole he is a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.060
 liar 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.000
 so researching it said that I should 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.830
 talk research before why not 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.320
 It worked fine so search 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:24.530
 Sorry man, you do not understand how I do. 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:28.080
 said again search 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.260
 Sorry, did not try to understand your 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.560
 asshole I knew what I was doing 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.080
 So the first thing is to have ethics. 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.630
 on your device make a video and 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.640
 then politely talk to the 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.830
 people about your experience 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.260
 do not try to play the smartass you 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.600

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.209

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.510

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.080
 he will say some things and can 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.640
 say here in the interrogation again he 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.700
 It gives you some suggestions. 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.160
 the maximum of the maximum he can say is 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.440
 call someone using voice 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.600

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.470

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:13.440
 Can you hold here, call the 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:15.299

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.630
 the more command you'll get 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.359
 It 's all personal 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.870
