of<00:01:33.450> courses<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:34.310> golfers<00:01:35.310> anticipate<00:01:35.939> are<00:01:36.060> we

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
of courses can golfers anticipate are we

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.840 
of courses can golfers anticipate are we
talking<00:01:36.540> about<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.290> super<00:01:37.650> long<00:01:37.860> 18<00:01:38.579> holes

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
talking about the super long 18 holes

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.010 
talking about the super long 18 holes
with<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:40.549> greens<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.820> islands<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.840> like

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
with like greens on islands and like

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.690 
with like greens on islands and like
surrounded<00:01:43.560> by<00:01:43.680> sand<00:01:44.009> traps<00:01:44.369> what<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.610> we

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
surrounded by sand traps what are we

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.179 
surrounded by sand traps what are we
looking<00:01:44.939> what<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> will<00:01:45.659> tell<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
looking what I will tell you is in the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.429 
looking what I will tell you is in the
demo<00:01:47.430> today<00:01:47.790> we're<00:01:48.210> showing<00:01:48.479> three<00:01:49.259> holes

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
demo today we're showing three holes

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.780 
demo today we're showing three holes
from<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.920> our<00:01:49.979> early<00:01:50.250> courses<00:01:50.430> called

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
from one of our early courses called

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.340 
from one of our early courses called
city<00:01:51.030> park<00:01:52.009> we<00:01:53.009> are<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> fun<00:01:53.700> flare<00:01:54.630> golf<00:01:55.049> game

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
city park we are a fun flare golf game

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.620 
city park we are a fun flare golf game
so<00:01:56.009> we're<00:01:56.219> not<00:01:56.369> realistic<00:01:56.850> simulation<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.509> our

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
so we're not realistic simulation so our

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.719 
so we're not realistic simulation so our
courses<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> more<00:01:58.740> fantasy<00:01:59.280> elements

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
courses I have a more fantasy elements

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.459 
courses I have a more fantasy elements
will<00:02:00.119> show<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.390> some<00:02:00.540> more<00:02:00.570> courses<00:02:01.020> later<00:02:01.229> on

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
will show you some more courses later on

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.920 
will show you some more courses later on
in<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> year<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.850> we've<00:02:03.299> definitely<00:02:03.450> focused

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
in the year but we've definitely focused

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.040 
in the year but we've definitely focused
the<00:02:03.990> entire<00:02:04.049> development<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.770> having<00:02:05.130> fun

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
the entire development on having fun

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.600 
the entire development on having fun
you<00:02:06.140> know<00:02:06.260> more<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.560> fantasy<00:02:07.040> side<00:02:07.250> of<00:02:07.400> things

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
you know more the fantasy side of things

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.400 
you know more the fantasy side of things
without<00:02:07.820> going<00:02:08.000> too<00:02:08.150> crazy<00:02:08.420> but<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:09.170> can<00:02:09.290> see

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
without going too crazy but you can see

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.210 
without going too crazy but you can see
that<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.650> characters<00:02:10.070> in<00:02:10.160> the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
that in the characters in the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.520 
that in the characters in the
presentation<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.480> it's<00:02:11.900> not<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.080> simulation

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
presentation so it's not a simulation

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.710 
presentation so it's not a simulation
but<00:02:12.770> we<00:02:12.860> do<00:02:12.950> have<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.160> very<00:02:13.490> very<00:02:13.820> good<00:02:14.000> physics

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
but we do have a very very good physics

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.210 
but we do have a very very good physics
engine<00:02:15.020> behind<00:02:15.140> everything<00:02:15.710> but<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.100> whole

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
engine behind everything but the whole

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.590 
engine behind everything but the whole
presentation<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.850> just<00:02:16.880> more<00:02:17.120> about<00:02:17.210> having

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
presentation is just more about having

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.440 
presentation is just more about having
fun<00:02:17.870> with<00:02:17.990> your<00:02:18.110> friends<00:02:18.470> cool<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.430> as<00:02:19.730> a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
fun with your friends cool so as a

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.620 
fun with your friends cool so as a
golfer<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.590> know<00:02:21.740> obviously<00:02:22.700> form<00:02:23.120> plays<00:02:23.600> a

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
golfer you know obviously form plays a

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.980 
golfer you know obviously form plays a
big<00:02:23.960> factor<00:02:24.290> in<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.940> success<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.540> your<00:02:26.690> swing

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
big factor in the success of your swing

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.280 
big factor in the success of your swing
is<00:02:27.290> there<00:02:27.920> possibly<00:02:28.730> some<00:02:29.690> interactivity

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
is there possibly some interactivity

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.420 
is there possibly some interactivity
with<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.980> Kinect<00:02:31.820> maybe<00:02:32.300> okay<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.770> with

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
with the Kinect maybe okay so with

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.860 
with the Kinect maybe okay so with
Kinect<00:02:34.820> we<00:02:34.940> will<00:02:35.090> be<00:02:35.210> using<00:02:35.360> features<00:02:35.780> of

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
Kinect we will be using features of

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.330 
Kinect we will be using features of
Kinect<00:02:36.140> like<00:02:36.290> voice<00:02:36.530> commands<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.190> things

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
Kinect like voice commands and things

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.340 
Kinect like voice commands and things
but<00:02:37.520> it's<00:02:37.700> actually<00:02:38.030> we<00:02:38.750> actually<00:02:38.780> wanted<00:02:39.260> to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
but it's actually we actually wanted to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.740 
but it's actually we actually wanted to
design<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.740> game<00:02:39.890> for<00:02:40.100> call<00:02:40.730> gamers<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.540> so

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
design the game for call gamers and so

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.270 
design the game for call gamers and so
the<00:02:41.900> swing<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.260> everything<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.860> pad

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
the swing and everything is pad

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.830 
the swing and everything is pad
controlled<00:02:43.790> cuz<00:02:44.210> I<00:02:44.270> want<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.540> be<00:02:44.630> really

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
controlled cuz I want it to be really

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.420 
controlled cuz I want it to be really
accurate<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.860> know<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.310> really

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
accurate and you know it's a really

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.300 
accurate and you know it's a really
competitive<00:02:46.850> game<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.980> Kinect's

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
competitive game and so the Kinect's

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
competitive game and so the Kinect's
awesome<00:02:49.700> but<00:02:49.880> for<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.150> particular

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
awesome but for this particular

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.610 
awesome but for this particular
experience<00:02:50.990> we<00:02:51.050> wanted<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.380> use<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
experience we wanted to use the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.110 
experience we wanted to use the
controller<00:02:51.920> but<00:02:52.130> we<00:02:52.220> will<00:02:52.340> be<00:02:52.430> using<00:02:52.460> some<00:02:53.090> of

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
controller but we will be using some of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.550 
controller but we will be using some of
the<00:02:53.240> other<00:02:53.300> features<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.690> Kinect<00:02:54.080> cool

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
the other features of Kinect cool

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.800 
the other features of Kinect cool
awesome<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:55.490> this<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.180> physicist<00:02:56.660> ray<00:02:56.780> oh

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
awesome so this is the physicist ray oh

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.350 
awesome so this is the physicist ray oh
yes<00:02:57.440> yeah<00:02:57.650> that's<00:02:57.860> Rico<00:02:58.280> as<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:58.700> said<00:02:59.000> she<00:02:59.210> can

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
yes yeah that's Rico as I said she can

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.060 
yes yeah that's Rico as I said she can
magnetize<00:02:59.750> the<00:03:00.080> pin<00:03:00.320> and<00:03:00.650> she<00:03:00.800> puts<00:03:00.980> an

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
magnetize the pin and she puts an

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.560 
magnetize the pin and she puts an
electric<00:03:01.460> field<00:03:01.670> round<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.150> sucks<00:03:02.420> the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
electric field round and it sucks the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.240 
electric field round and it sucks the
ball<00:03:02.750> in<00:03:02.990> it's<00:03:03.320> not<00:03:03.440> guaranteed<00:03:03.710> though<00:03:04.190> you

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
ball in it's not guaranteed though you

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.890 
ball in it's not guaranteed though you
get<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.550> get<00:03:04.640> really<00:03:04.910> close<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.150> sucking<00:03:05.570> in<00:03:05.690> so

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
get to get really close to sucking in so

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.360 
get to get really close to sucking in so
I<00:03:05.930> had<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.230> nice<00:03:06.440> little<00:03:06.590> draw<00:03:06.860> there<00:03:07.100> look<00:03:07.310> at

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
I had a nice little draw there look at

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.780 
I had a nice little draw there look at
that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
that

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.900 
that
that's<00:03:07.970> pretty<00:03:08.150> awesome<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:09.800> rundown<00:03:10.520> real
