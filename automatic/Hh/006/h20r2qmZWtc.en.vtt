00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.619

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.660
 work now 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.160
 I was with the pirate game one week 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.320
 this is I just could not play 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.340
 due to this game error stopped 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.359
 before you open the menu. 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.520
 main 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.680
 I thought it was a problem, failed to be 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.460
 pirate and meets the original 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.469
 problem continued better but for you 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.690
 that are joking is not because I am 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.129
 I resolve to stay operational of the yacht 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.460
 tells you all to buy the original 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.920
 because the game is very fucking online 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.680
 Sun-Thu rs to establish a game 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 here for you for you to be aware of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.370
 how this potential problem 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.100
 Dani, I do not know that there are a lot of people. 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.699
 They knew because I sent the whole internet. 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.559
 behind the solution of this problem which is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.290
 a very good thing you do not do 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.020
 ForrÃ³ idea for those who are not playing 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.540
 a week ago because of this I could already 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.790
 I was playing two weeks ago. 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.390
 so already so easy that this problem 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.340
 Come on, the game begins to load and give. 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.930
 Greatest Auto Trump stopped 5 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.439
 you're going to have it close 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.960
 This screen appears if it exits and 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.700
 trying again will do the same 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.509
 in safe mode will give the same 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.189
 thing 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.990
 for whoever is with the pirate will not 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.479
 will appear this screen will simply 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.119
 starting to charge will close the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.920
 program will close everything you do 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.630
 first who is on windows 7 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:55.439
 windows 8 independent of windows but not 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:57.869
 windows 8.1 control panel arrive 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.060
 here and see that everyone is all connected 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.060
 to your computer they send usb 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.290
 she in the peripherals the computer of 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.390
 What's happening is conflict 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.300
 with any usb device 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.640
 connected that I tell you 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.670
 disconnect everything from your computer leaves 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.190
 to connect only mouse and keyboard keyboard 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.200
 Mouse your monitor and you already 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.030
 appearing here lets out more content 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.560
 peripheral joystick 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.290
 cell phone can connect anything 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.690
 everything was good 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.870
 My advice would be for you to disable 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.850
 here the device model however 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.950
 equal and if in control here simply 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.050
 remove after it automatically 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.340
 it's in the driver alone there it will continue 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.320
 in the gta program 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.239
 When I tell you what to do for the 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.950
 computer and disconnects 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.930
 I did not have it when I connected it 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.130
 will assume USB connection flights 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.200
 Now I 've been vanished beauty to 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.630
 who has more than one joystick has ramp and 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.650
 connected and red can connect general 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.980
 leaves only keyboard mouse screen and connected 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.920
 via usb of yours there did that not good 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.140
 problem solved the problem is well 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.970
 Simple is just that only to connect already 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.459
 They are playing a week ago. 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.220
 but come on will start the game 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.140
 now you can close already to gain another tip 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.250
 always starts the game with a 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.250
 independent manager
