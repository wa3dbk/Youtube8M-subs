 dvd criticism now with a flu too 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.519
 a film in which I consistently under 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.870
 every video in the past few weeks in 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.940
 the comments were requested 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.860
 finally to make a criticism 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.420
 that has arrived with me I have the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.789
 movie finally seen and that's it 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.789
 now maybe tomorrow 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.980
 Dear friend I have the summer over 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.019
 actually with nobody except with 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.519
 My family talked but tomorrow 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.059
 is my first day in the new school 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.899
 and i want that this year 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.899
 something changes 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.170
 that is, if you are among the guests day 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.290
 find a friend then you come here 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.730
 already clear if I actually today 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.050
 no friend other than mine 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.800
 English teacher we think so 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.800
 pretty sad 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.010
 great 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.670
 that's when you have fun 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.990
 on the stand with the defect copy 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.080
 determine on request is totally on it 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.909
 he was having fun again 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.049
 that's what it does 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.049
 that's always going on 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.180
 Do you think the people would also be with you 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.630
 talk if they knew how crazy you are 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.810
 you are really good then we are just 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.640
 all psychos what do you want to do 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.899
 if you call out here I would be real 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.079
 I like to write books but I know 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.630
 not what do you write about us? 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.530
 call it the bitch and the falcon and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.530
 we solve crimes 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.210
 3 million is my dominions I am and 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.509
 why am i looking for and all those i love 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.140
 We always have someone for whom we only 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.179
 are air 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.360
 we probably think like it would not have 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.670
 earn better 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.180
 You see something and you understand what 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.100
 it works 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.240
 you are a wallflower I thought 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.240
 nobody would have noticed me 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.350
 I know many people will say that 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.370
 It did not really happen and 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.060
 At some point it will only be 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.060
 his stories 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.480
 but now its just like living 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.660
 and in this moment 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.660
 I swear we are infinite 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.970
 Maybe in the morning of the year 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.100
 2012 from 12 years released and has in 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.900
 original the title the perks of being a 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.910
 wallflower of about a billion 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.920
 times better than the original title 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.480
 but I want to talk about it here now 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.100
 Do not stop telling the story 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.600
 from charlie whose first high 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.880
 school year is he has something difficult 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.500
 get to know people and connections 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.300
 which is partly due to it 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.459
 not so simple past 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.050
 Again and again in the film flash us 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.580
 is taught and so he managed 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.530
 his first high school day straight 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.850
 once one interesting though 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.440
 strange bond to a teacher 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.870
 and the teacher here by the way 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.070
 played by paul rudd yes and so is 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.110
 Charlie as well a little bit of this 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.519
 stereotypical outsider you think 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.930
 At first, that will happen 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.269
 unlike he meets a few people 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.100
 which is also off the mainstream in 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.350
 The high school live from a higher one 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.120
 semester and then finds friends there 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.310
 the new experiences above all else 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.380
 Teenage topics like sexuality drugs 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.430
 and many more are teaching and are 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.010
 special is also the theme 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.660
 homosexuality is very central here 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.910
 maybe tomorrow and great 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.350
 implemented without teaching 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.060
 but guarantee the realistic 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.709
 create situations and in the beginning 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.269
 you think both if you have the trailer 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.190
 If you do not see the film 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.750
 really succeeded that reproduces what the 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.329
 film finally offers you think 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.940
 first a 08 15 teenie film and then 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.950
 The film is really strong and remembered 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.630
 partly on stripes like juno or else 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.220
 also garden state, and especially in case 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.900
 you probably know something from garden state 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.820
 I mean if you can do this 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.500
 special feeling of a tragicomedy 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.030
 What's the best for me ? 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.040
 maybe the day after tomorrow as well 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.410
 so there are many topics like 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.810
 for example homosexuality 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.549
 friendship loneliness with followers 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.620
 affiliation and many others and is 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.660
 it just a movie again 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.459
 discovered how the teenage time was many 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.780
 of you my viewers are just in 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.280
 this old and canon live this 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.870
 criterion maybe no other 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.160
 but I can tell you the older you get 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.840
 the more the more will be 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.490
 never get bigger in your life 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.020
 also the duties and the possibilities 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.850
 and that would be so many things that used to be 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.770
 as central as the love was 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.750
 class friends really that 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.610
 the biggest focus in everyday life 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.320
 and the constant ideology of 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.430
 Discussions about things to talk about 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.900
 but be nice in life though 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.900
 maybe sometimes not feasible 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.490
 at the 1 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.770
 in the age then realizes that the reality 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.570
 but sometimes a lot harder and 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.340
 just between these confrontations 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.139
 may also prefer to play 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.479
 tomorrow and start again in the 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.389
 beautiful old one just this youth like that 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.280
 of 15 16 17 18 years and is correct 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.800
 class implemented and the film has one 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.240
 have more soundtrack on top of that 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.430
 and that's why the film is on the whole 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.139
 line really powerful and makes 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.270
 that's really fun for me that means 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.449
 also the other one from logan lerman emma 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.800
 watson ezra miller import kate walsh and 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.660
 a lot more really down to the smallest 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.639
 detail is great and played well 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.979
 is great music and especially the 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.810
 situation often does not seem too over-the- top 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.460
 which is very easy with such a film 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.810
 can happen and here on the very 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.150
 point because it works, among others, but 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.490
 Also because of that is that both in the 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.050
 author of the novel also in the end 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.150
 actually the director of the film is 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.889
 and who is probably better suited exactly 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.560
 to capture the feeling as the inventor 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.610
 the story that we are in big 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.169
 class I prefer my hat 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.880
 Maybe tomorrow will do the right thing 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.440
 fun and be a great recommendation 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.780
 synonymous a movie where you really notice 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.070
 You can see that more than once 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.860
 he gets from me as 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.169
 tragicomedy what an absolutely strong and 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.460
 it difficult genre nine out of ten 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.800
 possible points 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.880
 and exactly these evaluations also in total 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.650
 one or the other asks 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.770
 maybe why not 10 with me it is 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.479
 9 is already a top movie 10 is for 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.060
 the very few are still reserving 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.590
 In addition, I was absolutely blown away 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.210
 and that's enough 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.800
 Maybe not quite tomorrow 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.810
 Quali film is definitely a must and 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.430
 an absolute recommendation because he too 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.349
 not such a high level of publicity 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.690
 has okay friend that's it from me for 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.669
 now with my review on works of 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.590
 being a wallflower is original 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.479
 really damn much better who is 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.789
