00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.760
 hello friends welcome to another tuto 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.040
 Tuesday 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.980
 I am leonardo pÃ©rez grandson and because 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.290
 you have been asking me 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.110
 insistently for a year I will do 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.600
 a manga drawing 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.180
 let's do this sketch in a way 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.920
 very simple 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.690
 we start by drawing a circle that does not 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.810
 It has to be perfect or nothing for the 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.530
 style we make it tenuous because then what 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.829
 let's erase 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.260
 from there we draw two lines for the sides 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.780
 of the face 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.810
 if you want you can put a guideline 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.390
 in the middle 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.160
 it's useful but sometimes I just 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.280
 I imagine it and sometimes if the back 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.920
 here is going to be the chin 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.980
 at the bottom of the circle 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.649
 original goes the nose in manga so 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.559
 the general is super simplified the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:06.409
 we can do as an ele and just by 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.869
 under this we make the mouth 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.899
 at a height just above the 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.100
 nose goes the bottom of the eyes and 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:18.140
 how huge are the top 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.380
 come here 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.180
 it is not necessary to draw the whole eye 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.300
 simply a line for the eyelid 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.360
 top and a bit of the bottom 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.290
 between these dances or the part of the 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.570
 eye that takes colony 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.960
 the iris is an oval that usually 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.970
 it looks complete at the bottom and the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.370
 top part is covered by the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.740
 upper eyelid 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.630
 Of course this can change depending on 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.000
 the expression or position of the sight 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.730
 eyebrows can go a little wider 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.330
 to the center and thinner towards the shore 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:00.070
 we put some eyelashes to the 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.070
 eyes and pupils 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.760
 the hair can go as triangles 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.600
 inverted of different sizes in 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.600
 different positions 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.990
 at this point we can fine tune any 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.060
 thing that we want for example I'm going to 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.060
 make the face a little thinner 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:03:01.120
 you can shade your eyes with stripes 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.020
 horizontals that are darker up 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.380
 and they are clarifying down 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.970
 that effect looks very professional 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.250
 we go over the lines 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.680
 certainly during the summer I will give 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.680
 a series of conferences and workshops 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.230
 drawing in europe so if you want 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.170

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.810
