something<00:04:23.419> I<00:04:23.510> want<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:23.720> know<00:04:23.810> too<00:04:23.990> is<00:04:24.050> on<00:04:24.140> the

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
something I want to know too is on the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.440 
something I want to know too is on the
oka<00:04:24.440> oka<00:04:24.710> mask<00:04:24.919> it<00:04:25.160> breaks<00:04:25.400> any<00:04:25.580> box<00:04:25.790> you<00:04:26.240> touch

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
oka oka mask it breaks any box you touch

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.240 
oka oka mask it breaks any box you touch
instantly<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.200> it<00:04:27.500> also<00:04:27.620> doesn't<00:04:28.040> on<00:04:28.100> all

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
instantly and it also doesn't on all

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.070 
instantly and it also doesn't on all
levels<00:04:28.460> so<00:04:29.150> it's<00:04:29.300> good<00:04:29.450> to<00:04:29.480> sometimes<00:04:29.900> get

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
levels so it's good to sometimes get

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.200 
levels so it's good to sometimes get
hidden<00:04:30.260> boxes<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.070> stuff<00:04:31.310> like<00:04:31.490> that<00:04:31.550> because

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
hidden boxes and stuff like that because

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.820 
hidden boxes and stuff like that because

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
it hits it just as long as you move

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.320 
it hits it just as long as you move
within<00:04:34.040> it<00:04:34.250> hits<00:04:34.460> everything<00:04:34.669> on<00:04:34.910> the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
within it hits everything on the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.080 
within it hits everything on the
vertical<00:04:35.510> path<00:04:35.870> so<00:04:36.560> that's<00:04:36.770> good<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.760> fruits

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
vertical path so that's good the fruits

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.940 
vertical path so that's good the fruits
are<00:04:38.240> basically<00:04:38.540> coins<00:04:38.870> get<00:04:39.080> 100<00:04:39.380> get<00:04:39.620> an<00:04:39.710> extra

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
do it too much in the early levels but

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.640 
do it too much in the early levels but

in the later levels there will be boxes
that<00:05:30.280> will<00:05:30.820> be<00:05:31.090> like<00:05:31.420> behind<00:05:31.990> where<00:05:32.380> you

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
that will be like behind where you

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.570 
that will be like behind where you
started<00:05:32.920> like<00:05:33.070> you<00:05:33.160> actually<00:05:33.280> have<00:05:33.490> to

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
started like you actually have to

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.860 
started like you actually have to
backtrack<00:05:33.760> immediately<00:05:34.360> from<00:05:34.480> the<00:05:34.570> starting

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
backtrack immediately from the starting

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.540 
backtrack immediately from the starting
point<00:05:35.110> and<00:05:35.320> so<00:05:35.800> it<00:05:35.920> kind<00:05:36.070> of<00:05:36.100> shows<00:05:36.280> you<00:05:36.430> that

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
point and so it kind of shows you that

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.310 
point and so it kind of shows you that
way<00:05:36.700> sometimes<00:05:37.090> they'll<00:05:37.210> be<00:05:37.330> boxes<00:05:37.780> literally

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
way sometimes they'll be boxes literally

hit him when you're spinning but they

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.950

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
backwards so and that pretty much equals

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.760 
backwards so and that pretty much equals
death<00:06:43.240> these<00:06:43.900> things<00:06:44.110> you<00:06:44.200> can<00:06:44.320> actually<00:06:44.440> jump

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
on and so that will prove useful later

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.410 
on and so that will prove useful later
on<00:06:47.500> you<00:06:48.460> can<00:06:48.550> actually<00:06:48.790> spin<00:06:49.000> this<00:06:49.150> littlest

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420
