content best easter egg in my opinion at
least<00:00:24.300> i<00:00:24.600> think<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.410> really<00:00:25.619> really

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
least i think that was really really

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.080 
least i think that was really really
cool<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.189> they<00:00:26.279> did<00:00:26.430> with<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.609> map<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
cool what they did with that map and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.390 
cool what they did with that map and
it's<00:00:27.510> only<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.080> get<00:00:28.289> better<00:00:28.619> based<00:00:29.189> on

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
it's only going to get better based on

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.370 
it's only going to get better based on
what<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:29.670> seeing<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.420> lot<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.019> people<00:00:31.289> do

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
what I'm seeing here a lot of people do

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.020 
what I'm seeing here a lot of people do
have<00:00:31.470> mixed<00:00:31.769> opinions<00:00:31.859> but<00:00:32.369> i<00:00:32.430> think<00:00:32.850> this

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
have mixed opinions but i think this

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.549 
have mixed opinions but i think this
easter<00:00:33.450> egg<00:00:33.570> definitely<00:00:34.050> will<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.320> out<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
easter egg definitely will go out with a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
easter egg definitely will go out with a
bang<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.040> we're<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.700> go<00:00:35.820> over<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.090> few

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
bang and we're going to go over a few

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.080 
bang and we're going to go over a few
certain<00:00:37.320> parts<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.250> trailer<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.910> will

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
certain parts of the trailer that will

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.209 
certain parts of the trailer that will
definitely<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.930> huge<00:00:40.410> part<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> easter

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
definitely be a huge part of the easter

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.340 
definitely be a huge part of the easter
egg<00:00:41.340> depending<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.300> i<00:00:42.540> think<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.870> all<00:00:43.050> revolves

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
egg depending on i think it all revolves

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
egg depending on i think it all revolves
around<00:00:43.590> us<00:00:43.860> okay<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.700> obviously<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.390> oz

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
around us okay so obviously we have oz

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.319 
around us okay so obviously we have oz
as<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.079> zombie<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.120> new

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
as a zombie and then we have the new

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.090 
as a zombie and then we have the new
zombie<00:00:48.629> alien<00:00:49.230> boss<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.680> see<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> end

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
zombie alien boss that we see at the end

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.770 
zombie alien boss that we see at the end
of<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> EXO<00:00:50.550> zombies<00:00:50.579> trailer<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:51.449> both

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
of the EXO zombies trailer and then both

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.959 
of the EXO zombies trailer and then both
those<00:00:52.050> guys<00:00:52.260> definitely<00:00:52.949> will<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.340> huge<00:00:53.760> in

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
those guys definitely will be huge in

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.369 
those guys definitely will be huge in
the<00:00:54.210> actual<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.660> stirring<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.230> we're

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the actual you stirring of what we're

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.139 
the actual you stirring of what we're
doing<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.800> then<00:00:55.920> how<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.100> end<00:00:56.430> off<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.879> easter

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
doing and then how we end off the easter

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.319 
doing and then how we end off the easter
egg<00:00:57.239> because<00:00:58.109> my<00:00:58.800> theory<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.460> we<00:01:00.120> can

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
egg because my theory is that we can

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.799 
egg because my theory is that we can
potentially<00:01:00.480> bring<00:01:01.199> us<00:01:01.410> back<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.010> life<00:01:02.250> um

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
potentially bring us back to life um

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.630 
potentially bring us back to life um
through<00:01:03.809> its<00:01:04.019> advanced<00:01:04.619> technology<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.430> this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
through its advanced technology in this

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
through its advanced technology in this
underwater<00:01:06.060> base<00:01:06.390> obviously<00:01:07.380> that's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
underwater base obviously that's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.800 
underwater base obviously that's
far-fetched<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.490> i<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:08.850> our<00:01:09.270> purpose

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
far-fetched but i do think our purpose

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.830 
far-fetched but i do think our purpose
is<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.229> save<00:01:10.619> eyes<00:01:10.860> um<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.270> think<00:01:12.659> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
is to save eyes um you know I think it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.289 
is to save eyes um you know I think it
can<00:01:13.229> very<00:01:13.439> well<00:01:13.530> happen<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.880> think<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
can very well happen and I think that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.060 
can very well happen and I think that
you<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> old<00:01:15.720> true<00:01:15.960> wants<00:01:16.259> oz<00:01:16.409> back<00:01:16.740> some

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
you know the old true wants oz back some

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.830 
you know the old true wants oz back some
way<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.340> another<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.119> all<00:01:18.240> want<00:01:18.420> oz<00:01:18.540> back

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
way or another and we all want oz back

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.210 
way or another and we all want oz back
and<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.650> advanced<00:01:20.130> warfare

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and I think you know advanced warfare

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.130 
and I think you know advanced warfare
and<00:01:20.729> sledgehammer<00:01:21.270> games<00:01:21.299> would<00:01:21.630> really<00:01:21.930> make

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and sledgehammer games would really make

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.929 
and sledgehammer games would really make
us<00:01:22.320> happy<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:22.920> surprised<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:23.729> oh<00:01:23.820> my

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
us happy and surprised and like oh my

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.480 
us happy and surprised and like oh my
god<00:01:24.090> oz<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.330> back<00:01:24.720> if<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:25.860> actually<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.340> that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
god oz is back if they actually do that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
god oz is back if they actually do that
for<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> Easter<00:01:27.210> egg<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:27.900> that's<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
for the Easter egg and if that's the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.660 
for the Easter egg and if that's the
main<00:01:28.500> goal<00:01:28.530> for<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.070> Easter<00:01:29.310> egg<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> think

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
main goal for the Easter egg and I think

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
main goal for the Easter egg and I think
that<00:01:29.759> would<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> pretty<00:01:30.150> cool<00:01:30.479> um<00:01:30.780> easter

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
that would be a pretty cool um easter

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.560 
that would be a pretty cool um easter
egg<00:01:31.710> i<00:01:31.979> guess<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.640> general<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:33.180> you're

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
egg i guess in general because you're

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.830 
egg i guess in general because you're
basically<00:01:33.990> protecting<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.189> zombie<00:01:35.850> um<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
basically protecting this zombie um and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.600 
basically protecting this zombie um and
it's<00:01:37.170> trying<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> attack<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.890> also<00:01:38.400> because

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it's trying to attack you also because

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.190 
it's trying to attack you also because
it's<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> zombie<00:01:39.180> doesn't<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.049> like

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it's a zombie doesn't it's it's not like

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.480 
it's a zombie doesn't it's it's not like
either<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.380> friendly<00:01:40.799> zombie<00:01:41.100> there's<00:01:41.250> no<00:01:41.310> such

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
either a friendly zombie there's no such

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.889 
either a friendly zombie there's no such
thing<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> friendly<00:01:42.060> zombie<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.630> still<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
thing as a friendly zombie it's still a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.109 
thing as a friendly zombie it's still a
zombie<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> odds<00:01:44.520> as<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> zombie

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
zombie but you know the odds as a zombie

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.700 
zombie but you know the odds as a zombie
he<00:01:45.509> doesn't<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:45.990> he's<00:01:46.350> trying<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.649> be

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
he doesn't know that he's trying to be

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.109 
he doesn't know that he's trying to be
saved<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.579> he's<00:01:47.759> still<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.060> be

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
saved so he's still going to be

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.210 
saved so he's still going to be
attacking<00:01:48.390> us<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.170> we're<00:01:49.320> basically<00:01:49.439> gonna<00:01:50.009> be

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
attacking us so we're basically gonna be

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.710 
attacking us so we're basically gonna be
trying<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.820> protect<00:01:51.299> something<00:01:51.509> that's

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
trying to protect something that's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.690 
trying to protect something that's
attacking<00:01:51.990> us<00:01:52.290> well<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> ton<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.520> other

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
attacking us well we have a ton of other

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.190 
attacking us well we have a ton of other
zombies<00:01:54.119> attacking<00:01:54.360> us<00:01:54.570> while<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.110> do

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
zombies attacking us while with to do

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.830 
zombies attacking us while with to do
tasks<00:01:55.530> etc<00:01:56.490> everything<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.479> easter<00:01:57.719> egg

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
tasks etc everything for the easter egg

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600 
tasks etc everything for the easter egg
and<00:01:58.020> i<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.500> big<00:01:58.890> part<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> easter<00:01:59.460> egg

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and i think a big part of the easter egg

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.459 
and i think a big part of the easter egg
while<00:01:59.909> we're<00:02:00.090> protecting<00:02:00.540> eyes<00:02:00.719> as<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> zombie

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
while we're protecting eyes as a zombie

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.700 
while we're protecting eyes as a zombie
would<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.399> protecting<00:02:03.360> us<00:02:03.509> from<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.140> actual

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
would be protecting us from the actual

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.069 
would be protecting us from the actual
zombie<00:02:04.799> boss<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.210> think<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> zombie<00:02:06.899> boss

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
zombie boss and I think the zombie boss

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.619 
zombie boss and I think the zombie boss
will<00:02:07.710> go<00:02:07.890> after<00:02:08.129> eyes<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> big

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
will go after eyes and will be a big

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.510 
will go after eyes and will be a big
threat<00:02:09.929> against<00:02:10.440> oz<00:02:10.619> and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
threat against oz and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.090 
threat against oz and
I think<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.180> know<00:02:12.330> one<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.440> main<00:02:13.620> ways<00:02:13.860> to

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
I think you know one of the main ways to

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.670 
I think you know one of the main ways to
probably<00:02:14.430> fail<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.970> Easter<00:02:15.330> egg<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:16.530> to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
probably fail the Easter egg and have to

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.160 
probably fail the Easter egg and have to
restart<00:02:17.190> would<00:02:17.640> be<00:02:17.880> letting<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.720> huge<00:02:19.110> a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
restart would be letting this huge a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.260 
restart would be letting this huge a
zombie<00:02:19.470> boss<00:02:19.620> actually<00:02:20.160> get<00:02:20.280> two<00:02:20.370> eyes<00:02:20.520> now

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
zombie boss actually get two eyes now

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.110 
zombie boss actually get two eyes now
the<00:02:22.230> zombie<00:02:22.560> boss<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.190> way<00:02:23.340> he<00:02:23.610> spawns<00:02:23.940> in

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
the zombie boss the way he spawns in

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.790 
the zombie boss the way he spawns in
would<00:02:24.360> be<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.510> few<00:02:24.840> different<00:02:25.170> ideas<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.650> a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
would be a few different ideas here a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.640 
would be a few different ideas here a
few<00:02:26.370> different<00:02:26.490> ways<00:02:26.760> at<00:02:26.970> least<00:02:27.230> now<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.440> could

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
few different ways at least now it could

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.830 
few different ways at least now it could
be<00:02:28.710> every<00:02:29.160> few<00:02:29.370> rounds<00:02:29.580> where<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.450> see<00:02:30.690> this

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
be every few rounds where you see this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.570 
be every few rounds where you see this
guy<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.440> then<00:02:31.710> every<00:02:31.950> few<00:02:32.100> rounds<00:02:32.340> you

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
guy and then every few rounds you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.910 
guy and then every few rounds you
literally<00:02:32.850> have<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.810> four<00:02:33.930> players

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
literally have to have all four players

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.400 
literally have to have all four players
whatever<00:02:35.370> you're<00:02:35.640> doing<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.120> oz<00:02:36.600> at<00:02:36.900> all<00:02:37.140> times

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
the map at least that's what I think but

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.950 
the map at least that's what I think but
if<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.700> start<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.120> easter-egg<00:03:00.210> every<00:03:00.750> few

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.540 
if you start the easter-egg every few

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
for research i guess and they figure out

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.050 
for research i guess and they figure out
how<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.350> bring<00:03:46.560> him<00:03:46.709> back<00:03:46.740> or<00:03:47.100> they<00:03:47.160> already

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
doing that right at the end and then you

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.699

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
think it's pretty damn good I think it's

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.990 
think it's pretty damn good I think it's
gonna<00:04:04.440> be<00:04:04.500> actually<00:04:04.830> really<00:04:05.160> exciting<00:04:05.820> that

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
gonna be actually really exciting that

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.610 
gonna be actually really exciting that
actually<00:04:06.330> happens<00:04:06.660> because<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.380> fact

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
actually happens because just the fact

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.350 
actually happens because just the fact
that<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.860> have<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.070> protect<00:04:08.489> protect<00:04:09.120> this
