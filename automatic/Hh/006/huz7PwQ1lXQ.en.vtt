 beauty talks here is french with 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.900
 one more tip for you today the tip is 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:21.320
 referring to the lamp of the originals 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.400
 panel is the one from jailton he asked 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.359
 many lamps 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.509
 We need to put it to this. 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.630
 replacing to have the lighting in that 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.310
 panel or store exchange by led 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.360
 I have here two models to show 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.940
 for you 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:45.199
 the store is the one here is original she 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:49.010
 comes something like the same 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:01:02.420
 only the body is larger because it has 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:01:03.890
 eight years there, replacing the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.370
 of this panel are how many 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.710
 works one 23 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:14.710
 Okay, we're going to need three 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.460
 placing LED's 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.049
 here we have one of the odometer is a panel 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.140
 of automatic cars 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:28.909
 it has here another one another display 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.700
 that has to the place because these panels 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.890
 are universal display outside here 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.649
 to inform the number of the marches if 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.640
 You 're the first to the second. 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:47.750
 so what I 'm going to do I do not need 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.439
 remove the dashboard only if I 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.899
 want to have a greater freedom of 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.180
 work but it's very simple it will arrive 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:01.180
 here with pliers do not you like 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.180
 connect here arrived it good production 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.200
 pick up with pliers or the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.880
 slot you can ask me if 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.800
 It was small but I still prefer it. 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.670
 so the application with pliers have pull 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:21.489
 here's another spin too pulled 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.680
 ok we have here is the led bulb 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.819
 Look at the time, we gotta have it. 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.760
 careful with the measure 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:35.350
 so that it is not big and does not 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:38.709
 passing here in the right hole 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.140
 in the hole that fits the beauty bulbs 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.019
 This is a white led I 'll be 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.420
 replacing the led beauty 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:54.430
 only happens my panel panel 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:58.269
 Celtic has an orange coloration father 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.690
 from some back you also notice 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.519
 when there is the panel is of the color floor with 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.940
 that orange 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.459
 Do you know that you have a painting behind you? 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.069
 of the acetate when it is the same 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.530
 logic that yellow lamp 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:19.630
 You know you do not have there then you 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.420
 have standing here is lighting 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:27.670
 the right original color panel 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:31.570
 but they come with a reducer 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:35.700
 brightness that when you place the 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.250
 led lamp gets very weak as well 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.980
 chatinho then if you really want 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.650
 place and place the lamp of this 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.010
 fifth lamp 35 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:53.200
 you can be taking this opportunity to 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:56.100
 removing all screws 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.100
 here behind 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:08.620

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:12.850

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.250
 I'm taking the pointers up 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.019
 here the acetate is removing with 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.190
 Chinese reducer 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:24.159
