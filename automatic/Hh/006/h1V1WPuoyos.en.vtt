00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
know I like that the killstreaks aren't

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.260 
know I like that the killstreaks aren't
as<00:01:29.649> overpowered<00:01:30.399> as<00:01:30.520> what<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.819> was<00:01:30.939> in<00:01:31.119> black

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
as overpowered as what it was in black

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.949 
as overpowered as what it was in black
ops<00:01:31.479> 2<00:01:31.630> but<00:01:32.020> with<00:01:32.770> that<00:01:32.979> it's<00:01:33.159> kind<00:01:33.459> of<00:01:33.959> the

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
ops 2 but with that it's kind of the

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:38.160 
ops 2 but with that it's kind of the
killstreaks<00:01:36.299> they<00:01:37.299> are<00:01:37.539> incredibly

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
killstreaks they are incredibly

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.080 
killstreaks they are incredibly
difficult<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:39.039> get<00:01:39.219> on<00:01:39.340> this<00:01:39.459> game<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:39.909> don't

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
difficult to get on this game you don't

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.550 
difficult to get on this game you don't
get<00:01:40.209> as<00:01:40.299> many<00:01:40.450> points<00:01:40.689> from<00:01:41.200> your<00:01:41.259> kill

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
get as many points from your kill

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.410 
get as many points from your kill
streets<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.099> know<00:01:42.219> seeking<00:01:42.670> kind<00:01:42.909> of<00:01:43.060> ladder

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
streets you know seeking kind of ladder

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.139 
streets you know seeking kind of ladder
up<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:43.749> kill<00:01:43.929> streaks<00:01:44.229> like<00:01:44.349> we<00:01:45.279> all<00:01:45.459> did<00:01:45.969> on

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
up you kill streaks like we all did on

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.649 
up you kill streaks like we all did on
black<00:01:46.359> ops<00:01:46.569> 2<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.179> killstreaks

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
black ops 2 and what the killstreaks

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.620 
black ops 2 and what the killstreaks
don't<00:01:49.869> really<00:01:50.109> do<00:01:50.289> much<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.939> I<00:01:52.240> think<00:01:52.450> that

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
don't really do much and I think that

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.629 
don't really do much and I think that
really<00:01:52.659> if<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.499> do<00:01:53.799> will<00:01:54.069> enough<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.459> get<00:01:54.609> a

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639 
really if you do will enough to get a

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.159 
really if you do will enough to get a
score<00:01:54.909> streak<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.359> score<00:01:55.630> screeches<00:01:56.049> at

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:56.169 
score streak the score screeches at

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:57.749 
score streak the score screeches at
least<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.679> know<00:01:56.799> get<00:01:57.009> you<00:01:57.099> a<00:01:57.159> couple<00:01:57.459> of<00:01:57.490> kills

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759

wrong<00:03:24.460> but<00:03:24.700> as<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:25.030> said<00:03:25.090> if<00:03:25.480> you're<00:03:25.900> not<00:03:26.020> very

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
wrong but as I said if you're not very

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.960 
wrong but as I said if you're not very
good<00:03:26.350> oncology<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.220> you've<00:03:27.400> struggled<00:03:27.730> in

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
good oncology and you've struggled in

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.470 
good oncology and you've struggled in
previous<00:03:28.360> titles<00:03:28.890> you're<00:03:29.890> gonna<00:03:30.010> do<00:03:30.220> in<00:03:30.670> my

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
previous titles you're gonna do in my

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.240 
previous titles you're gonna do in my
opinion<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.990> bit<00:03:32.200> better<00:03:32.350> on<00:03:32.620> advanced<00:03:33.160> warfare

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
opinion a bit better on advanced warfare

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.880 
opinion a bit better on advanced warfare

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
look at this game a card let's see where

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.770 
look at this game a card let's see where
he's<00:04:55.450> located<00:04:55.630> in<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:58.060> majority<00:04:58.480> of<00:04:58.510> time

around<00:05:04.540> 90<00:05:05.470> Meg<00:05:05.740> download<00:05:06.280> I<00:05:06.310> believe<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.730> don't

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
around 90 Meg download I believe I don't

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.460 
around 90 Meg download I believe I don't
know<00:05:07.000> if<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.180> top<00:05:07.390> Mia<00:05:07.570> but<00:05:07.780> it's<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:07.990> fastest

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
know if the top Mia but it's the fastest

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.940 
know if the top Mia but it's the fastest
any<00:05:08.680> way<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:08.890> can<00:05:09.130> get<00:05:09.370> so<00:05:10.240> in<00:05:10.360> theory<00:05:10.950> it

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
any way you can get so in theory it

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.860 
any way you can get so in theory it
should<00:05:12.010> at<00:05:12.370> least<00:05:12.610> be<00:05:12.940> an<00:05:13.030> even<00:05:13.330> gunfire<00:05:13.690> I

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
should at least be an even gunfire I

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.470 
should at least be an even gunfire I
should<00:05:14.140> never<00:05:14.470> be<00:05:15.340> behind<00:05:15.730> on<00:05:15.940> that<00:05:16.090> gun<00:05:16.270> fight

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
should never be behind on that gun fight

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.470 
should never be behind on that gun fight
so<00:05:16.720> this<00:05:16.900> my<00:05:17.110> only<00:05:17.260> concern<00:05:17.880> obviously<00:05:18.880> it's

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
so this my only concern obviously it's

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.760 
so this my only concern obviously it's
the<00:05:19.510> first<00:05:19.780> day<00:05:19.960> the<00:05:20.080> games<00:05:20.320> out<00:05:20.560> there's

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
the first day the games out there's

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.140 
the first day the games out there's
going<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:20.950> be<00:05:21.010> a<00:05:21.070> hell<00:05:21.310> of<00:05:21.370> a<00:05:21.520> lot<00:05:21.640> of<00:05:21.700> people

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
going to be a hell of a lot of people

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.660 
going to be a hell of a lot of people
playing<00:05:22.450> it<00:05:22.660> in<00:05:22.870> so<00:05:23.860> its<00:05:23.980> prey<00:05:24.130> just<00:05:24.370> due<00:05:24.610> to

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
playing it in so its prey just due to

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.470 
playing it in so its prey just due to
the<00:05:24.940> load<00:05:25.450> on<00:05:25.690> their<00:05:25.930> servers<00:05:26.380> at<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.560> moment

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
the load on their servers at the moment

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.940 
the load on their servers at the moment
but<00:05:28.480> like<00:05:28.660> i<00:05:28.780> said<00:05:28.810> yes<00:05:29.200> Lee<00:05:29.470> and<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:29.800> day

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
but like i said yes Lee and the day

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.410
