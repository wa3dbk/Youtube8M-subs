00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
evolved since doing the Big Finish stuff

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.370 
evolved since doing the Big Finish stuff
and<00:04:05.859> it's<00:04:06.670> almost<00:04:07.060> as<00:04:07.239> if<00:04:07.269> we've<00:04:07.600> had<00:04:07.780> three

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
and it's almost as if we've had three

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.199 
and it's almost as if we've had three
series<00:04:08.799> of<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.069> on<00:04:09.280> screen<00:04:09.609> anyway<00:04:10.000> because

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
series of you on screen anyway because

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.090
