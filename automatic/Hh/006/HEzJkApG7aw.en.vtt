so<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:03.840> you're<00:02:03.990> sprinting<00:02:04.619> down<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.310> street

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
so if you're sprinting down the street

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.580 
so if you're sprinting down the street
and<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> sudden<00:02:06.869> you're<00:02:07.170> running<00:02:07.500> out

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
and all of a sudden you're running out

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.900 
and all of a sudden you're running out
of<00:02:07.710> breath<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.340> can't<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.729> any

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
of breath and you just can't go any

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.479 
of breath and you just can't go any
further<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.780> not<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.229> lack<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.560> oxygen<00:02:11.459> that

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
further it's not the lack of oxygen that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.860 
further it's not the lack of oxygen that
limits<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
limits you it's the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.680 
limits you it's the
lack<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.379> creatine<00:02:13.940> phosphate<00:02:14.940> believe<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.569> or

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
lack of creatine phosphate believe it or

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.780 
lack of creatine phosphate believe it or
not<00:02:15.810> even<00:02:16.110> though<00:02:16.709> you're<00:02:17.040> out<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.430> breath<00:02:17.640> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
not even though you're out of breath and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.830 
not even though you're out of breath and
it<00:02:17.879> feels<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.269> you're<00:02:18.420> dying

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
it feels like you're dying

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.990 
it feels like you're dying
it's<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.230> creatine<00:02:19.890> phosphate<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.700> limits

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it's the creatine phosphate that limits

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.780 
it's the creatine phosphate that limits
you<00:02:21.200> same<00:02:22.200> thing<00:02:22.440> with<00:02:22.560> lifting<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.519> in

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
you same thing with lifting so in

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.089 
you same thing with lifting so in
between<00:02:24.150> heavy<00:02:24.510> sets<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.440> want<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.830> allow

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
between heavy sets we want to allow

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.699 
between heavy sets we want to allow
enough<00:02:26.489> time<00:02:26.519> for<00:02:26.879> our<00:02:27.420> creatine<00:02:28.140> phosphate

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
enough time for our creatine phosphate

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.149 
enough time for our creatine phosphate
to<00:02:28.980> regenerate<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.599> our<00:02:30.870> next<00:02:31.200> lift<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:31.950> can

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
to regenerate so our next lift we can

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.270 
to regenerate so our next lift we can
lift<00:02:32.510> maximally<00:02:33.510> with<00:02:33.900> lots<00:02:34.409> of<00:02:34.620> effort<00:02:35.010> lots

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
lift maximally with lots of effort lots

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.309 
lift maximally with lots of effort lots
of<00:02:35.489> weight<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.090> if<00:02:36.690> you've<00:02:36.840> ever<00:02:36.959> dealt<00:02:37.200> with

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
of weight and if you've ever dealt with

of weight and if you've ever dealt with
these<00:02:37.530> guys<00:02:37.739> were<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.069> hurry<00:02:38.430> up<00:02:38.459> hurry<00:02:38.670> up

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
these guys were like hurry up hurry up

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.520 
these guys were like hurry up hurry up
hurry<00:02:38.970> up<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:39.629> can't<00:02:39.870> lift<00:02:40.079> his<00:02:40.260> heart

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
hurry up you just can't lift his heart

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.979 
hurry up you just can't lift his heart
or<00:02:40.769> lift<00:02:41.010> as<00:02:41.159> heavy<00:02:41.459> yeah<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.209> might<00:02:42.659> be<00:02:42.870> as

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
or lift as heavy yeah you might be as

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.170 
or lift as heavy yeah you might be as
sore<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.799> might<00:02:44.010> keep<00:02:44.310> your<00:02:44.519> pump<00:02:44.879> but<00:02:45.150> a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
sore and you might keep your pump but a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.380 
sore and you might keep your pump but a
pump<00:02:45.510> doesn't<00:02:45.870> make<00:02:46.049> you<00:02:46.230> big<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.910> also<00:02:48.060> have

pump doesn't make you big you also have

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.849 
pump doesn't make you big you also have
to<00:02:48.510> remember<00:02:48.599> this<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.230> our<00:02:49.500> body

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
to remember this that our body

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.770 
to remember this that our body
manufactures<00:02:50.579> creatine<00:02:51.030> phosphate<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.629> get

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
manufactures creatine phosphate you get

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.680 
manufactures creatine phosphate you get
creatine<00:02:52.170> phosphate<00:02:52.650> from<00:02:52.920> me<00:02:53.329> but<00:02:54.329> it's<00:02:54.510> not

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
creatine phosphate from me but it's not

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.539 
creatine phosphate from me but it's not
quite<00:02:55.109> the<00:02:55.379> same<00:02:55.410> amount<00:02:55.950> as<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.160> get<00:02:56.370> when

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
quite the same amount as you get when

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.280 
quite the same amount as you get when

to me whoever is cheapest and what
you're<00:03:03.060> trying<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.390> do<00:03:03.599> is<00:03:03.840> super<00:03:04.349> saturate

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
you're trying to do is super saturate

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.059 
you're trying to do is super saturate
the<00:03:05.400> muscle<00:03:05.909> with<00:03:06.180> creatine<00:03:06.629> phosphate<00:03:07.379> so

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
the muscle with creatine phosphate so

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.729 
the muscle with creatine phosphate so
after<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> couple<00:03:08.790> weeks<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.299> notice<00:03:09.629> wow<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.500> do

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
after a couple weeks you notice wow I do

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.339 
after a couple weeks you notice wow I do
get<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> little<00:03:11.430> more<00:03:11.670> pumped<00:03:12.180> my<00:03:12.750> recovery<00:03:13.140> is

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
get a little more pumped my recovery is

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.170 
get a little more pumped my recovery is
a<00:03:13.470> little<00:03:13.829> better<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.370> I'm<00:03:14.519> able<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.819> squeeze

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
a little better and I'm able to squeeze

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.479 
a little better and I'm able to squeeze
out<00:03:15.390> one<00:03:15.840> or<00:03:15.959> two<00:03:15.989> more<00:03:16.349> reps<00:03:16.590> I've<00:03:16.829> got<00:03:17.130> better

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
out one or two more reps I've got better

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.059 
out one or two more reps I've got better
power<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.329> strength<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.079> that's<00:03:19.650> because

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
power and strength and that's because

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.400 
power and strength and that's because
you<00:03:20.579> are<00:03:20.609> saturating<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.450> muscle<00:03:21.870> or<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.049> super

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
you are saturating the muscle or a super

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.949 
you are saturating the muscle or a super
saturated<00:03:22.620> muscle<00:03:23.370> with<00:03:23.819> creatine<00:03:24.239> phosphate

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
saturated muscle with creatine phosphate

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.900 
saturated muscle with creatine phosphate
once<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.530> muscle<00:03:25.889> is<00:03:26.069> loaded<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:26.669> if<00:03:26.790> you

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
once the muscle is loaded and if you

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.640 
once the muscle is loaded and if you
guys<00:03:27.060> are<00:03:27.269> old<00:03:27.389> enough<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.750> remember<00:03:28.139> when

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
guys are old enough you remember when

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.440 
guys are old enough you remember when
creatine<00:03:29.190> was<00:03:29.370> first<00:03:29.609> brought<00:03:29.819> out<00:03:29.849> they

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
creatine was first brought out they

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.000 
creatine was first brought out they
would<00:03:30.599> say<00:03:30.780> there's<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.079> loading<00:03:31.349> phase<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.950> a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
would say there's a loading phase of a

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.409 
would say there's a loading phase of a
week<00:03:32.190> or<00:03:32.370> two<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.730> then<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.120> go<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.329> a

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
week or two and then you go to a

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.199 
week or two and then you go to a
maintenance<00:03:33.720> phase<00:03:34.169> so<00:03:35.099> once<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.090> have

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
maintenance phase so once you have

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.330 
maintenance phase so once you have
saturated<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.930> muscle<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.410> only<00:03:37.560> need<00:03:37.829> three

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
saturated the muscle you only need three

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.610 
saturated the muscle you only need three
or<00:03:38.370> four<00:03:38.459> or<00:03:38.760> four<00:03:38.940> or<00:03:39.030> five<00:03:39.180> grams<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.780> day<00:03:39.810> of

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
or four or four or five grams a day of

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.670 
or four or four or five grams a day of
creatine<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.370> maintain<00:03:41.849> that<00:03:42.030> level<00:03:42.410> this<00:03:43.410> is

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
creatine to maintain that level this is

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.330 
creatine to maintain that level this is
also<00:03:44.030> one<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.180> main<00:03:45.389> reasons<00:03:45.959> why<00:03:46.650> it

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
also one of the main reasons why it

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.520 
also one of the main reasons why it
really<00:03:47.549> doesn't<00:03:47.970> matter<00:03:48.090> when<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.989> take<00:03:49.290> your

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
really doesn't matter when you take your

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.430 
really doesn't matter when you take your
creatine<00:03:50.099> because<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.750> amount<00:03:52.109> or<00:03:52.349> the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
creatine because the amount or the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.339 
creatine because the amount or the
levels<00:03:52.949> have<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:53.310> build<00:03:53.639> up<00:03:53.879> in<00:03:54.030> your<00:03:54.060> body<00:03:54.419> you

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
levels have to build up in your body you

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.990 
levels have to build up in your body you
can<00:03:55.470> take<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.709> before<00:03:55.829> your<00:03:56.190> workout<00:03:56.549> after

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
can take it before your workout after

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.250 
can take it before your workout after
your<00:03:57.090> workout<00:03:57.389> it<00:03:57.599> really<00:03:57.810> doesn't<00:03:58.109> matter

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
your workout it really doesn't matter

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.110 
your workout it really doesn't matter
because<00:03:59.160> if<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.549> levels<00:03:59.879> have<00:03:59.970> not

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
because if the levels have not

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.490 
because if the levels have not
accumulated<00:04:00.750> in<00:04:00.870> your<00:04:00.900> body<00:04:01.139> you're<00:04:01.349> not

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
accumulated in your body you're not

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.770 
accumulated in your body you're not
going<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.680> receive<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.190> benefits<00:04:02.609> of<00:04:02.819> them<00:04:03.120> so

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
going to receive the benefits of them so

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.270 
going to receive the benefits of them so
again<00:04:04.049> this<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:04.650> something<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.129> need<00:04:05.220> to

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
again this is something you need to

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.400 
again this is something you need to
remember<00:04:05.819> when<00:04:06.449> you're<00:04:06.599> working<00:04:06.629> out<00:04:07.139> light

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
remember when you're working out light

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.809 
remember when you're working out light
when<00:04:07.680> you're<00:04:07.799> warming<00:04:08.099> up<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.459> go<00:04:08.639> a<00:04:08.669> little

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
when you're warming up you go a little

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.819 
when you're warming up you go a little
faster<00:04:09.389> because<00:04:09.510> you're<00:04:09.840> not<00:04:09.959> again

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
faster because you're not again

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.110 
faster because you're not again
stressing<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.519> muscle<00:04:11.849> you're<00:04:11.970> not

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
stressing the muscle you're not

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.539 
stressing the muscle you're not
utilizing<00:04:12.750> all<00:04:13.139> your<00:04:13.500> strength<00:04:13.889> you're<00:04:14.400> not

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
utilizing all your strength you're not

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.279 
utilizing all your strength you're not
using<00:04:14.819> up<00:04:15.060> all<00:04:15.150> your<00:04:15.269> creatine<00:04:15.750> phosphate

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
using up all your creatine phosphate

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.289 
using up all your creatine phosphate
because<00:04:16.799> again<00:04:17.099> you're<00:04:17.280> not<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.880> know<00:04:18.030> it's

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
because again you're not you know it's

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.060 
because again you're not you know it's
not<00:04:18.389> maximal<00:04:18.870> effort<00:04:19.139> but<00:04:19.260> once<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.709> begin<00:04:19.949> to

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
not maximal effort but once you begin to

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.199 
not maximal effort but once you begin to
hit<00:04:20.220> your<00:04:20.370> workings

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
hit your workings

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.499 
hit your workings
that's<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.959> gotta<00:04:22.109> slow<00:04:22.620> down<00:04:22.650> your<00:04:23.509> recovery

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
that's you gotta slow down your recovery

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.300 
that's you gotta slow down your recovery
time<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.870> got<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.080> slow<00:04:25.410> down<00:04:25.590> your<00:04:25.830> workout

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
time you got to slow down your workout

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.249 
time you got to slow down your workout

between<00:04:28.410> sets<00:04:28.979> it's<00:04:29.940> nothing<00:04:30.330> there's

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419
