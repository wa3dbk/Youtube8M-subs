 pan often forgotten from the second war 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.100
 global Allied bombing that 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.540
 have caused thousands of deaths among 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.730
 French civilians in big cities 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.560
 occupied by the Nazis today even 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.630
 in nantes we commemorate one of these 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.900
 bombing it was 70 years ago today 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.179
 for the day September 16, 1943 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.220
 the inhabitants paid a very high price 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.839
 heavy to shelling are his targets and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.800

 hannedouche the heart of nantes 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.530
 wiped out in a quarter of an hour that was the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.580
 September 16, 1943 in the middle of the afternoon 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.050
 there had been some 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.330
 bombing alert 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.390
 but nothing to do with this deluge of fire 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.490
 without being suspicious of most 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.180
 people had stayed outside to contemplate 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.180
 Allied planes 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.840
 one thousand two hundred bombs dropped by 147 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.680
 American flying fortresses go 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.680
 to fall on the city 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.950
 taken by surprise the nantes look for 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:09.020
 protect by all means 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.750
 I want to arrive in the cellar and there we 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.180
 found five brave neighbors and we 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.399
 got closer to each other 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.920
 we stood together against 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.289
 the other one we lowered our heads and at each 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.330
 time or that would take it burned 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.909
 it was scared 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.659
 laughter oh no we got scared 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.110
 I was scared I'm not afraid to say it 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.840
 1943 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.399
 the war is at a turning point the purpose of 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.289
 these allied shelling on the coasts 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.380
 French and well to prepare the 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.470
 land for a future landing the b 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.690
 17 targets the railway stations the bridges the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.020
 port facilities and factories 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.799
 who work everything for the Germans 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.750
 balance sheet nine hundred dead this September 16th 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.149
 508 days later in a second 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.189
 vague enough to fuel the propaganda of the 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.840
 Gingham diet against the Anglo 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.039
 US 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.319
 here are what's left of the most 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.420
 merchants of the great city located 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.620
 far from any military objective or 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.810
 industrial 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.100
 well aware of the disastrous effect of 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.970
 their bombing on populations 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.980
 French 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.590
 the Americans are trying to thwart 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.540
 vichy propaganda by launching 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.970
 thousands of leaflets before the bombing 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.530
 from the city 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.820
 he recalls the war aims he is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.380
 to denounce the occupation 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.150
 german police vichy 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.430
 so it shows that the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.280
 bombings make sense in the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.260
 Fascist fight but basically 70 years 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.760
 later if the memory stays sharp 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.320
 point of resentment the time passes the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.610
 people around you you wanted 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.740
 a little to the Americans 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.160
 at first I think the legends 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.290
 wanted and after there's liberation is 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.680
 arrived not believe that today and 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.650
 many jeans guy who rockers 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.230
 reggae desk, and in turn its 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.170
 shameful allied crews also suffered from 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.740
 heavy losses during the second 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.420
 world War 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.760
 nearly forty thousand of them are 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.510

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.500
