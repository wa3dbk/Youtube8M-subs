00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.270 
actually like sheltered in a sense where
he<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:42.750> thought<00:01:42.930> humans<00:01:43.590> are<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:43.770> evil<00:01:44.159> I'm

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
guessing and I guess he got brought up

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.389 
guessing and I guess he got brought up
that<00:01:46.470> way<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.710> something<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.100> that's<00:01:47.250> why<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
that way or something and that's why it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.649 
that way or something and that's why it
was<00:01:47.490> attacking<00:01:47.939> him<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.509> he<00:01:48.570> never

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
was attacking him was like that he never

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.450 
was attacking him was like that he never
got<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.899> actually<00:01:49.110> understand<00:01:49.740> humans<00:01:50.280> is

got to actually understand humans is
what<00:01:50.880> I'm<00:01:50.970> thinking<00:01:51.360> which<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.960> why<00:01:52.110> since

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
what I'm thinking which is why since

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.830 
what I'm thinking which is why since
he's<00:01:52.829> now<00:01:53.009> cueing<00:01:53.399> himself<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.970> he's<00:01:54.060> around

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.080 
this in last my last with you that I
think<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.129> I<00:03:09.159> wanted<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.459> try<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.669> be<00:03:09.819> thrown

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
think so I wanted to try to be thrown

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.849 
think so I wanted to try to be thrown
the<00:03:10.329> king<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:11.049> demon<00:03:11.319> king<00:03:11.469> so<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.680> can<00:03:11.829> just

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
the king the demon king so I can just

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.530 
the king the demon king so I can just
take<00:03:12.099> over<00:03:12.280> into<00:03:12.519> Ocelot<00:03:12.909> which<00:03:13.329> while

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
take over into Ocelot which while

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.999 
take over into Ocelot which while
assuming<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.139> it's<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.439> demon<00:03:14.709> general

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:15.009 
assuming and it's the demon general

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:16.649 
assuming and it's the demon general
Lucifer<00:03:15.519> me<00:03:15.669> thought<00:03:15.909> he<00:03:16.000> was<00:03:16.150> dead<00:03:16.359> but<00:03:16.540> he's

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
Lucifer me thought he was dead but he's

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.050 
Lucifer me thought he was dead but he's
acting<00:03:16.959> alive<00:03:17.199> and<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:18.310> guess<00:03:18.729> that's<00:03:18.879> why<00:03:19.000> I'm

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
acting alive and I guess that's why I'm

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.429 
acting alive and I guess that's why I'm
thinking<00:03:19.209> again<00:03:19.720> that's<00:03:19.900> what<00:03:19.989> I'm<00:03:20.049> thinking

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
thinking again that's what I'm thinking

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.129 
thinking again that's what I'm thinking
he<00:03:20.680> was<00:03:20.859> probably<00:03:21.099> one<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.579> causes<00:03:21.729> of<00:03:22.139> mal

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
he was probably one of the causes of mal

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.229 
he was probably one of the causes of mal
like<00:03:23.620> trying<00:03:23.979> like<00:03:24.280> being<00:03:24.609> evil<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.030> stuff

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
like trying like being evil and stuff

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.580 
like trying like being evil and stuff
and<00:03:25.359> not<00:03:25.479> trying<00:03:25.689> to<00:03:25.750> understand<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.199> humans

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
and not trying to understand the humans

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.429 
and not trying to understand the humans
because<00:03:27.220> understanding<00:03:27.729> humans<00:03:28.060> now<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:29.290> is

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:29.439 
because understanding humans now this is

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.170 
because understanding humans now this is
this<00:03:29.889> was<00:03:30.069> Shane<00:03:30.340> changing<00:03:30.790> him<00:03:30.970> right<00:03:31.150> now

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
this was Shane changing him right now

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.030 
this was Shane changing him right now
because<00:03:31.569> he's<00:03:31.689> understanding<00:03:32.290> humming<00:03:32.560> being

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
because he's understanding humming being

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.679 
because he's understanding humming being
around<00:03:33.340> them<00:03:33.609> and<00:03:33.729> stuff<00:03:33.939> you<00:03:34.150> never<00:03:34.269> act<00:03:34.540> if

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
around them and stuff you never act if

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.539 
around them and stuff you never act if
I'd<00:03:34.810> been<00:03:34.959> around<00:03:35.049> humans<00:03:35.319> beforehand<00:03:36.009> so<00:03:36.189> I

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
I'd been around humans beforehand so I

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.460 
I'd been around humans beforehand so I
think<00:03:36.849> you<00:03:37.060> just<00:03:37.090> had<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.989> same<00:03:38.139> notion

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
think you just had the same notion

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.949 
think you just had the same notion
although<00:03:38.769> these<00:03:38.979> are<00:03:39.159> all<00:03:39.280> from<00:03:39.689> evil<00:03:40.689> people

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
although these are all from evil people

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:41.999 
although these are all from evil people
modules<00:03:41.290> kill<00:03:41.470> him<00:03:41.590> or<00:03:41.680> something<00:03:41.889> that's

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:42.009 
modules kill him or something that's

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:44.580 
modules kill him or something that's
that's<00:03:42.519> what<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:42.729> problem<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.509> okay<00:03:44.229> yeah

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
that's what the problem is so okay yeah

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.999 
that's what the problem is so okay yeah
