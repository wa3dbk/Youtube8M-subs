at<00:05:10.900> different<00:05:11.169> times<00:05:11.379> I<00:05:11.710> assume<00:05:12.189> they're<00:05:12.400> not

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
at different times I assume they're not

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.119 
at different times I assume they're not
but<00:05:13.059> that's<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.419> way<00:05:13.509> it<00:05:13.659> happened<00:05:14.080> so<00:05:14.379> I<00:05:14.680> just

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
but that's the way it happened so I just

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:16.049 
but that's the way it happened so I just
did<00:05:15.309> it<00:05:15.430> I<00:05:15.580> thought<00:05:15.729> it<00:05:15.789> was<00:05:15.879> kind<00:05:16.029> of

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:16.059 
did it I thought it was kind of

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:18.600 
did it I thought it was kind of
interesting<00:05:16.569> that<00:05:16.809> garage<00:05:17.529> would<00:05:17.740> yell<00:05:18.009> at

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
interesting that garage would yell at

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.640 
interesting that garage would yell at
the<00:05:19.270> end<00:05:21.180> afterwards<00:05:22.180> it's<00:05:22.270> kind<00:05:22.479> of<00:05:22.509> like<00:05:22.659> hey

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
the end afterwards it's kind of like hey

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.649 
the end afterwards it's kind of like hey
look<00:05:24.069> at<00:05:24.219> me<00:05:24.490> kind<00:05:24.939> of<00:05:24.969> thing<00:05:25.180> you<00:05:25.300> know<00:05:25.330> I
