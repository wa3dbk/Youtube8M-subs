00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.960 
principal it's like yep they're trying
to<00:03:13.019> expel<00:03:13.290> us<00:03:13.319> that's<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:14.250> only<00:03:14.519> way<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.670> think

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
to expel us that's the only way I think

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.039 
to expel us that's the only way I think
I'll<00:03:15.060> probably<00:03:15.239> get<00:03:15.599> them<00:03:15.750> out<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.870> this

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
I'll probably get them out of this

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.050 
I'll probably get them out of this
situation<00:03:16.260> most<00:03:16.950> likely<00:03:17.400> it'll<00:03:17.639> be<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.910> girl

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
situation most likely it'll be the girl

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.699 
situation most likely it'll be the girl
that<00:03:18.299> was<00:03:18.420> what<00:03:18.569> Shingo<00:03:18.989> for<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.440> past<00:03:19.590> couple

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
that was what Shingo for the past couple

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.069 
that was what Shingo for the past couple
episodes<00:03:20.250> actually<00:03:20.400> that's<00:03:20.730> probably<00:03:21.079> where

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
episodes actually that's probably where

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.020 
episodes actually that's probably where
it's<00:03:22.230> gonna<00:03:22.380> go<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.859> don't<00:03:23.220> want<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.670> assume

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
it's gonna go I don't want to assume

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.059 
it's gonna go I don't want to assume
that's<00:03:24.359> where<00:03:24.540> it's<00:03:24.630> gonna<00:03:24.720> go<00:03:24.930> because<00:03:25.290> with

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
that's where it's gonna go because with

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.920 
that's where it's gonna go because with
the<00:03:26.190> girl<00:03:26.400> kind<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:27.000> being<00:03:27.239> together<00:03:27.630> with

obvious the way she was going about the

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.140 
obvious the way she was going about the
way<00:03:55.169> she<00:03:55.290> was<00:03:55.319> acting<00:03:55.440> trying<00:03:56.099> to<00:03:56.370> get<00:03:56.880> him<00:03:57.060> to

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
way she was acting trying to get him to

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.750 
way she was acting trying to get him to
stay<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.329> little<00:03:57.419> bit<00:03:57.599> later<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.799> comes<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.519> pass

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
stay a little bit later it comes to pass

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.940 
stay a little bit later it comes to pass
now<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.329> yes<00:04:00.540> she<00:04:00.780> was<00:04:00.959> setting<00:04:01.380> up<00:04:01.500> Shingo

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950

now that yes she was setting up Shingo
throughout<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.430> entire<00:04:02.730> time<00:04:03.000> she<00:04:03.180> was<00:04:03.269> with

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
throughout the entire time she was with

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.629 
throughout the entire time she was with
him<00:04:03.690> but<00:04:04.109> she<00:04:04.169> does<00:04:04.470> develop<00:04:05.069> feelings<00:04:05.250> for

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
him but she does develop feelings for

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.129 
him but she does develop feelings for
him<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.060> wonder<00:04:06.569> if<00:04:06.720> they're<00:04:06.840> gonna<00:04:06.930> become
