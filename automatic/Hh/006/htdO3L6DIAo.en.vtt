00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.469
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.920
 next issue last we are ready 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.620
 on the road in the Audi S5 Sportback and the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.250
 test for you and look what's good 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.229
 piece to be able to 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.729
 to be provided exactly 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.659
 By the way, we have the audi center 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.159
 Dresden 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.019
 Thank you again for the same 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.700
 Here I am a friend of the technical 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.340
 data and that's why we start with it 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.850
 right here installed in the audi s5 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.800
 Sportback we have the v6 tsi 3 liters 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.990
 because the clear day by a 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.210
 would have to put because this engine is like 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.649
 you would not normally think 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.710
 turbo charged but compressor 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.190
 charged we have 333 ps and one here 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.229
 maximum torque of 440 newton meters 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.229
 he is very sociable he is very calm 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.550
 the driving behavior here above all things 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.860
 actually a bit untypical for 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.020
 a sporty designed vehicle 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.670
 he is really only sporty if 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.920
 So you do not want it until you really do 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.239
 then it comes on then and then 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.929
 is also very good and very fast 

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:47.550
 in my opinion, at least as I said 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.720
 he has a good and good one 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.489
 trunk volume we were yesterday 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.099
 already shopping so week shopping 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:55.050
 it is possible without any problems thanks so 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:55.950
 Let us now show that he is good too 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.979
 can go 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.270
 the only thing I find what you can 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.729
 really have to complain if you go now 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.840
 really drive with several people 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.429
 would like to 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.530
 really can only take a back seat 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.080
 the small so markus has behind 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.140
 absolutely no place 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.610
 he must have but it is just clear 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.010
 I am relatively tall at the back 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.900
 through the creatively sloping roof him 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.610
 Of course not really crowded 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.370
 equipped the audi costs as well 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.840
 We will have about 75,000 euros here 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.390
 but also have some ex 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.080
 something in it about a few can be 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.050
 fight 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.849
 the others are already useful 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.800
 for example the band olufsen soundsystem 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.170
 We have already mentioned a few times 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.140
 that we are already pretty sound 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.459
 fetishists are therefore first time 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.049
 So something really the madness, the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.580
 soundsystem is the absolute hammer for 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.790
 people who like to play music and 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.849
 not only the great sound from the car 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.220
 to recommend every case 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.530
 yes well about the car exclusive leather what 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.150
 Here in it is argue that 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.220
 I do not like the other one me 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.410
 belongs to the latter group something you 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.120
 Do you see that so it exclusively leather 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.739
 You can definitely take my 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.780
 Consider after looking at that certain 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.220
 you want to treat extra but you should 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.420
 maybe good that again 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.440
 taste the need you there myself 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.370
 Decide outside we have here 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.560
 relatively bright white leather fitted to 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.250
 yes i do not like it personally 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.079
 I do not necessarily finds 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.340
 suitable for everyday use, however, maybe 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.099
 a nice word if you have something 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.660
 The s5 might want something else 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.360
 In any case, my opinion is good 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.130
 It is also a very important feature 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.290
 definitely the rear view camera 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.299
 you have a very bad one here 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.120
 Survey because just the back so far 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.230
 goes out the back 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.459
 for this reason is just one 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.329
 Rear view camera of my opinion must 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.459
 actually when wrapping 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.500
 the steering is typically very high 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.440
 easy I think it would be five 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.550
 calm 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.660
 the steering a bit more 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.150
 sportiness a bit more feedback 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.620
 from the street can give for it 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.430
 I mean by the motor which is a 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.140
 real cream 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.300
 You can also tell that the compressor 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.880
 is charged because he is very early 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.490
 and very low speed range very much 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.440
 a lot of pressure builds bz suit I would yes 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.580
 also describe it 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.990
 that is not reflected then also 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.510
 will be back if you are in the launch 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.400
 Control uses and the road is dry 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.650
 should one the sprint in 5.1 seconds 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.900
 create 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.530
 jack long design or small picture of the audi 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.870
 s5 is from the engine sound or exhaust 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.210
 Sounded relatively unobtrusive only 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.340
 so switches from 4,000 5,000 revolutions 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.530
 man I want such a small smile 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.200
 almost but call that's about it at 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.850
 otherwise he is very calm and very 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.310
 quiet and above all things almost 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.170
 already a very quiet glider but yes 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.420
 So is all too long falls 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.680
 stretch suitable for it but what 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.180
 you can prepare that now 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.180
 listen directly 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.500
 conclusion yes also the typical course what 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.910
 You should not forget that says 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.979
 also every car test has and I believe 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.289
 that would say the colors and colors 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.419
 high quality nothing glass all materials 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.240
 also feel high quality on the 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.070
 mother in itself makes it fun because he 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.380
 just nice out already in the passage 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.180
 has the tower or maybe it has as rome 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.860
 that actually makes the test five 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.919
 You also have to have a pleasant glider 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.460
 say also long stretch technically yes 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:39.070
 exactly in the room space for the 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.000
 front seats in any case very good 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.460
 given 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.710
 in the fund it will be a bit 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.830
 scarce with the headroom so who there 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.750
 I really need that space 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.220
 then rather recommend the should 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.289
 I'd rather take a look at the s4 from the 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.750
 the type of construction in the cockpit and so is the im 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:02.320
 principle exactly the same vehicle only 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.810
 That's exactly what it was at the end 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.759
 you liked the video would us 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.090
 Of course, the thumb upwards 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.410
 A abo would of course have the best 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.550
 to suspend her or not 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.720
 Any questions we might ask 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.449
 then in the comments or something 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.900
 could answer just write 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.020
 underneath 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.220
 We would be happy to enjoy it now 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.830
 here's a bit the prospect 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.830
 dresden and wish you much fun
