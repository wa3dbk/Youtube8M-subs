okay<00:00:00.690> well<00:00:00.870> I<00:00:00.900> think<00:00:00.989> we<00:00:01.199> finally<00:00:01.740> made<00:00:01.949> our

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
okay well I think we finally made our

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.430 
okay well I think we finally made our
way<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.250> our<00:00:02.550> last<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:03.060> soos<00:00:03.330> p55<00:00:03.870> board<00:00:04.049> to

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
way to our last a soos p55 board to

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.490 
way to our last a soos p55 board to
unbox<00:00:04.770> we've<00:00:04.980> got<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.220> P<00:00:05.370> 7<00:00:05.730> P<00:00:05.759> 55<00:00:06.420> D<00:00:06.660> deluxe

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
unbox we've got the P 7 P 55 D deluxe

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.169 
unbox we've got the P 7 P 55 D deluxe
board<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.220> what's<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.700> difference<00:00:09.030> between

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
board so what's the difference between

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.720 
board so what's the difference between
this<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.690> all<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.500> other<00:00:10.530> boards<00:00:10.980> well<00:00:11.190> it's

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
this and all the other boards well it's

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.999 
this and all the other boards well it's
got<00:00:11.940> 16<00:00:12.389> plus<00:00:12.599> plus<00:00:12.870> 3<00:00:13.110> phase<00:00:13.320> power<00:00:13.349> for<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
got 16 plus plus 3 phase power for the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.919 
got 16 plus plus 3 phase power for the
CPU<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:14.910> that's<00:00:15.120> better<00:00:15.360> than<00:00:15.570> any<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
CPU so that's better than any of the

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.170 
CPU so that's better than any of the
other<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.170> seuss<00:00:16.440> boards<00:00:16.830> now<00:00:17.310> you've<00:00:17.550> also<00:00:17.789> got

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
other a seuss boards now you've also got

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.359 
other a seuss boards now you've also got
support<00:00:18.720> now<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.960> Evo<00:00:19.350> has<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.800> -<00:00:20.070> but

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
support now the Evo has this - but

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.460 
support now the Evo has this - but
you've<00:00:20.760> got<00:00:20.970> support<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.750> drive<00:00:22.080> expert

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
you've got support for drive expert

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.349 
you've got support for drive expert
which<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.800> an<00:00:22.890> automatic<00:00:23.369> Drive<00:00:24.090> backup

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
which is an automatic Drive backup

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.259 
which is an automatic Drive backup
solution<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.590> there's<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.130> other<00:00:26.880> relevant

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
solution so there's that other relevant

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.960 
solution so there's that other relevant
stuff<00:00:27.720> there<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:28.949> much<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.760> anything

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
stuff there not really much of anything

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.749 
stuff there not really much of anything
in<00:00:30.269> there<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.630> let's<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.410> board<00:00:31.859> open

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
in there but let's get this board open

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.200 
in there but let's get this board open
okay<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.110> all<00:00:34.380> right<00:00:34.440> you've<00:00:35.130> got<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.579> turbo<00:00:35.820> V

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
okay so all right you've got the turbo V

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.350 
okay so all right you've got the turbo V
remote<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> hardware<00:00:38.040> level

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
remote so this is a hardware level

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.430 
remote so this is a hardware level

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
overclocking button so you can actually

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.290 
overclocking button so you can actually
increase<00:00:40.920> decrease<00:00:41.250> your<00:00:41.670> bus<00:00:41.850> speed<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
increase decrease your bus speed and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
increase decrease your bus speed and
you've<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> few<00:00:42.840> different<00:00:42.870> presets<00:00:43.739> turbo

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you've got a few different presets turbo

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.580 
you've got a few different presets turbo
key<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.390> turn<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.110> plugs<00:00:46.379> into

connectors then we've got an IDE cable

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.770 
connectors then we've got an IDE cable
let's<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.350> board<00:01:16.740> out<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.600> will

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
let's get this board out so you will

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.310 
let's get this board out so you will
notice<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.799> looks<00:01:20.040> very<00:01:20.640> similar<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.960> all

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
notice that it looks very similar to all

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.010 
notice that it looks very similar to all
of<00:01:22.650> us<00:01:22.740> uses<00:01:23.100> other<00:01:23.369> p55<00:01:23.970> boards<00:01:24.509> they've<00:01:24.780> gone

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
of us uses other p55 boards they've gone

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.679 
of us uses other p55 boards they've gone
with<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> fairly<00:01:25.680> unified<00:01:26.670> looking<00:01:27.150> theme<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
with a fairly unified looking theme and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.300 
with a fairly unified looking theme and
let's<00:01:27.840> see<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.439> find<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> difference

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
let's see if we can find the difference

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
let's see if we can find the difference
between<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.180> their<00:01:30.840> other<00:01:30.990> boards<00:01:31.439> so

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
between this and their other boards so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.319 
between this and their other boards so
first<00:01:32.250> thing<00:01:32.460> let's<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.909> look<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
first thing let's have a look at the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.600 
first thing let's have a look at the
general<00:01:33.720> layout<00:01:33.869> here's<00:01:34.560> your<00:01:34.829> two<00:01:35.040> slots<00:01:35.369> for

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
general layout here's your two slots for

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.510 
general layout here's your two slots for
crossfire<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.210> SLI<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.049> 8<00:01:37.439> X<00:01:37.740> 8<00:01:37.979> X<00:01:38.310> if

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
crossfire and SLI so it's 8 X 8 X if

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.429 
crossfire and SLI so it's 8 X 8 X if
you're<00:01:38.670> running<00:01:38.820> two<00:01:39.090> cards<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.259> this

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
you're running two cards and then this

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.700 
you're running two cards and then this
one<00:01:40.650> will<00:01:40.829> run<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.159> 4x<00:01:41.430> electrical<00:01:42.270> off<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
one will run at 4x electrical off of the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.800 
one will run at 4x electrical off of the
chipset<00:01:44.130> which<00:01:44.310> has<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.820> different<00:01:45.479> looking

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
chipset which has a different looking

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.020 
chipset which has a different looking
cooler<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.710> actually<00:01:47.030> pretty

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
cooler on it this is actually pretty

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.870 
cooler on it this is actually pretty
looking<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.079> very<00:01:49.259> very<00:01:49.649> shiny<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.280> nice

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
looking it's very very shiny and nice

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.480 
looking it's very very shiny and nice
yeah<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> kind<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.380> anyway<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.340> then

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
yeah I kind of like that anyway so then

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.399 
yeah I kind of like that anyway so then
we've<00:01:53.700> got<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.509> two<00:01:54.630> three<00:01:54.810> four<00:01:54.990> five<00:01:55.200> six

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
we've got one two three four five six

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.440 
we've got one two three four five six
seven<00:01:55.619> eight<00:01:55.829> nine<00:01:55.860> SATA<00:01:56.700> ports<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.180> we've<00:01:57.299> got

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
seven eight nine SATA ports so we've got

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.709 
seven eight nine SATA ports so we've got
six<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.259> right<00:01:58.590> angle<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.969> then<00:02:00.360> three

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
six on a right angle here and then three

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.819 
six on a right angle here and then three
down<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.140> bottom<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.500> board<00:02:01.710> you've

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
down at the bottom of the board you've

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.380 
down at the bottom of the board you've
got<00:02:01.979> your<00:02:02.130> onboard<00:02:02.549> power<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.060> reset

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
got your onboard power and reset

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.899 
got your onboard power and reset
switches<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.740> you've<00:02:05.070> got<00:02:05.280> your<00:02:05.460> memo

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
switches and then you've got your memo

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.389 
switches and then you've got your memo
okay<00:02:06.270> switch<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.960> then<00:02:07.439> up<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:07.979> you've<00:02:08.160> got

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
okay switch and then up here you've got

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.369 
okay switch and then up here you've got
little<00:02:08.700> toggle<00:02:09.090> switches<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.629> over<00:02:09.959> volting

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379

the uncor and then the CPU so you

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.000 
the uncor and then the CPU so you
probably<00:02:16.840> won't<00:02:17.380> be<00:02:17.470> playing<00:02:17.710> around<00:02:17.890> with

you've got your power connectors in the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.640 
you've got your power connectors in the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
ice fortress looking PWM coolers so

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.400 
ice fortress looking PWM coolers so
there<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.090> can<00:02:34.120> see<00:02:34.300> there's<00:02:34.630> your<00:02:34.780> 16<00:02:35.140> phase

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
there you can see there's your 16 phase

there you can see there's your 16 phase
power<00:02:35.680> around<00:02:36.100> your<00:02:36.340> CPU<00:02:36.730> socket<00:02:37.210> here's<00:02:37.840> the

power around your CPU socket here's the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.140 
power around your CPU socket here's the

thingamajiggy<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.960> then<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.680> guess

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
thingamajiggy and then that I guess

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.920 
thingamajiggy and then that I guess
comes<00:02:42.280> out<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.550> little<00:02:42.850> place<00:02:43.090> at<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.390> back<00:02:43.600> and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
comes out a little place at the back and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.170 
comes out a little place at the back and
then<00:02:44.770> here<00:02:45.160> we<00:02:45.250> go<00:02:45.370> let's<00:02:45.610> have<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.790> look<00:02:45.970> at<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
then here we go let's have a look at the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.570 
then here we go let's have a look at the
back<00:02:46.360> i/o<00:02:46.600> so<00:02:47.350> you've<00:02:47.530> got<00:02:47.709> your<00:02:47.830> ps2<00:02:48.130> keyboard

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
back i/o so you've got your ps2 keyboard

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.460 
back i/o so you've got your ps2 keyboard
and<00:02:48.940> mouse<00:02:49.060> there's<00:02:49.450> your<00:02:49.600> clear<00:02:49.810> CMOS<00:02:50.140> switch

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
and mouse there's your clear CMOS switch

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.310
