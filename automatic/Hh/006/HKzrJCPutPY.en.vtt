hello<00:00:01.260> and<00:00:01.530> welcome<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.979> Minecraft<00:00:02.460> where

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hello and welcome to Minecraft where

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.570 
hello and welcome to Minecraft where
today<00:00:03.179> we<00:00:03.629> are<00:00:03.720> playing<00:00:03.959> with<00:00:04.080> redstone

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580 
today we are playing with redstone

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.270 
today we are playing with redstone
specifically<00:00:05.580> redstone<00:00:06.509> lamps<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.230> how<00:00:08.220> to

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
specifically redstone lamps and how to

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.009 
specifically redstone lamps and how to
power<00:00:08.580> them<00:00:08.820> using<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.420> centrally<00:00:09.990> located

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
power them using a centrally located

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.580 
power them using a centrally located
switch<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.670> as<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.269> demonstrate<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:13.170> flip<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
switch so as to demonstrate you flip the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.039 
switch so as to demonstrate you flip the
switch<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.130> all<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> redstone<00:00:15.599> lamps<00:00:15.900> go

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
switch and all of the redstone lamps go

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.980 
switch and all of the redstone lamps go
on<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.949> switch<00:00:17.130> again<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.609> they<00:00:18.180> all<00:00:18.359> go<00:00:18.779> off

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
on to switch again and they all go off

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.679 
on to switch again and they all go off
how<00:00:19.830> do<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.039> do<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.460> may<00:00:20.609> ask<00:00:20.820> well<00:00:21.240> it's

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
how do you do it you may ask well it's

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.420 
how do you do it you may ask well it's
actually<00:00:21.960> quite<00:00:22.140> simple<00:00:22.410> let's<00:00:23.010> go<00:00:23.100> ahead<00:00:23.220> and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
actually quite simple let's go ahead and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.740 
actually quite simple let's go ahead and
take<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> look<00:00:23.760> behind<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> scenes<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.630> see

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
take a look behind the scenes and see

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.050 
take a look behind the scenes and see
what's<00:00:24.900> going<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:26.039> behind<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.430> switch<00:00:26.670> we

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
what's going on so behind the switch we

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.660 
what's going on so behind the switch we
have<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.570> stone<00:00:28.289> block<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.130> redstone

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
have a stone block here with redstone

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.880 
have a stone block here with redstone
that<00:00:30.660> way<00:00:30.750> whatever<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.199> switch<00:00:31.410> does

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
that way whatever this switch does

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.250 
that way whatever this switch does
powers<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.450> redstone<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.960> attached<00:00:34.230> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
powers the the redstone is attached to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.830 
powers the the redstone is attached to
for<00:00:34.680> instance<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.850> flip<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.210> switch<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
for instance if you flip the switch and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.250 
for instance if you flip the switch and
the<00:00:37.590> redstone<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.309> powered<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:40.110> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the redstone is powered on and if you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.990 
the redstone is powered on and if you
flip<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.559> switch<00:00:40.680> again<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.550> powered<00:00:41.910> off

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
flip the switch again it is powered off

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.119 
flip the switch again it is powered off
now<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.230> come<00:00:43.379> around<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.710> back<00:00:43.829> here

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
now if you come around the back here

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.470 
now if you come around the back here
you'll<00:00:44.399> notice<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> redstone<00:00:45.180> comes

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
you'll notice that the redstone comes

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.959 
you'll notice that the redstone comes
along<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> back<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.500> wall<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.039> attaches

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
along the back of this wall and attaches

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.170 
along the back of this wall and attaches
to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.539> brick<00:00:48.840> directly<00:00:49.590> below<00:00:49.770> each<00:00:50.489> one<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
to the brick directly below each one of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.510 
to the brick directly below each one of
these<00:00:51.329> redstone<00:00:51.899> lamps<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.039> comes<00:00:53.219> all<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
these redstone lamps so it comes all the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
these redstone lamps so it comes all the
way<00:00:53.550> around<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:55.050> you'll<00:00:55.260> notice

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
way around here and then you'll notice

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260 
way around here and then you'll notice
this<00:00:55.739> redstone<00:00:56.100> repeater<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.149> is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
this redstone repeater and that is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.599 
this redstone repeater and that is
because<00:00:57.600> believe<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.500> 15<00:00:58.980> blocks<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
because believe it's 15 blocks the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.180 
because believe it's 15 blocks the
redstone<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.149> only<00:01:00.300> travel<00:01:00.800> 15<00:01:01.800> blocks

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
redstone will only travel 15 blocks

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.039 
redstone will only travel 15 blocks
before<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.300> stops

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
before it stops

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.800 
before it stops
powering<00:01:04.650> anything<00:01:05.580> after<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.659> have

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
powering anything after that so you have

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.469 
powering anything after that so you have
to<00:01:06.960> input<00:01:07.590> these<00:01:07.770> redstone<00:01:08.670> repeaters<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
to input these redstone repeaters to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.140 
to input these redstone repeaters to
continue<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> current<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.740> work<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.909> we

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
continue the current on work so we

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.630 
continue the current on work so we
haven't<00:01:12.390> come<00:01:12.479> around<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.780> corner<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.260> again

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
haven't come around the corner and again

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.520 
haven't come around the corner and again
attaching<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.760> these<00:01:14.909> redstone<00:01:15.450> lamps<00:01:16.380> as

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
attaching to these redstone lamps as

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.940 
attaching to these redstone lamps as
well<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.729> you'll<00:01:18.540> notice<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.020> next<00:01:19.680> door<00:01:19.740> we

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
well so you'll notice right next door we

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.130 
well so you'll notice right next door we
have<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.729> wall<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.780> without

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
have a wall just like it without

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.080 
have a wall just like it without
everything<00:01:22.560> implemented<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.700> we're<00:01:23.790> gonna<00:01:23.909> go

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
everything implemented so we're gonna go

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.359 
everything implemented so we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.409> just<00:01:25.409> kind<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.650> work<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.070> quick

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369

did obviously we did start with the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.700 
did obviously we did start with the
lever<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.790> power<00:01:33.000> everything<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.350> each<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
lever to power everything and in each of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.230 
lever to power everything and in each of
these<00:01:34.799> empty<00:01:35.130> spots<00:01:35.430> we're<00:01:35.700> gonna<00:01:35.790> need<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
these empty spots we're gonna need a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.319 
these empty spots we're gonna need a
redstone<00:01:36.619> lamp<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.040> let's<00:01:38.189> go<00:01:38.310> ahead<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.670> put

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
redstone lamp so let's go ahead and put

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.460 
redstone lamp so let's go ahead and put
those<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.810> place

just<00:02:09.590> keep<00:02:10.590> coming<00:02:10.979> down<00:02:11.270> until<00:02:12.270> we<00:02:12.360> get<00:02:12.480> to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
just keep coming down until we get to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.640 
just keep coming down until we get to
about<00:02:12.780> here

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
about here

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.740 
about here
now<00:02:14.250> I'll<00:02:14.400> show<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.640> what<00:02:14.790> happens<00:02:15.269> if<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.599> go

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
now I'll show you what happens if you go

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.020 
now I'll show you what happens if you go
too<00:02:15.810> far<00:02:16.200> with<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:17.489> have<00:02:17.519> this<00:02:17.790> whole

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
too far with this so we have this whole

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.660 
too far with this so we have this whole
line<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.900> redstone<00:02:19.200> I'm<00:02:20.040> gonna<00:02:20.190> go<00:02:20.340> ahead<00:02:20.459> and

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
line of redstone I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.210 
line of redstone I'm gonna go ahead and
power<00:02:20.849> on<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.569> switch<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.860> you'll<00:02:23.040> notice

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
power on this switch and you'll notice

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.160 
power on this switch and you'll notice
it<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.670> powers<00:02:24.090> on<00:02:24.269> these<00:02:24.450> three<00:02:24.659> lights<00:02:24.870> just

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
it it powers on these three lights just

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.080 
it it powers on these three lights just
like<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.440> supposed<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.890> now<00:02:26.700> if<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.879> come

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
like it's supposed to now if you come

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.180 
like it's supposed to now if you come
down<00:02:27.269> to<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.510> end<00:02:27.629> here<00:02:27.900> however<00:02:28.190> you'll

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
down to the end here however you'll

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.100 
down to the end here however you'll
notice<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.790> something<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.420> different<00:02:30.900> it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
notice that something is different it

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.500 
notice that something is different it
stops<00:02:31.530> right<00:02:31.890> here<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.239> what<00:02:33.420> I'm

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
stops right here so this is what I'm

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.069 
stops right here so this is what I'm
talking<00:02:33.840> about

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
talking about

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.869 
talking about
right<00:02:34.440> about<00:02:34.590> here<00:02:34.650> what<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.159> want<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.430> do<00:02:35.579> is

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
right about here what you want to do is

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.270 
right about here what you want to do is
go<00:02:36.420> ahead<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.690> implement<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.470> redstone

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
go ahead and implement a redstone

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.520 
go ahead and implement a redstone
repeater<00:02:38.480> which<00:02:39.480> then<00:02:39.659> of<00:02:39.780> course<00:02:39.989> continues

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
repeater which then of course continues

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.949 
repeater which then of course continues
to<00:02:40.709> current<00:02:41.040> onward<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.269> then<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.569> will<00:02:42.720> keep

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
to current onward so then you will keep

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.550 
to current onward so then you will keep
this<00:02:43.200> coming<00:02:43.590> along<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:43.980> back<00:02:44.129> wall<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
this coming along the back wall and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.300 
this coming along the back wall and
again<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:47.400> will<00:02:47.609> attach<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.269> there<00:02:48.540> and

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
again we will attach it there and

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.319 
again we will attach it there and
finally<00:02:50.310> end<00:02:50.700> at<00:02:51.060> our<00:02:51.390> last<00:02:52.049> lamp<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.489> there<00:02:54.120> we

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
finally end at our last lamp so there we

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.869 
finally end at our last lamp so there we
have<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.569> it's<00:02:54.900> actually<00:02:55.049> quite<00:02:55.680> simple<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.310> few

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
have it it's actually quite simple a few

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.910 
have it it's actually quite simple a few
things<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.359> note<00:02:57.569> when<00:02:58.379> I<00:02:58.409> was<00:02:58.470> playing<00:02:58.829> around

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
things to note when I was playing around

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.460 
things to note when I was playing around
this<00:02:59.280> round<00:03:00.120> with<00:03:00.329> this<00:03:00.510> rather<00:03:00.840> the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
this round with this rather the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.069 
this round with this rather the
direction<00:03:02.459> of<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.760> redstone<00:03:03.209> repeater<00:03:03.810> is

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
direction of the redstone repeater is

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.559 
direction of the redstone repeater is
important<00:03:04.890> for<00:03:05.430> instance<00:03:05.760> if<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.120> take<00:03:06.150> this

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
important for instance if you take this

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.270 
important for instance if you take this
away<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.379> place<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.890> opposite

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
away and you place it the opposite

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.280 
away and you place it the opposite
direction<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:09.269> doesn't<00:03:09.599> work<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.959> current

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
direction it doesn't work the current

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.410 
direction it doesn't work the current
will<00:03:10.440> not<00:03:10.650> go<00:03:10.890> through<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.970> way<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> always

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
will not go through it the way I always

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.849 
will not go through it the way I always
remember<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.019> is<00:03:13.200> when<00:03:13.379> I'm<00:03:13.470> placing<00:03:13.709> my

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
remember it is when I'm placing my

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.210 
remember it is when I'm placing my
redstone<00:03:14.310> repeaters<00:03:14.790> excuse<00:03:15.480> me<00:03:16.069> when<00:03:17.069> I'm

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
redstone repeaters excuse me when I'm

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.830 
redstone repeaters excuse me when I'm
placing<00:03:17.430> my<00:03:17.669> redstone<00:03:17.849> repeaters<00:03:18.419> I<00:03:18.599> always

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
placing my redstone repeaters I always

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.300 
placing my redstone repeaters I always
go<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.169> direction<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.739> want<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.099> current

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
go in the direction I want the current

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.150 
go in the direction I want the current
to<00:03:20.609> go<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.900> case<00:03:22.109> it's<00:03:22.349> this<00:03:22.470> way<00:03:22.680> and

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
to go and in this case it's this way and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.509 
to go and in this case it's this way and
it<00:03:23.819> continues<00:03:23.970> on<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:24.959> we<00:03:25.620> come<00:03:25.829> back<00:03:25.980> over<00:03:26.190> to

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
it continues on so we come back over to

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.699 
it continues on so we come back over to
our<00:03:26.609> switch<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.299> you<00:03:27.989> will<00:03:28.139> now<00:03:28.260> notice<00:03:28.530> that

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
our switch and you will now notice that

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.390 
our switch and you will now notice that
this<00:03:29.250> turns<00:03:29.609> on<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.269> off<00:03:30.569> all<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:32.250> our

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
this turns on and off all of our

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.720 
this turns on and off all of our
redstone<00:03:32.910> lamps<00:03:34.069> another<00:03:35.069> thing<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.340> can<00:03:35.519> do

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
redstone lamps another thing you can do

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.220 
redstone lamps another thing you can do
now<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.120> we<00:03:36.209> have<00:03:36.359> this<00:03:36.569> implemented<00:03:36.989> you

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
now that we have this implemented you

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.280 
now that we have this implemented you
can<00:03:37.349> actually<00:03:38.329> combine<00:03:39.329> these<00:03:39.720> two<00:03:39.900> systems

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
can actually combine these two systems

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.000 
can actually combine these two systems
together<00:03:40.879> that<00:03:41.879> way<00:03:42.030> once<00:03:42.720> which<00:03:43.049> will<00:03:43.590> light

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
together that way once which will light

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.009 
together that way once which will light
all<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.579> these<00:03:44.699> redstone<00:03:45.209> lamps<00:03:45.569> and<00:03:45.900> of

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
all of these redstone lamps and of

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.150 
all of these redstone lamps and of
course<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.470> would<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:46.680> want<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:46.859> continue

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
course you would just want to continue

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.189 
course you would just want to continue
this<00:03:47.430> on<00:03:47.669> maybe<00:03:48.329> place<00:03:48.629> down<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> redstone

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
this on maybe place down a redstone

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.259 
this on maybe place down a redstone
repeater<00:03:49.319> here<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.190> then<00:03:50.669> obviously<00:03:51.090> since

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
repeater here and then obviously since

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.909 
repeater here and then obviously since
we<00:03:51.419> are<00:03:51.540> going<00:03:51.810> in<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.079> direction<00:03:52.349> we<00:03:52.799> would

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
we are going in this direction we would

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.339 
we are going in this direction we would
want<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:53.220> switch<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.540> direction<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:55.199> this

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
want to switch the direction of this

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.800 
want to switch the direction of this
redstone<00:03:55.889> repeater<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.030> continues<00:03:57.629> on

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
redstone repeater so it continues on

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.319 
redstone repeater so it continues on
down<00:03:58.049> continues<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:58.889> down<00:03:59.099> to<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.370> end<00:03:59.549> we

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
down continues on down to the end we

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.550 
down continues on down to the end we
would<00:04:00.449> go<00:04:00.569> ahead<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:00.780> get<00:04:00.959> rid<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.319> this

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
would go ahead and get rid of this

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.390 
would go ahead and get rid of this
switch<00:04:01.859> and<00:04:02.310> now<00:04:03.180> if<00:04:03.629> you<00:04:04.169> flip<00:04:04.859> this<00:04:05.190> switch

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
switch and now if you flip this switch

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.229 
switch and now if you flip this switch
here<00:04:05.849> you<00:04:06.000> should<00:04:06.239> see<00:04:06.530> wall<00:04:07.530> up<00:04:07.879> all<00:04:08.879> of<00:04:09.150> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
here you should see wall up all of the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.110 
here you should see wall up all of the
redstone<00:04:09.599> lamps<00:04:09.930> lit<00:04:10.109> up<00:04:10.699> I'll<00:04:11.699> go<00:04:11.910> ahead<00:04:11.970> and

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
redstone lamps lit up I'll go ahead and

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.000 
redstone lamps lit up I'll go ahead and
do<00:04:12.209> one<00:04:12.480> more<00:04:12.720> walk<00:04:12.959> around<00:04:13.319> here<00:04:13.530> or<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.709> fly

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
do one more walk around here or a fly

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.650 
do one more walk around here or a fly
around<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.400> should<00:04:14.430> say<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.269> can<00:04:15.389> kind

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
around I should say just so you can kind

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.039 
around I should say just so you can kind
of<00:04:15.720> get<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.930> look<00:04:16.139> at<00:04:16.229> what's<00:04:16.410> going<00:04:16.470> on<00:04:16.739> and

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
of get a look at what's going on and

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.000 
of get a look at what's going on and
there<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.079> have<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.910> quite<00:04:20.910> simple<00:04:21.389> they

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
there you have it quite simple they

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.950 
there you have it quite simple they
essentially<00:04:23.010> controlled<00:04:23.669> redstone<00:04:24.360> lamp

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
essentially controlled redstone lamp

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
essentially controlled redstone lamp
system

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980
