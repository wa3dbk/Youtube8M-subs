3ds
I<00:02:15.879> mean<00:02:16.329> that's<00:02:16.480> three<00:02:16.689> the<00:02:16.870> PS<00:02:17.079> Vita<00:02:17.349> is<00:02:17.590> like

the people that want it wants triple-a
games<00:02:21.459> yeah<00:02:21.999> and<00:02:22.569> it's<00:02:22.780> weird<00:02:23.049> because<00:02:23.170> they

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
games yeah and it's weird because they

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.349 
games yeah and it's weird because they
just<00:02:23.709> say<00:02:23.920> hey<00:02:24.099> we're<00:02:24.280> not<00:02:24.400> doing<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.209> play

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
just say hey we're not doing to play

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.789 
just say hey we're not doing to play
games<00:02:25.569> anymore<00:02:25.689> but<00:02:26.139> then<00:02:26.290> they<00:02:26.379> don't<00:02:26.530> appeal

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
games anymore but then they don't appeal

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.679 
games anymore but then they don't appeal
to<00:02:26.829> anybody<00:02:27.099> else<00:02:27.519> so<00:02:28.150> it's<00:02:28.359> just<00:02:28.450> like<00:02:28.569> a

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
to anybody else so it's just like a

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.360 
to anybody else so it's just like a
rough<00:02:29.019> spot<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.499> he<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:29.829> right<00:02:29.980> now<00:02:30.159> so<00:02:30.340> I

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
rough spot that he is in right now so I

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.129 
rough spot that he is in right now so I
think<00:02:30.519> Disney<00:02:31.060> theory<00:02:31.269> would<00:02:31.480> probably<00:02:32.019> help

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:32.139 
think Disney theory would probably help

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.679 
think Disney theory would probably help
them<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.379> lot<00:02:32.409> for<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.129> kid<00:02:33.310> demographic<00:02:34.090> yeah

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
them a lot for the kid demographic yeah

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.580 
them a lot for the kid demographic yeah
so<00:02:35.790> all<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.209> great<00:02:37.659> and<00:02:37.689> all<00:02:37.900> but<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.319> one

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
so all this is great and all but the one

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.339 
so all this is great and all but the one
problem<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.129> it's<00:02:39.819> gonna<00:02:40.150> run<00:02:40.480> into<00:02:40.599> is<00:02:40.989> it

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
problem that it's gonna run into is it

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.970 
problem that it's gonna run into is it
being<00:02:41.950> known<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.930> Vita<00:02:44.200> they<00:02:44.439> never<00:02:44.680> make
