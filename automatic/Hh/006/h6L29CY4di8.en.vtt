00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
basically how le explained us how this

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.459 
basically how le explained us how this
business<00:00:10.000> works<00:00:10.210> or<00:00:10.540> how<00:00:10.570> does<00:00:10.720> this<00:00:11.170> item

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
business works or how does this item

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.949 
business works or how does this item
works<00:00:11.680> the<00:00:12.070> body<00:00:12.280> band<00:00:12.520> is<00:00:12.870> basically<00:00:13.870> we've

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
works the body band is basically we've

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:15.600 
works the body band is basically we've
got<00:00:14.139> billions<00:00:14.379> of<00:00:14.559> course<00:00:14.740> our<00:00:14.889> body<00:00:15.309> our

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
got billions of course our body our

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.130 
got billions of course our body our
protons<00:00:16.330> are<00:00:16.420> supposed<00:00:16.630> to<00:00:16.660> be<00:00:16.750> all<00:00:16.870> spinning

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
protons are supposed to be all spinning

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.960 
protons are supposed to be all spinning
and<00:00:17.320> really<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.680> same<00:00:17.950> directions<00:00:18.369> reasons

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
and really the same directions reasons

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.730 
and really the same directions reasons
they're<00:00:19.060> not<00:00:19.270> as<00:00:19.420> electricity<00:00:19.810> everything

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
they're not as electricity everything

anything<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> way<00:01:27.690> I<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.930> think

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
anything and the way I like to think

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.850 
anything and the way I like to think
about<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:29.640> your<00:01:30.000> body's<00:01:30.270> working<00:01:30.450> with

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
about it is if your body's working with

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.260 
about it is if your body's working with
your<00:01:31.860> proton<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.310> screen<00:01:32.610> together<00:01:32.850> stood

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
your proton the screen together stood

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.850 
your proton the screen together stood
against<00:01:33.540> each<00:01:33.690> other<00:01:33.899> we<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.229> free<00:01:34.590> flowing

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
against each other we have free flowing

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
against each other we have free flowing
energy<00:01:35.070> from<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.490> brain<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.030> edge<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
energy from the brain to the edge of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.240 
energy from the brain to the edge of
your<00:01:36.600> body<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.470> needs<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.770> help<00:01:37.979> heal

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
your body there needs to help heal

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.030 
your body there needs to help heal
without<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.210> filter<00:01:39.450> effect<00:01:39.930> EMF<00:01:40.440> radiation

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
without the filter effect EMF radiation

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.460 
without the filter effect EMF radiation
then<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.149> body<00:01:42.330> naturally<00:01:42.540> heals<00:01:42.990> faster

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
then your body naturally heals faster

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.980 
then your body naturally heals faster
and<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.830> have<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> higher<00:01:44.159> pain<00:01:44.460> tolerance<00:01:44.990> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and you have a higher pain tolerance and

and you have a higher pain tolerance and
that's<00:01:46.170> how<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> explain<00:01:46.500> about<00:01:48.320> okay<00:01:49.320> what<00:01:49.649> was

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
that's how I explain about okay what was

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.130 
that's how I explain about okay what was
it<00:01:50.039> when<00:01:50.550> somebody<00:01:50.850> asked<00:01:51.119> me<00:01:51.179> you<00:01:51.810> know<00:01:51.840> how

here is used to resonate at stainless

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.650 
here is used to resonate at stainless
steel<00:02:10.679> frequency<00:02:11.220> whatever<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.180> i'm<00:02:12.510> not

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
steel frequency whatever that is i'm not

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.000 
steel frequency whatever that is i'm not
sure<00:02:12.840> what<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.319> stainless<00:02:13.620> stainless<00:02:13.769> steel

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
sure what the stainless stainless steel

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.880 
sure what the stainless stainless steel
resonates<00:02:14.430> at<00:02:14.610> but<00:02:15.390> get<00:02:16.200> no<00:02:16.319> longer<00:02:16.530> resonates

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
resonates at but get no longer resonates

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.050 
resonates at but get no longer resonates
at<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.160> because<00:02:17.459> when<00:02:17.640> we<00:02:17.700> put<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.000> the

so it doesn't matter what it is I have a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.940 
so it doesn't matter what it is I have a
ring<00:02:34.420> here<00:02:34.630> which<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.080> had<00:02:35.260> been<00:02:35.410> printed<00:02:35.650> after

same<00:02:36.220> frequency<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.240> other<00:02:37.300> words<00:02:37.510> i

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
same frequency so in other words i

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.020 
same frequency so in other words i
change<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.050> frequency<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.910> hearing<00:02:39.910> as<00:02:40.000> well

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
change the frequency of hearing as well

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.840 
change the frequency of hearing as well
which<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.450> gold<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:41.680> this<00:02:41.920> no<00:02:42.100> longer<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.520> isaac

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
which is gold so this no longer is isaac

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.910 
which is gold so this no longer is isaac
