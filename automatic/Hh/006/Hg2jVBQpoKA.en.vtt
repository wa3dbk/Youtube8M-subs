00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.140
 perhaps it does not bother you that everyone 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.349
 have the same you do not have to you when 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.300
 you go back to school because to me yes 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.710
 today I bring you four super cool ideas 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.580
 so you can go back to a different class 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.160
 original and fun 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.160
 [Music] 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.180
 and then for the second model that 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.220
 add 2 dots of adhesive tape 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.350
 I proceeded to paint in the middle with the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.440
 free enamel runs mobile 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.020
 cooperatives I added washington up and 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.590
 already a single pencil and totally 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.590
 different 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.830
 the staff and the pens you only have 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.290
 to decorate a piece of paper or 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.330
 post-it to your likes add your data 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.700
 personal anything you want 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.070
 put and simply put it in the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.230
 pen tube is something super easy and 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.070
 makes the pens look very 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.070
 pretty 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.129
 [Music] 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.480
 with microsoft and the screen is improved 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.480
 from our goalkeeper 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.580
 so what I did was that I took the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.340
 measure then the court I stuck with tail 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.620
 in this case a cube and I cut the excess 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.260
 once I did that I cut the corners 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.300
 to proceed to bend them inwards 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:47.630
 and stick them 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:47.630
 [Music] 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.080
 and after that I proceeded to take the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.960
 measure to make the cap once what 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.350
 I did the marquez and then the courts with 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.680
 I stuck a blade with the same 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.219
 tail 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.219
 and that's it 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.690
 to unite these two extremes what 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.790
 I used was it was it's basically a 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.550
 Adhesive tape that comes with decoration 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.140
 and then I assure you with a little bit of glue 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.140
 tail or in this case 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.450
 and finally add a little vinyl 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.810
 white since I did not have a law I go and what 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.850
 Garnish with a style flower turÃ­n 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.110
 with the colors that combined with the 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.110
 super cute water 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.389
 why will it be that the operations of 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.120
 books are always ugly so I said 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.550
 well I will create mine I grabbed material 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.979
 that I had left over I cut it with a knife 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.280
 I added a washi tech plume and 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:22.090
 ready a super cute separator and that 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.090
 highlight 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.929
 I wish you all a successful new year 

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:02.330
 school to those who go to university 

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:04.490
 for the first time also desire 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.770
 very lucky and remember that we are going to 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.939

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.939
