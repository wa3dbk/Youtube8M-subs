what's<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> advantage<00:01:59.340> it's<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> be

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
what's the advantage it's going to be

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.240 
what's the advantage it's going to be
considerably<00:02:00.659> softer<00:02:01.020> considerably<00:02:02.009> stocked

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
considerably softer considerably stocked

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.709 
considerably softer considerably stocked
up<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.549> rover<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.909> rubbers<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.540> rubber

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
up in the rover the rubbers the rubber

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.120 
up in the rover the rubbers the rubber
ones<00:02:03.960> were<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.229> bit<00:02:04.409> harder<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.890> little

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
ones were a little bit harder a little

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.859 
ones were a little bit harder a little
stiffer<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.060> when<00:02:06.299> those<00:02:06.420> were<00:02:06.570> installed

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
stiffer so when those were installed

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.139 
stiffer so when those were installed
sometimes<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.590> some<00:02:07.890> toys<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:08.459> quite<00:02:08.640> go

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149

are going to be made from original molds

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.860 
are going to be made from original molds
they're<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.909> to<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.060> made<00:02:18.209> from<00:02:18.360> copies<00:02:18.840> of

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
they're going to be made from copies of

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.300 
they're going to be made from copies of
the<00:02:18.989> original<00:02:19.319> molds<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:19.680> there's<00:02:20.040> an<00:02:20.189> issue

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the original molds if there's an issue

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.860 
the original molds if there's an issue
there<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:21.120> neat<00:02:21.269> thing<00:02:21.299> about<00:02:21.450> these<00:02:21.810> is

been<00:02:42.540> actually<00:02:42.959> formed<00:02:43.889> into<00:02:44.129> there<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.400> you

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
been actually formed into there so you

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.069 
been actually formed into there so you
can<00:02:44.609> go<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> little<00:02:44.879> bend<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.359> of<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.569> and

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
can go a little bend out of that and

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.420 
can go a little bend out of that and
it's<00:02:46.379> going<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.590> contour<00:02:46.889> it<00:02:46.980> everything<00:02:47.340> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
it's going to contour it everything you

that's<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.920> little<00:03:08.310> trickier<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.790> do<00:03:08.909> will<00:03:09.659> be

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
that's a little trickier to do will be

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.149 
that's a little trickier to do will be
over<00:03:09.989> here<00:03:10.139> what's<00:03:10.409> this<00:03:10.560> second<00:03:10.920> well

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
over here what's this second well

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.349 
over here what's this second well
there's<00:03:11.400> always<00:03:11.579> with<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.849> convertibles

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
but well worth it this is going to be

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.250 
but well worth it this is going to be
actually<00:03:15.239> your<00:03:15.480> complete<00:03:15.750> convertibles

background of them and these are fairly
complex<00:03:30.810> pieces<00:03:31.139> there's<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.799> lot<00:03:31.829> of<00:03:31.949> work

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
complex pieces there's a lot of work

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.619 
complex pieces there's a lot of work
that<00:03:32.250> went<00:03:32.370> into<00:03:32.489> that<00:03:32.669> yeah<00:03:33.180> there's<00:03:33.389> there's

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
a lot of thought that goes into these

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.009 
a lot of thought that goes into these
and<00:03:35.099> plastic<00:03:36.060> industries<00:03:36.419> never<00:03:36.629> we<00:03:36.750> get<00:03:36.900> some

necessarily new but when we get these
things<00:03:39.720> in<00:03:39.870> we<00:03:39.989> go<00:03:40.109> ahead<00:03:40.229> and<00:03:40.319> test<00:03:40.500> fit<00:03:40.709> them

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
things in we go ahead and test fit them

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.170 
things in we go ahead and test fit them
and<00:03:40.889> check<00:03:41.040> them<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.250> make<00:03:41.310> sure<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.699> by<00:03:42.120> the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
and check them to make sure that by the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.030 
and check them to make sure that by the
time<00:03:42.359> you<00:03:42.599> get<00:03:42.750> them<00:03:42.870> you're<00:03:43.799> getting<00:03:43.979> the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
time you get them you're getting the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.020 
time you get them you're getting the
right<00:03:44.129> stuff<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.489> it's<00:03:44.579> going<00:03:44.669> to<00:03:44.729> be<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.849> good

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
right stuff and it's going to be a good

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.460 
right stuff and it's going to be a good
fit<00:03:45.150> before<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.720> other<00:03:45.810> thing<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.019> like<00:03:46.169> is<00:03:46.199> you

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
fit before the other thing I like is you

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.110 
fit before the other thing I like is you
take<00:03:46.799> a<00:03:46.829> lot<00:03:46.979> of<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.129> guesswork<00:03:47.430> out<00:03:47.489> because

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120
