00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 so hey people welcome to one 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.490
 another block ago 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.510
 I'm allowed to do you now 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.050
 because I bought a lot yes it is 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.330
 actually 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.610
 It only looks like a lot of choice though 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.109
 it's just that that's it 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.820
 So in principle I have amassed 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.689
 I'll buy it all then I will 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 still in unboxing show that are 34 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.480
 pile of mangas has stopped 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.400
 accumulated this time and as she 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.019
 really blatantly so I fell 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.360
 do not even know how I got here yet 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.590
 a receipt so it's just the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.870
 receipt of the ec card with you 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.329
 I have paid so fast 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.329
 perhaps without anything 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:57.360
 hello here 500 francs is natural 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.879
 a little less because I pay too 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.969
 but less of them missed time 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.689
 Apart from that he is really sick now 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.810
 we must also introduce hot 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.460
 focus 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.670
 You have to introduce myself then 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.670
 then it was like that and then i got it 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.549
 finished so after that I have to go further 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.290
 look no further shaping of was right 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.720
 class and I am also an already 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.600
 a bit silly because I mean 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.329
 believe 65 mangas or so been white 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.310
 not exactly and it got me on the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.560
 the entire receipt fits the device that the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.840
 receipt 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.090
 So we should print so 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.040
 nobody had heard at 30 or 40 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.200
 continue as long as that was right 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.909
 class 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.560
 By the way, I will not be like that now 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.090
 Go here on the lack was there 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.220
 I then unboxing to turn it 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.630
 So maybe several eat too much 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.939
 fall video here all you need is kill 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.430
 really horny manga knows maybe 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.409
 some the movie edge of tomorrow's edge of 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.659
 tomorrow is based on this manga me 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.740
 I've already read it online 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.970
 not known is in german out 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.370
 comes right hamma part people that is 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.650
 a correct recommendation so the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.720
 you have to buy me too 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.110
 somehow the last band was looking forward to the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.180
 just sifted my 18 after last 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.909
 at the moment high school of the dead in 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.250
 color finally ready to experience 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.720
 that's how it has been so far and I have it 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.900
 also contact lenses 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.110
 a little too good because I have here 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.430
 also not so long and have here 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.140
 I I have my contact lenses convincing 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.349
 Also bought a bit today 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.819
 but one costs and there I am 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.269
 now on my macbook synonymous still off 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.920
 been and a little bit on 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.340
 work so a bit prepare yourself 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.810
 the school again have school again 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.510
 This week has now five weeks 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.980
 Summer holidays must be five days each day 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.159
 work a week it has two 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.170
 Weeks but you have to go that way 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.200
 also look a bit cool again 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.269
 to have school 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.159
 yes I do not remember what else I do 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.870
 perhaps hereof short here again 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.290
 a little further a nice view 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.239
 here 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.700
 that were the mangas no longer bought 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.870
 I'll know later 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.560
 maybe not, I would rather make four 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.599
 unboxing letters unboxing because it is 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.549
 really a lot and I have that 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.900
 experience made that so long videos 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.430
 just can not be looked 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.340
 because I prefer four then 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.639
 short videos a 3 to 5 minutes out and 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.410
 are briefly compact and flush and there has 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.739
 also the attention span I 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:42.930
 a lot more with the people 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:45.290
 thanks for seeing and then you have to 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.290
