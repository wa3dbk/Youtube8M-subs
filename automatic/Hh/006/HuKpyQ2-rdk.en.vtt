this<00:03:45.360> piece<00:03:47.300> goes<00:03:48.300> into<00:03:48.750> here

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:40.150 

I<00:04:06.890> believe<00:04:07.610> I<00:04:07.790> might<00:04:08.000> have<00:04:08.300> it<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.570> wrong<00:04:08.750> way

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:05:10.250 

just<00:04:40.670> try<00:04:40.880> this<00:04:40.940> again

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:18.689 

we<00:05:10.890> grab<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.400> base<00:05:12.920> and<00:05:14.420> the<00:05:15.420> antenna

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:25.670 

it's<00:05:19.210> Fitz<00:05:19.599> over

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.580 

then<00:05:26.280> you<00:05:26.460> secure<00:05:26.940> this<00:05:30.169> making<00:05:31.169> sure<00:05:31.380> that

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
then you secure this making sure that

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:52.180 
then you secure this making sure that
it's<00:05:31.770> flush

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.300 

then

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:04.620 

screw<00:05:58.030> your<00:05:58.210> antenna<00:05:58.630> on<00:06:03.210> and<00:06:04.210> it's<00:06:04.420> that
