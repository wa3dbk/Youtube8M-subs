due to disagreements edwin's t addition

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.770 
due to disagreements edwin's t addition
and<00:02:42.890> smash<00:02:43.160> going<00:02:43.579> into<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:43.849> coma<00:02:44.239> for<00:02:44.360> doing<00:02:44.690> a

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
up for approximately six years I think

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.540 
up for approximately six years I think
that's<00:02:50.120> what<00:02:50.299> busted<00:02:50.629> them<00:02:50.810> up<00:02:51.579> all<00:02:52.579> that<00:02:52.790> team

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
that's what busted them up all that team

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
I guess you could say that algebra

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.660 
I guess you could say that algebra
divided<00:03:01.470> after<00:03:02.470> reforming<00:03:03.100> algebra<00:03:03.520> the

divided after reforming algebra the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.100 
divided after reforming algebra the
