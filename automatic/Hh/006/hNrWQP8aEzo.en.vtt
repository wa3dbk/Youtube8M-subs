00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.269
 we carry out this experiment for 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.290
 find out if adding water will be and 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:17.029
 the temperature varies this experiment 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:20.449
 we used a salt water thermometer e 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.949
 a teaspoon to equip it with a container 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.430
 who finds traveling 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.880
 we are 100 grams of water a 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.880
 container 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.130
 then we measure the water temperature 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.350
 you have 22 races 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.780
 finally we stop 35 salt women 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:45.520
 and we mix the mixed water 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:51.480
 note that the salt is not dissolved by 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.480
 all then we redeem it and wait 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:09.289
 we respected the sales and almost 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.530
 loose we leave it now completely 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.530
 cool down 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.470
 we measure the temperature 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.410
 measures 29 degrees 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.430
 after the misery the temperature 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:05.819
 that I only 3 degrees that action 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:09.620
 adding another 10 grams of salt e 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.620
 we mix everything further 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.750
 we can also note the salt was not 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:40.560
 dissolved and then the solution is saturated e 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:44.660
 we must put it to heat does not hold 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.660
 next the Emilian temperature 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.569
 measures 20 degrees water nature after 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.280
 an hour had increased by one degree 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.480
 repeating the experiment add 10 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.370
 grams of salt 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.680
 after 12 hours the water temperature 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.990
 it was equal to room temperature 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.180
 your 20 degrees so we can't 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.800
 conclude with certainty that the 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.799
 temperature change is due to us 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.650
 at the junta it should be successful 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.419
 to conduct the experiment in conditions 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.419
 of constant room temperature
