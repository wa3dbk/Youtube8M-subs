00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
a bit as you can see the cast time is a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.170 
a bit as you can see the cast time is a
lot<00:02:19.650> shorter<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.580> it's<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.790> little<00:02:20.910> bit<00:02:21.000> more

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.450 
practical also the buff duration has
been<00:02:24.660> increased<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.380> minute<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.310> up

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
been increased to a minute this is up

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.660 
been increased to a minute this is up
from<00:02:26.640> 45<00:02:27.210> seconds<00:02:28.160> but<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.250> biggest<00:02:29.400> problem

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
from 45 seconds but the biggest problem

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.030 
from 45 seconds but the biggest problem
obviously<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.050> they<00:02:31.170> cut<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.620> damage

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
obviously is that they cut the damage

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.310 
obviously is that they cut the damage
bonus<00:02:32.220> in<00:02:32.520> half<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.120> used<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.390> be<00:02:33.540> thirty

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
bonus in half it used to be thirty

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.270 
bonus in half it used to be thirty
percent<00:02:34.740> in<00:02:35.040> 5.1<00:02:35.550> now<00:02:35.880> it's<00:02:36.090> fifteen<00:02:36.690> percent

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
percent in 5.1 now it's fifteen percent

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.740 
percent in 5.1 now it's fifteen percent
I'm<00:02:38.280> really<00:02:38.520> curious<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.910> see<00:02:39.060> what<00:02:39.300> impact

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
I'm really curious to see what impact

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.180 
I'm really curious to see what impact
this<00:02:39.930> will<00:02:40.080> have<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.260> our<00:02:40.380> dps<00:02:40.800> going<00:02:41.430> into<00:02:41.580> 5.2

damage mitigation talent that absorbs
damage<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:54.030> talent<00:02:54.420> might<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.720> some

hiding in 5.2 they've changed it so now

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.320 
hiding in 5.2 they've changed it so now
it<00:03:34.440> does<00:03:34.620> spread<00:03:35.040> dots<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.760> that's<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.120> little

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
it does spread dots so that's a little

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.980 
it does spread dots so that's a little
bit<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.660> loss<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:38.480> spent<00:03:39.480> just<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.720> little

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
bit of a loss I spent just a little

while on a target dummy testing my dps
in<00:03:43.100> 5.1<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.340> then<00:03:44.460> I<00:03:44.520> switched<00:03:44.790> over<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.060> 5.2

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
in 5.1 and then I switched over to 5.2

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.140 
in 5.1 and then I switched over to 5.2
to<00:03:46.470> see<00:03:46.620> if<00:03:46.710> there<00:03:46.890> was<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> very<00:03:47.550> noticeable

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
to see if there was a very noticeable

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.450 
to see if there was a very noticeable
difference<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.960> it<00:03:49.410> fluctuated<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.220> much

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
difference and it fluctuated so much

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.360 
difference and it fluctuated so much
that<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.700> just<00:03:50.910> really<00:03:51.300> couldn't<00:03:51.570> tell<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:53.280> I'm

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
that I just really couldn't tell so I'm

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.440 
that I just really couldn't tell so I'm
really<00:03:53.610> curious<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:54.030> see<00:03:54.240> what<00:03:54.360> the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
really curious to see what the

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.970 
really curious to see what the
