I've been coming down here since I was
probably<00:00:14.259> like<00:00:14.590> 14<00:00:15.190> and<00:00:15.779> it's<00:00:16.779> cool<00:00:17.140> to<00:00:17.289> come

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
probably like 14 and it's cool to come

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.740 
probably like 14 and it's cool to come
down<00:00:17.860> to<00:00:17.890> a<00:00:18.010> beach<00:00:18.220> like<00:00:18.250> this<00:00:18.670> no<00:00:19.420> that<00:00:19.599> hasn't

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750

down to a beach like this no that hasn't
changed<00:00:19.930> since<00:00:20.320> then<00:00:20.680> I<00:00:20.740> mean<00:00:21.040> they've<00:00:21.189> really

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
changed since then I mean they've really

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.159 
changed since then I mean they've really
preserved<00:00:21.759> it<00:00:21.910> well<00:00:22.090> senator<00:00:22.779> for<00:00:22.960> State

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169

Beach<00:00:23.380> largely<00:00:23.860> is<00:00:24.220> untouched<00:00:25.090> by<00:00:25.270> man<00:00:25.480> it's

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
Beach largely is untouched by man it's

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.019 
Beach largely is untouched by man it's
pretty<00:00:26.410> easy<00:00:26.590> to<00:00:26.740> imagine<00:00:27.009> what<00:00:27.400> California

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
pretty easy to imagine what California

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.600 
pretty easy to imagine what California
coast<00:00:28.509> of<00:00:28.660> California<00:00:29.140> looked<00:00:29.349> like<00:00:29.619> 200-300

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
coast of California looked like 200-300

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.030 
coast of California looked like 200-300
years<00:00:31.000> ago<00:00:31.329> or<00:00:31.509> even<00:00:31.540> longer

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
years ago or even longer

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.130 
years ago or even longer
I'm<00:00:34.040> paying<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.460> bank<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.090> in<00:00:35.600> all<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.899> rocks

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
I'm paying the bank and in all the rocks

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.860 
I'm paying the bank and in all the rocks
make<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.220> wave<00:00:37.400> is<00:00:37.579> good<00:00:37.790> consists<00:00:38.660> of<00:00:38.750> all

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
make the wave is good consists of all

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.299 
make the wave is good consists of all
these<00:00:39.020> cobblestones<00:00:39.470> with<00:00:39.800> maybe<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.129> little

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
these cobblestones with maybe a little

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.210 
these cobblestones with maybe a little
sand<00:00:40.670> mixed<00:00:41.000> in<00:00:41.150> and<00:00:41.270> I<00:00:41.360> think<00:00:41.860> it's<00:00:42.860> not

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
sand mixed in and I think it's not

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.390 
sand mixed in and I think it's not
necessarily<00:00:43.940> barrel<00:00:44.270> but<00:00:44.449> it's<00:00:44.570> like<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.750> nice

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
necessarily barrel but it's like a nice

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.100 
necessarily barrel but it's like a nice
clean<00:00:46.400> soft<00:00:46.820> wall<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.360> I<00:00:47.420> think<00:00:47.660> that's<00:00:47.840> what

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
clean soft wall and I think that's what

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.500 
clean soft wall and I think that's what
makes<00:00:48.769> them<00:00:48.949> so<00:00:49.129> high<00:00:49.339> performance<00:00:52.030> lowers<00:00:53.030> is

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
makes them so high performance lowers is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.500 
makes them so high performance lowers is
one<00:00:53.809> of<00:00:54.019> the<00:00:54.980> best<00:00:55.220> ways<00:00:55.519> in<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:55.760> world<00:00:56.000> as<00:00:56.449> far

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
one of the best ways in the world as far

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.750 
one of the best ways in the world as far
as<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.900> left<00:00:57.140> in<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.410> rot<00:00:57.650> so<00:00:58.129> it<00:00:58.220> really<00:00:58.250> allows

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
as the left in a rot so it really allows

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.329 
as the left in a rot so it really allows
guys<00:00:59.059> to<00:00:59.449> you<00:01:00.170> know<00:01:00.199> pick<00:01:00.769> which<00:01:00.980> way<00:01:01.160> they

guys to you know pick which way they

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.060 
guys to you know pick which way they
want<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.579> go<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:02.089> you<00:01:02.989> know<00:01:03.019> ideally<00:01:03.589> show<00:01:04.009> you

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.190 

a<00:01:09.340> paddling<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.700> just<00:01:11.150> come<00:01:11.450> Square<00:01:11.720> bottom

just right up
it's<00:01:14.450> such<00:01:14.720> a<00:01:14.750> rhythm<00:01:15.140> away<00:01:15.380> because<00:01:15.650> it's<00:01:16.010> got

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
it's such a rhythm away because it's got

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.430 
it's such a rhythm away because it's got
enough<00:01:16.430> power<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.790> push<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.480> push<00:01:17.720> back

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
when you push against it but it's also

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.030 
when you push against it but it's also
playful<00:01:21.260> enough<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:21.620> where<00:01:21.740> you
