alright well I'm continuing on with my
study<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.560> crystal<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.569> batteries<00:00:06.569> and

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
my little friend penny over here is

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.720 
my little friend penny over here is
still<00:00:12.750> running<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.380> one<00:00:13.710> going<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.490> two

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
still running on that one going on two

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.390 
still running on that one going on two
weeks<00:00:14.759> now<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.509> I've<00:00:16.470> been<00:00:16.680> tracking<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
weeks now and I've been tracking the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.359 
weeks now and I've been tracking the
voltages<00:00:18.300> twice<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> day<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.650> it's

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
voltages twice a day and it's

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.840 
voltages twice a day and it's
fluctuating<00:00:20.850> up<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.510> down<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:22.170> goes<00:00:22.230> up<00:00:22.949> an

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
fluctuating up and down it goes up an

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.050 
fluctuating up and down it goes up an
evening<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:25.199> morning<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.710> down<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.369> I

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
evening and the morning it's down and I

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.609 
evening and the morning it's down and I
don't<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.869> its<00:00:27.990> temperature<00:00:28.320> humidity

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
don't know if its temperature humidity

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.919 
don't know if its temperature humidity
what's<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.359> was<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.630> one

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
what's going on but this was the one

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.700 
what's going on but this was the one
that<00:00:31.080> I'd<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.380> pointless<00:00:32.090> designed<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
that I'd be pointless designed it's a

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.819 
that I'd be pointless designed it's a
alum<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.950> salt<00:00:35.880> substitute<00:00:36.230> not<00:00:37.230> salt<00:00:37.590> that

borax<00:00:41.219> like<00:00:41.640> 20<00:00:41.940> Mule<00:00:42.120> Team<00:00:42.180> borax<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
borax like 20 Mule Team borax and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.889 
borax like 20 Mule Team borax and
there's<00:00:43.590> cooked<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.160> stove<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.899> then

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
there's cooked on the stove and then

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.139 
there's cooked on the stove and then
it's<00:00:46.320> copper<00:00:46.739> magnesium<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.700> that's<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.059> it

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
it's copper magnesium and that's what it

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.690 
it's copper magnesium and that's what it
looks<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:49.050> done<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.700> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
looks like when it's all done and the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.939 
looks like when it's all done and the
alum<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.539> top<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.350> melts<00:00:52.739> down

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
alum is on the top here that melts down

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.889 
alum is on the top here that melts down
into<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> other<00:00:53.520> chemicals<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.780> other

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
into the other chemicals and the other

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.410 
into the other chemicals and the other
chemicals<00:00:55.379> really<00:00:55.620> don't<00:00:55.800> melt<00:00:56.210> they<00:00:57.210> just

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
chemicals really don't melt they just

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.779 
chemicals really don't melt they just
get<00:00:57.600> real<00:00:57.809> hot<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.440> somehow<00:00:59.010> something<00:00:59.460> goes

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
get real hot and somehow something goes

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.729 
get real hot and somehow something goes
on<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.210> because<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.930> thing's<00:01:01.199> still<00:01:01.379> running

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
on in because that thing's still running

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.979 
on in because that thing's still running
folks<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.940> voltage<00:01:03.120> really<00:01:03.690> isn't

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
folks and the voltage really isn't

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
folks and the voltage really isn't
dropping<00:01:04.170> anymore<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> while<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:05.760> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
dropping anymore for a while there it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.940 
dropping anymore for a while there it
looked<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.020> was<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> drop<00:01:07.650> off

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
looked like it was going to drop off

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.910 
looked like it was going to drop off
taper<00:01:08.280> off<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.390> now<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.840> stabilized<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
taper off and now it's stabilized and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.880 
taper off and now it's stabilized and
it's<00:01:11.189> been<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.640> way<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.820> several<00:01:12.390> days<00:01:12.630> now

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
it's been that way for several days now

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.350 
it's been that way for several days now
so<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:14.939> how<00:01:14.970> long<00:01:15.330> she

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
so I'm just going to see how long she

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.800 
so I'm just going to see how long she
runs<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.460> go<00:01:17.460> from<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.330> wanted<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
runs and go from there but I wanted to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.890 
runs and go from there but I wanted to
go<00:01:18.990> back<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.530> thing<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.280> was<00:01:20.670> the

to keep out the humidity and then I used

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.889 
to keep out the humidity and then I used
this<00:01:55.979> five-minute<00:01:56.549> epoxy<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.420> went<00:01:57.810> off

this five-minute epoxy that went off

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.679 
this five-minute epoxy that went off
real<00:01:58.229> quick<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.850> didn't<00:02:00.210> completely

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
dry out I don't think so what I got over

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.330 
dry out I don't think so what I got over
left<00:02:05.700> over<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.299> was<00:02:06.649> about<00:02:07.649> point<00:02:08.129> eight

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
left over here was about point eight

here not as bright as pennies

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.300 
here not as bright as pennies
you<00:02:13.300> know<00:02:13.420> penny<00:02:13.720> has<00:02:14.080> magnesium<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:15.010> she<00:02:15.069> has

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
you know penny has magnesium so she has

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.790 
you know penny has magnesium so she has
a<00:02:15.340> higher<00:02:15.580> voltage<00:02:15.930> but<00:02:16.930> it's<00:02:17.290> running<00:02:17.650> this

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
a higher voltage but it's running this

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.650 
a higher voltage but it's running this
thing<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.550> I'm<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.209> going<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.450> see<00:02:19.629> what

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
thing and I'm just going to see what

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.509 
thing and I'm just going to see what
happens<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.319> voltage<00:02:20.800> as<00:02:21.099> this<00:02:21.310> thing

happens of this voltage as this thing

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.940 
happens of this voltage as this thing
sets<00:02:21.940> up<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.360> cures<00:02:22.780> with<00:02:23.530> everything

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
sets up and cures with everything

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.479 
sets up and cures with everything
trapped<00:02:24.370> inside<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.830> I'll<00:02:26.830> be<00:02:27.040> interested<00:02:27.280> to

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
trapped inside and I'll be interested to

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.780 
trapped inside and I'll be interested to
see<00:02:27.819> if<00:02:28.120> if<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.019> voltage<00:02:29.379> drops<00:02:29.980> off<00:02:30.280> linearly

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
see if if the voltage drops off linearly

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.600 
see if if the voltage drops off linearly
or<00:02:31.379> dramatically<00:02:32.379> or<00:02:32.680> what<00:02:32.890> happens<00:02:33.370> with<00:02:33.580> a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
or dramatically or what happens with a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.479 
or dramatically or what happens with a
sealed<00:02:34.060> cell<00:02:34.569> like<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.950> anyway<00:02:36.310> that's

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
sealed cell like that so anyway that's

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.860 
sealed cell like that so anyway that's
what<00:02:36.670> I've<00:02:36.790> been<00:02:36.819> doing<00:02:37.090> I've<00:02:37.299> been<00:02:37.330> testing

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.330 
from the Don bedini rock battery project
and<00:03:00.780> when<00:03:01.780> these<00:03:01.900> things<00:03:01.959> are<00:03:02.349> completely<00:03:02.530> dry

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
and when these things are completely dry

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.449 
and when these things are completely dry
I<00:03:03.730> can<00:03:04.239> set<00:03:04.569> that<00:03:04.810> in<00:03:05.079> that<00:03:05.290> little<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:06.069> dish

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
I can set that in that little like dish

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.420 
I can set that in that little like dish
there<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.150> move<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.230> around<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.950> get

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
there and move it around and get

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.180 
there and move it around and get
different<00:03:09.700> voltages<00:03:10.739> because<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.950> iron

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
different voltages because the iron

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.569 
different voltages because the iron
pyrite<00:03:12.940> has<00:03:13.329> a<00:03:13.360> diode<00:03:13.840> effect<00:03:14.410> on<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.430> I've

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
pyrite has a diode effect on it and I've

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.569 
pyrite has a diode effect on it and I've
been<00:03:15.730> studying<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.889> completely<00:03:17.889> dry<00:03:18.280> but

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
been studying that completely dry but

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.550 
been studying that completely dry but
when<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.850> move<00:03:19.060> this<00:03:19.239> thing<00:03:19.450> around<00:03:19.630> you'll

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
when you move this thing around you'll

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.099 
when you move this thing around you'll
pick<00:03:20.829> up<00:03:20.859> voltages<00:03:21.700> also<00:03:22.420> if<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.569> heat<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:22.900> up

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
pick up voltages also if you heat it up

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.890 
pick up voltages also if you heat it up
of<00:03:23.319> course<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.739> get<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.220> voltage<00:03:24.459> rise<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.269> but

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
of course you get a voltage rise to but

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.629 
of course you get a voltage rise to but
that's<00:03:26.139> been<00:03:26.410> an<00:03:26.530> interesting<00:03:26.739> experiment

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
that's been an interesting experiment

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:33.089 
that's been an interesting experiment
with<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:29.910> epson<00:03:30.910> salt<00:03:31.209> crystal<00:03:31.859> with<00:03:32.859> this

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
with the epson salt crystal with this

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.520 
with the epson salt crystal with this
iron<00:03:33.400> pyrite<00:03:34.030> rock<00:03:34.359> which<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.260> semi

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
iron pyrite rock which is the semi

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.979 
iron pyrite rock which is the semi
conductor<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.310> diode<00:03:36.760> basically<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:37.720> I'm

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
conductor the diode basically so I'm

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.259 
conductor the diode basically so I'm
still<00:03:38.230> studying<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.970> along<00:03:39.970> with<00:03:40.000> these

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
still studying that along with these

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.839 
still studying that along with these
other<00:03:40.420> little<00:03:40.750> projects<00:03:41.440> here<00:03:41.709> so<00:03:42.669> anyway

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
other little projects here so anyway

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.849 
other little projects here so anyway
that's<00:03:43.000> run<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.480> with<00:03:43.660> this<00:03:43.840> thanks<00:03:44.709> for

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
that's run that with this thanks for
