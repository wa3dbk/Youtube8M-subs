00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.320 
just all of that and this guy's would
not<00:02:10.470> die<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.250> usually<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.700> only<00:02:11.760> takes<00:02:12.180> like

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
not die like usually it only takes like

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.770 
not die like usually it only takes like
two<00:02:12.840> or<00:02:12.989> three<00:02:13.050> shots<00:02:13.560> with<00:02:13.890> his<00:02:14.069> gun<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:15.540> I

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
two or three shots with his gun but I

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.300 
two or three shots with his gun but I
felt<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.290> was<00:02:16.410> putting<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.830> whole<00:02:16.950> clip

into<00:02:17.519> him<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.880> he<00:02:17.970> just<00:02:18.000> would<00:02:18.450> not<00:02:18.720> die<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.620> I

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
into him and he just would not die so I

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.229 
into him and he just would not die so I
keep<00:02:19.890> doing<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.519> finally<00:02:20.790> kill<00:02:21.060> him

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
keep doing it and finally kill him
