ready<00:01:59.860> to<00:02:01.920> split<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:02.950> roll<00:02:03.190> I'm<00:02:03.280> not<00:02:03.459> sure

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
ready to split a roll I'm not sure

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.290 
ready to split a roll I'm not sure
whether<00:02:03.940> we<00:02:04.119> show<00:02:04.810> before<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.470> adjustment<00:02:06.099> I

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
whether we show before the adjustment I

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.759 
whether we show before the adjustment I
think<00:02:07.300> we've<00:02:07.450> adjusted<00:02:07.569> it<00:02:08.050> so<00:02:08.080> that<00:02:08.440> reaches

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
think we've adjusted it so that reaches

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:18.690 
think we've adjusted it so that reaches
down<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.280> one<00:02:09.459> inch<00:02:09.640> sharp<00:02:16.860> see<00:02:17.860> ya<00:02:18.190> Dan

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
down to the one inch sharp see ya Dan

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.210 
down to the one inch sharp see ya Dan
you<00:02:18.879> see<00:02:19.060> how<00:02:19.180> much<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.480> flexes<00:02:19.840> there<00:02:20.220> but

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
you see how much it flexes there but

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.490 
you see how much it flexes there but
this<00:02:21.340> up<00:02:21.550> it's<00:02:22.000> quite<00:02:22.300> rigid<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:26.170> bring<00:02:26.379> it

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
this up it's quite rigid just bring it

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.440 
this up it's quite rigid just bring it
forward<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:27.370> about<00:02:27.610> half<00:02:28.269> a

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
forward and so it's about half a

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.089
