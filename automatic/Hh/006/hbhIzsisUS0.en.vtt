00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.180
 Hi, girls, how are you? 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.090
 explain and in the points I hope it's 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.999
 grows well for those who are starting 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.249
 this cloth is called eta mine is a bit 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:14.740
 thick they reach to offer to the 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:18.840
 dots 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.840
 If you are from the beginning I recommend you 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.860
 you eat a pencil or a gel pen and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.860
 marquez for example here I have 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.530
 here these points 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.020
 we are going to tell 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.170
 As it is very small there are people who do 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.230
 like to work one by one which is 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.910
 small square by quadritos then I the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.100
 jobs of 3 or 3 1 2 3 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.100
 taking this point where I stayed 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.250
 I'll count again 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 tell where my needle is 1 2 and 3 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.180
 it's always going to be taken at number 3 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.460
 always be taken into account again as 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.140
 1 1 2 3 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.140
 123 then with the needle 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.950
 how are you going to put it 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.770
 You take about half a meter as one meter more 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.899
 or less thread 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.899
 and you're going to double the island 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.390
 then I use two strands 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.820
 from the brand you find in your 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.440
 shop the haberdashery 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.670
 it is nuanced iris mark 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.250
 to know if the stacks are stains 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.400
 you have to wet them and carve them in the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.170
 cloth 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.710
 and you will find out if you get hooked 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.590
 work usually almost all front 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.940
 and zebras, you're going to take two strands 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.610
 let's do this 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.610
 and then once you put on the needle 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.960
 the legs slade to the side of 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.190
 up and where there's nothing is beating going 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.190
 to be the bottom part 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:30.390
 well then here I'm going to mark 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.390
 this is an example 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.250
 diving 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.500
 and how do we sometimes forget what 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.600
 that we have is weakened loose 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.600
 then like my needle 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.720
 and I start to ride whether you put it 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.770
 down here 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.920
 you are going to finish up 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.050
 is to move forward and then sides if the 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.810
 strand you want me to come down here in the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:09.239
 cross because you are going to move forward here 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.580
 and I 'm going to tell you 1 2 3 123 I put it 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.880
 for here because I can move towards this 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.880
 side 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.340
 low 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.970
 this is an album of three desserts I turn 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.970
 so 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.530
 and take a needle so I do not forget 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.530
 that I have my passage 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.430
 If you are going to change , it is the same 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.430
 procedure that you are going to do 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.010
 there are very good 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.050
 and here you return to advance surfing 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.450
 in your work everything always first is 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.450
 he has to do the diagonals 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.220
 and this is practice 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.920
 so they stay in the back 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.920
 for two sticks 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.950
 they stay delineated 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.560
 ah 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.180
 drying the day of pure sticks 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.570
 then here to hide the strand 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:08.290
 you are simply going to put 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:12.090
 in this thread you will put it underneath 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.090
 but in the middle of the cloth 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.829
 [Music] 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.250
 You do not use a knot here, you can cut and 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.710
 You can always change thread 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.460
 procedure you will do so 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:40.060
 if you have to put another thread 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.849
 it's the same, I recommend you first 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.849
 for example in this flower 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.969
 you can first do for him with little 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:52.829
 which is blue bar type 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:54.989
 everything is coming out and counting well 

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:57.719
 after all this blue you will go 

00:05:54.989 --> 00:06:00.179
 filling this drawing you find it in 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:03.629
 the group showed me on tiptoe or in the 

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:05.380
 group by cross point with angel here 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:08.170
 on Facebook 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.569
 and so we are going to do it until we give 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.759
 shape 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:16.009
 this way I here I have some 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.009
 still that is for the tablecloth 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.840
 some companies already share them 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:25.919
 it is refound a button a rose 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.919
 I need to start 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.849
 This took it out in a border of roses 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.210
 I did 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:39.120
 I think it's selfishness 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.729
 in the chart they will realize 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.710
 I hope you like this tutorial and 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:47.570
 understand a little how to start point 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.570
 from cross to soon girls
