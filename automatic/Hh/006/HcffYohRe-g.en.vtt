again<00:00:09.490> here's<00:00:09.790> a<00:00:10.049> high-end<00:00:11.049> twin-tube<00:00:11.590> Shah

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
again here's a high-end twin-tube Shah

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.650 
again here's a high-end twin-tube Shah
market<00:00:13.040> we<00:00:14.040> did<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> PvP<00:00:15.389> plot

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
market we did this this is a PvP plot

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.050 
market we did this this is a PvP plot
now<00:00:15.900> you'll<00:00:16.080> notice<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.740> rebound<00:00:17.460> it

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
now you'll notice that in rebound it

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.330 
now you'll notice that in rebound it
actually<00:00:18.600> does<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:19.080> more<00:00:19.410> force<00:00:19.860> at<00:00:20.160> low

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
actually does have more force at low

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.120 
actually does have more force at low
speeds<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.470> and<00:00:22.470> that's<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.740> good<00:00:22.919> thing

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
speeds and and that's a good thing

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.920 
speeds and and that's a good thing
that's<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.490> people<00:00:23.939> typically<00:00:24.330> notice<00:00:24.750> when

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that's what people typically notice when

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.440 
that's what people typically notice when
they<00:00:25.020> put<00:00:25.200> shocks<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.520> would<00:00:27.210> feel

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 
they put shocks on that this would feel

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.359 
they put shocks on that this would feel
good<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.900> feel<00:00:28.110> like<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.470> doing<00:00:29.130> something

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
good and feel like it's doing something

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.179 
good and feel like it's doing something
for<00:00:29.700> you<00:00:30.079> if<00:00:31.079> you<00:00:31.169> look<00:00:31.320> at<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.559> same<00:00:31.860> shock

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
for you if you look at that same shock

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.950 
for you if you look at that same shock
as<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.550> CVP<00:00:33.210> now<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:35.149> this<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.690> purpose

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
as a CVP now the this is not on purpose

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.830 
as a CVP now the this is not on purpose
by<00:00:37.320> any<00:00:37.469> means<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.100> graph<00:00:38.850> shape<00:00:39.329> changed

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
by any means but the graph shape changed

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.830 
by any means but the graph shape changed
a<00:00:39.930> little<00:00:40.050> bit<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.090> data<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.600> still

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
a little bit but the the data is still

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.910 
a little bit but the the data is still
the<00:00:42.960> same<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.770> can<00:00:44.430> see<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.910> CVP<00:00:45.920> as

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the same so we can see that in CVP as

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.050 
the same so we can see that in CVP as
the<00:00:47.490> rebound<00:00:48.300> stack<00:00:48.660> opens<00:00:49.370> we've<00:00:50.370> got<00:00:50.730> almost

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
the rebound stack opens we've got almost

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.870 
the rebound stack opens we've got almost
zero<00:00:51.540> force<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.650> 1.5<00:00:53.310> inches<00:00:53.670> per

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
zero force and then about 1.5 inches per

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.300 
zero force and then about 1.5 inches per
second<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.810> starts<00:00:55.170> generating<00:00:55.380> force<00:00:55.950> and

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
second it starts generating force and

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.520 
second it starts generating force and
then<00:00:56.880> it<00:00:57.000> actually<00:00:57.420> generates<00:00:57.540> more<00:00:57.989> force<00:00:58.320> as

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
then it actually generates more force as

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.200 
then it actually generates more force as
it<00:00:58.650> accelerates<00:00:58.950> and<00:00:59.430> then<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.700> turns<00:00:59.910> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it accelerates and then it turns a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.840 
it accelerates and then it turns a
decelerates<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.290> it<00:01:02.040> generates<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.610> little

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
decelerates that it generates a little

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.910 
decelerates that it generates a little
less<00:01:03.000> force<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.630> then<00:01:03.750> more<00:01:04.379> as<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.769> gets

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
less force and then more as it gets

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.730 
less force and then more as it gets
closer<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.339> zero<00:01:05.759> so<00:01:06.060> again<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.380> then

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
closer to zero so again and then

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.260 
closer to zero so again and then
compression<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.579> see<00:01:08.850> there's<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> couple

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
compression you can see there's a couple

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.170 
compression you can see there's a couple
of<00:01:09.509> things<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.079> there<00:01:10.320> as<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
of things going on there as the

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.090 
of things going on there as the
compression<00:01:12.180> stack<00:01:12.570> opens<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.259> has<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
compression stack opens it has a kind of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.889 
compression stack opens it has a kind of
a<00:01:14.220> wave<00:01:14.430> there<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.030> there's<00:01:15.299> something<00:01:15.570> going

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
a wave there so there's something going

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.410 
a wave there so there's something going
on<00:01:15.990> internally<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.369> by<00:01:17.549> no<00:01:17.609> means<00:01:17.789> means

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
on internally and this by no means means

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.440 
on internally and this by no means means
that<00:01:19.009> all<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.069> these<00:01:20.369> shocks<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.939> bad<00:01:21.090> shocks

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
that all of these shocks are bad shocks

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.319 
that all of these shocks are bad shocks
but<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:22.200> whatever<00:01:22.380> reason<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.819> one<00:01:23.999> that<00:01:24.210> we

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
but for whatever reason the one that we

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.279 
but for whatever reason the one that we
tested<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.490> has<00:01:26.490> has<00:01:26.969> some<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:27.840> things<00:01:28.049> going

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
tested it has has some some things going

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.969 
tested it has has some some things going
on<00:01:28.469> internally<00:01:29.329> but<00:01:30.329> again<00:01:30.929> people<00:01:31.499> notice

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
on internally but again people notice

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.919 
on internally but again people notice
these<00:01:32.189> things<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.060> shock<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.630> really

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
these things that this shock is really

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.770 
these things that this shock is really
not<00:01:34.049> generating<00:01:34.619> any<00:01:34.679> force<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.509> rebound<00:01:36.509> as

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
not generating any force and rebound as

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.160 
not generating any force and rebound as
as<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:38.159> car<00:01:38.670> begins<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.299> extend<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.810> rebound

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
as your car begins to extend and rebound

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.529 
as your car begins to extend and rebound
and<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.039> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.639> tell<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.969> because<00:01:42.149> there's

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
and so you can tell that because there's

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:43.849 
and so you can tell that because there's
nothing<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.139> on<00:01:43.319> and<00:01:43.499> then<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.709> the<00:01:43.770> sudden

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
nothing going on and then all the sudden

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.999 
nothing going on and then all the sudden
you<00:01:44.009> feel<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.219> lot<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.459> force<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.469> again<00:01:46.469> for

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
you feel a lot of force and again for

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.980 
you feel a lot of force and again for
high-end<00:01:47.459> monta<00:01:47.700> tubes<00:01:47.909> doesn't<00:01:48.719> matter<00:01:48.840> if

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
high-end monta tubes doesn't matter if

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.760 
high-end monta tubes doesn't matter if
it's<00:01:49.109> a<00:01:49.200> AST<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> Penske<00:01:50.520> Moton<00:01:51.409> or<00:01:52.409> any<00:01:52.649> of

it's a AST or a Penske Moton or any of

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.349 
it's a AST or a Penske Moton or any of
the<00:01:52.829> other<00:01:52.979> models<00:01:53.340> out<00:01:53.459> there<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.999> is<00:01:54.179> what

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
the other models out there this is what

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.809 
the other models out there this is what
people<00:01:54.569> notice<00:01:55.079> when<00:01:55.219> when<00:01:56.219> they're<00:01:56.369> driving

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
people notice when when they're driving

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.539 
people notice when when they're driving
they<00:01:57.119> notice<00:01:57.569> that<00:01:57.599> the<00:01:58.529> shock<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.039> generating

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
they notice that the shock is generating

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.519 
they notice that the shock is generating
force<00:01:59.819> at<00:02:00.029> those<00:02:00.179> lower<00:02:00.450> speeds<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.319> you

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:01.529 
force at those lower speeds and and you

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:02.989 
force at those lower speeds and and you
truly<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:02.069> feel<00:02:02.249> the<00:02:02.369> difference<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.819> these

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
truly can feel the difference with these

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:07.519 
truly can feel the difference with these
shocks<00:02:04.459> okay<00:02:05.459> so<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:06.049> call<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.200> one<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:07.529 
shocks okay so I call this one the

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:10.309 
shocks okay so I call this one the
pinnacle<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.160> shocks<00:02:08.490> this<00:02:08.880> is<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:10.080> gold

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
pinnacle of shocks this is the gold

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.220 
pinnacle of shocks this is the gold
standard<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.130> shocks<00:02:11.490> I<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.020> lot<00:02:13.200> of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
standard of shocks I have a lot of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.170 
standard of shocks I have a lot of
respect<00:02:13.530> for<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:13.830> company<00:02:14.280> they<00:02:14.550> make<00:02:15.150> a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
respect for this company they make a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.480 
respect for this company they make a
really<00:02:15.660> really<00:02:15.690> good<00:02:16.110> shock<00:02:16.410> all<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.340> their

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
really really good shock all of their

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.559 
really really good shock all of their
products<00:02:17.970> look<00:02:18.209> great<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:20.790> did<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> PvP

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
products look great and so we did a PvP

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.679 
products look great and so we did a PvP
plot<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.739> comparison's<00:02:23.400> sake

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
plot of it for comparison's sake

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.180 
plot of it for comparison's sake
so<00:02:25.049> again

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
so again

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.260 
so again
pretty<00:02:26.430> good<00:02:26.640> now<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:28.160> shock<00:02:29.270> designed

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
pretty good now this is a shock designed

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.740 
pretty good now this is a shock designed
for<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:31.170> circle<00:02:31.710> track<00:02:31.920> application

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
for a circle track application

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.880 
for a circle track application
and<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.710> know<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:34.950> shocks<00:02:35.490> retail<00:02:35.940> for

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
and you know this shocks retail for

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.440 
and you know this shocks retail for
$3500<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.040> think<00:02:38.250> if<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.520> were<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.670> do<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> set<00:02:39.330> of

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
$3500 I think if you were to do a set of

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.020 
$3500 I think if you were to do a set of
them<00:02:40.040> but<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.370> know<00:02:41.460> they<00:02:41.580> run<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.760> lot<00:02:41.940> of

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
them but you know they run a lot of

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.250 
them but you know they run a lot of
compression<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:42.690> not<00:02:43.200> as<00:02:43.350> much<00:02:43.500> rebound<00:02:45.260> if

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
compression and not as much rebound if

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.980 
compression and not as much rebound if
we<00:02:46.410> go<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.710> next<00:02:46.890> slide<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.880> CVP<00:02:48.480> plot<00:02:48.720> of

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
we go to the next slide the CVP plot of

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.800 
we go to the next slide the CVP plot of
that<00:02:49.170> high-end<00:02:49.410> shock<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.640> again<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.240> mean<00:02:51.600> now

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
that high-end shock so again I mean now

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.560 
that high-end shock so again I mean now
in<00:02:52.770> comparison<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.520> what<00:02:53.760> we<00:02:53.880> saw<00:02:54.090> with<00:02:54.360> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
in comparison to what we saw with the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.020 
in comparison to what we saw with the
high-end<00:02:54.990> twin<00:02:55.200> tube<00:02:55.380> earlier<00:02:55.980> notice<00:02:56.880> how

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
high-end twin tube earlier notice how

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.230 
high-end twin tube earlier notice how
the<00:02:57.090> lines<00:02:57.470> follow<00:02:58.470> each<00:02:58.680> other<00:02:58.920> up<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.060> down

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
the lines follow each other up and down

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.450 
the lines follow each other up and down
the<00:03:00.390> graph<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.870> mean<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.710> doesn't<00:03:02.190> get<00:03:02.310> any

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
the graph I mean it doesn't get any

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.160 
the graph I mean it doesn't get any
better<00:03:02.640> than<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:02.970> that's<00:03:03.360> why<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.720> shock

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
better than that that's why this shock

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.130 
better than that that's why this shock
is<00:03:04.200> considered<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.950> very<00:03:05.130> high-end<00:03:05.580> shock<00:03:06.140> but

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
is considered a very high-end shock but

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.030 
is considered a very high-end shock but
I<00:03:07.500> will<00:03:08.070> say<00:03:08.310> one<00:03:08.610> but<00:03:08.880> with<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.470> notice<00:03:10.470> that

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
I will say one but with this notice that

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.700 
I will say one but with this notice that
at<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.760> lower<00:03:11.940> speeds<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.930> does<00:03:13.200> leak<00:03:13.560> a

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
at the lower speeds it does leak a

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.160 
at the lower speeds it does leak a
little<00:03:13.950> bit<00:03:14.100> as<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:15.210> shock<00:03:15.450> accelerates<00:03:16.020> and

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
little bit as the shock accelerates and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.500 
little bit as the shock accelerates and
again<00:03:16.440> could<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.610> know<00:03:17.880> it's<00:03:18.240> not

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
again could you know it's not

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.800 
again could you know it's not
necessarily<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.260> bad<00:03:19.470> thing<00:03:19.770> but<00:03:20.640> it's<00:03:21.210> here<00:03:21.600> to

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
necessarily a bad thing but it's here to

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.450 
necessarily a bad thing but it's here to
point<00:03:22.050> out<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.440> even<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.980> highest<00:03:23.130> end

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
point out that even in the highest end

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.020 
point out that even in the highest end
shocks<00:03:23.930> when<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.110> run<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.710> plot<00:03:26.550> like<00:03:26.790> this

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
shocks when you run a plot like this

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.970 
shocks when you run a plot like this
where<00:03:27.360> you're<00:03:27.540> accelerating<00:03:27.960> the<00:03:28.440> shock<00:03:28.680> to

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
where you're accelerating the shock to

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.000 
where you're accelerating the shock to
ten<00:03:29.220> inches<00:03:29.490> per<00:03:29.700> second<00:03:30.120> or<00:03:30.900> in<00:03:30.989> our<00:03:31.080> case<00:03:31.110> 9.5

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
ten inches per second or in our case 9.5

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.940 
ten inches per second or in our case 9.5
inches<00:03:32.340> per<00:03:32.520> second<00:03:33.320> there<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.500> going<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.770> be<00:03:34.920> a

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
inches per second there is going to be a

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.820 
inches per second there is going to be a
little<00:03:35.160> leak<00:03:35.459> in<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.420> shock<00:03:36.690> as<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.290> goes<00:03:37.620> to

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
little leak in the shock as it goes to

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.010 
little leak in the shock as it goes to
accelerate<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.550> you<00:03:39.270> know<00:03:39.390> again<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.780> point

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
accelerate so you know again the point

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.699 
accelerate so you know again the point
is<00:03:40.200> even<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:41.730> highest<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.420> high-end<00:03:43.020> shocks

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
is even the highest of high-end shocks

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.870 
is even the highest of high-end shocks
can<00:03:44.640> have<00:03:44.880> this<00:03:45.090> slight<00:03:45.420> delay<00:03:45.750> in<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:46.050> and

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
can have this slight delay in it and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.940 
can have this slight delay in it and
it's<00:03:47.880> it's<00:03:48.450> nothing<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.930> be<00:03:49.080> ashamed<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.709> I

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
it's it's nothing to be ashamed of I

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.940 
it's it's nothing to be ashamed of I
mean<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.430> would<00:03:51.060> consider<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:52.110> one<00:03:52.920> of

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
mean I would consider this the one of

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.220 
mean I would consider this the one of
the<00:03:53.100> top<00:03:53.250> shocks<00:03:53.580> on<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.940> market<00:03:54.270> and<00:03:54.480> you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
the top shocks on the market and you

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.949 
the top shocks on the market and you
still<00:03:55.500> see<00:03:55.709> here<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.100> their<00:03:56.250> dyno<00:03:56.519> plot<00:03:56.820> so<00:03:57.540> a

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
still see here on their dyno plot so a

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.000 
still see here on their dyno plot so a
lot<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.650> people<00:03:58.980> especially<00:04:00.260> on<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.470> internet

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
lot of people especially on the internet

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.380 
lot of people especially on the internet
would<00:04:02.190> like<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.550> look<00:04:02.700> at<00:04:02.850> this<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.090> say<00:04:03.209> well

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
would like to look at this and say well

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.320 
would like to look at this and say well
this<00:04:03.600> shocks<00:04:03.870> terrible<00:04:04.350> but<00:04:04.980> if<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.209> the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
this shocks terrible but if this is the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.660 
this shocks terrible but if this is the
best<00:04:06.510> shock<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.320> people<00:04:07.739> perceive<00:04:08.340> as<00:04:08.550> the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
best shock that people perceive as the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.580 
best shock that people perceive as the
best<00:04:08.850> shock<00:04:09.060> on<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.330> market<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:10.380> has<00:04:10.560> a

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
best shock on the market and it has a

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.430 
best shock on the market and it has a
slight<00:04:11.070> leak<00:04:11.519> at<00:04:11.670> this<00:04:11.850> then<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.840> know<00:04:12.959> any

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
slight leak at this then you know any

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.800 
slight leak at this then you know any
shock<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:14.040> has<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.790> slight<00:04:15.209> leak<00:04:15.510> like<00:04:15.750> this

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
shock that has a slight leak like this

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.229 
shock that has a slight leak like this
but<00:04:16.350> has<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.070> really<00:04:17.430> really<00:04:17.609> nice<00:04:17.910> tight

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
but has the really really nice tight

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.509 
but has the really really nice tight
trace<00:04:18.870> on<00:04:19.080> it<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.410> would<00:04:19.709> consider<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.310> be<00:04:20.430> a

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
trace on it I would consider to be a

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.970 
trace on it I would consider to be a
great<00:04:20.700> shock<00:04:23.240> okay<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.930> course<00:04:25.380> this

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
great shock okay so of course this

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.890 
great shock okay so of course this
wouldn't<00:04:26.280> be<00:04:26.460> an<00:04:26.550> AST<00:04:26.940> presentation<00:04:27.630> if<00:04:27.780> I

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
wouldn't be an AST presentation if I

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.890 
wouldn't be an AST presentation if I
didn't<00:04:28.169> present<00:04:28.530> an<00:04:28.650> ast<00:04:29.070> shock<00:04:29.540> I've<00:04:30.540> done

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
didn't present an ast shock I've done

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.480 
didn't present an ast shock I've done
the<00:04:31.050> same<00:04:31.080> comparison<00:04:31.950> that<00:04:31.980> I've<00:04:32.220> done<00:04:32.340> on

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
the same comparison that I've done on

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.180 
the same comparison that I've done on
all<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.730> other<00:04:33.060> ones<00:04:33.150> here<00:04:33.540> this<00:04:33.750> is<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.190> AST

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
all the other ones here this is a AST

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.710 
all the other ones here this is a AST
5100<00:04:36.060> model<00:04:36.419> so<00:04:37.250> in<00:04:38.250> this<00:04:38.430> case<00:04:38.700> it's<00:04:39.030> a

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
5100 model so in this case it's a

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.460 
5100 model so in this case it's a

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.930 
and I shock aluminum-bodied

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
40-millimeter piston shock that we're

40-millimeter piston shock that we're
using<00:04:45.180> here<00:04:45.570> does<00:04:46.260> not<00:04:46.290> have<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.680> remote

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
using here does not have a remote

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.550 
using here does not have a remote
reservoir<00:04:47.610> on<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.300> it's<00:04:48.540> a<00:04:48.720> single<00:04:49.170> adjustable

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560

reservoir on it it's a single adjustable
shock<00:04:50.340> absorber<00:04:51.020> but<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.140> can<00:04:52.260> see<00:04:52.380> typical

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
shock absorber but you can see typical

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.860 
shock absorber but you can see typical
PvP<00:04:53.460> plot<00:04:53.730> nice<00:04:54.450> rebound<00:04:55.790> curve<00:04:56.790> at<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.420> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
PvP plot nice rebound curve at the the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.560 
PvP plot nice rebound curve at the the
nose<00:04:58.080> end<00:04:58.410> of<00:04:58.620> it<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.460> then<00:04:59.580> tapering<00:05:00.060> off<00:05:00.240> and

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
nose end of it and then tapering off and

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.100 
nose end of it and then tapering off and
then<00:05:00.720> it<00:05:01.350> runs<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:02.030> digressive<00:05:03.060> curve<00:05:03.720> for

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
then it runs a digressive curve for

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.240 
then it runs a digressive curve for
compression<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.900> I<00:05:07.230> did<00:05:07.620> again<00:05:08.100> the

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
compression so I did again the

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.020 
compression so I did again the
comparison<00:05:08.630> I<00:05:09.630> took<00:05:10.380> yeah<00:05:10.950> I<00:05:11.130> took<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.550> CVP

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
comparison I took yeah I took the CVP

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.660 
comparison I took yeah I took the CVP
plot<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.600> then<00:05:12.900> added<00:05:13.410> all<00:05:13.560> of<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.890> CVP<00:05:14.400> data

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
plot and then added all of the CVP data

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.990 
plot and then added all of the CVP data
to<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.150> so<00:05:16.340> in<00:05:17.340> this<00:05:17.820> case<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.330> can<00:05:18.510> see<00:05:20.000> that

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
to it so in this case you can see that

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.620 
to it so in this case you can see that
the<00:05:21.270> lines<00:05:21.570> are<00:05:21.780> very<00:05:21.960> tight<00:05:22.290> running<00:05:23.630> running

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
the lines are very tight running running

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.170 
the lines are very tight running running
the<00:05:24.720> plots<00:05:24.960> against<00:05:25.440> there<00:05:25.650> now<00:05:26.220> I<00:05:26.610> didn't<00:05:27.090> do

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
the plots against there now I didn't do

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.970 
the plots against there now I didn't do
it<00:05:27.330> this<00:05:27.540> is<00:05:27.690> not<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:27.870> direct<00:05:28.080> comparison<00:05:28.590> to

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
it this is not a direct comparison to

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.050 
it this is not a direct comparison to
some<00:05:29.160> of<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.310> other<00:05:29.430> ones<00:05:29.610> but<00:05:29.700> if<00:05:29.820> you<00:05:29.910> look

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
some of the other ones but if you look

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.260 
some of the other ones but if you look
back<00:05:30.300> at<00:05:30.360> what<00:05:31.080> we<00:05:31.200> call<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.560> venerable<00:05:32.010> old

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
back at what we call the venerable old

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.700 
back at what we call the venerable old
standby<00:05:33.270> this<00:05:33.510> is<00:05:33.660> a<00:05:33.690> similar<00:05:34.140> plot<00:05:34.410> to<00:05:34.560> that

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
standby this is a similar plot to that

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.580 
standby this is a similar plot to that
but<00:05:35.430> you<00:05:35.520> can<00:05:35.640> see<00:05:35.669> how<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.060> compression

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
but you can see how the compression

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.650 
but you can see how the compression
overlays<00:05:37.590> on<00:05:37.860> top<00:05:37.890> of<00:05:38.280> itself<00:05:38.610> nicely<00:05:39.120> and

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
overlays on top of itself nicely and

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.890 
overlays on top of itself nicely and
again<00:05:40.350> we've<00:05:40.800> got<00:05:40.830> a<00:05:40.980> little<00:05:41.130> bit<00:05:41.310> of<00:05:41.460> leakage

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
again we've got a little bit of leakage

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.340 
again we've got a little bit of leakage
down<00:05:42.900> at<00:05:43.080> the<00:05:43.169> very<00:05:43.380> low<00:05:43.590> speed<00:05:43.950> but<00:05:44.820> again<00:05:45.780> we

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
down at the very low speed but again we

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.110 
down at the very low speed but again we
even<00:05:46.710> saw<00:05:46.980> that<00:05:47.190> with<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.520> highest<00:05:47.850> of<00:05:47.970> high

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
even saw that with the highest of high

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.890 
even saw that with the highest of high
end<00:05:48.300> shocks<00:05:48.600> and<00:05:49.340> and<00:05:50.340> when<00:05:51.120> you<00:05:51.150> do<00:05:51.690> the

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
end shocks and and when you do the

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.200 
end shocks and and when you do the
comparison<00:05:52.310> unfortunately<00:05:53.310> this<00:05:53.430> has<00:05:53.820> all<00:05:54.180> of

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
comparison unfortunately this has all of

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.150 
comparison unfortunately this has all of
the<00:05:54.510> data<00:05:54.750> on<00:05:54.930> it<00:05:55.050> but<00:05:55.290> if<00:05:55.620> you<00:05:55.860> were<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.040> go

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
the data on it but if you were to go

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.860 
the data on it but if you were to go
back<00:05:56.340> and<00:05:56.550> look<00:05:56.700> at<00:05:56.820> a<00:05:56.850> half<00:05:57.120> inch<00:05:57.270> per<00:05:57.540> second

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
back and look at a half inch per second

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.870 
back and look at a half inch per second
or<00:05:58.020> one<00:05:58.169> and<00:05:58.260> a<00:05:58.350> half<00:05:58.500> inches<00:05:58.770> per<00:05:58.979> second<00:05:59.370> you

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
or one and a half inches per second you

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.770 
or one and a half inches per second you
would<00:06:00.000> see<00:06:00.180> how<00:06:00.330> tight<00:06:00.630> the<00:06:02.270> the<00:06:03.270> plot<00:06:03.540> is

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
would see how tight the the plot is

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.380 
would see how tight the the plot is
together<00:06:04.200> at<00:06:04.350> those<00:06:04.530> lower<00:06:04.770> speeds<00:06:05.160> so<00:06:05.490> so

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
together at those lower speeds so so

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.900 
together at those lower speeds so so
anyway<00:06:06.990> just<00:06:07.020> wanted<00:06:07.710> to<00:06:07.830> show<00:06:08.130> a<00:06:08.490> bunch<00:06:08.729> of

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
anyway just wanted to show a bunch of

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.550 
anyway just wanted to show a bunch of
different<00:06:09.240> versions<00:06:09.630> of<00:06:09.750> that<00:06:09.900> and<00:06:10.169> of<00:06:10.290> course

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
different versions of that and of course

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.620 
different versions of that and of course
I<00:06:11.160> can<00:06:11.970> show<00:06:12.240> a<00:06:12.979> comparison<00:06:13.979> here<00:06:14.160> again<00:06:14.630> the

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
I can show a comparison here again the

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.830 
I can show a comparison here again the
similar<00:06:16.020> old<00:06:16.919> standby<00:06:17.430> versus<00:06:17.910> the<00:06:18.030> AST<00:06:18.540> and

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
similar old standby versus the AST and

plot<00:06:27.390> now<00:06:27.990> I<00:06:28.260> used<00:06:28.470> a<00:06:28.590> 5100<00:06:29.370> but<00:06:29.580> this<00:06:29.970> could

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
plot now I used a 5100 but this could

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.250 
plot now I used a 5100 but this could
easily<00:06:30.360> be<00:06:30.660> a<00:06:30.870> 4,100<00:06:31.830> as<00:06:31.979> well<00:06:32.660> the<00:06:33.660> internal

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
easily be a 4,100 as well the internal

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.280 
easily be a 4,100 as well the internal
parts<00:06:34.590> are<00:06:34.770> the<00:06:34.860> same<00:06:35.360> what<00:06:36.360> a<00:06:36.600> lot<00:06:37.110> of<00:06:37.140> the

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 
parts are the same what a lot of the

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.780 
parts are the same what a lot of the
external<00:06:37.680> parts<00:06:38.130> are<00:06:38.280> different<00:06:38.610> between

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 
external parts are different between

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.300 
external parts are different between
those<00:06:39.030> models<00:06:39.390> but<00:06:39.540> but<00:06:40.200> they're<00:06:40.410> very<00:06:40.620> much

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
those models but but they're very much

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.090 
those models but but they're very much
the<00:06:41.520> same<00:06:41.700> internally<00:06:42.440> so<00:06:43.440> I<00:06:43.470> wanted<00:06:43.860> to<00:06:43.950> keep

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
the same internally so I wanted to keep

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.779 
the same internally so I wanted to keep
this<00:06:44.280> under<00:06:44.700> 25<00:06:45.510> minutes<00:06:45.540> and<00:06:46.520> give<00:06:47.520> you<00:06:47.610> just

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:47.789 
this under 25 minutes and give you just

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.719 
this under 25 minutes and give you just
a<00:06:47.880> little<00:06:47.910> taste<00:06:48.330> of<00:06:48.570> shock<00:06:49.530> dyno<00:06:49.919> plots<00:06:50.310> and

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
a little taste of shock dyno plots and

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.049 
a little taste of shock dyno plots and
what<00:06:51.210> to<00:06:51.330> look<00:06:51.510> for<00:06:51.780> and<00:06:51.960> what<00:06:52.169> some<00:06:52.500> of<00:06:52.530> the

00:06:53.049 --> 00:06:53.059 
what to look for and what some of the

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:56.199 
what to look for and what some of the
competition<00:06:53.959> will<00:06:54.139> show<00:06:54.379> you<00:06:54.439> out<00:06:54.739> there<00:06:55.209> this

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:56.209 
competition will show you out there this

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:58.359 
competition will show you out there this
is<00:06:56.449> again<00:06:56.779> just<00:06:57.049> a<00:06:57.169> real<00:06:57.409> very<00:06:58.069> brief

00:06:58.359 --> 00:06:58.369 
is again just a real very brief

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:01.089 
is again just a real very brief
comparison<00:06:59.319> there's<00:07:00.319> a<00:07:00.379> lot<00:07:00.619> of<00:07:00.739> really<00:07:00.860> good

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:01.099 
comparison there's a lot of really good

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:02.889 
comparison there's a lot of really good
shock<00:07:01.549> models<00:07:01.909> out<00:07:02.059> there<00:07:02.089> I<00:07:02.269> think<00:07:02.449> I<00:07:02.659> showed

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:02.899 
shock models out there I think I showed

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:05.289 
shock models out there I think I showed
that<00:07:02.959> I'm<00:07:03.409> trying<00:07:03.739> to<00:07:03.799> be<00:07:03.949> as<00:07:04.099> unbiased<00:07:04.969> as

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:05.299 
that I'm trying to be as unbiased as

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:09.909 
that I'm trying to be as unbiased as
possible<00:07:05.469> but<00:07:06.469> a<00:07:06.799> s<00:07:07.339> T's<00:07:07.610> do<00:07:08.089> make<00:07:08.329> a<00:07:08.919> really

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
possible but a s T's do make a really

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.039 
possible but a s T's do make a really
good<00:07:10.129> shock<00:07:10.429> and<00:07:10.759> you<00:07:11.059> can<00:07:11.239> see<00:07:11.449> that<00:07:11.659> when<00:07:11.959> you

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:12.049 
good shock and you can see that when you

00:07:12.049 --> 00:07:14.309 
good shock and you can see that when you
put<00:07:12.199> it<00:07:12.289> on<00:07:12.409> the<00:07:12.499> dyno<00:07:12.679> and<00:07:13.039> do<00:07:13.759> direct

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 
put it on the dyno and do direct

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:16.149 
put it on the dyno and do direct
comparisons<00:07:15.319> against<00:07:15.649> some<00:07:15.860> of<00:07:15.949> the<00:07:16.009> other

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:16.159 
comparisons against some of the other

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:18.939 
comparisons against some of the other
models<00:07:16.429> out<00:07:16.789> there<00:07:17.110> so<00:07:18.110> we'll<00:07:18.409> be<00:07:18.529> doing<00:07:18.649> more

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:18.949 
models out there so we'll be doing more

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:21.609 
models out there so we'll be doing more
of<00:07:19.099> these<00:07:20.349> demonstrations<00:07:21.349> and

00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:21.619 
of these demonstrations and

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:24.039 
of these demonstrations and
presentations<00:07:22.399> we've<00:07:23.360> got<00:07:23.509> a<00:07:23.539> lot<00:07:23.749> of<00:07:23.899> data

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:24.049 
presentations we've got a lot of data

00:07:24.049 --> 00:07:26.109 
presentations we've got a lot of data
that<00:07:24.319> we<00:07:24.439> can<00:07:24.589> present<00:07:24.979> and<00:07:25.339> hope<00:07:25.610> you<00:07:25.789> enjoyed

00:07:26.109 --> 00:07:26.119 
that we can present and hope you enjoyed

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:28.659 
that we can present and hope you enjoyed
