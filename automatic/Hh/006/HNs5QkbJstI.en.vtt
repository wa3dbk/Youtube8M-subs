played I can't wait for it i really like
it<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.300> two<00:00:48.960> reasons<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:51.059> i

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it for two reasons one is because i

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.900 
it for two reasons one is because i
think<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> game<00:00:52.440> looks<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.070> good<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
think the game looks really good the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.889 
think the game looks really good the
compost<00:00:54.420> play<00:00:54.629> out<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:55.050> well<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:56.899> like

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
compost play out really well just like

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.369 
compost play out really well just like
perfect<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.300> the<00:01:00.300> other<00:01:00.449> reason<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.930> just

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
perfect and the other reason is just

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.179 
perfect and the other reason is just
because<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> best<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.040> after

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
because I'm the best you know after

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.750 
because I'm the best you know after
getting<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> 50<00:01:06.479> game<00:01:06.659> win<00:01:06.900> streak<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
getting like a 50 game win streak and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.130 
getting like a 50 game win streak and
realizing<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.330> escalon<00:01:09.780> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
realizing that I'm on in escalon you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.960 
realizing that I'm on in escalon you
know<00:01:10.229> greater<00:01:10.500> than<00:01:10.710> anything<00:01:10.950> Martin<00:01:11.880> will

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
know greater than anything Martin will

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
know greater than anything Martin will
ever<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.299> able<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.570> achieve<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.140> really

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
ever be able to achieve it just really

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.920 
ever be able to achieve it just really
feels<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.830> um<00:01:15.770> but<00:01:17.000> as<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.450> some<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
feels good um but as for some of the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
feels good um but as for some of the
techniques<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.189> some<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
techniques and some of the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
techniques and some of the
technicalities<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.259> game<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> guess<00:01:22.619> I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
technicalities of the game I guess I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.170 
technicalities of the game I guess I
could<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.189> go<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.430> real<00:01:23.700> quick<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.060> I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
could kind of go in real quick because I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.280 
could kind of go in real quick because I
don't<00:01:24.299> want<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.479> spend<00:01:24.659> too<00:01:24.689> much<00:01:24.869> time<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
don't want to spend too much time on it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.200 
don't want to spend too much time on it
I<00:01:25.530> still<00:01:26.040> plan<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> put<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.670> actual<00:01:27.060> like

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
I still plan to put out actual like

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.789 
I still plan to put out actual like
video<00:01:27.540> footage<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.350> whatnot<00:01:28.530> would

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
video footage of it and whatnot would

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
video footage of it and whatnot would
like<00:01:28.920> goo<00:01:29.040> types<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.400> stuff<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> can

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
like goo types of stuff but what I can

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.719 
like goo types of stuff but what I can
say<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.280> combo<00:01:32.670> system<00:01:32.880> plays

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
say is that the combo system plays

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.819 
say is that the combo system plays
somewhat<00:01:35.729> similar<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.270> marvel<00:01:36.930> vs<00:01:37.140> capcom<00:01:37.170> in

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
somewhat similar to marvel vs capcom in

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.700 
somewhat similar to marvel vs capcom in
a<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.490> where<00:01:39.020> you're<00:01:40.020> pretty<00:01:40.259> much<00:01:40.320> kind<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
a way where you're pretty much kind of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.039 
a way where you're pretty much kind of
set<00:01:40.950> into<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> AVC<00:01:42.000> structure<00:01:42.600> your<00:01:42.810> light

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
set into the AVC structure your light

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.410 
set into the AVC structure your light
medium<00:01:43.290> heavy<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:44.009> your<00:01:44.549> generic<00:01:44.850> combo<00:01:45.270> for

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
medium heavy is your generic combo for

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.240 
medium heavy is your generic combo for
like<00:01:45.540> every<00:01:45.840> character<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.009> press

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
heavy twice in a row it automatically

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.310 
heavy twice in a row it automatically
launches<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.310> character<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.939> tags<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.140> your

um<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:33.530> think<00:02:34.400> what<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:35.390> would<00:02:35.510> use<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.900> for

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
um I think what you would use that for

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.500 
um I think what you would use that for
is<00:02:36.230> mainly<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.650> punish<00:02:37.070> stuff<00:02:37.340> otherwise<00:02:38.060> it's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
is mainly to punish stuff otherwise it's

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.449 
is mainly to punish stuff otherwise it's
still<00:02:38.750> just<00:02:38.960> pretty<00:02:39.380> much<00:02:39.590> most<00:02:39.770> practical<00:02:40.370> to

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
still just pretty much most practical to

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.120 
still just pretty much most practical to
go<00:02:40.550> into<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.790> b<00:02:40.970> c<00:02:41.330> twice<00:02:41.959> again<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.709> don't<00:02:42.920> want

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
go into a b c twice again I don't want

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.530 
go into a b c twice again I don't want
to<00:02:43.220> explain<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.610> too<00:02:43.880> much<00:02:44.060> because<00:02:44.270> it

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
to explain this too much because it

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.590 
to explain this too much because it
might<00:02:44.660> just<00:02:44.840> get<00:02:44.990> overwhelming<00:02:45.740> um<00:02:46.610> there

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
might just get overwhelming um there

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.030 
might just get overwhelming um there
