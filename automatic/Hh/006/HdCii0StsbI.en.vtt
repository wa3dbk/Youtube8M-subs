 Hello everyone, Julia is with you today. 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.580
 tell you about the mechanical fisherman 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.580
 robofish 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.629
 fish just let i die like 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.629
 living unique to real fish 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.520
 what are you so 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.410
 You can see these fish certainly reminds 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.540
 real and even in size they 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.520
 almost as real but if 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.440
 take a closer look at them 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.360
 notice 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.910
 depicted different gears some 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.610
 there is detail in general all that is inherent 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.950
 the robot itself is made of plastic and plastic 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.540
 they have a silicone tail inside and they 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.120
 crammed with various mechanical 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.250
 elements and sensors thanks to which 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.300
 they can swim like real fish 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.520
 by the way 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:16.920
 even seals confuse them with real ones. 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:19.140
 fish when you just keep this 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.180
 the fish in your hands you might think that this 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.980
 ordinary plastic toy which 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.500
 nothing like but 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.370
 only you put it in the water here 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.709
 will start the most interesting work 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.989
 sensor fish feels that it was immersed 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.390
 the water and starts to swim like living these 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.090
 fish don't just swim in a circle either 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.100
 back and forth they swim in 5 directions and 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.850
 may even sink they feel 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.829
 let 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.959
 they can swim alone either you 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.880
 as now flocks in general with these 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.440
 no problem with fish 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.630
 I need to clean the aquarium 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.970
 and also no need to remember you fed 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.269
 them or not because these fish feed 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.850
 just two lr44 batteries of these 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.350
 there will be enough batteries for 6 hours 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.450
 uninterrupted swimming even you are so much in 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.340
 bath you do not sit in general fish very 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.500
 cool and especially if you have long wanted 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.400
 to get fish but your parents for some reason 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.560
 not allowed 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.560
 then these fish are just what you need
