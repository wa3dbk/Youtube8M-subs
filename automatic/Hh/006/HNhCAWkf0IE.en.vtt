00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.570 
Rings just to get them just about the
rights<00:02:07.249> or<00:02:07.520> width<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.560> then<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.310> only<00:02:10.340> thing

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
rights or width and then the only thing

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.580 
rights or width and then the only thing
I<00:02:10.759> could<00:02:10.819> get<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.090> sit<00:02:11.600> right<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:12.080> with<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
I could get to sit right and with the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.170 
I could get to sit right and with the
right<00:02:12.709> width<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.400> was<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.700> suppressor

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
right width and that was the suppressor

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.080 
right width and that was the suppressor
if<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.959> use<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> rectangle<00:02:15.980> long<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.549> just<00:02:16.730> don't

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
if you use a rectangle long I just don't

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.119 
if you use a rectangle long I just don't
right<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.629> this<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.620> cheeky<00:02:19.010> little

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
right and this is the cheeky little

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.940 
right and this is the cheeky little
trick<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.670> used<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.420> Maxim<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.440> well<00:02:21.709> to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
trick that I used to Maxim a well to

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.650 
trick that I used to Maxim a well to
minimize<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.519> amount<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.790> layers<00:02:23.030> if<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.629> use

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
minimize the amount of layers if you use

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.309 
minimize the amount of layers if you use
the<00:02:24.459> Corporal<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.730> gives<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.569> double<00:02:27.110> and

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
the Corporal that gives you a double and

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.610 
the Corporal that gives you a double and
you<00:02:28.280> can<00:02:28.519> then<00:02:28.700> add<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> private<00:02:30.019> to<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.319> so

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
you can then add a private to that so

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.229 
you can then add a private to that so
you<00:02:30.709> use<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.069> lot<00:02:31.370> less<00:02:31.400> layers<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.970> get<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
you use a lot less layers you get the

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.600 
you use a lot less layers you get the
thick<00:02:32.510> sort<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.930> like<00:02:33.050> tree<00:02:33.950> sort<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.430> about

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
thick sort of like tree sort of about

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.559 
thick sort of like tree sort of about
style<00:02:35.060> logo<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:36.640> it's<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.730> casar<00:02:38.000> then<00:02:38.299> just

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
style logo and it's a casar then just

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.210 
style logo and it's a casar then just
tweaking<00:02:38.840> them<00:02:39.140> around<00:02:39.349> just<00:02:39.830> getting<00:02:40.099> them

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
tweaking them around just getting them

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.100 
tweaking them around just getting them
just<00:02:40.489> just<00:02:40.910> right<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.420> they're<00:02:41.569> not<00:02:41.690> touching

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
just just right so they're not touching

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.680 
just just right so they're not touching
the<00:02:42.200> edges<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:42.769> it<00:02:43.670> really<00:02:43.970> does<00:02:44.269> look

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
the edges and it really does look

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.860 
the edges and it really does look
absolutely<00:02:45.290> spot-on<00:02:46.180> one<00:02:47.180> other<00:02:47.299> thing<00:02:47.450> is

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
absolutely spot-on one other thing is

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.650 
absolutely spot-on one other thing is
obviously<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.319> colors<00:02:48.739> of<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.670> logo<00:02:50.090> or

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
obviously the colors of the the logo or

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.509
