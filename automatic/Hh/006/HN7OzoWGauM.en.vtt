00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.630
 I really dared to get on one of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.990

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.880
 I'm with this bike here we go 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.830

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:46.110

 been called the third room 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.000
 international motorcycle lime 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.340
 so we hope to see you in action 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 we will see very little practiced told them 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.180
 the instructor is going to have to grab the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.130
 real bike because I have enough 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.870
 little so let's see what it is that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.870
 Bring us this motorbike 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.430
 first helmet mario and mario me 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.430
 listen out 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.359
 and it happened that we will count up 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.359
 when are you going to the fairs 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.149
 If you have complications to put on 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.149
 drawer we got on so we have 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.799
 the motorcycle 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.870
 this is the clutch and this is the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.080
 throttle 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.720
 and this is the change this left is 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.590
 just like a mechanical car in it 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.590
 function loose everything 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:37.230
 everything you can do for a spin 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:49.630
 and now yes but good we now that 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.040
 the motor has molds and can leave 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.550
 Very much, between two thousand and three thousand 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.290
 quiet revolutions nothing else you're going 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.030
 letting go slowly and you are accelerating the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.030
 pair like one already calm 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.660
 if it is prepared ready mats me 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.980
 I imagine on the side it's okay to 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.980
 front on the route 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.010
 forward 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.380
 if we do not mean more seriously though 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.960
 let go enough 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.040
 now yes and Jenny tells us our 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.080
 producer that can make it a 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.760
 professional marsh if you do not submit to 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.430
 this situation a little more so 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.260
 complicated 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.240
 the quiet desert the clutch does not 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.980
 you drop mario braille this 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.570
 face of a bicycle when letting go 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.200
 inside and without sewers so they can 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.200
 to practice what I say 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.080
 look at cameras that have a good time 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:14.230
 has gone this step I do not want to fall 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.330
 not of course not mario let's see the 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.890
 instructor who should practice for that 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.890
 more always for that
