00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that it counts as two attacks so it will

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.429 
that it counts as two attacks so it will
trigger<00:01:23.820> things<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.450> chain<00:01:24.869> lightning<00:01:25.110> or

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
and I in one dot which is coincidentally

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.180 
and I in one dot which is coincidentally
the<00:02:25.630> ultimate<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.440> he<00:02:26.560> has<00:02:26.680> which<00:02:26.980> is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
the ultimate that he has which is

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.590 
the ultimate that he has which is
basically<00:02:27.670> splits<00:02:28.030> into<00:02:28.150> two<00:02:28.330> doc<00:02:29.940> oh<00:02:30.940> yeah

actually control both of them

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.949 
actually control both of them
independent<00:02:34.269> yeah<00:02:34.420> they're<00:02:34.630> two<00:02:34.780> different

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
independent yeah they're two different

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.479 
independent yeah they're two different
you<00:02:35.220> know<00:02:36.220> they're<00:02:36.700> already<00:02:36.910> messed<00:02:37.239> up<00:02:38.489> wow

lot of experts from hell lets us know

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.479 
lot of experts from hell lets us know
duration<00:02:52.660> on<00:02:52.750> but<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.860> thing<00:02:53.890> what<00:02:54.220> makes

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
duration on but the thing what makes

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.520 
duration on but the thing what makes
this<00:02:54.670> non-us<00:02:55.360> overpowered<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.260> if<00:02:56.380> you

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
this non-us overpowered is that if you

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.310 
this non-us overpowered is that if you
die<00:02:56.709> with<00:02:56.920> one<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.700> other<00:02:57.940> die<00:02:58.209> guy<00:02:58.660> dies<00:02:59.019> too

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
die with one the other die guy dies too

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.870 
die with one the other die guy dies too
like<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.620> are<00:02:59.769> dead<00:02:59.950> if<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:00.190> die<00:03:00.400> with<00:03:00.609> one<00:03:00.760> of

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
like you are dead if you die with one of

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.870 
like you are dead if you die with one of
them<00:03:01.000> so<00:03:01.269> in<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.410> end<00:03:02.590> it's<00:03:03.400> your<00:03:03.519> health

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
them so in the end it's your health

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.080 
them so in the end it's your health
half-door<00:03:04.660> anything<00:03:05.170> oh<00:03:05.700> no<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.760> have<00:03:06.970> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
half-door anything oh no you have the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.610 
half-door anything oh no you have the
same<00:03:07.269> amount<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.600> health<00:03:07.780> health<00:03:08.079> so<00:03:08.560> you

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
same amount of health health so you

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.780 
same amount of health health so you
still<00:03:08.739> have<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.070> two<00:03:09.220> thousand<00:03:09.519> held<00:03:09.670> on

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
still have like two thousand held on

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.160 
still have like two thousand held on
them<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.030> everything<00:03:10.239> when<00:03:10.870> they<00:03:10.959> merged

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
them and everything when they merged

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.310 
them and everything when they merged
together<00:03:11.380> you<00:03:11.890> get<00:03:12.070> like<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.870> health<00:03:14.170> of

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
together you get like the the health of

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.910 
together you get like the the health of
the<00:03:14.440> highest<00:03:15.510> health<00:03:16.510> business<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:17.470> massively

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
the highest health business is massively

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.970 
the highest health business is massively
over<00:03:18.310> power<00:03:18.549> its<00:03:18.970> net<00:03:19.329> actually<00:03:20.079> no<00:03:20.320> I<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.620> for

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
over power its net actually no I you for

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.670 
over power its net actually no I you for
me<00:03:21.100> come<00:03:21.459> on<00:03:21.810> you'd<00:03:22.810> think<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:23.260> your<00:03:23.380> powered

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
me come on you'd think of your powered

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.319 
me come on you'd think of your powered
but<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.040> be<00:03:24.130> honest<00:03:24.400> there's<00:03:24.579> so<00:03:24.730> many<00:03:24.850> weakest

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
but to be honest there's so many weakest

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.990 
but to be honest there's so many weakest
because<00:03:25.750> he<00:03:26.200> doesn't<00:03:26.470> actually<00:03:26.769> have<00:03:27.220> since

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
because he doesn't actually have since

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.460 
because he doesn't actually have since
you<00:03:28.060> tend<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.299> build<00:03:28.450> proc<00:03:28.630> items<00:03:28.959> on<00:03:29.109> Gemini

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
you tend to build proc items on Gemini

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.410 
you tend to build proc items on Gemini
and<00:03:29.620> they<00:03:30.100> don't<00:03:30.310> have<00:03:30.459> those<00:03:30.790> props<00:03:31.150> when<00:03:31.329> you

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
and they don't have those props when you

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.060 
and they don't have those props when you
