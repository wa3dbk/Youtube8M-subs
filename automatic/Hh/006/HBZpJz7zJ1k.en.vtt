00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
like hardcore is quite a different game

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.130 
like hardcore is quite a different game
than<00:00:52.260> software<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.239> lot<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.480> ways<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
than software and in a lot of ways the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.349 
than software and in a lot of ways the
progression<00:00:56.039> from<00:00:56.219> 1<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.640> 60<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.360> soft<00:00:58.079> core<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
progression from 1 to 60 of soft core is

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.270 
progression from 1 to 60 of soft core is
not<00:01:00.359> terribly<00:01:00.660> exciting<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.320> honest<00:01:01.680> at

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
not terribly exciting to be honest at

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.709 
not terribly exciting to be honest at
least<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.699> me<00:01:02.789> anyway<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.539> feels

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
least for me anyway it kind of feels

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.469 
least for me anyway it kind of feels
like<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.619> want<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> 60<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.420> I

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
like I just want to get to 60 so that I

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.969 
like I just want to get to 60 so that I
can<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.750> access<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.260> all<00:01:07.290> my<00:01:07.350> skills<00:01:07.770> and

abilities<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.460> all<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.729> stuff<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.270> with

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
abilities and all that stuff but with

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.450 
abilities and all that stuff but with
hard<00:01:09.869> core<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.189> mindful

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
hard core you really have to be mindful

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.330 
hard core you really have to be mindful
of<00:01:11.729> everything<00:01:12.180> you're<00:01:12.330> doing<00:01:12.479> along<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.020> way

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
of everything you're doing along the way

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.640 
of everything you're doing along the way
and<00:01:14.360> then<00:01:15.360> there's<00:01:15.540> also<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> added<00:01:16.049> bonus<00:01:16.320> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and then there's also the added bonus of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.350 
and then there's also the added bonus of
the<00:01:17.400> auction<00:01:17.850> house<00:01:18.030> being<00:01:19.820> not<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:20.850> flooded

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the auction house being not so flooded

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.560 
the auction house being not so flooded
with<00:01:21.630> amazing<00:01:22.560> items<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.820> there's<00:01:24.299> more

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
with amazing items so there's more

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.920 
with amazing items so there's more
competition<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.259> items<00:01:26.450> instead<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.600> one<00:01:27.780> out

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
competition for items instead of one out

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.819 
competition for items instead of one out
of<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.979> 30<00:01:29.340> items<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.090> find<00:01:30.270> at<00:01:30.829> Inferno

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
of you know 30 items you find at Inferno

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.710 
of you know 30 items you find at Inferno
being<00:01:32.100> worth<00:01:32.430> putting<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> auction<00:01:33.420> house

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
being worth putting on the auction house

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.749 
being worth putting on the auction house
it'll<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:34.079> more<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:35.670> know

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
it'll be more like you know I don't know

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.700 
it'll be more like you know I don't know
what<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> percentage<00:01:36.390> would<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.350> more<00:01:37.590> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
what the percentage would be but more of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.260 
what the percentage would be but more of
the<00:01:37.860> items<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.340> valuable<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.030> it's

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the items will be valuable because it's

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.289 
the items will be valuable because it's
just<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.979> much<00:01:41.189> less<00:01:41.689> gear<00:01:42.689> being<00:01:43.079> found<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
just so so much less gear being found so

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.819 
just so so much less gear being found so
that's<00:01:45.299> another<00:01:45.600> thing<00:01:45.840> I'm<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.530> excited

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
that's another thing I'm really excited

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.100 
that's another thing I'm really excited
about<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:48.390> I'll<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.630> making<00:01:48.780> these<00:01:49.020> videos

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
about so I'll be making these videos

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
about so I'll be making these videos
occasionally<00:01:50.040> I'm<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.310> sure<00:01:50.490> exactly<00:01:51.210> how

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
occasionally I'm not sure exactly how

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.020 
occasionally I'm not sure exactly how
often<00:01:51.899> will<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.590> see<00:01:52.640> at<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> start

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
often will just have to see at the start

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.630 
often will just have to see at the start
it<00:01:54.270> won't<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.659> very<00:01:54.689> often<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:56.219> because<00:01:56.460> it's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
it won't be very often just because it's

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.569 
it won't be very often just because it's
pretty<00:01:57.630> easy<00:01:57.840> at<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.200> very<00:01:58.380> start<00:01:58.469> but<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:59.189> I

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
pretty easy at the very start but as I

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.550 
pretty easy at the very start but as I
start<00:01:59.820> getting<00:01:59.909> into<00:02:00.360> later<00:02:00.719> acts<00:02:01.110> later

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
start getting into later acts later

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.090 
start getting into later acts later
difficulties<00:02:02.299> maybe<00:02:03.299> I'll<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> by<00:02:04.350> level

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
difficulties maybe I'll do it by level

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.310 
difficulties maybe I'll do it by level
progression<00:02:05.820> or<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.000> might<00:02:06.180> do<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> /<00:02:06.600> act<00:02:06.840> or

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
progression or I might do it / act or

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.169 
progression or I might do it / act or
I'm<00:02:07.950> not<00:02:08.099> really<00:02:08.220> sure<00:02:08.310> how<00:02:08.610> many<00:02:08.670> did

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
I'm not really sure how many did

I'm not really sure how many did
it<00:02:09.390> up<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:10.289> I'll<00:02:10.379> find<00:02:10.619> some<00:02:10.829> way<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.069> make<00:02:11.579> it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
it up but I'll find some way to make it

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.030 
it up but I'll find some way to make it
make<00:02:11.969> sense<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.540> I'll<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.140> kind<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.409> give

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
progression i'm trying really hard not

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.809 
progression i'm trying really hard not
to<00:03:24.569> die<00:03:24.720> like<00:03:25.010> i'm<00:03:26.010> taking<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.489> seriously

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
to die like i'm taking it seriously

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.460 
to die like i'm taking it seriously
that's<00:03:27.090> part<00:03:27.359> of<00:03:27.419> a<00:03:27.599> big<00:03:27.810> reason<00:03:27.989> i'm<00:03:28.229> playing

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
that's part of a big reason i'm playing

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.069 
that's part of a big reason i'm playing
a<00:03:28.560> wizard<00:03:28.889> is<00:03:29.069> because<00:03:29.790> i<00:03:29.819> have<00:03:30.359> experience

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
a wizard is because i have experience

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.140 
a wizard is because i have experience
with<00:03:31.169> a<00:03:31.229> wizard<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.129> i<00:03:32.159> think<00:03:32.280> i'm<00:03:32.549> a<00:03:32.579> lot<00:03:32.849> less

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
with a wizard so i think i'm a lot less

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.969 
with a wizard so i think i'm a lot less
likely<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.870> die<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.290> i<00:03:34.439> just<00:03:34.590> really<00:03:34.859> like

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
likely to die and i just really like

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.460 
likely to die and i just really like
wizard<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.299> i'll<00:03:36.540> be<00:03:36.629> taking<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.989> seriously

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
wizard so i'll be taking it seriously

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.640 
wizard so i'll be taking it seriously
and<00:03:37.769> really<00:03:38.310> working<00:03:38.909> hard<00:03:38.939> to<00:03:39.479> stay<00:03:40.109> safe<00:03:40.409> and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
and really working hard to stay safe and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.520 
and really working hard to stay safe and
get<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.189> level<00:03:41.370> 60<00:03:41.819> 60<00:03:42.659> is<00:03:42.720> my<00:03:42.870> goal<00:03:43.109> what's<00:03:43.409> him
