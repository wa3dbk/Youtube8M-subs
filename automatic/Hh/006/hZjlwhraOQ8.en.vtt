00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
it when you talk about areola but will

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.370 
it when you talk about areola but will
he<00:03:57.950> come<00:03:58.160> in<00:03:58.220> at<00:03:58.519> 240<00:03:59.359> like<00:03:59.600> he<00:03:59.780> said<00:04:00.049> he<00:04:00.230> has<00:04:00.350> a

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
he come in at 240 like he said he has a

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.259 
he come in at 240 like he said he has a
bet<00:04:00.709> with<00:04:00.890> his<00:04:01.040> trainer<00:04:01.370> in<00:04:01.670> his<00:04:01.790> camp<00:04:02.090> I

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
bet with his trainer in his camp I

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.140 
bet with his trainer in his camp I
believe<00:04:03.519> that<00:04:04.519> he's<00:04:04.609> going<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:04.820> come<00:04:04.940> in<00:04:05.060> at

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
believe that he's going to come in at

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.380 
believe that he's going to come in at
239<00:04:05.630> so<00:04:06.290> I'm<00:04:06.859> not<00:04:07.489> sure<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:07.970> know<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.209> thing

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
239 so I'm not sure you know the thing

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.259 
239 so I'm not sure you know the thing
about<00:04:08.420> his<00:04:08.780> weight<00:04:09.049> is<00:04:09.609> it'll<00:04:10.609> only<00:04:10.760> make<00:04:10.910> him

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
about his weight is it'll only make him

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.720 
about his weight is it'll only make him
faster<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:11.989> only<00:04:12.170> make<00:04:12.440> his<00:04:12.560> combos<00:04:13.010> better<00:04:13.370> if

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
faster it only make his combos better if

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.880 
faster it only make his combos better if
he<00:04:13.910> loses<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.540> way

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
he loses the way

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.960 
he loses the way
but<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:15.980> thing<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.459> don't<00:04:16.549> see<00:04:16.820> him<00:04:16.940> that

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
but the thing is you don't see him that

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.940 
but the thing is you don't see him that
tired<00:04:17.510> you<00:04:17.959> know<00:04:18.019> what<00:04:18.169> I<00:04:18.200> mean<00:04:18.230> it's<00:04:18.650> not<00:04:18.799> like

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
tired you know what I mean it's not like

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.129 
tired you know what I mean it's not like
he's<00:04:19.340> huffing<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:19.820> puffing<00:04:20.180> after<00:04:20.480> three

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
he's huffing and puffing after three

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.890 
he's huffing and puffing after three
rounds<00:04:21.169> so<00:04:21.889> it's<00:04:22.270> something<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.360> gotta<00:04:23.510> dress

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
rounds so it's something you gotta dress

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.020 
rounds so it's something you gotta dress
but<00:04:24.230> I<00:04:24.290> think<00:04:24.590> he's<00:04:24.740> slowly<00:04:25.130> getting<00:04:25.340> ahold<00:04:25.850> of

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
but I think he's slowly getting ahold of

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.850 
but I think he's slowly getting ahold of
it<00:04:26.180> now<00:04:26.360> what<00:04:26.810> do<00:04:26.870> I<00:04:26.930> think<00:04:27.260> happens<00:04:27.650> in<00:04:27.770> this

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
it now what do I think happens in this

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.970 
it now what do I think happens in this
fight<00:04:28.450> like<00:04:29.450> i<00:04:29.540> said<00:04:29.750> adamek<00:04:30.230> all<00:04:30.410> day<00:04:30.740> behind

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
fight like i said adamek all day behind

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.580 
fight like i said adamek all day behind
that<00:04:31.280> jab<00:04:31.580> could<00:04:31.940> really<00:04:32.360> cause<00:04:33.139> a<00:04:33.169> lot<00:04:33.560> of

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
that jab could really cause a lot of

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.940 
that jab could really cause a lot of
problems<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:35.660> think<00:04:36.410> he's<00:04:36.500> got<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.680> really

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
problems and I think he's got a really

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.830 
problems and I think he's got a really
good<00:04:37.100> shot<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.490> winning<00:04:37.730> you<00:04:38.360> know<00:04:38.480> I<00:04:38.510> mean<00:04:38.690> I

good shot of winning you know I mean I

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.170 
good shot of winning you know I mean I
think<00:04:38.870> he's<00:04:39.139> a<00:04:39.169> he's<00:04:39.950> a<00:04:39.980> good<00:04:40.220> fighter<00:04:40.460> so<00:04:41.120> I

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
think he's a he's a good fighter so I

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.129 
think he's a he's a good fighter so I
she<00:04:41.330> had<00:04:41.419> this<00:04:41.540> heavyweight<00:04:41.870> division

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
she had this heavyweight division

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.900 
she had this heavyweight division
there's<00:04:42.620> not<00:04:42.740> many<00:04:42.860> guys<00:04:43.100> that<00:04:43.400> actually<00:04:43.520> set

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
there's not many guys that actually set

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.250 
there's not many guys that actually set
their<00:04:44.090> shots<00:04:44.360> up<00:04:44.630> with<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.320> jab<00:04:45.790> however<00:04:47.260> you

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
their shots up with the jab however you

their shots up with the jab however you
know<00:04:48.290> I<00:04:48.650> think<00:04:49.130> ariel<00:04:49.790> is<00:04:49.970> gonna<00:04:50.150> get<00:04:50.360> to<00:04:50.570> him

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
know I think ariel is gonna get to him

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.640 
know I think ariel is gonna get to him
at<00:04:50.780> some<00:04:51.050> point<00:04:51.350> um<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:53.139> did<00:04:54.139> I<00:04:54.169> just<00:04:54.470> have<00:04:54.620> a

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
at some point um I did I just have a

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.610 
at some point um I did I just have a
feeling<00:04:54.950> i<00:04:55.340> don't<00:04:55.639> know<00:04:55.940> if<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.180> jab<00:04:56.690> will

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
feeling i don't know if that jab will

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.440 
feeling i don't know if that jab will
keep<00:04:57.860> him<00:04:58.010> at<00:04:58.100> bay<00:04:58.160> because<00:04:58.490> i<00:04:58.669> think<00:04:58.850> adamek

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
keep him at bay because i think adamek

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.000 
keep him at bay because i think adamek
will<00:04:59.600> have<00:04:59.750> a<00:04:59.780> lot<00:05:00.020> of<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.229> success<00:05:00.770> and

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
will have a lot of a success and

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.430 
will have a lot of a success and
probably<00:05:01.729> be<00:05:01.880> up<00:05:02.030> in<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.270> cards<00:05:02.750> but<00:05:03.260> like<00:05:03.410> I

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
probably be up in the cards but like I

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.670 
probably be up in the cards but like I
said<00:05:03.590> with<00:05:03.889> Adamek<00:05:04.540> if<00:05:05.540> you<00:05:05.750> do<00:05:05.990> get<00:05:06.200> to<00:05:06.500> him

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
said with Adamek if you do get to him

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.469 
said with Adamek if you do get to him
and<00:05:07.190> like<00:05:07.250> I<00:05:07.370> said<00:05:07.430> he's<00:05:07.700> there<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:08.000> be<00:05:08.120> hit<00:05:08.330> he

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
and like I said he's there to be hit he

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.690 
and like I said he's there to be hit he
can<00:05:08.660> get<00:05:08.780> hit<00:05:08.960> too<00:05:08.990> and<00:05:09.620> I<00:05:09.770> think<00:05:09.830> areola<00:05:10.490> once

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
can get hit too and I think areola once

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.390 
can get hit too and I think areola once
he<00:05:10.820> gets<00:05:11.030> hit<00:05:11.240> you<00:05:11.870> know<00:05:11.990> or<00:05:12.740> once<00:05:12.979> I<00:05:13.100> really

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
he gets hit you know or once I really

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.580 
he gets hit you know or once I really
garriola<00:05:14.060> gets<00:05:14.450> to<00:05:14.660> adamak<00:05:15.080> that's<00:05:15.410> when

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
garriola gets to adamak that's when

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.530 
garriola gets to adamak that's when
Adamek<00:05:16.010> will<00:05:16.160> respond<00:05:16.700> and<00:05:16.970> get<00:05:17.060> into<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.270> brawl

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
Adamek will respond and get into a brawl

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.980 
Adamek will respond and get into a brawl
and<00:05:18.260> I<00:05:18.440> believe<00:05:18.800> that<00:05:19.100> no<00:05:19.310> matter<00:05:19.490> how<00:05:19.990> those

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
and I believe that no matter how those

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.560 
and I believe that no matter how those
hands<00:05:21.229> up<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:21.740> that<00:05:21.860> jab<00:05:22.190> is<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:22.880> know<00:05:23.000> and

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
hands up and that jab is you know and

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.260 
hands up and that jab is you know and
