often<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.240> sometimes<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:43.080> will<00:01:43.229> you're<00:01:43.979> gonna

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
often but sometimes it will you're gonna

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.400 
often but sometimes it will you're gonna
have<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:45.000> split<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.390> only<00:01:45.869> screen<00:01:46.229> you

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
have to split up the only screen you

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.280 
have to split up the only screen you
have<00:01:46.440> on<00:01:47.009> top<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.570> screen<00:01:48.930> isn't

that immersive if you have a stand

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.219 
that immersive if you have a stand
allows<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.970> do<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.930> go<00:01:55.080> into

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
allows you to do so you can go into

allows you to do so you can go into
portrait<00:01:55.740> mode<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.390> actually<00:01:57.840> very<00:01:57.869> good

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
portrait mode this is actually very good

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
portrait mode this is actually very good
for<00:01:58.350> playing<00:01:58.800> games<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.340> part<00:01:59.550> minus<00:01:59.790> because

you now have to contend with bezels if

you now have to contend with bezels if

of the game

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.010 
of the game
available<00:03:29.980> because<00:03:30.820> your<00:03:31.270> monitors<00:03:31.780> are

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
available because your monitors are

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.260 
available because your monitors are

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
to 16 x 16 x 10 games will look a lot

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.960 
to 16 x 16 x 10 games will look a lot
crisper<00:03:38.710> because<00:03:39.160> you're<00:03:39.340> running<00:03:39.730> in<00:03:39.880> a

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
crisper because you're running in a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.780 
crisper because you're running in a
higher<00:03:40.210> resolution<00:03:40.690> also<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:42.100> bigger<00:03:42.340> screen

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
higher resolution also the bigger screen

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.210 
higher resolution also the bigger screen
allows<00:03:43.120> for<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.540> more<00:03:43.870> immersive<00:03:44.140> feel<00:03:44.650> as<00:03:45.010> well

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
allows for a more immersive feel as well

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.730 
allows for a more immersive feel as well
but<00:03:46.090> still<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.660> brings<00:03:46.900> disadvantages

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
but still that brings disadvantages

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.500 
but still that brings disadvantages
because<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.280> bezels<00:03:48.670> are<00:03:48.760> now<00:03:48.940> much<00:03:49.270> much

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
because the bezels are now much much

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.720 
because the bezels are now much much
closer<00:03:49.840> together<00:03:50.140> so<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.160> makes<00:03:51.310> them<00:03:51.520> much

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
closer together so it makes them much

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.390 
closer together so it makes them much
more<00:03:52.030> apparent<00:03:52.770> also<00:03:53.770> because<00:03:54.250> you're

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
more apparent also because you're

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.070 
more apparent also because you're
running<00:03:54.730> more<00:03:55.000> than<00:03:55.060> one<00:03:55.360> monitor<00:03:55.780> that's

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
running more than one monitor that's

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.620 
running more than one monitor that's
going<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.320> tax<00:03:56.590> your<00:03:56.800> GPU<00:03:57.280> more<00:03:57.700> than<00:03:57.970> just

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
going to tax your GPU more than just

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.440 
going to tax your GPU more than just
running<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:59.110> once<00:03:59.380> and<00:04:00.280> not<00:04:00.520> necessarily<00:04:00.760> give

running it once and not necessarily give

you any more feeling of you than you had
before<00:04:06.630> you<00:04:07.630> can<00:04:07.780> get<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.960> little<00:04:08.200> crazy<00:04:08.500> with

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
before you can get a little crazy with

before you can get a little crazy with
portrait<00:04:09.310> monitors<00:04:09.670> if<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.030> go<00:04:10.210> get<00:04:10.450> 5

in<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.060> two<00:05:39.240> 20s<00:05:39.660> I<00:05:39.870> went<00:05:40.080> full<00:05:40.440> scale<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:40.949> got

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
in the two 20s I went full scale and got

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.969 
in the two 20s I went full scale and got
the<00:05:41.250> 2<00:05:41.820> 38<00:05:42.240> years<00:05:42.449> on<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:42.660> side<00:05:42.870> that's<00:05:43.800> just

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
the 2 38 years on the side that's just

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.400 
the 2 38 years on the side that's just
because<00:05:44.220> it's<00:05:45.150> much<00:05:45.360> more<00:05:45.570> compatible<00:05:45.930> with

the other vendors I didn't know no I'll

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.990 
the other vendors I didn't know no I'll
worry<00:05:49.169> about<00:05:49.259> a<00:05:49.440> software<00:05:49.979> solution<00:05:50.160> that's

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
worry about a software solution that's

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.219 
worry about a software solution that's
awfully<00:05:52.070> I'd<00:05:53.070> also<00:05:53.310> like<00:05:53.610> to<00:05:53.669> talk<00:05:53.970> about

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
awfully I'd also like to talk about

ones<00:05:59.370> with<00:05:59.610> odd<00:05:59.849> one<00:06:00.570> three<00:06:01.530> and<00:06:01.560> five<00:06:02.270> but<00:06:03.270> you

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
ones with odd one three and five but you

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.379 
ones with odd one three and five but you
can<00:06:03.569> actually<00:06:03.750> game<00:06:04.319> on<00:06:04.620> two<00:06:04.979> monitors<00:06:05.389> tune

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
advantage of I affinities api's and

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.650
