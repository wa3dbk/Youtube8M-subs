00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
wither is high in the air and he really

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.480

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.070 
said no chance and that is why I had to

him and I really thought the skeletons
arrows<00:03:01.630> would<00:03:01.840> hit<00:03:02.020> him<00:03:02.110> that's<00:03:02.350> weird<00:03:02.620> I

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
arrows would hit him that's weird I

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.960 
arrows would hit him that's weird I
never<00:03:03.160> seen<00:03:03.370> that<00:03:03.400> before

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
never seen that before

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.160 
never seen that before

gunner<00:03:05.740> against<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.610> wither<00:03:06.820> which<00:03:07.030> should

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
gunner against the wither which should

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.910

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
so now guys I've switched it today and

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.300 
so now guys I've switched it today and
if<00:03:40.420> you're<00:03:40.570> wondering<00:03:40.840> why<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.200> was<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:41.830> dark

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
if you're wondering why it was so dark

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.580 
if you're wondering why it was so dark
the<00:03:42.550> first<00:03:42.820> couple<00:03:43.300> rounds<00:03:43.330> it<00:03:44.080> was<00:03:44.410> because

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
the first couple rounds it was because

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.380 
the first couple rounds it was because
the<00:03:44.709> skeletons<00:03:45.220> burned<00:03:45.519> during<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.880> day<00:03:46.090> and

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
the skeletons burned during the day and

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.090 
the skeletons burned during the day and
I<00:03:46.690> made<00:03:46.870> them<00:03:46.989> fight<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.320> wither<00:03:47.530> guys<00:03:47.800> I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
I made them fight the wither guys I

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.009 
I made them fight the wither guys I
couldn't<00:03:48.580> have<00:03:48.760> them<00:03:48.970> burning<00:03:49.390> too<00:03:49.570> that

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
couldn't have them burning too that

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.140 
couldn't have them burning too that
would<00:03:50.170> just<00:03:50.500> be<00:03:50.650> wrong<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.310> for<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:51.940> next

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
would just be wrong and for the next

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.970 
would just be wrong and for the next
round<00:03:52.330> we<00:03:52.480> were<00:03:52.570> planning<00:03:52.930> on<00:03:53.230> fighting<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.680> B

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
round we were planning on fighting the B

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.040 
round we were planning on fighting the B
I<00:03:54.220> tried<00:03:54.670> that<00:03:54.820> he<00:03:54.970> can't<00:03:55.330> actually<00:03:55.810> hit<00:03:55.930> the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
I tried that he can't actually hit the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.990 
I tried that he can't actually hit the
wither<00:03:56.230> either<00:03:56.560> but<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.280> switched<00:03:57.550> it<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.820> an

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
wither either but I switched it to an

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.030 
wither either but I switched it to an
even<00:03:58.209> better<00:03:58.510> mob<00:03:58.780> it's<00:03:59.320> gonna<00:03:59.470> be<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.769> spit

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
even better mob it's gonna be the spit

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.890 
even better mob it's gonna be the spit
bug<00:04:00.250> instead<00:04:00.790> he's<00:04:00.970> got<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.209> hundred<00:04:01.570> health

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
bug instead he's got a hundred health

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.780 
bug instead he's got a hundred health
instead<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.560> eighty<00:04:02.830> so<00:04:03.430> he<00:04:03.519> might<00:04:03.610> have<00:04:03.730> a

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
instead of eighty so he might have a

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.000 
instead of eighty so he might have a
chance<00:04:04.060> here<00:04:04.330> against<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.170> wither<00:04:05.380> so<00:04:05.860> let

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
chance here against the wither so let

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.110 
chance here against the wither so let
the<00:04:06.130> battle<00:04:06.370> begin

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
acid attack which should hopefully do a

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.229 
acid attack which should hopefully do a
lot<00:04:11.380> of<00:04:11.410> damage<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:12.580> wither<00:04:12.790> is<00:04:12.970> at<00:04:13.090> full

which<00:06:01.159> seems<00:06:01.490> like<00:06:01.669> a<00:06:01.699> really<00:06:02.000> obvious<00:06:02.300> battle

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
which seems like a really obvious battle

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.769 
which seems like a really obvious battle
I<00:06:03.139> tried<00:06:03.710> it<00:06:03.919> and<00:06:04.069> it<00:06:04.430> just<00:06:04.759> doesn't<00:06:05.240> work<00:06:05.389> the

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
I tried it and it just doesn't work the

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:07.450 
I tried it and it just doesn't work the
mere<00:06:05.960> skeleton<00:06:06.469> when<00:06:06.620> he<00:06:06.680> shoots<00:06:06.919> arrows<00:06:07.279> they

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
mere skeleton when he shoots arrows they

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.879 
mere skeleton when he shoots arrows they
actually<00:06:07.969> go<00:06:08.240> through<00:06:08.599> the<00:06:08.810> wither<00:06:09.020> which<00:06:09.740> was

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
actually go through the wither which was

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.379 
actually go through the wither which was
really<00:06:10.069> weird<00:06:10.279> they<00:06:10.610> can't<00:06:10.849> hit<00:06:10.969> him<00:06:11.089> they<00:06:11.240> go

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
really weird they can't hit him they go

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:12.760 
really weird they can't hit him they go

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:24.770 
a good hug it's a really really bad hug

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.790 
a good hug it's a really really bad hug
he's<00:07:25.670> out<00:07:25.820> a<00:07:25.850> 152<00:07:26.570> and<00:07:26.600> the<00:07:26.900> wither<00:07:27.140> is<00:07:27.410> about

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
he's out a 152 and the wither is about

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.060 
he's out a 152 and the wither is about
to<00:07:28.010> die<00:07:28.310> guys<00:07:28.610> he's<00:07:28.910> at<00:07:29.060> 11<00:07:29.570> now<00:07:29.750> and<00:07:30.530> he's<00:07:30.770> at<00:07:30.890> 2

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:31.070 
to die guys he's at 11 now and he's at 2

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.490 
to die guys he's at 11 now and he's at 2
and<00:07:31.370> he's<00:07:31.520> dead<00:07:31.760> the<00:07:32.240> first<00:07:32.630> win<00:07:32.930> against<00:07:33.350> him

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:33.500 
and he's dead the first win against him

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.170 
and he's dead the first win against him
and<00:07:33.980> I<00:07:34.070> guess<00:07:34.220> with<00:07:34.370> the<00:07:34.400> wither<00:07:34.640> effect<00:07:35.030> he's

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.180
