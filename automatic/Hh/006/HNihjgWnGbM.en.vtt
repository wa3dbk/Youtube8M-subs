00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
and a few seconds here so let me hurry

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.290 
and a few seconds here so let me hurry
up<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.370> do<00:02:11.550> kind<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> over

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
up and do kind of the over

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.780 
up and do kind of the over
the<00:02:12.480> map<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:13.080> here's<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.440> main<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.790> standard

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
the map so here's the main a standard

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.870 
the map so here's the main a standard
natural<00:02:15.270> standard<00:02:15.930> ramp<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:17.010> as<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:17.760> see

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
natural standard ramp and as you can see

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.940 
natural standard ramp and as you can see
the<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.330> next<00:02:18.570> nearest<00:02:18.780> expansion<00:02:19.410> minerals

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
the the next nearest expansion minerals

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.890 
the the next nearest expansion minerals
only<00:02:20.220> no<00:02:20.370> gas<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.120> there's<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.390> kind<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.810> a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
only no gas so there's a kind of a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.350 
only no gas so there's a kind of a
larger<00:02:22.530> fight<00:02:22.740> for<00:02:23.160> these<00:02:23.340> kind<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.760> other

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
larger fight for these kind of other

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.090 
larger fight for these kind of other
starting<00:02:24.720> points<00:02:24.990> it's<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.380> four<00:02:25.680> player<00:02:25.860> map

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
starting points it's a four player map

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.740 
starting points it's a four player map
looks<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.970> actually<00:02:27.270> gonna<00:02:27.360> send<00:02:27.630> that

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
looks like you actually gonna send that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.810 
looks like you actually gonna send that
SUV<00:02:28.020> straight<00:02:28.320> across<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.740> middle<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
SUV straight across the middle and the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.070 
SUV straight across the middle and the
other<00:02:29.940> thing<00:02:30.150> I'm<00:02:30.210> gonna<00:02:30.330> notice<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.960> can

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
other thing I'm gonna notice is you can

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.540 
other thing I'm gonna notice is you can
see<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> large<00:02:31.500> kind<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.800> artifact<00:02:32.250> area

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
see a large kind of artifact area

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.860 
see a large kind of artifact area
leading<00:02:32.790> kinda<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.240> this<00:02:33.360> area<00:02:33.600> right<00:02:33.720> here

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
leading kinda to this area right here

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.300 
leading kinda to this area right here
which<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.380> think<00:02:34.410> whether<00:02:34.680> supply<00:02:35.040> deep<00:02:35.190> was

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
which is I think whether supply deep was

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.770 
which is I think whether supply deep was
going<00:02:35.520> down<00:02:35.640> here<00:02:35.820> this<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.090> kind<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.330> this

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
going down here this is kind of this

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.390 
going down here this is kind of this
kind<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.080> portion<00:02:37.530> leaning<00:02:38.010> off<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.250> cliff

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
kind of portion leaning off this cliff

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.500 
kind of portion leaning off this cliff
is<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.700> most<00:02:39.030> vulnerable<00:02:39.270> area<00:02:40.070> for<00:02:41.070> drop

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
is the most vulnerable area for drop

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.640 
is the most vulnerable area for drop
which<00:02:42.510> makes<00:02:42.750> drop<00:02:42.960> ships<00:02:43.170> actually<00:02:43.290> very

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
which makes drop ships actually very

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.920 
which makes drop ships actually very
important<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.400> map<00:02:44.610> both<00:02:45.210> for<00:02:45.540> defense

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
important in this map both for defense

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.330 
important in this map both for defense
and<00:02:46.080> offense<00:02:46.440> one<00:02:46.800> because<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:47.190> such<00:02:47.310> a

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
and offense one because it's such a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.950 
and offense one because it's such a
large<00:02:47.640> map<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.060> see<00:02:48.090> larger<00:02:48.540> maps<00:02:48.720> like

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
large map and you see larger maps like

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.410 
large map and you see larger maps like
this<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:50.160> just<00:02:50.310> need<00:02:50.460> drop<00:02:50.850> ships<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.180> kind<00:02:51.330> of

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
this you just need drop ships to kind of

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.600 
this you just need drop ships to kind of
viably<00:02:52.020> take<00:02:52.290> expansions<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.130> you're<00:02:53.370> gonna

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
viably take expansions and you're gonna

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.160 
viably take expansions and you're gonna
send<00:02:53.880> up<00:02:54.030> I'm<00:02:54.270> sorry<00:02:54.480> skew<00:02:54.750> gonna<00:02:54.930> send<00:02:55.080> in

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
send up I'm sorry skew gonna send in

and it looks like yeah it's gonna die
fairly<00:03:26.940> quickly<00:03:27.120> here<00:03:27.239> but<00:03:28.050> yeah<00:03:28.200> drop<00:03:28.470> ships

very<00:03:28.950> important<00:03:29.489> on<00:03:29.640> this<00:03:29.850> map<00:03:30.290> we'll<00:03:31.290> the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
very important on this map we'll the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.570 
very important on this map we'll the
only<00:03:31.620> information<00:03:31.860> you're<00:03:32.190> getting<00:03:32.400> right

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
only information you're getting right

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.070 
only information you're getting right
here<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.910> there's<00:03:33.090> not<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.300> kind<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.750> an

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
here that there's not a kind of an

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.170 
here that there's not a kind of an
infantry<00:03:34.530> rush<00:03:34.770> which<00:03:35.310> really<00:03:35.640> on<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> map<00:03:35.970> this

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
infantry rush which really on a map this

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.250 
infantry rush which really on a map this
size<00:03:36.360> isn't<00:03:36.570> very<00:03:36.840> viable

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
size isn't very viable

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.560 
size isn't very viable
anyway<00:03:37.590> two<00:03:38.489> Marines<00:03:38.730> at<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.090> front<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.480> it

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
anyway two Marines at the front and it

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.960 
anyway two Marines at the front and it
looks<00:03:39.720> like<00:03:39.810> Yosh<00:03:40.380> going<00:03:40.739> for<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.400> two<00:03:41.550> factory

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
looks like Yosh going for a two factory

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.479 
looks like Yosh going for a two factory
build<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:43.230> he's<00:03:43.380> gonna<00:03:43.470> be<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> little<00:03:43.860> bit<00:03:44.100> a

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
build so he's gonna be a little bit a

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.030 
build so he's gonna be a little bit a
little<00:03:44.760> bit<00:03:44.970> behind<00:03:45.120> skew<00:03:45.630> if<00:03:45.930> skew<00:03:46.800> and<00:03:46.950> it

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
little bit behind skew if skew and it

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.530 
little bit behind skew if skew and it
looks<00:03:47.190> like<00:03:47.250> yes<00:03:47.580> you<00:03:47.820> only<00:03:48.000> going<00:03:48.239> with<00:03:48.420> that

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
machine shop so skews probably gonna go

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.810 
machine shop so skews probably gonna go
for<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.900> basically<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.380> command<00:03:52.770> center<00:03:53.070> build

floating up this command center or I
should<00:04:14.160> say<00:04:14.340> barracks<00:04:14.880> gonna<00:04:15.600> take<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:15.900> across

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
should say barracks gonna take it across

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.199 
should say barracks gonna take it across
the<00:04:16.260> map<00:04:16.410> same<00:04:16.680> for<00:04:17.040> skew<00:04:17.910> in<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.060> meantime

the map same for skew in the meantime
going<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.570> float<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.840> across<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.230> middle<00:04:19.549> but

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
going to float it across the middle but

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.580 
going to float it across the middle but
yeah<00:04:20.669> taking<00:04:20.970> basically<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:22.020> map<00:04:22.200> really
