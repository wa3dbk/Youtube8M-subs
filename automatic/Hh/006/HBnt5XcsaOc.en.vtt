00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
factor and I'm hoping that Microsoft

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.050 
factor and I'm hoping that Microsoft
definitely<00:04:22.800> takes<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.730> into<00:04:23.910> account

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
definitely takes that into account

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.170 
definitely takes that into account
