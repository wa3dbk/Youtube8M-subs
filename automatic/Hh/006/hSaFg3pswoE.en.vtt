 new version of said game is more 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.390
 simple to perform good to perform 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.370
 in the sense of what would be his 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.930
 manufacturing 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.930
 and I thought that how 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.770
 last week on Sunday do not perform 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.010
 no promotion so I'm going to put this 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.540
 game in promotion in the store so 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.910
 for everyone who makes a purchase 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.740
 this time make a purchase 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.100
 minimum ten euros which is what is 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.510
 allows the mayito and point is for the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.710
 activity to said gift game 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.710
 it still fits 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.270
 finish versioning it and apply it 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.220
 a story the idea to the idea 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.460
 It is obviously related to the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.670
 devil since I came up with the 36 is 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.220
 which are the how well you know the number 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.570
 of the devil and in turn , it occurred to me 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.900
 that its price was 666 to follow 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.080
 thus maintaining this dynamic game 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.450
 Well, now I realize that I want 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.820
 I watched him jce 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.899
 first I think I would like me 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.269
 comment if you see it better or worse than you 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.030
 it seems in relation to the previously 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.160
 uploaded the one in the magic channel 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.849
 trick and if anyone comes up with a 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.860
 history 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.730
 you already know that although to seven by one what 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.560
 did since magic gratifies to 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.099
 everyone who throws a cable to the store 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.240
 and a good story related to 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.940
 said character 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.340
 Well, the truth can be fun 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.280
 yes so I leave everything to you 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.190
 imagination next to the game 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.370
 that gives a good result then good 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.890
 gratification thank you very much 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.400
 and it's already good because as it comes it has 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.280
 commented 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.159
 I come to show you the card game 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.019
 of the devil the idea of ​​the game and here a 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:59.400
 little more simplified than in the video 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:04.379
 previous is to show the public three 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.569
 white emails 1 2 and 3 and make a 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.700
 movement only extract a letter 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.489
 and leave it behind to make the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.780
 back of the cards and one turn 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.329
 would make it appear 36 is like I've already 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.340
 said the idea is to relate it to 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.069
 some story that has to do with the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.909
 Devil 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.879
 given that 666 is the number of the devil if 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.280
 Do you find any valid history? 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.459
 As I said before I was gratified 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.349
 who shows their best story many 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.560
 thank you and now yes until the next 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.560
