00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello friends and I will also go out 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.660
 you more a video the asphalt 80 more 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.160
 We're not playing in the game's notebook . 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.420
 here at holo 1820 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.910
 I'll explain more about this to you. 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.260
 in the course of the video is not multiplayer 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.000
 This time I'll show you one more. 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.600
 career video show that a 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.600
 infection race or here with the camaro 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.700
 you can already notice from the beginning of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.309
 video that the graphics are excellent 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.140
 so worthy to get out of the version that was 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.760
 playing there on the computer on windows 8 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.460
 The bad side of this is that the game is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.309
 too heavy for the smartphone 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.289
 you will look at question 1.517 say if 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.090
 I 'm not mistaken because it's a lot of space 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.670
 best my inner commandment is 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.620
 8 gigabytes that actually to us 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.960
 using the same ends up having a 5 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.539
 gigabytes then takes up a lot of space and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.860
 delete a lot to install it is 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.299
 Too bad I can not be 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.680
 playing on windows 8 than on windows 8 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.330
 It was much better for me to play because 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.280
 could play with xbox control was 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 playing with it on television and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.270
 everything else 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.619
 now you have to play here on windows 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.869
 phone is complicated for me 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.299
 mainly for this reason storage 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.830
 internal be quite limited but I am 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.060
 waiting to leave windows phone another point 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.560
 that I can install on the card 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.900
 memory will get more restful 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.640
 wanting to be last here or between 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.950
 the last in the square you infected 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.869
 How to face Infection Now 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.970
 okay then talk to you there as 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.670
 the whole race works better 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.590
 world read palcar hit back to me I 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.899
 infected, as the latter is not 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.450
 counting time and now tell me I have 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.100
 30 seconds of life this is going to go 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.070
 increasing this time formula 1 by tapping 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.189
 opponents hitting opponents 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.020
 destroying them I gain more time 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.899
 which good side to be infected side 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.399
 good is an infinite book I can give 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.110
 start the whole race fourth 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.360
 survive whole race right 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.549
 one bad side is that after a 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.259
 Some time I'll explode if I do not go 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.390
 destroying some opponents right 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.310
 so it's complicated a dilemma is because 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.400
 Do you want to stay in first if you want? 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.900
 staying at first is great but 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.370
 You're not going to have to keep knocking. 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.950
 will have how to be gaining time a 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.110
 time you will end up being destroyed 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.819
 because your time is running out 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.650
 Look, I just got destroyed here and 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.780
 When you're destroyed because your 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.360
 time you healed you back to the race 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.189
 usually as a normal corridor without 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.510
 to be with this infinite book when 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.400
 You're infected here, can you? 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.400
 that the screen is also located 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.890
 damn I'm playing bad that we 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.629
 there they will pick up a neighbor's shortcut 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.569
 exploit is infected here and use the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.000
 nitro full time 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.930
 the graphics of the game I said so 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.150
 impressive is the best graphic that 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.700
 I've seen it here in my number 221 game 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.379
 lisinho wheel wheel well in high 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.389
 all handsets with windows phone 8 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.670
 time wheel number 520 also that the most 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.920
 and also has 512 mb of ram 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.129
 Quiet wheel I've seen people playing in the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.139
 number 520 the game wheel smooth yet very 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.689
 well not far from the end of the 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.579
 I rush that I already do a facelift here 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.900
 to see when the beautiful drift passes 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.599
 for d 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.920
 if activated or patio unit and care 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.290
 not to beat that we are on the final stretch 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.879
 of this race and I even memorized all 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.859
 the clues of the game from so much I played 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.329
 he was not playing on windows 8 to 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.859
 who does not know why nor 28 the game 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.560
 was playing for me to take frostbite 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.909
 the screen then to avoid problems there I 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.010
 I'm throwing it at them. 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:35.389
 fix this problem and on windows 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.040
 8 has run there nice house 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.870
 the video is not well liked 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.060
 media that does not delay the channel subscribes 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.409
 if you want something that shows that 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.970
 our team has any tips for 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.739
 videos and asphalt do not forget to leave us 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.590
 video comments also via twitter 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.940

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.769
 guys will stop here a hug 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.769
