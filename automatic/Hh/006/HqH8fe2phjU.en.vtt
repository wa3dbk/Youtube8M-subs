fantastic<00:01:54.899> color<00:01:55.200> colors<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:56.909> got<00:01:56.939> an

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
fantastic color colors we have got an

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.660 
fantastic color colors we have got an
opening<00:01:57.630> at<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.780> bottom<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
opening at the bottom and this is the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.310 
opening at the bottom and this is the
opening<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.299> translates<00:02:00.840> into<00:02:01.049> being

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
opening that translates into being

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.920 
opening that translates into being
shorter<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:01.950> longer<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:03.119> when<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.630> are<00:02:03.659> looking

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
shorter or longer so when we are looking

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.709 
shorter or longer so when we are looking
to<00:02:04.289> go<00:02:04.439> from<00:02:04.710> infant<00:02:05.159> which<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.700> size<00:02:06.000> you

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
to go from infant which is this size you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.109 
to go from infant which is this size you
extract<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.770> by<00:02:08.100> unzipping<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.880> piece

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
extract this by unzipping this piece

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.680 
extract this by unzipping this piece
right<00:02:09.479> here<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:11.670> then<00:02:11.880> take<00:02:12.150> your<00:02:12.390> extra

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
right here you then take your extra

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.940 
right here you then take your extra
piece<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.530> piece<00:02:13.590> goes<00:02:14.490> onto<00:02:16.070> here

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
piece and this piece goes onto here

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.770 
piece and this piece goes onto here
and<00:02:18.069> then<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.910> piece<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.330> had<00:02:19.540> removed

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
and then the piece that you had removed

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.270 
and then the piece that you had removed
initially<00:02:20.290> goes<00:02:20.500> on<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.890> bottom<00:02:21.160> so

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
initially goes on to the bottom so

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.380 
initially goes on to the bottom so
you're<00:02:21.370> just<00:02:21.489> extending<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.180> you're<00:02:22.300> gonna

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
you're just extending it you're gonna

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.420 
you're just extending it you're gonna
end<00:02:22.629> up<00:02:22.720> with<00:02:22.900> something<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.260> lot<00:02:23.410> longer<00:02:23.650> it

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
end up with something a lot longer it

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.979 
end up with something a lot longer it
opens<00:02:24.790> at<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:24.940> bottom<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.569> you're<00:02:25.840> able

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
opens at the bottom so that you're able

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.479 
opens at the bottom so that you're able
to<00:02:26.140> have<00:02:26.349> your<00:02:26.530> child's<00:02:26.920> feet<00:02:27.190> when<00:02:27.340> they're<00:02:27.459> a

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
to have your child's feet when they're a

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.339 
to have your child's feet when they're a
lot<00:02:27.700> older<00:02:27.879> sticking<00:02:28.540> out<00:02:28.660> at<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.840> bottom

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
lot older sticking out at the bottom

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.740 
lot older sticking out at the bottom
naturally<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.400> costs<00:02:30.790> more<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.030> your<00:02:31.480> cost

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
naturally it costs more so your cost

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.720 
naturally it costs more so your cost
here<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.080> going<00:02:32.379> to<00:02:32.470> be<00:02:32.560> twice<00:02:32.800> as<00:02:32.860> much<00:02:33.190> but

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
here is going to be twice as much but

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.250 
here is going to be twice as much but
you're<00:02:33.849> getting<00:02:34.150> twice<00:02:34.390> as<00:02:34.450> much<00:02:34.750> use<00:02:34.959> out<00:02:35.230> of

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
you're getting twice as much use out of

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.410 
you're getting twice as much use out of
it<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.769> money<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.130> well<00:02:36.489> invested<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:37.239> this

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
it so the money is well invested so this

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.870 
it so the money is well invested so this
is<00:02:37.540> 7:00<00:02:37.870> a.m.<00:02:38.019> on<00:02:38.349> fall<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.800> they<00:02:39.610> are

is 7:00 a.m. on fall and they are

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.630 
is 7:00 a.m. on fall and they are
probably<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.510> original<00:02:41.040> owner<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:42.310> kind

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
probably the original owner of this kind

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.339 
probably the original owner of this kind
