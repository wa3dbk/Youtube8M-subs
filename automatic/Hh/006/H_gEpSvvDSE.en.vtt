00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.300
 encouragement to the constructor tutorial and 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.150
 tutorial tutorials 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.940
 hello youtube friends today I bring you 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.110
 the tuneup 2014 news for 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.330
 windows 8.1 rtm since tuneup 2013 is not 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.740
 compatible with windows 8.1 rtm we started 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.450
 I do not install it because I already have 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.840
 installed but the installation is very 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.310
 easy as all there is only what to do 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.460
 the boxes that ask and give 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.870
 next next and finalize them 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.579
 I will leave the official page in the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.320
 description of the video so they can 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.269
 download the trial version with the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.640
 which will have 15 free days for 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.190
 try it to see if they like it before 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.260
 buy it and good here on the page 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.070
 official you can see all the improvements and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.070
 news that brings 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.280
 good as you see in this version have 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.080
 changed the interface completely by 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.890
 everything else remains the same apart from the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.620
 full integration with windows 8.1 rtm and 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.630
 with a couple of novelties this is one of 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.490
 the most important novelties for 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.180
 Turn off wifi in a single click and 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.180
 save battery 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.820
 these options are the same as before 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.820
 but with different design 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.820
 and here we have another one of the most 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.979
 highlighted to delete the files 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.310
 that are the same although they have different 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.310
 first name 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.650
 otherwise everything remains the same as 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.220
 can see the maintenance with a click 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.220
 still the same 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.310
 I recommend that in configuration 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.260
 maintenance with one click read these 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.120
 options and palome in all that create 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.830
 that you need to somatize so that 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.629
 clean the maintenance with a kit 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.580
 since almost all by default come 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.830
 deactivated and activating will clean them 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.720
 team much more thoroughly 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.640
 I just left the boxes off 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.769
 of web passwords so you do not have to 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.019
 rewrite them when you start 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.879
 session in my accounts and the last 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.500
 download location so you do not have to 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.260
 redirect them to the folder 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.620
 I want to hope you like it and 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.510
 Enjoy it and this was all I hope 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.440
