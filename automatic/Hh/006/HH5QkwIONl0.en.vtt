00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.390
 Gregorian calendar 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.300
 the movement of the earth in relation to the moon is another of those operations 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.329
 that system that is normally used to count the chronological time 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.359
 the way of thinking that I do not know for how long the Gregorian calendar 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.519
 is based on wars egolatrías controls 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.449
 the word calendar comes from the word warming 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.449
 from Latin meaning book of accounts 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.819
 established the date of the first day of each month 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.679
 in the fourth they had to pay the taxes and say where is the 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.480
 famous saying time is money 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.620
 the names of the months of our calendar are derived from the activity 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.250
 of the first calendar 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.940
 this serbian calendar 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.270
 for planning and training your armies 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.260
 the beginning of the year used to be celebrated in March 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.610
 but in the year 133 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.610
 sheen decided to delay the year two months 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.310
 why September in Latin 7 for us is the ninth month October 8 the 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.660
 appalling 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.920
 November which means the passing death announced in December 10 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.170
 now gesture be 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.870
 on the bridge July 5 Cesar led the year twelve months 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.200
 pando la damita 30 travelers 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.400
 the other thirty-one days 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.670
 - to the month of February that stayed with 29 days 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.820
 to the fifth month 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.180
 then called quintillas 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.970
 he put his name July 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.790
 later his son Augustius Caesar 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.110
 decides to put August before this deserves 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.670
 section already 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.890
 but not to be less than his father 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.890
 and so that his time also had thirty-one days 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.900
 he removed 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.920
 one more day to ferrer 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.479
 in the Christian calendar Roman time 12 irregular months 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.469
 it was a right 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.270
 and it was known as the Julian calendar 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.970
 where natural cycles were not taken into account 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.500
 like the equinoxes and solstices 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.200
 in 1582 the Gregorian Pope 13 Aug 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.800
 advanced and the day of the calendar date 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.450
 and so the calendar went 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.079
 of juliana gregoriana 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.769
 these are just some changes 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.139
 that have been made to the calendar that we follow 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.579
 it is in this disorder season in which we live since then 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.680
 ensuring that not only the European man but currently all the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.760
 cultures and races dominated by thought and convictions 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.729
 western 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.729
 or they raised this time pattern very importantly 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.349
 bush is a manipulator shepherd 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.649
 for a nonsense that supposedly honored us 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.590
 so that in many ways the story is a script written by 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.699
 those who hold power 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.509
 but not only Gregorian calendar and other irregular calendars 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:47.919
 disconnects us from mother nature 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.169
 also mechanical clocks take us away from synchrony 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.539
 the clock is a three-dimensional measure of space 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.579
 apply the idea of ​​time 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.650
 while the Gregorian calendar of 12 months does not correspond to any cycle 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.849
 natural 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.540
 the clock is an invention that started as a simple toy 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.989
 and later it was used by some mountains for fun 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.539
 later to wake up early 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.299
 with time ottoman sepes 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.739
 and that a toy passed second machine that ran lives 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:18.750
 indeed 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.690
 the mechanical watch was accepted by all Europeans as an example of 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.870
 human triumph 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.719
 about nature 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:26.790
 thus, was that 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.209
 the human mind accepted as natural 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.239
 his own time infected the frequency that we identify as joseph 60 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.980
 an unconscious mental proportion determined by the lack of 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.619
 the regular calendar of 12 months 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.209
 and 60 minute participation 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.089
 the combination of these two factors the 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:49.100
 this single frequency of time has resorted to 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.169
 historical man a debilitating and hopeless mental chaos 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.809
 known as civilization 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.769
 that only a final convulsion of the disorder of time that rules the race 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:01.559
 human 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:03.999
 with a virulent mental illness 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:07.459
 when you get carried away according to the Gregorian calendar 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.189
 and the mechanical clock 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.149
 without wondering why you use it 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.609
 to be carried away by a program 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.149
 unconscious 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:19.389
 the purpose of Rome by imposing on the people who had conquered the 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.870
 calendar 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.039
 not by taking power from the people and the roman jungle 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.759
 they gave it to those who used the moon as kia 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.100
 people who were like with nature to take away the Caesar power 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.349
 it took a step for a while to keep them away from contact with the 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.129
 nature that will force them to see Rome as a source of power 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.100
 the judges and the principles of 1900 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.840
 the twelve-month calendar was accepted 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.479
 with a world standard 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.999
 so actually two thousand years later 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:50.939
 Rome has conquered the world 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.249
 and nobody had ever asked about 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.210
 this attitude that said calendar 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.040
 of vido ap that we are not governed by natural cycles of the universe 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.939
 we have not learned to know the time 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:06.499
 although we generally do not think about it 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.620
 we usually treat on time as if it belonged to the third dimension 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.639
 But this is not so 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.199
 the first dimension of being 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:13.990
 point 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.780
 the second on the line the third is the plane of the office 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.439
 the fourth dimension this time but like humanity 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.430
 a rite that time belongs to another dimension 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.510
 And that only 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.220
 we have to live according to him decided to measure it as if it were a 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.430
 space gave me the third dimension 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.910
 they took two circles measured in 12 pieces 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.419
 as if it were a cake 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.800
 and each of these 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.159
 bossi 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:46.779
 they lived it in 60 pires bits and we have a clock or 10 12 hours and 60 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:47.879
 minutes 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:51.939
 this reversal of the historical human mind in the frequency of its 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:53.699
 own artificial time 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.539
 more than any foal factor has condemned us to a world 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.150
 of inescapable horrors 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.349
 in Greek mythology one of the daughters of Atlas 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.809
 ipl what they called maya 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:08.099
 in Mayan India means world of illusion
