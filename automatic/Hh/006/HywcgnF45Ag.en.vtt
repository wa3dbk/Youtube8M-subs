00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:07.140
 for this Christmas is at the end of 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.210
 dinner with a break of almonds you want 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.240
 learn how to do it in the village 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.130
 we say as for an approximate liter of 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.259
 break we need 280 grams of sugar 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.320
 120 grams of cane liquor 100 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:25.259
 grams of almonds a liter of milk 6 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.909
 eggs a pinch of baking soda 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:32.640
 two cloves nutmeg and cinnamon stick 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:34.410
 in a pot we put the milk and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.100
 we add a quarter of the cinnamon stick 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.100
 the cloves the sugar and the baking 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.249
 we heat up so that inclusions and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.159
 let reduce at low heat for about 10 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:56.390
 minutes and turn off the heat and let 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.390
 cool the mixture a little 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.520
 meanwhile we pricked the almonds and 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.470
 we put them to toast in a saucepan do not leave 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.320
 to move so that they are evenly browned 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.750
 and do not burn when they have the color 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.750
 Golden separates and reserve 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.650
 On the other hand, we separate the yolks from the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.260
 clear and we will beat them to be and 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.270
 bones if you prefer or you're going to do 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.960
 much quantity uses a blender and you 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.960
 it will make faster 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:42.979
 Once the milk is warm, we remove the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.979
 cinnamon and cloves 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.210
 now let's temper the buds this 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.310
 step is very delicate we should incorporate 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.350
 the milk little by little while still moving 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.350
 to avoid cooking the yolks 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.000
 weather 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.000
 doubt 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.420
 when you have half the milk 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.670
 incorporated into the pot and 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.420
 We carry on low heat while still moving 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.550
 in addition 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.400
 We know that it is ready when it starts 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.890
 to thicken and you want to make sure you use 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.150
 a thermometer and when you dial 85 degrees 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.800
 remove from the fire and add the brandy 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.620
 mix very well because this will help us 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.080
 to lower the temperature later you can 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.950
 add the nutmeg subtly and the 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.459
 toasted almonds 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.459
 same 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.880
 I dont know 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.010
 so 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:07.650
 i 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:09.660
 and it cools and stores in a bottle of 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.150
 pre-sterilized glass for 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.400
 keep for longer if you're going to 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.940
 immediately consume this step is not 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.940
 necessary 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.810
 Merry Christmas enjoy these dates

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.450
