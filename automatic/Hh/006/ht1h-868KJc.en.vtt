00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
off eBay probably ten years ago maybe

off eBay probably ten years ago maybe
around<00:00:22.949> 2002<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.350> I<00:00:25.580> have<00:00:26.580> my<00:00:26.699> suspicions<00:00:27.300> on

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
around 2002 and I have my suspicions on

around 2002 and I have my suspicions on
it<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.050> PSA<00:00:28.439> started<00:00:28.890> grading

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.150 
packs
I<00:00:29.699> eventually<00:00:30.359> broke<00:00:31.349> down<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.679> decided<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
I eventually broke down and decided to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.299 
I eventually broke down and decided to
submit<00:00:32.520> my<00:00:32.669> packs<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.899> holder<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.440> not

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
surprisingly this was the one pack that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.580 
surprisingly this was the one pack that
they<00:00:37.050> rejected<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:38.790> kind<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.410> if<00:00:40.410> it'll

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
they rejected you kind of see if it'll

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.930 
they rejected you kind of see if it'll
show<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:40.890> well<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:41.460> there's<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:41.760> really

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
show up well in here there's not really

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.030 
show up well in here there's not really
well-defined<00:00:42.809> fold<00:00:43.320> lines<00:00:43.590> around<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
well-defined fold lines around the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.200 
well-defined fold lines around the
corners<00:00:44.430> that's<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> things<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
corners that's one of the things you

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
corners that's one of the things you
want<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> look<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:46.039> image<00:00:47.039> wax<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:49.430> that's

want to look for on image wax and that's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.790 
want to look for on image wax and that's
a<00:00:50.579> sign<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.690> pack<00:00:52.590> was<00:00:53.780> resealed

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
a sign that the pack was resealed

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.849 
a sign that the pack was resealed
rewrapped<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.039> resealed<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:58.739> other

rewrapped and resealed and the other

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.590 
rewrapped and resealed and the other
thing<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.640> kind<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> telltale<00:01:00.539> sign

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
thing that's a kind of a telltale sign

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.529 
thing that's a kind of a telltale sign
the<00:01:01.020> gums<00:01:01.230> broken<00:01:01.940> sometimes<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.359> get

the gums broken sometimes you can get

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.679

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
moving around over the years but often

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.219 
moving around over the years but often
times<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.280> packs<00:01:11.490> been<00:01:11.700> resealed<00:01:12.229> then

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
times if it packs been resealed then

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.830 
times if it packs been resealed then
they'll<00:01:14.100> use<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.390> person<00:01:15.689> who's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
they'll use the the person who's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.510 
they'll use the the person who's
reselling<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> pack<00:01:16.560> will<00:01:16.770> use<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> more

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
reselling the pack will use a more

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.770 
reselling the pack will use a more
modern<00:01:17.549> piece<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.180> gum<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.570> obviously

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
modern piece of gum because obviously

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.490 
modern piece of gum because obviously
there's<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> lot<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.790> 1965<00:01:21.500> individual

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
there's not a lot of 1965 individual

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.289 
there's not a lot of 1965 individual
pieces<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.950> bubble<00:01:23.070> gum<00:01:23.280> from<00:01:23.850> these<00:01:24.030> packs

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
pieces of bubble gum from these packs

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.520 
pieces of bubble gum from these packs
laying<00:01:24.600> around<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:25.049> they<00:01:25.140> could<00:01:25.320> use<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
laying around that they could use to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.840 
laying around that they could use to
reseal<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:27.180> way<00:01:27.299> they<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.850> get

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
reseal it so one way they they do get

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.460 
reseal it so one way they they do get
around<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.509> through<00:01:30.810> breaking<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
around that is through breaking up the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.749 
around that is through breaking up the
gum<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> can't<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.189> tell<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.490> it's

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
gum so you can't really tell that it's

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.100 
gum so you can't really tell that it's
under<00:01:33.030> sized<00:01:33.299> compared<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> original<00:01:34.470> gum

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
under sized compared to the original gum

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.520 
under sized compared to the original gum

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
resealed wax is that there's not a lot

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.449 
resealed wax is that there's not a lot
of<00:02:19.640> wrinkles<00:02:19.910> in<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.390> flat<00:02:20.810> surfaces<00:02:21.459> like

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
of wrinkles in the flat surfaces like

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.490 
of wrinkles in the flat surfaces like
the<00:02:22.610> front<00:02:22.819> surface<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.480> lot<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.870> times<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.319> dead

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
the front surface a lot of times a dead

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.770 
the front surface a lot of times a dead
giveaway<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:25.129> a<00:02:25.730> pact<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.360> will<00:02:26.629> have

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
giveaway is a pact that will have

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.539 
giveaway is a pact that will have
wrinkles<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.379> it<00:02:27.410> where<00:02:28.129> it<00:02:28.190> shouldn't<00:02:28.459> be

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
wrinkles on it where it shouldn't be

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.210 
wrinkles on it where it shouldn't be
because<00:02:28.700> obviously<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.330> cards<00:02:29.660> don't<00:02:30.379> fold

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
because obviously the cards don't fold

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.640 
because obviously the cards don't fold
so<00:02:32.030> there's<00:02:32.450> no<00:02:32.569> way<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.019> to<00:02:33.170> get<00:02:33.260> wrinkled

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
so there's no way for it to get wrinkled

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.160 
so there's no way for it to get wrinkled
if<00:02:33.980> it's<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.280> legitimate<00:02:34.610> pact

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.870 

okay<00:02:42.170> well<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.590> comments<00:02:43.010> look<00:02:43.250> like<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.519> nice

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
okay well the comments look like a nice

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.300 
okay well the comments look like a nice
shape<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:45.380> maybe<00:02:45.560> I'll<00:02:45.709> get<00:02:45.799> something<00:02:46.040> that's

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
shape so maybe I'll get something that's

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.559 
shape so maybe I'll get something that's
gradable<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.819> here<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.720> Don<00:02:47.989> Demeter<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
gradable in here the Don Demeter is the

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.240 
gradable in here the Don Demeter is the
bottom<00:02:50.569> card<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.140> there's<00:02:51.500> no<00:02:51.680> wax<00:02:51.890> stain

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
bottom card and there's no wax stain

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.240 
bottom card and there's no wax stain
again<00:02:52.579> that's<00:02:52.760> another<00:02:53.030> telltale<00:02:53.510> sign<00:02:54.250> if

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
again that's another telltale sign if

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.140 
again that's another telltale sign if
this<00:02:55.880> was<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> factory<00:02:57.049> sealed<00:02:57.319> wax<00:02:58.160> pact<00:02:58.459> you

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
this was a factory sealed wax pact you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.170 
this was a factory sealed wax pact you
would<00:02:59.299> expect<00:02:59.629> to<00:02:59.690> see<00:03:00.220> residue<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.400> wax<00:03:01.940> on

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
would expect to see residue of wax on

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.610 
would expect to see residue of wax on
the<00:03:02.299> back<00:03:02.450> card<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.959> this<00:03:03.079> one<00:03:03.230> isn't<00:03:03.410> which

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
the back card and this one isn't which

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.770 
the back card and this one isn't which
is<00:03:03.769> good<00:03:03.950> for<00:03:04.100> me<00:03:04.220> because<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.790> means<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.480> could

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
is good for me because it means it could

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.830 
is good for me because it means it could
be<00:03:05.810> submitted<00:03:06.139> and<00:03:07.389> it's<00:03:08.389> a<00:03:08.420> little<00:03:08.720> bit

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
be submitted and it's a little bit

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.110 
be submitted and it's a little bit
off-centered<00:03:09.019> but<00:03:09.680> very<00:03:09.950> sharp<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.519> think<00:03:10.970> this

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
off-centered but very sharp I think this

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.809 
off-centered but very sharp I think this
could<00:03:11.750> a<00:03:11.959> t'<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.560> it's<00:03:13.310> more<00:03:13.459> than<00:03:13.639> I<00:03:13.670> was

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
could a t' so it's more than I was

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.080 
could a t' so it's more than I was
expecting<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:16.600> I'll<00:03:17.600> take<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:18.850> under<00:03:19.850> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
expecting so I'll take that under the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.530 
expecting so I'll take that under the
circumstances<00:03:21.340> next<00:03:22.340> one<00:03:22.489> is<00:03:22.639> Jean<00:03:22.880> Stevens

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.270 

and<00:03:26.540> again<00:03:26.840> nice<00:03:27.319> corners<00:03:27.859> at<00:03:28.010> least<00:03:28.160> they

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
and again nice corners at least they

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.080 
and again nice corners at least they
didn't<00:03:28.430> put<00:03:28.579> VG<00:03:28.910> Commons<00:03:29.329> in<00:03:29.480> here<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:31.130> again

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
didn't put VG Commons in here and again

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.580 
didn't put VG Commons in here and again
it's<00:03:32.269> pretty<00:03:32.450> nicely<00:03:32.720> centered<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.290> little<00:03:33.319> bit

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
it's pretty nicely centered a little bit

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.470 
it's pretty nicely centered a little bit
off<00:03:33.709> top<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.130> bottom<00:03:34.250> but<00:03:34.519> another<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.150> think<00:03:35.180> a

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
off top to bottom but another I think a

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.900 
off top to bottom but another I think a
submit<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:35.840> bull<00:03:36.019> card<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.500> have<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.609> look<00:03:37.760> up

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
submit a bull card I have to look up

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.809 
submit a bull card I have to look up
what<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.650> vintage<00:03:39.650> card<00:03:39.889> prices<00:03:40.310> values<00:03:40.670> are

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
what the vintage card prices values are

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.539 
what the vintage card prices values are
for<00:03:40.970> these<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.299> see<00:03:41.450> if<00:03:41.480> there's<00:03:41.780> enough<00:03:42.079> of<00:03:42.799> a

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
for these to see if there's enough of a

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.270 
for these to see if there's enough of a
market<00:03:44.060> price<00:03:44.239> for<00:03:44.299> an<00:03:44.660> 8<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:45.500> justify<00:03:46.220> the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
market price for an 8 to justify the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.610 
market price for an 8 to justify the
grading<00:03:46.730> fees<00:03:46.970> but<00:03:47.450> might<00:03:48.169> need<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:48.410> for<00:03:48.500> my

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
grading fees but might need it for my

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.740 
grading fees but might need it for my
set<00:03:48.829> also<00:03:49.190> so<00:03:49.400> those<00:03:49.880> may<00:03:50.060> be<00:03:50.120> going<00:03:50.359> in<00:03:50.599> for

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
set also so those may be going in for

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.849 
set also so those may be going in for
grading<00:03:51.639> and<00:03:52.639> next<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:54.459> 1965<00:03:55.459> Ricky<00:03:55.819> stars

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
grading and next is a 1965 Ricky stars

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.650 
grading and next is a 1965 Ricky stars
no<00:03:57.859> superstars<00:03:58.669> of<00:03:58.849> course<00:03:59.090> this<00:03:59.359> one's<00:03:59.540> a

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
no superstars of course this one's a

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.030 
no superstars of course this one's a
little<00:03:59.870> bit<00:03:59.989> off-centered<00:04:00.109> so<00:04:00.590> not<00:04:00.769> really

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
little bit off-centered so not really

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.190 
little bit off-centered so not really
worth<00:04:01.430> grading<00:04:01.880> but<00:04:02.419> again<00:04:02.599> really<00:04:02.720> nice<00:04:02.959> you

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
worth grading but again really nice you

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.629 
worth grading but again really nice you
know<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.440> corners<00:04:03.739> are<00:04:03.859> sharp<00:04:04.099> so<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:06.709> much

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
know the corners are sharp so so much

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.430 
know the corners are sharp so so much
more<00:04:07.940> than<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.239> expected<00:04:08.359> from<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:09.049> resealed

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
more than I expected from a resealed

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.270 
more than I expected from a resealed
pack

never quite made it in the big leagues

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.340 
never quite made it in the big leagues
and<00:04:52.169> again<00:04:53.169> a<00:04:53.200> little<00:04:53.290> bit<00:04:53.470> off-centered<00:04:55.350> and

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
and again a little bit off-centered and

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.440 
and again a little bit off-centered and
that's<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.830> last<00:04:57.010> card<00:04:57.340> now<00:04:57.580> if<00:04:58.090> you<00:04:58.180> look<00:04:58.330> at

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
that's the last card now if you look at

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.180 
that's the last card now if you look at
the<00:04:58.540> gum<00:04:58.750> we'll<00:04:59.290> see<00:04:59.470> if<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.710> makes<00:04:59.740> a<00:05:00.010> full

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
the gum we'll see if it makes a full

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.100 
the gum we'll see if it makes a full
piece<00:05:00.430> I<00:05:00.580> guess<00:05:00.730> it<00:05:00.880> does<00:05:02.880> but<00:05:03.880> gum<00:05:04.780> in<00:05:04.930> that

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
piece I guess it does but gum in that

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.650 
piece I guess it does but gum in that
here<00:05:05.620> I've<00:05:05.860> never<00:05:06.070> opened<00:05:06.220> 265<00:05:06.940> pack<00:05:07.210> but<00:05:07.480> this

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
here I've never opened 265 pack but this

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.510 
here I've never opened 265 pack but this
definitely<00:05:08.200> looks<00:05:08.260> undersized<00:05:08.860> probably

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
definitely looks undersized probably

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.040
