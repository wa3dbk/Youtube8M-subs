on multiple playthroughs it did feel

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.330 
on multiple playthroughs it did feel
excessive<00:01:29.110> at<00:01:29.230> times<00:01:29.470> you<00:01:29.980> could<00:01:30.160> skip

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
excessive at times you could skip

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.980 
excessive at times you could skip
through<00:01:30.550> them<00:01:30.700> fairly<00:01:30.880> easily<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:31.720> it's<00:01:31.870> not

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
through them fairly easily so it's not

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.660 
through them fairly easily so it's not
really<00:01:32.410> that<00:01:32.440> big<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:32.770> deal<00:01:33.100> now<00:01:33.520> these

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
really that big a deal now these

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110

and a half hours now when you're on easy
mode<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.690> game<00:02:54.870> was<00:02:55.050> simple<00:02:55.380> enough<00:02:55.620> for<00:02:55.650> a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
mode this game was simple enough for a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.040 
mode this game was simple enough for a
young<00:02:56.130> child<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.790> would<00:02:56.970> say<00:02:57.120> around<00:02:57.450> 6<00:02:57.840> could

young child I would say around 6 could

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.420 
young child I would say around 6 could
probably<00:02:58.260> get<00:02:58.620> through<00:02:58.830> this<00:02:58.950> game<00:02:59.190> without

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
probably get through this game without

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.979 
probably get through this game without
too<00:02:59.640> much<00:02:59.760> trouble<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.360> could<00:03:00.600> see<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.780> lot<00:03:00.930> of

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
too much trouble I could see a lot of

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.449 
too much trouble I could see a lot of
frustration<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.770> last<00:03:02.010> part<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.400> game

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
frustration in the last part of the game

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.610 
frustration in the last part of the game
but<00:03:03.090> overall<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.780> should<00:03:03.989> be<00:03:04.080> easy<00:03:04.290> enough<00:03:04.560> for

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
but overall it should be easy enough for

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.040 
but overall it should be easy enough for
them<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.610> levels<00:03:05.940> themselves<00:03:06.090> were<00:03:06.570> very<00:03:06.600> fun

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
them the levels themselves were very fun

with<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.360> price<00:03:57.600> as<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.110> do<00:03:58.170> feel<00:03:58.470> $15<00:03:59.280> is<00:03:59.430> a

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
with the price as I do feel $15 is a

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.069 
with the price as I do feel $15 is a
little<00:03:59.760> bit<00:03:59.880> steep<00:04:00.090> for<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.420> game<00:04:00.660> when<00:04:00.989> it

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
little bit steep for this game when it

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.660 
little bit steep for this game when it
has<00:04:01.230> about<00:04:01.470> three<00:04:01.799> hours<00:04:02.190> worth<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.489> content

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
has about three hours worth of content

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.490
