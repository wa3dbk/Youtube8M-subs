00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
cleveland browns obviously my last video

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.129 
cleveland browns obviously my last video
when<00:00:08.910> i<00:00:08.940> broke<00:00:09.150> him<00:00:09.300> down<00:00:09.450> i<00:00:09.510> have<00:00:09.780> enrages

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
when i broke him down i have enrages

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.470 
when i broke him down i have enrages
like<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> 5th<00:00:10.620> 6th<00:00:10.920> rounder<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.550> he<00:00:12.179> went<00:00:12.360> much

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
like a 5th 6th rounder and he went much

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.610 
like a 5th 6th rounder and he went much
higher<00:00:12.690> than<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:12.990> i<00:00:13.049> think<00:00:13.170> it's<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.500> little

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
higher than that i think it's a little

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.129 
higher than that i think it's a little
bit<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.009> reach<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> hypest<00:00:15.809> type

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
bit of a reach but that the hypest type

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.620 
bit of a reach but that the hypest type
train<00:00:16.529> was<00:00:16.710> moving<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.369> guy<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.940> it

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
train was moving with this guy and it

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.179 
train was moving with this guy and it
seems<00:00:18.810> like<00:00:18.869> lean<00:00:19.140> bought<00:00:19.320> into<00:00:19.470> after<00:00:19.920> seeing

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
seems like lean bought into after seeing

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.160 
seems like lean bought into after seeing
him<00:00:20.490> he<00:00:20.699> visited<00:00:21.090> them<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.449> two<00:00:21.600> days<00:00:21.840> and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
him he visited them for two days and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560 
him he visited them for two days and
they<00:00:22.740> got<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> good<00:00:23.189> feel<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.699> him<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> good<00:00:24.180> feel

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
they got a good feel for him a good feel

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.630 
they got a good feel for him a good feel
for<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> upside<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.289> he<00:00:25.560> has<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.400> think

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
for the upside that he has and I think

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.880 
for the upside that he has and I think
that's<00:00:26.820> why<00:00:27.029> he<00:00:27.180> went<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.689> high<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.410> tough<00:00:28.710> to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that's why he went so high it's tough to

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.519 
that's why he went so high it's tough to
find<00:00:29.099> players<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.760> are<00:00:29.910> 64<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.230> over

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
find players that are 64 that are over

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.910 
find players that are 64 that are over
200<00:00:32.040> pounds<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:33.030> run<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> 45<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.500> field

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
200 pounds that do run a 45 on the field

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.740 
200 pounds that do run a 45 on the field
and<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.489> Cleveland<00:00:35.940> was<00:00:36.180> thin<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:36.600> wide

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and that Cleveland was thin at wide

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.600 
and that Cleveland was thin at wide
receiver<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.559> why<00:00:37.770> they<00:00:37.980> made<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.250> move

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
receiver this is why they made the move

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.850 
receiver this is why they made the move
and<00:00:38.930> that's<00:00:39.930> exactly<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.620> they're<00:00:40.739> hoping

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and that's exactly what they're hoping

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.350 
and that's exactly what they're hoping
for<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.280> he's<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> starting

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
for that he's going to be a starting

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.299 
for that he's going to be a starting
wide<00:00:42.570> out<00:00:42.870> earlier<00:00:43.350> rather<00:00:43.620> than<00:00:43.770> later<00:00:43.860> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
wide out earlier rather than later and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.160 
wide out earlier rather than later and
to<00:00:45.090> me<00:00:45.239> i<00:00:45.270> wouldn'ta<00:00:45.690> made<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> move

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
to me i wouldn'ta made the move

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.950 
to me i wouldn'ta made the move

little<00:00:55.320> fan<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.890> still<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:56.670> Trent

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059

Richardson's<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.199> offense

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
Richardson's going to be that offense

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.139 
Richardson's going to be that offense
and<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.949> think<00:00:59.160> Cleveland<00:00:59.489> still<00:00:59.760> going<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and I think Cleveland still going to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.599 
and I think Cleveland still going to
struggle<00:01:00.480> offensively<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.620> season<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.219> if

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
struggle offensively this season and if

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.429 
struggle offensively this season and if
that's<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> case<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.539> think<00:01:03.840> they're<00:01:04.229> going<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
that's the case I think they're going to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.960 
that's the case I think they're going to
miss<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.739> second<00:01:05.100> round<00:01:05.250> pick<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.610> mean<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:05.820> it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
miss this second round pick I mean if it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.359 
miss this second round pick I mean if it
ends<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> top<00:01:06.810> 50<00:01:07.229> pick<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.680> next<00:01:08.189> year's

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
ends up as a top 50 pick and next year's

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.370 
ends up as a top 50 pick and next year's
draft<00:01:08.640> i<00:01:08.939> think<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.360> browns<00:01:09.600> fans<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.140> going

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
draft i think the browns fans are going

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.230 
draft i think the browns fans are going
to<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.650> pretty<00:01:10.920> disappointed<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
to be pretty disappointed with the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.760 
to be pretty disappointed with the
players<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.630> they're<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.380> miss<00:01:13.560> out

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
players that they're going to miss out

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.050 
players that they're going to miss out
on<00:01:14.010> there's<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> some<00:01:14.430> great<00:01:14.790> players

up<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.950> great<00:01:17.159> player<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.970> development

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
up a great player but the development

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.510 
up a great player but the development
meet<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.869> needed<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.710> other<00:01:20.009> thing<00:01:20.189> i<00:01:20.340> want<00:01:20.490> to

add is I think the front office of the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
add is I think the front office of the
Cleveland<00:01:23.100> Browns<00:01:23.189> may<00:01:23.549> made<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.909> move<00:01:24.119> on

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
Cleveland Browns may made this move on

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.480 
Cleveland Browns may made this move on
purpose<00:01:24.780> because<00:01:24.960> they're<00:01:25.830> coming<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
purpose because they're coming to the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.830 
purpose because they're coming to the
