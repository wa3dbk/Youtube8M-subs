00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.430
 does not exist is our third part now 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.170
 let's line our second row and 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.050
 we have armed the white face 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.840
 we have aligned with these centers now 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.630
 we are going to insert these edges of these 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.880
 it's a very easy step there are only three cases 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.189
 possible out there are other 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.529
 variants of this and then teach the 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.659
 three cases we already know or the same piece 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.390
 as a reference I will place my piece 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:30.200
 orange with blue first I'll look 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.110
 the color where it corresponds in this case 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.500
 here is the line of our orange 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.110
 now I'm going to see which side would go blue in 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.510
 this then can not be is now what 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.430
 I'm going to place in this place you take the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.650
 first is to move it to the side 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.100
 opposite where I'm going to insert I'm going to 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.450
 up is that side now back I go back to 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.600
 line and bass 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.540
 the author here I have armed my slot of two 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.390
 pieces and without undoing this for what 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.810
 is the insert as I do I'm going to move 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.140
 towards my side t-mobile subo to align 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.350
 and this jonas and placed it I have placed 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.040
 these three pieces the time to download 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.770
 it remains in its place the following case is 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.420
 same but now they are not ripped 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.690
 it was up then we are going to look 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.759
 our blue color now does not have to go 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.770
 on this side how is the color blue now 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.990
 will have to go this side instead of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.940
 this what we are going to do is the same 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.520
 with a mirror movement now what 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.420
 we will do the other way around I will remove that my 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.290
 opposite side which I will upload now 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.369
 I return my piece and I return the alcohol and 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.619
 My lot is armed 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.909
 now I'm going to move this slot towards the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.240
 right side that is the one that moby 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.549
 I go up to align our mode and low and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.429
 the piece has now been aligned 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.350
 this side and our third case is 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.659
 finds in his piece in none of the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.270
 two forms that is orange blue 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.909
 above means that it is inserted 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.770
 already but it must be wrong, because if 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.099
 they do not find him in his place he is 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.019
 reverse 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.149
 in this case here is my piece as 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.549
 we see should go here what we are going to do 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.140
 in this case I'm going to take my coboo like this and 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.450
 what he has to do is twice the same 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.220
 movement that I did previously one 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.099
 to place the piece you have to 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.170
 up here and get this and then 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.840
 and do in the step that I have left 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.579
 I recommend you always put a piece 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.590
 yellow since these are the pieces that 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.660
 at the moment they are not going to serve us I'm going to 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.290
 make the movement in which uncertain 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.290
 it's here 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.040
 already insert it and logically the sleeper 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.560
 had to have left artist and we 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.280
 will be in either of the two cases 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.550
 previous 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.680
 we simply insert 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.680
 and here is these are our three 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.720
 possible cases to align our 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.310
 second row all the others are 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.000
 variants of these and see you in the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.000
 next video
