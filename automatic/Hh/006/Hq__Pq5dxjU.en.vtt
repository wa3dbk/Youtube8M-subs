00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.359
 initially used by the military 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.059
 today the drones are the new fever 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.280
 admirers of technology and used as 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.059
 work tool for various 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.280
 people 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.460
 but what few people know that using 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.789
 of them is not yet regulated and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.080
 requires individual authorization 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.480
 granted by the national 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.640
 civil aviation from the top can give 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.070
 a privileged view 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.160
 the device that weighs one pound wins 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.950
 height and speed can travel 10 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.600
 miles alone to lose sight of 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.420
 all controlled from one 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.340
 smartphone a console like this that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.100
 I remember electronic games 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.829
 differently from model drones 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.140
 or unmanned aircraft are more 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.980
 can carry a variety of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.920
 gps sensors and cameras that work with 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.370
 a simple battery you go with it 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.129
 model is accurate course needs a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.930
 experience and averaged e.g. 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.439
 more or less some ladies and practice 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.340
 to look for the year with an aircraft of 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.710
 helicopter or airplane 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.610
 the drone naldoni and today are already equipped 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.270
 with gps they are much easier to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.540
 fly 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.500
 for example if you have a year you 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.290
 Lose control 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.390
 He comes back alone, he poses without 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.369
 skill of the pilot in the region of santa 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.740
 in the center of sÃ£o paulo where the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.189
 drones are sold 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.040
 curiosity in this store for at least ten 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.290
 of these are sold per month beforehand 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.970
 in the beginning it was a curious person means 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.840
 it was more leisure 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.369
 is now working option even right 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.860
 photographers are looking for a 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.009
 are several models one that fits in the palm 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.280
 of the hand and costs 300 reais but the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.229
 are also the most powerful 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.049
 cost from two thousand reais 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.570
 price goes up according to the accessories 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.700
 who purchases receive training or take 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.890
 beware of people to not happen 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.319
 no type of accident 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.050
 do not exceed the margin above 300 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.450
 meters because it can already affect 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.480
 something does not fly in 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.100
 airport areas too many people 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.290
 crowd be very careful about this 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.200
 hence also not to cause the accident 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.390
 despite the curiosity and the increase of 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.340
 sales few people know that the use of 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.580
 drones has no regulations in brazil 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.530
 ie a practice is prohibited only 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.989
 five devices were able to 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.690
 government to release to operate 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.060
 only that the greater the interest for them 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.550
 greater the need also for a law 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.160
 that tells how and where they will 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.500
 to function in Brazil at least 12 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.220
 companies develop technologies for the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.870
 sector 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.390
 the national civil aviation agency 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.459
 prepares a proposal that will be 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.150
 public consultation before entering into 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.160
 force 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.360
 the expectation is that this happens until the 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.970
 end of year 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.209
 until then whoever uses a drone that is for 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.190
 fun or commercial test 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:11.150
 is subject to fine because for now 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.519
 in practice this flight is forbidden that we 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.700
 we are asking and from anac is 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.579
 working is that a framework be defined 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.810
 for drone operation until 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:26.390
 25 kilos up to 25 kilos in non 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.940
 urban and areas and it can 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.950
 operate for example to check 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.360
 fire lines to inspect 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:38.570
 transmission to verify herds in 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.920
 flowering and said that he 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.920
 has many utilities
