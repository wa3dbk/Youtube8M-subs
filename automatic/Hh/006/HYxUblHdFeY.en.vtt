00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.009
 my ladies and gentlemen i want them 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.290
 once again kidnap in the world of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.330
 grand prix eurovision de la 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.320
 but but but stand united to so 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.360
 you are only 15 songs left 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.199
 it is again a last place from the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.600
 1983, if I remember rightly 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.529
 it is a finnish song and is 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.029
 carries the title 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.779
 nora tschirner had to be there and she was afraid 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.430
 perhaps 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.960
 it is in the song that she is 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.030
 So this is a very equal 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.739
 complicated song a difficult song 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.210
 It describes that a bit 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.649
 feeling of the fin before the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.200
 Sauna visit only very close 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.629
 later this song explodes meaningless 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.860
 out of herself she as a spectator that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.300
 I want to say right away 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.789
 need a tiny bit 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.469
 patience actually a whole lot 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.079
 patience because it is far too one a piece 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.550
 very depressive and lonely suite we 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.129
 Sing this song once more for her 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.710
 look forward to a map had 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.710
 tann laura bassi with sony 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.770
 3 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.409
 still there 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:34.259
 we bring out loud paper 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.969
 hello hello sorry I have you 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.390
 but just expressed clearly 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:41.640
 I mean or I said it is 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.890
 a depressed lonely vienna and her 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.229
 and woman and squeal in one 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.459
 tour here an apology one more 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.000
 piece far art what we up here 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:50.399
 do 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.149
 no to punishment from the very beginning please 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.149
 No 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:04.030
 I have to get back the rhythm 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.030
 Come in we break 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.950
 I can not work like this 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.629
 where have we been now 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.629
 makes a game and so on 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.890
 at the moment rips 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.890
 there was 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.349
 I do not run with this we want 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.280
 but let's see if the number profi 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.280
 I prefer to get through here now 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.940
 we render the rating neutral 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.659
 Ankara has the deduction is the case 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.650
 on 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.940
 that was that does not make sense the song is 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.300
 too little is itself a 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.920
 Finnish song happened and we have 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.880
 another song also brought from the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.070
 year before 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.920
 But a Finnish song is not 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.500
 so finnish and has the penultimate place 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.900
 occupied the song is something altogether 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.090
 I can say that happier and happier 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.090
 we sing the title physics again 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:17.270
 does the work the bafin under the 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:20.600
 latte called the fortified ladder 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.600
 Qatar was 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.750
 movie theater 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.650

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.650
 choice
