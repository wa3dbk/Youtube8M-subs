00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.979
 the term bible appeared as an everyday word for the guild 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:11.570
 is the plural of piro 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.629
 the Greek word for cuba 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:14.629
 in the month 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.919
 xx and xxi - books as we know it today 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.789
 the texts were rolled up and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.569
 in these meetings 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.500
 the six million copies sold 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 it is the best selling book 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.720
 world with a finish 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.869
 all of us who love us Christians 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.800
 we consider the sacred 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.739
 However 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.030
 it's amazing how most of us know very little about children 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.970
 we read 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.550
 we should read it 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.680
 every day and the purpose here will be to talk a little about them 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.190
 in fact the bible is not exactly corn 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.280
 it is composed of 66 books for evangelicals 73 Catholic points 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.420
 separated between the motive in the new testament 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.760
 and as much as we have access to it today as a very leaning book 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.050
 it was not always like this 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.850
 indeed 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.340
 the books of the bible 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.140
 differentiate you in crisis and in several ways to start by ibge the increase 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.250
 of the applications and by their authors numbers 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.130
 while we discussed wills were written in Hebrew 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.980
 the new ones were written on strike 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.860
 the possible time space also escape 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.570
 the first book of the bible 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.930
 your last 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.390
 I have a hiatus of no less than a thousand and six hundred years 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.329
 the historians 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.640
 calls the son of the pentateuch if they are genes 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.320
 that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.980
 Leviticus Deuteronomy numbers 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.550
 have begun to be written around a thousand and five hundred antichrist 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.690
 on the other hand 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.160
 most scholars date back to the last book of the bible apocalypse brother of 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.499
 last decade of the 1st century 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.320
 after criticism 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.170
 like this 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.979
 the social and cultural circumstances in which each of the 23 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.160
 also differ practically 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.140
 if the Jews started writing the book days 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.439
 that I walk in the desert in search of the promised land 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.510
 logical that the apocalypse 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.070
 on the oppression of the Roman empire and martyrdom and his brothers of faith 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.639
 but if the bible is not a very 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.550
 how was this selection process done? 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.550
 of 42 would be or not in this compilation all the books have the same 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.579
 importance 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.029
 and if not all the Jews truly expected 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.059
 the chosen books we love khandan 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.999
 Greek word for Catalan 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.420
 I'ts very interesting 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.939
 think that those in the early church 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.760
 had not defined which texts were considered sacred or not 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.239
 in an era without the press and without communication the living were all 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.279
 hand-copied in all churches is a corpse of all books 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:58.829
 Besides that 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.829
 the churches said rodley palestinians different opinions 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.139
 about which of these books should or should not be considered 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.329
 sacred 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.029
 this definition took more than 200 years 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.109
 after the death of jesus 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.579
 to get an idea 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.789
 books that we consider sacred today 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:18.709
 as brother apocalypse 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.229
 judas 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.609
 according to pm 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.049
 2nd and 3rd João have already been out of some ancient carnivals 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.519
 on the other hand - that today 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.499
 are out of our lives that are little known by most Christians 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.519
 were already part of the duels with the wax of the inspired 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.519
 by our early church brothers 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.549
 many believers the third siege 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.459
 nero with tense hectare 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.699
 cheeses like the shepherd and arms and the epistles of Ignatius Polycarp 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.319
 clement 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.299
 the first historical record of coal at risk that evangelicals recognize 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.579
 today as expected 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.899
 only the date of the year 367 after Christ 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:04.050
 number that isolated 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.050
 of the neck of alexandria 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.409
 Amazingly 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.849
 still today Christians of the whole world of scrap perversion 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.430
 the leading and most famous dgs health 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.479
 this protest to Catholics 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:20.530
 the dispute 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.110
 many practically the Old Testament 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.730
 and the Catholics it includes on its bike 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.219
 if we have more 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:29.190
 judith 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.229
 first mark of today according macabeus ecclesiastical wisdom 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.180
 and to pt 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.830
 besides small additions the book of psalms that Daniel 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.020
 but the difference in the lives of Christians by the 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.620
 not limited to the old testament 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.760
 the bible of the orthodox church of ethiopia includes for example 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.020
 besides the book of death the already mentioned pasture agert 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.279
 gray jatobá that Syria 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.279
 disregarding our current apocalypse 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:02.360
 the decisive churches and till 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.110
 it seems a reality far north 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.530
 but it was very little 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.800
 the bible of the evangelicals did not remain without link of April 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.620
 wheezing 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.479
 'judas' and the apocalypse 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.120
 none other than Luther himself 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.160
 or Protestant Welsh country 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.009
 I proposed that they be withdrawn 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.169
 the new testament 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.360
 already in the 16th century after Christ 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.030
 besides these cases 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.030
 there are also the texts considered unanimously as apocalypse, ie without 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.249
 shelf life 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:41.259
 the list is immense contains examples of common thinking the apocalypse of moses 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.770
 the apocalypse 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.110
 gospel of judas iscariot of Mary Magdalene 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.760
 we lose many others from a list of more than 100 titles certainly not 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.270
 written by its supposed authors, we are happy today to consider the 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.569
 rules and the most absurd imagine en 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.770
 despite all the major issues within such as eg 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:09.689
 the historical books of the Jews the evangelicals or the Pauline epistles 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:12.689
 are practically unanimous 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.699
 there is a variation of 10% among the scoundrels of the different forms of 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:22.059
 Christian 

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:23.259
 thus 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:24.439
 the christians 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:25.770
 an act of faith 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.759
 we believe that just as the holy spirit 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.809
 inspired the authors of the Bible 

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:35.819
 so it has been present throughout the history of the salvation of the g20 that the 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:37.699
 makes up 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:42.719
 we believe that knowing the origins of its population will help 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:47.509
 salvation and our understanding of the history of God's relationship 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:48.569
 humanity 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.590
 without ever compromising the act 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.419
 with the real word 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:53.550
 and divine revelation
