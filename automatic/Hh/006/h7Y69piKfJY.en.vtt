00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
say that right now on the way I want to

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.780 
say that right now on the way I want to
win<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.319> p.m.<00:02:24.560> cuz<00:02:24.980> i<00:02:25.010> know<00:02:25.190> my<00:02:25.459> hair<00:02:25.640> never

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.780 
win a p.m. cuz i know my hair never
grows<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.420> hole<00:02:27.069> even<00:02:28.069> formation<00:02:28.640> it's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
grows in a hole even formation it's

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.550 
grows in a hole even formation it's
always<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.150> ones<00:02:29.329> on<00:02:29.569> top<00:02:29.780> takes<00:02:30.079> longest<00:02:30.440> to

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
always the ones on top takes longest to

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.809 
always the ones on top takes longest to
have<00:02:30.709> like<00:02:30.829> a<00:02:30.920> mole<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.160> thing<00:02:31.280> going<00:02:31.489> on<00:02:31.579> so

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
have like a mole that thing going on so

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.550 
have like a mole that thing going on so
yeah<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.690> other<00:02:32.810> side<00:02:33.049> should<00:02:33.260> be<00:02:33.349> doing

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
yeah so the other side should be doing

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.830 
yeah so the other side should be doing
the<00:02:33.620> same<00:02:33.650> thing<00:02:34.040> hopefully<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.400> don't<00:02:34.579> have<00:02:34.730> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
the same thing hopefully I don't have a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
the same thing hopefully I don't have a
left<00:02:35.840> side<00:02:35.959> longer<00:02:36.260> than<00:02:36.379> the<00:02:36.440> right<00:02:36.620> thing

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
left side longer than the right thing

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.559 
left side longer than the right thing
because<00:02:37.010> when<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.220> was<00:02:37.430> relaxed<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.209> was<00:02:38.360> my

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
because when I was relaxed that was my

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.569 
because when I was relaxed that was my
constant<00:02:38.840> problem<00:02:39.379> one<00:02:39.950> side<00:02:40.160> was<00:02:40.310> always

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
constant problem one side was always

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.849 
constant problem one side was always
