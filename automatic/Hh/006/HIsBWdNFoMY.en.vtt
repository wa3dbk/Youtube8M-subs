00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello friends today I am showing these 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:13.519
 here is the sheath I did not order them myself 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.770
 but one good friend who 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.840
 did me free but again did 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:25.199
 they are absolutely like I told him one thing 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.250
 from cooking one of the options but my wife 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.179
 already on the channel 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:38.040
 similar but this principle is absolutely 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:41.760
 also made that is this is a thin skin 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.890
 stuck together two and in this way 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.450
 cut out stitched on the sewing machine is not 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.770
 such a loop under the belt 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.980
 more than sure to start a comment 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.590
 and talk like why I didn't and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.610
 found thick skin and make thick 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.180
 leather all like this until I do not 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.520
 wondered not looking for sweaters skin made 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.970
 wanted by what I wanted to see 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.630
 true to say that they did it 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.300
 so they are quite happy with me again 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.720
 same surely thick skin eat thick 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.740
 leather 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.540
 but no less so here they are too 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:31.670
 fairly good functional 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.680
 turned out the skin glued the cream is not read 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.149
 special bone glue 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.619
 sewed seams with such white threads 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.670
 loop in this way first 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.970
 glued with the same glue but then stitched 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.710
 one line on the sewing machine 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.570
 Itself on 1 layer on me quite it 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.149
 arranges 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.640
 the process i also filmed i therefore 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.209
 ask you if i need it 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.810
 mount in order to show you the principle 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:09.929
 all technology in quotes inventions 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.350
 such here is why under the video I 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.020
 leave a comment if you wish 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.750
 look at the process of their manufacture 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.750
 place but if not, respectively, 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.569
 of milk
