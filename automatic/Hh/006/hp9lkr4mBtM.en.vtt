00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
Mercedes really heavy feel you knew

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.790 
Mercedes really heavy feel you knew
exactly<00:01:17.770> where<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.280> car<00:01:18.520> was<00:01:18.790> at<00:01:19.090> all<00:01:19.300> times

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
exactly where the car was at all times

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.180 
exactly where the car was at all times
wasn't<00:01:20.800> quite<00:01:21.100> as<00:01:21.600> precise<00:01:22.600> yet<00:01:22.960> as<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.410> BMW

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
wasn't quite as precise yet as the BMW

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.480 
wasn't quite as precise yet as the BMW
but<00:01:24.399> more<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:25.090> than<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:26.020> Lexus<00:01:26.440> really<00:01:27.310> good

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
but more so than the Lexus really good

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.400 
but more so than the Lexus really good
under<00:01:27.729> braking<00:01:27.940> stable<00:01:28.630> under<00:01:28.869> braking<00:01:29.259> as<00:01:29.380> a

under braking stable under braking as a
matter<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.800> fact<00:01:30.039> all<00:01:30.250> three<00:01:30.759> of<00:01:30.880> these<00:01:31.000> cars

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
matter of fact all three of these cars

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.600 
matter of fact all three of these cars
had<00:01:31.630> very<00:01:32.050> similar<00:01:33.240> braking<00:01:34.240> distances<00:01:35.610> now

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
had very similar braking distances now

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.650 
had very similar braking distances now
when<00:01:36.729> you're<00:01:36.850> going<00:01:37.060> up<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.270> hill

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
when you're going up the hill

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.540 
when you're going up the hill
nothing<00:01:38.140> beats<00:01:38.410> torque<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.100> in<00:01:39.190> this<00:01:39.280> case

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
nothing beats torque and in this case

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.310 
nothing beats torque and in this case
this<00:01:39.789> is<00:01:39.940> where<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.270> Mercedes<00:01:40.780> was<00:01:40.810> able<00:01:41.289> to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
this is where the Mercedes was able to

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.410 
this is where the Mercedes was able to
make<00:01:41.590> up<00:01:41.740> time<00:01:41.979> on<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.340> other<00:01:42.460> cars<00:01:42.789> as<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.270> has

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
make up time on the other cars as it has

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.240 
make up time on the other cars as it has
plenty<00:01:43.750> of<00:01:43.930> mid-range<00:01:44.289> and<00:01:44.770> low-end<00:01:44.950> torque

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
plenty of mid-range and low-end torque

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.820 
plenty of mid-range and low-end torque
to<00:01:46.180> really<00:01:46.570> launch<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.140> car<00:01:47.350> out<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:47.740> the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
to really launch the car out of the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.699 
to really launch the car out of the
corners<00:01:48.250> but<00:01:49.180> it<00:01:49.300> also<00:01:49.539> has<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.259> highest

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
corners but it also has the highest

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.070 
corners but it also has the highest
average<00:01:50.920> chassis<00:01:51.819> slip<00:01:52.179> angle<00:01:52.569> in<00:01:52.720> so<00:01:52.899> many

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
average chassis slip angle in so many

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.680 
average chassis slip angle in so many
words<00:01:53.289> that<00:01:53.500> means<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:54.069> slides<00:01:54.610> more<00:01:55.360> than<00:01:55.599> the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
words that means it slides more than the

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.380 
words that means it slides more than the
other<00:01:55.840> cars<00:01:56.170> did<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:57.429> costs<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.090> speed

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
other cars did and that costs you speed

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.290 
other cars did and that costs you speed
that's<00:01:59.110> why<00:01:59.349> the<00:01:59.410> Mercedes<00:02:00.069> was<00:02:00.759> old<00:02:01.030> not

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
that's why the Mercedes was old not

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.930 
that's why the Mercedes was old not
quite<00:02:01.630> as<00:02:01.840> quick<00:02:02.050> as<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.410> BMW<00:02:02.709> and<00:02:03.250> only<00:02:03.729> just

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
quite as quick as the BMW and only just

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.270 
quite as quick as the BMW and only just
a<00:02:04.030> little<00:02:04.060> bit<00:02:04.539> quicker<00:02:04.810> than<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.679> Lexus<00:02:06.069> in

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
a little bit quicker than the Lexus in

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.730 
a little bit quicker than the Lexus in
spite<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.640> all<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.060> horsepower<00:02:07.660> as<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.649> was

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
spite of all that horsepower as it was

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.370 
spite of all that horsepower as it was
slid<00:02:09.130> around<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.490> little<00:02:09.610> more<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:11.080> doesn't

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
slid around a little more that doesn't

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.580 
slid around a little more that doesn't
mean<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.560> wasn't<00:02:11.709> fun<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.630> wastes<00:02:14.500> a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
mean it wasn't fun it just wastes a

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.530 
mean it wasn't fun it just wastes a
little<00:02:14.860> bit<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.220> power<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.819> chassis
