00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
lots of fun get some eggs off her I got

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.520 
lots of fun get some eggs off her I got
her<00:02:15.019> from<00:02:15.230> reptile<00:02:15.620> City<00:02:16.450> for<00:02:17.450> $300<00:02:18.110> with<00:02:18.290> the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
her from reptile City for $300 with the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.390 
her from reptile City for $300 with the
cage<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.010> set<00:02:19.220> up<00:02:20.620> just<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.769> cage<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.220> her

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
cage and set up just the cage and her

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.420 
cage and set up just the cage and her
and<00:02:22.730> then<00:02:22.880> we<00:02:22.970> bought<00:02:23.150> all<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.390> accessories

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.949 
licking the tongue a lot and being a bit
skittish<00:02:32.470> well<00:02:33.470> go<00:02:33.709> away

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
skittish well go away

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.449 
skittish well go away
but<00:02:35.959> are<00:02:36.500> we<00:02:36.560> doing<00:02:36.829> the<00:02:36.890> video<00:02:37.130> on<00:02:37.190> my<00:02:37.310> other

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
but are we doing the video on my other

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.479 
but are we doing the video on my other
snakes<00:02:39.250> but<00:02:43.090> just<00:02:44.090> get<00:02:44.239> her<00:02:44.299> back<00:02:44.329> in<00:02:44.630> there

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
snakes but just get her back in there

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.270 
snakes but just get her back in there
yeah<00:02:47.200> are<00:02:48.200> we<00:02:48.320> doing<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.590> video<00:02:48.739> on<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.980> rest<00:02:49.160> of

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
yeah are we doing a video on the rest of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.580 
yeah are we doing a video on the rest of
my<00:02:49.340> reptile<00:02:49.760> room<00:02:49.940> pretty<00:02:50.840> soon<00:02:51.140> um<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:53.590> so

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
my reptile room pretty soon um this so

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.020 
my reptile room pretty soon um this so
here<00:02:54.860> look<00:02:55.160> forward<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.549> that<00:02:55.670> I'll<00:02:55.880> probably

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
here look forward to that I'll probably

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.060 
here look forward to that I'll probably
mean<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.329> my<00:02:56.630> next<00:02:56.840> video

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
mean that my next video

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.330 
mean that my next video
children's<00:02:58.970> pythons<00:02:59.359> only<00:02:59.720> really<00:02:59.989> grow<00:03:00.340> up

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
children's pythons only really grow up

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.569 
children's pythons only really grow up
to<00:03:01.579> about<00:03:02.320> this<00:03:03.320> is<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.890> maximum<00:03:04.220> size<00:03:04.519> for

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
to about this is the maximum size for

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.699 
to about this is the maximum size for
children<00:03:05.180> right<00:03:05.299> there's<00:03:06.140> three<00:03:06.440> different

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
children right there's three different

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.170 
children right there's three different
types<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.250> children's<00:03:07.609> Python<00:03:07.760> then<00:03:08.000> there's

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
types of children's Python then there's

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.920 
types of children's Python then there's
Stimson<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.660> children<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.829> ah<00:03:10.930> can't

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
Stimson a children I and ah can't

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.190 
Stimson a children I and ah can't
remember<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.230> last<00:03:12.380> one<00:03:12.590> Mac<00:03:13.519> ah<00:03:13.959> look<00:03:14.959> it's

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
remember the last one Mac ah look it's

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.240 
remember the last one Mac ah look it's
up<00:03:15.320> starting<00:03:15.799> with<00:03:15.890> an<00:03:15.980> M<00:03:18.190> they<00:03:19.190> were

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
up starting with an M they were

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.620 
up starting with an M they were
originally<00:03:19.730> just<00:03:19.880> one<00:03:20.090> group<00:03:20.359> called

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
originally just one group called

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.000 
originally just one group called
children's<00:03:21.019> Python<00:03:21.169> that<00:03:21.500> I've<00:03:21.650> been<00:03:21.769> split

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
children's Python that I've been split

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.690 
children's Python that I've been split
up<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:24.400> will<00:03:25.400> be<00:03:25.579> selling<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.090> baby

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
up I will be selling the baby

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.449 
up I will be selling the baby
soon<00:03:27.060> probably<00:03:27.300> next<00:03:27.599> year<00:03:27.810> for<00:03:28.530> maybe<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
soon probably next year for maybe the

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.199 
soon probably next year for maybe the
year<00:03:29.580> after<00:03:29.840> for<00:03:30.860> $1,200<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.129> there<00:03:32.970> will<00:03:33.180> be

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
year after for $1,200 and there will be

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.000 
year after for $1,200 and there will be
a<00:03:33.330> padlet<00:03:33.660> one<00:03:33.930> because<00:03:34.349> I'm<00:03:34.530> getting<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.830> pack

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
a padlet one because I'm getting a pack

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.850 
a padlet one because I'm getting a pack
of<00:03:35.040> smell<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:36.330> breed<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.930> look<00:03:37.530> forward<00:03:37.739> to

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
of smell to breed so look forward to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.589 
of smell to breed so look forward to
that<00:03:39.769> yeah<00:03:40.769> they<00:03:41.040> only<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.879> occasional<00:03:42.120> speak

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
that yeah they only the occasional speak

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.890 
that yeah they only the occasional speak
for<00:03:42.900> I've<00:03:43.319> had<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.620> whole<00:03:44.280> life<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:45.269> cage

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
for I've had a whole life in this cage

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.020 
for I've had a whole life in this cage
they<00:03:46.290> don't<00:03:46.530> outgrow<00:03:46.739> very<00:03:47.220> big<00:03:47.489> they<00:03:47.819> don't

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
they don't outgrow very big they don't

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.020 
they don't outgrow very big they don't
outgrow<00:03:48.540> their<00:03:49.050> cages<00:03:49.920> really<00:03:50.519> easily

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
outgrow their cages really easily

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.650 
outgrow their cages really easily
they're<00:03:51.650> pretty<00:03:52.650> good<00:03:52.980> like<00:03:53.970> temperament

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
they're pretty good like temperament

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.750 
they're pretty good like temperament
wise<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.080> just<00:03:55.290> get<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> little<00:03:55.650> bit<00:03:55.830> cache

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
wise you just get a little bit cache

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.710 
wise you just get a little bit cache
defensive<00:03:57.540> as<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.930> can<00:03:58.080> see<00:03:59.180> but<00:04:00.180> that's<00:04:00.330> just

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
defensive as you can see but that's just

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.050 
defensive as you can see but that's just
the<00:04:01.500> way<00:04:01.620> she's<00:04:01.890> question<00:04:02.310> gets<00:04:02.489> fed<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:02.880> their
