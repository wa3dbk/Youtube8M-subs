and I am loving it I have experimented a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.920 
and I am loving it I have experimented a
lot<00:00:31.020> with<00:00:31.079> the<00:00:31.320> dps<00:00:31.860> power<00:00:32.450> with<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> dps

for you with the load out the best
loadout<00:00:41.190> i<00:00:41.220> think<00:00:41.730> i<00:00:43.010> will<00:00:44.010> begin<00:00:44.309> with

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
loadout i think i will begin with

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
loadout i think i will begin with
showing<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> powers<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.079> time

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
showing you the powers I go to the time

bomb<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.210> very<00:00:51.260> important<00:00:52.260> because

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
bomb this one is very important because

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.040 
bomb this one is very important because
it<00:00:52.739> gives<00:00:52.769> you<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> power<00:00:53.519> back<00:00:54.050> tachyon

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
it gives you the power back tachyon

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.240 
it gives you the power back tachyon
blast<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:56.280> distortion<00:00:57.149> wave<00:00:57.530> then<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:59.070> go<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
blast to distortion wave then we go to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.360 
blast to distortion wave then we go to
the<00:00:59.579> space<00:00:59.989> you'll<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.140> gravitonic<00:01:01.679> field<00:01:02.039> in

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the space you'll get gravitonic field in

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.970 
the space you'll get gravitonic field in
spiral<00:01:02.820> ways<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.480> reality<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> left

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
spiral ways what reality you go to left

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.410 
spiral ways what reality you go to left
I<00:01:05.190> style<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.880> singularity<00:01:06.690> in<00:01:07.200> gravity<00:01:07.920> well

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
I style a singularity in gravity well

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.230 
I style a singularity in gravity well
then<00:01:09.420> two<00:01:10.020> iconic<00:01:10.380> powers<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.190> just<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.730> put

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
then two iconic powers I just have put

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.790 
then two iconic powers I just have put
one<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.690> fertilization<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.470> all<00:01:13.650> that

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
one in the fertilization and all that

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.030 
one in the fertilization and all that
more<00:01:14.010> power<00:01:14.370> and<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.570> these<00:01:15.750> two<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.290> one

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
more power and in these two in one

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.580 
more power and in these two in one
hundred<00:01:17.130> percent<00:01:17.310> weapon<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.060> Rachel<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.870> don't

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
hundred percent weapon is Rachel I don't

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.120 
hundred percent weapon is Rachel I don't
know<00:01:19.950> why<00:01:20.190> but<00:01:20.600> i'm<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:22.380> experimenting<00:01:22.680> with

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
know why but i'm just experimenting with

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.210 
know why but i'm just experimenting with
this<00:01:23.900> with<00:01:24.900> all<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.230> these<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.010> see

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
this with all of these just to see

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.900 
this with all of these just to see
what's<00:01:26.430> best<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:27.980> we<00:01:28.980> go<00:01:29.160> to<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.460> loadouts

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
what's best then we go to the loadouts

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.470 
what's best then we go to the loadouts
the<00:01:30.420> loadouts<00:01:30.810> i<00:01:31.080> use<00:01:31.320> gravity<00:01:31.980> well<00:01:32.480> time

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
the loadouts i use gravity well time

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.270 
the loadouts i use gravity well time
bomb<00:01:34.340> tae-hyun<00:01:35.340> blast<00:01:35.640> warp<00:01:36.540> reality<00:01:37.280> there's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
bomb tae-hyun blast warp reality there's

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.860 
bomb tae-hyun blast warp reality there's
Arjun<00:01:38.670> wave<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.300> time<00:01:39.960> shift<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> now<00:01:42.720> i'm

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
Arjun wave and time shift so now i'm

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.960 
Arjun wave and time shift so now i'm
going<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.230> show<00:01:43.410> you<00:01:43.440> guys<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.430> rotation

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
going to show you guys the rotation

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.700 
going to show you guys the rotation
there<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.300> no<00:01:45.540> weapon<00:01:45.960> included<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.590> this

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
there is no weapon included in this

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.800 
there is no weapon included in this
rotation<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.550> don't<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.060> need<00:01:48.510> a<00:01:48.540> weapon

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
rotation so you don't have need a weapon

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.680 
rotation so you don't have need a weapon
mastery<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:50.000> i'm<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.510> show

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
mastery for this one i'm going to show

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.710 
mastery for this one i'm going to show
you<00:01:51.720> guys<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.890> these<00:01:53.160> are<00:01:53.340> i<00:01:53.400> start<00:01:53.880> i<00:01:54.210> use

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you guys so these are i start i use

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.170 
you guys so these are i start i use
gravity<00:01:55.140> well<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.650> i<00:01:56.160> keep<00:01:56.370> it<00:01:56.520> straight

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
gravity well and i keep it straight

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.890 
gravity well and i keep it straight
mark<00:01:57.450> reality<00:01:59.420> as<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.660> can<00:02:00.900> see<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.410> dot

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
mark reality as you can see it's a dot

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.380 
mark reality as you can see it's a dot
to<00:02:03.900> gravity<00:02:04.350> well

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
to gravity well

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.109 
to gravity well
so<00:02:07.390> what<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:07.840> do<00:02:07.990> that<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.560> do<00:02:08.640> graph<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.790> our<00:02:09.940> walk

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
so what I do that I do graph to our walk

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.950 
so what I do that I do graph to our walk
reality<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.960> I<00:02:11.350> took<00:02:11.470> time<00:02:11.920> off<00:02:11.950> after<00:02:12.960> time

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
reality and I took time off after time

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.660 
reality and I took time off after time
mum<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.680> give<00:02:15.070> you<00:02:15.160> power<00:02:15.550> back<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.640> use

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
mum is to give you power back if you use

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.660 
mum is to give you power back if you use
your<00:02:19.150> full<00:02:19.420> rotation<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.990> do<00:02:23.430> crafts<00:02:24.430> well

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
your full rotation so I do crafts well

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.440 
your full rotation so I do crafts well
what<00:02:24.880> way<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.390> type<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.550> social<00:02:27.550> wave<00:02:27.910> find

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
what way of the type of social wave find

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:38.910 
what way of the type of social wave find
 so<00:02:37.540> as<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:38.050> see<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.500> still<00:02:38.770> has

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
 so as you can see it still has
