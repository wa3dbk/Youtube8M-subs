00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.580
 my name is synonymous of music and 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.150
 Today I'll show you the harley 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.550

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.529
 a modern five page rock what for 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.770
 surprisingly cheap money currently 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.899
 costs 150 euros has its modern 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.599
 estimated earth corpus with 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:29.630
 bolted already closed 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.820
 Mechanics in rosewood handle are 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.350
 with 24 points 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.059
 everything is amazingly clean 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.770
 the paint is super applied 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.780
 So there is at first glance 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:44.240
 nothing to moan electronics side gives 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.250
 There are two hamburger in addition to a volume 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.380
 regulator a developer with the man 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.720
 between these two hamburgers a 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.340
 stepless, as a rule, can nevertheless 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.400
 a burden if you both the same 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.890
 There are two here 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.780
 active tom fortis once bastl once 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.860
 With which one quite nicely in the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.590
 sound can intervene 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.269
 we'll hear what's going on later 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.960
 Practical, this patent is easy 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.759
 here at the back 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.759
 The battery can replace swaps 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.859
 without using tools long to make around 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.889
 I now have the bridge on the excavator 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:18.229
 turned on the tone controls in 

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:22.850
 left middle position and am now 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.139
 but a look through 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.399
 in between a bit on the bass 

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:30.280
 and to travelport that you hear that 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.030
 because there are very nice country differences 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.030
 with vehicles can 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.650
 Sit down to fit 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.390

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.290
 mid cologne rhine turn 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.460

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.870
 mainly for rock songs use 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.219
 would sound like government attacks quite nicely 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.099
 Violently one otherwise one has here also 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:09.489
 with the two pickups still quite 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.599
 nice choice and for 150 euros you can 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.719
 not really doing much wrong 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.719
