driver video card installs natively I
had<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.750> install<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:18.810> geforce<00:01:19.810> 210<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.890> onboard

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
had to install a geforce 210 the onboard

had to install a geforce 210 the onboard
video<00:01:24.460> wouldn't<00:01:24.880> work<00:01:31.500> what<00:01:32.500> other<00:01:32.680> stuff<00:01:33.869> had

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
video wouldn't work what other stuff had

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.930 
video wouldn't work what other stuff had
to<00:01:34.990> find<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.289> driver<00:01:35.590> for<00:01:36.539> Ethernet<00:01:38.789> but<00:01:39.789> that

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
to find the driver for Ethernet but that

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.320 
to find the driver for Ethernet but that
was<00:01:40.090> easy<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:40.630> install<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:42.280> then<00:01:42.700> I<00:01:42.880> installed

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
was easy to install and then I installed

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.520 
was easy to install and then I installed
a<00:01:43.600> separate<00:01:44.440> wireless<00:01:44.890> in<00:01:45.270> USB<00:01:46.270> adapter<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:47.080> why

00:01:47.530 --> 00:02:03.109 
a separate wireless in USB adapter a why
B<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.360> can<00:01:49.679> do<00:01:50.679> this<00:01:50.830> stuff<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:52.210> so<00:01:52.420> where<00:01:52.570> is

drivers<00:04:04.609> for<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.669> extra<00:04:06.090> step<00:04:06.329> that<00:04:06.359> I<00:04:06.540> had

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
drivers for the extra step that I had

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.780 
drivers for the extra step that I had
like<00:04:07.859> the<00:04:08.069> g-force<00:04:08.609> g-force<00:04:09.479> to<00:04:09.780> ten<00:04:10.019> ran<00:04:10.199> fine

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
like the g-force g-force to ten ran fine

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.270 
like the g-force g-force to ten ran fine
but<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.879> sound<00:04:12.120> card<00:04:12.449> I<00:04:12.690> used<00:04:12.949> because<00:04:13.949> on

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
but the sound card I used because on

board<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:15.019> onboard<00:04:16.019> Sam<00:04:16.260> didn't<00:04:16.560> work<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.919> an

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
board the onboard Sam didn't work is an

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.680 
board the onboard Sam didn't work is an
oddity<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.849> and<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:19.769> uses<00:04:20.159> a<00:04:20.190> special<00:04:20.760> driver

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
oddity to and that uses a special driver

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.980 
oddity to and that uses a special driver
I<00:04:21.900> think<00:04:22.169> it's<00:04:22.289> KX<00:04:22.740> project<00:04:23.400> audio<00:04:24.360> driver<00:04:24.690> or

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
I think it's KX project audio driver or

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.570 
I think it's KX project audio driver or
something<00:04:25.409> so<00:04:25.710> that's<00:04:26.039> all<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:28.470> could<00:04:29.010> also

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
something so that's all I could also

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.460 
something so that's all I could also
check<00:04:29.909> to<00:04:29.970> see<00:04:30.120> how<00:04:30.419> all<00:04:30.770> stuff<00:04:31.770> like<00:04:31.800> you<00:04:32.370> to

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
check to see how all stuff like you to

00:04:33.470 --> 00:05:02.530 
check to see how all stuff like you to
work

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.440 

try<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.600> think<00:05:03.930> of<00:05:05.390> let's<00:05:06.390> try<00:05:06.570> this<00:05:08.450> can't

try to think of let's try this can't

watch<00:05:09.720> that<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:17.480> think<00:05:18.480> I<00:05:18.570> need<00:05:18.750> to<00:05:18.780> install

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
watch that I think I need to install

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.420
