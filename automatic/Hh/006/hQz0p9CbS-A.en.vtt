00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello dear people this video because i 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.899
 just like I did some time ago 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.360
 looking for the perfect ray 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.400
 player and before I put it too many words 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.340
 lose yourself with information about 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.570
 today definitely beats on the link 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.670
 under the video 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.920
 in the description there you will find the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.630
 Current review for all known 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.840
 but above all things also popular blu 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.670
 ray player models from the year 2040 of 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.859
 well known manufacturer because that is one 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.900
 tactically up-to-date best list 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.239
 because of the uncomplicated to the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.649
 less minutes all player models 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.370
 the debates are announced 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.840
 based on various criteria factors 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.700
 compare with each other and so on 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.010
 Of course, you will quickly find the model 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.500
 It's perfect for your encouragement, though 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.940
 also reality what I myself was before 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.079
 Two weeks in search of one 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.360
 only device has after about two 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.219
 years of intensive use simply 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.899
 abandoned the ghost, of course, very much 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.489
 very excited is because of 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.410
 manufacturer's warranty is also two 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.960
 years that means i could get the broken one 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.030
 no longer gets free a 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.280
 Send a new service faster 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.320
 but should if we are honest, the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.060
 old devices are not up now 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.770
 the state of an ice technology is very 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 far advanced and the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.520
 Image quality increased rapidly 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.650
 that is, it pays to take a 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.540
 Buy blu-ray player models 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.490
 Of course I then slip on 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.009
 this one does as we all know 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.630
 are all on the internet 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.700
 electromechanical products in many missing because 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.200
 much cheaper that means you mean 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.299
 I was able to determine the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.310
 Price difference is well know 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.350
 mostly dk 10 to 20 percent if you 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.420
 the device also compares to shopping 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.640
 local electrical retailer, of course 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.659
 cheap shopping world is the internet 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.700
 for me, although the first one was me 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.799
 honestly almost fell off the stool 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.049
 because there are so many now 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.810
 different player from panasonic 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.430
 philips sony or whatever that is 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.890
 very well-known brands but you know 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.140
 just not what is the best or 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.610
 which really makes sense because it is 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.530
 never rely money now really 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.509
 all models the last which of course 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.340
 only the first countries are white 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.979
 not like the experiences of the users 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.090
 At that time, after about an hour have 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.920
 I frankly just 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.390
 abandoned and put on the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.530
 looking for a blu-ray player test 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.629
 made and a bit disgusting 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.610
 practical matter for me 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.250
 go already told is that close 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.560
 clear table really has it all 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.480
 quite simply many familiar models 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.790
 compare with each other and also 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.709
 equal to a price equal with integrated 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.150
 and that one equal in current best 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.830
 Price on the internet can see 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.870
 but of course these are just a few 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.580
 superficial information if you 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.680
 now go into detail and unwillingly with 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.400
 the thought also increases whoever 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.980
 to buy 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.200
 then I recommend you very clearly sticks 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.120
 necessarily on the link below the video 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.440
 in the description because there you will find 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.300
 in current tests until 2014 and 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.300
 In any case, continue
