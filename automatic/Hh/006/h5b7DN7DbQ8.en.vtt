00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
gives you you know a really nice wiring

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.320 
gives you you know a really nice wiring
job<00:02:06.920> up<00:02:07.920> here<00:02:08.280> what<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.819> let<00:02:09.239> me

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
job up here what you have let me

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.250 
job up here what you have let me
disconnect<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:11.390> you're<00:02:12.390> gonna<00:02:12.480> have

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
disconnect it you're gonna have

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.390 
disconnect it you're gonna have
a<00:02:13.319> female<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> male<00:02:15.569> output<00:02:16.439> actually<00:02:17.250> made

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
a female and a male output actually made

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.720 
a female and a male output actually made
it<00:02:17.549> an<00:02:17.760> extension<00:02:18.120> here<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> female<00:02:19.730> or

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
it an extension here to the female or

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.819 
it an extension here to the female or
the<00:02:20.849> male<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.060> guess<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.290> one<00:02:22.439> that<00:02:22.620> plugs

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
the male I guess the the one that plugs

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.039 
the male I guess the the one that plugs
into<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.189> battery<00:02:23.519> would<00:02:24.420> go<00:02:24.599> here<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> mean

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
into the battery would go here I mean

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:25.970 
into the battery would go here I mean
that<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.319> little<00:02:25.500> bit<00:02:25.590> longer<00:02:25.799> because

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
that one a little bit longer because

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.740 
that one a little bit longer because
they<00:02:26.159> were<00:02:26.220> both<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:27.030> same<00:02:27.060> length<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.540> can

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
they were both the same length you can

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.170 
they were both the same length you can
see<00:02:27.870> here<00:02:28.079> where<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.260> added<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.879> and<00:02:29.879> it's<00:02:30.000> just

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
see here where I added it and it's just

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.880 
see here where I added it and it's just
a<00:02:30.239> little<00:02:30.420> bit<00:02:30.510> easier<00:02:30.629> so<00:02:31.049> what<00:02:31.680> you're<00:02:31.799> gonna

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
a little bit easier so what you're gonna

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.059 
a little bit easier so what you're gonna
do<00:02:32.750> you're<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.989> connector<00:02:34.560> coming<00:02:34.860> out<00:02:34.980> of

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
do you're the connector coming out of

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.890 
do you're the connector coming out of
your<00:02:35.190> board<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.879> typically<00:02:36.299> plugs<00:02:36.690> into

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
your board that typically plugs into

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.220 
your board that typically plugs into
your<00:02:37.069> battery<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.730> now<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.420> gonna<00:02:39.690> actually

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
your battery that now is gonna actually

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.190 
your battery that now is gonna actually
connect<00:02:40.879> directly<00:02:41.879> into<00:02:42.569> here<00:02:44.480> okay<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.720> then

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
connect directly into here okay and then

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.770 
connect directly into here okay and then
once<00:02:46.650> that's<00:02:46.859> done<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:48.180> one<00:02:48.359> left<00:02:48.569> over

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
once that's done the one left over

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.710 
once that's done the one left over
actually<00:02:49.530> connects<00:02:49.859> your<00:02:50.129> battery<00:02:50.519> so<00:02:51.420> let<00:02:51.599> me

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
actually connects your battery so let me

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.390 
actually connects your battery so let me
mount<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> battery<00:02:52.920> here<00:02:55.159> get<00:02:56.159> it<00:02:56.280> all

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
mount up the battery here get it all

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.280 
mount up the battery here get it all
mounted<00:02:56.909> up<00:02:58.639> okay<00:02:59.639> got<00:02:59.849> that<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.599> so<00:03:00.870> all<00:03:00.900> you

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
in person you can probably look at this

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.009 
in person you can probably look at this
straight<00:03:14.400> ahead<00:03:14.549> into<00:03:15.000> your<00:03:15.239> high<00:03:15.420> for<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.810> good

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
straight ahead into your high for a good

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.349 
straight ahead into your high for a good
three<00:03:16.920> seconds<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.579> then<00:03:17.639> you<00:03:17.970> don't<00:03:18.150> want<00:03:18.269> to

three seconds and then you don't want to

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.089 
three seconds and then you don't want to
look<00:03:18.510> at<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.690> anymore<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.109> mean<00:03:19.349> they're<00:03:19.500> super

look at it anymore I mean they're super

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.750 
look at it anymore I mean they're super
bright<00:03:20.510> one<00:03:21.510> cell<00:03:21.780> LED<00:03:22.319> lights<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:23.579> can<00:03:23.730> see

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
bright one cell LED lights you can see

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.390 
bright one cell LED lights you can see
here<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.329> two<00:03:24.510> rear<00:03:24.750> ones<00:03:25.049> are<00:03:25.230> flashing<00:03:26.190> and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
here the two rear ones are flashing and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.150 
here the two rear ones are flashing and
it<00:03:27.000> just<00:03:27.180> adds<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.690> lot<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.139> this<00:03:28.260> little<00:03:28.620> 1sq

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
it just adds a lot to this little 1sq

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.210 
it just adds a lot to this little 1sq
let<00:03:29.340> me<00:03:29.510> get<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.629> body<00:03:30.870> mounted<00:03:31.410> up<00:03:31.530> actually

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
let me get the body mounted up actually

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
yours like I did a little bit of my

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.740 
yours like I did a little bit of my
battery<00:03:44.819> connector<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.239> don't<00:03:45.389> have<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.660> you

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
battery connector you don't have to you

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.240 
battery connector you don't have to you
it's<00:03:45.989> pretty<00:03:46.109> much<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.349> plug-and-play

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
it's pretty much a plug-and-play

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.640 
it's pretty much a plug-and-play
let<00:03:47.669> me<00:03:47.760> dim<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.150> lights<00:03:48.329> here<00:03:48.449> a<00:03:48.599> little<00:03:48.810> bit
