00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.169 

okay<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.740> all<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.039> pin<00:01:08.250> curls<00:01:08.609> out<00:01:08.820> and

okay so I have all the pin curls out and
this<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.079> relatively<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:11.039> it<00:01:11.189> looks<00:01:11.520> like

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this is relatively what it looks like

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.270

anytime<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.299> take<00:01:12.630> pin<00:01:12.899> curl<00:01:13.140> down<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.679> you<00:01:14.100> can

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
anytime I take pin curl down as you can

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.539 
anytime I take pin curl down as you can
see<00:01:14.460> they're<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.819> really<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.329> best<00:01:15.539> of<00:01:15.869> curls

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
see they're not really the best of curls

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.969 
see they're not really the best of curls

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
but pink rose are great for our creating

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.919 
but pink rose are great for our creating
hairstyles<00:01:20.670> rather<00:01:20.880> than<00:01:21.149> just<00:01:21.689> creating

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
hairstyles rather than just creating

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.910

curl the hair and as you can see it just

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.660 
curl the hair and as you can see it just
kind<00:02:51.159> of<00:02:51.250> bounces<00:02:51.760> right<00:02:52.000> back<00:02:52.060> up<00:02:52.540> into<00:02:52.840> a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
kind of bounces right back up into a

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.710 
kind of bounces right back up into a
solid<00:02:54.670> shape<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:56.799> more<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.069> do<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
solid shape and the more you do it the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.660 
solid shape and the more you do it the
more<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:59.109> layers<00:02:59.349> will<00:02:59.739> start<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.159> drive<00:03:00.370> down

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
more the layers will start to drive down

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.179 
more the layers will start to drive down
and<00:03:00.939> hang<00:03:01.150> lower<00:03:01.450> that's<00:03:02.049> why<00:03:02.349> with<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.829> pageboy

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
and hang lower that's why with a pageboy

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.640 
and hang lower that's why with a pageboy
you<00:03:04.090> want<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.359> do<00:03:04.480> less<00:03:04.780> brushing<00:03:05.319> at<00:03:05.530> the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
you want to do less brushing at the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.800 
you want to do less brushing at the
front<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.250> more<00:03:06.549> brushing<00:03:06.970> at<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.239> back<00:03:07.450> and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
front and more brushing at the back and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.050 
front and more brushing at the back and
you<00:03:07.900> would<00:03:08.409> just<00:03:08.560> do<00:03:08.829> this<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.819> whole<00:03:10.000> way

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
you would just do this the whole way

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.180 
you would just do this the whole way
around<00:03:10.269> your<00:03:10.690> head<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.109> for<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.799> back<00:03:11.980> you

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
around your head and for the back you

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.800 
around your head and for the back you
would<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.400> kind<00:03:12.579> of<00:03:12.700> bring<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.239> layers

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
would just kind of bring the layers

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.649 
would just kind of bring the layers
around<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.650> front<00:03:14.889> and<00:03:15.340> then<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.420> would<00:03:16.569> just

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
around the front and then you would just

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.229 
around the front and then you would just
smooth<00:03:17.019> out<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.470> shape<00:03:17.709> together<00:03:18.239> it's

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
smooth out the shape together it's

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.780 
smooth out the shape together it's
really<00:03:19.450> quite<00:03:19.750> easy<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:21.010> just<00:03:21.040> takes<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.639> little

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
really quite easy it just takes a little

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.479 
really quite easy it just takes a little
bit<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.920> determination<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.069> play<00:03:24.250> with<00:03:24.400> the

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
bit of determination to play with the

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.610 
bit of determination to play with the
curls<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.090> like<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:25.900> said<00:03:26.170> you're<00:03:26.290> probably<00:03:26.379> I

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
curls and like I said you're probably I

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.960 
curls and like I said you're probably I
have<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:26.859> keep<00:03:27.040> brushing<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.549> out<00:03:27.670> and

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
have to keep brushing it out and

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.929 
have to keep brushing it out and
weighing<00:03:28.209> them<00:03:28.569> down<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:29.799> same<00:03:30.010> goes<00:03:30.220> for<00:03:30.639> the

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
weighing them down the same goes for the

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.020 
weighing them down the same goes for the
little<00:03:31.389> 60s<00:03:31.900> flip<00:03:32.260> you<00:03:33.129> just<00:03:33.400> take<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:33.819> hair

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
little 60s flip you just take the hair

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.420 
little 60s flip you just take the hair
brush<00:03:34.299> into<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.780> from<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:34.989> bottom<00:03:35.439> and<00:03:35.680> then

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
brush into it from the bottom and then

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.180 
brush into it from the bottom and then
just<00:03:36.700> kind<00:03:36.879> of<00:03:36.970> winding<00:03:37.239> motion<00:03:37.959> brush<00:03:38.650> upward

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
just kind of winding motion brush upward

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.879 
just kind of winding motion brush upward
instead<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.730> underneath<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.720> then<00:03:40.889> it'll

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
instead of underneath and then it'll

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.890 
instead of underneath and then it'll
instantly<00:03:42.459> start<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:43.030> turn<00:03:43.180> into<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.540> shape

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
instantly start to turn into that shape

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.809 
instantly start to turn into that shape
and<00:03:44.169> of<00:03:44.799> course<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.099> might<00:03:45.250> have<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.609> play

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
and of course you might have to play

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.710 
and of course you might have to play
with<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:48.040> then<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.370> will<00:03:48.489> just<00:03:48.699> do

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
with it and then I will just do

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.140 
with it and then I will just do
and<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.770> would<00:03:50.920> again<00:03:51.280> do<00:03:51.520> that<00:03:51.550> around<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
and you would again do that around the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.060 
and you would again do that around the
whole<00:03:52.330> side<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.660> your<00:03:52.930> head<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.320> on<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.890> back

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
whole side of your head and on the back

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.790 
whole side of your head and on the back
you<00:03:54.100> would<00:03:54.400> just<00:03:54.490> bring<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.360> pieces<00:03:56.320> of<00:03:56.590> hair

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
you would just bring the pieces of hair

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
it'll kind of just pull out the shape

it'll kind of just pull out the shape
that<00:04:31.720> you<00:04:31.960> want<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:33.810> usually<00:04:34.810> like<00:04:35.140> to<00:04:35.200> brush

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
out the bane area for a little while

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.950 
out the bane area for a little while
just<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.350> weigh<00:04:38.950> down<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.220> curls<00:04:39.790> so<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.690> can

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
just to weigh down the curls so I can

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.390 
just to weigh down the curls so I can
really<00:04:41.140> start<00:04:41.440> manipulating<00:04:41.680> its<00:04:42.310> shape<00:04:44.400> as

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
really start manipulating its shape as

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.950 
really start manipulating its shape as
you<00:04:45.520> can<00:04:45.700> see<00:04:45.970> it's<00:04:46.120> already<00:04:46.300> kind<00:04:46.600> of<00:04:46.690> getting

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
you can see it's already kind of getting

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.630 
you can see it's already kind of getting
to<00:04:47.650> where<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.640> desired<00:04:49.000> effect<00:04:49.180> would<00:04:49.630> be<00:04:50.640> and

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
to where the desired effect would be and

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.659 
to where the desired effect would be and
kind<00:04:52.000> of<00:04:52.060> getting<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.450> take<00:04:52.750> a<00:04:52.840> bit<00:04:52.990> effect

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
kind of getting that take a bit effect

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.070 
kind of getting that take a bit effect
and<00:04:54.669> usually<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.210> pretty<00:04:55.419> much<00:04:55.570> wants<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:55.960> do

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
and usually it pretty much wants to do

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.610 
and usually it pretty much wants to do
that<00:04:56.290> on<00:04:56.560> its<00:04:56.950> own<00:04:57.240> when<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:58.360> i<00:04:58.570> SAT<00:04:59.020> them<00:04:59.230> I<00:04:59.410> just

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
that on its own when I i SAT them I just

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.159 
that on its own when I i SAT them I just
bring<00:05:00.190> them<00:05:00.340> up<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.880> put<00:05:01.120> them<00:05:01.150> in<00:05:01.419> it<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:01.840> a

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
bring them up and put them in it and a

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.500 
bring them up and put them in it and a
curl<00:05:02.440> kind<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.740> going<00:05:02.950> within<00:05:03.100> itself<00:05:03.580> I'll

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
curl kind of going within itself I'll

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.500 
curl kind of going within itself I'll
show<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:04.780> I<00:05:06.720> just<00:05:07.720> roll<00:05:08.050> it<00:05:08.200> up<00:05:09.210> kind<00:05:10.210> of<00:05:10.270> like

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
show you I just roll it up kind of like

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.790 
show you I just roll it up kind of like
this

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
this

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.650 
this
and<00:05:13.030> just<00:05:14.030> pin<00:05:14.270> it<00:05:14.300> end<00:05:14.570> there<00:05:15.580> so<00:05:16.580> most<00:05:17.510> likely

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
and just pin it end there so most likely

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.040 
and just pin it end there so most likely
will<00:05:18.260> end<00:05:18.500> up<00:05:18.680> with<00:05:18.710> something<00:05:19.160> like<00:05:19.340> this<00:05:20.050> and

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
will end up with something like this and

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.570 
will end up with something like this and
remember<00:05:21.320> don't<00:05:21.560> get<00:05:21.740> discouraged<00:05:21.980> just<00:05:22.370> keep
