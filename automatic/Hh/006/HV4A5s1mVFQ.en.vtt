00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
stop-motion animation and I think you'll

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.509 
stop-motion animation and I think you'll
enjoy<00:03:39.130> it<00:03:39.810> otherwise<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:41.620> can<00:03:41.799> pass<00:03:42.190> on<00:03:42.459> I

enjoy it otherwise you can pass on I
guess<00:03:42.910> but<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:43.530> think<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:44.620> pretty<00:03:44.799> good<00:03:45.010> and

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
guess but I think it's pretty good and

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.900 
guess but I think it's pretty good and
you<00:03:46.090> might<00:03:46.239> want<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.480> give<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.630> chance
