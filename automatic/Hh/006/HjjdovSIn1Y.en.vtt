got a little bit more protection so over

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100 
got a little bit more protection so over
on<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.670> back<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.600> cross

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
on the back we have this kind of cross

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.779 
on the back we have this kind of cross
grippy<00:00:41.040> design<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.800> fairly<00:00:44.250> thin

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
grippy design here and it's fairly thin

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.880 
grippy design here and it's fairly thin
yeah<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.570> really<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.379> thinness<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.739> this

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
yeah I really like the thinness of this

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.310 
yeah I really like the thinness of this
thing<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:48.120> think<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.840> kind<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
thing and I think as kind of like a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.930 
thing and I think as kind of like a
metal<00:00:49.739> II<00:00:49.829> look<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.340> which<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:50.730> like

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
metal II look to it which I really like

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.330 
metal II look to it which I really like
and<00:00:51.149> adds<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.079> bit<00:00:52.230> more<00:00:52.260> premium<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.219> it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and adds a bit more premium this to it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.459 
and adds a bit more premium this to it
and<00:00:53.489> also<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> clicking<00:00:55.289> into

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
and also I really like the clicking into

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.840 
and also I really like the clicking into
the<00:00:55.590> buttons<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.100> they're<00:00:56.190> very<00:00:56.219> easy<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850

volume<00:01:00.000> buttons<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.539> really<00:01:01.079> easy<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.379> process

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
volume buttons is really easy to process

like<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.159> some<00:01:05.670> cases<00:01:05.970> make<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.330> feel<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> bit

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
like that some cases make it feel a bit

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.600 
like that some cases make it feel a bit
squidgy<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> buttons<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.950> hard<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.460> press

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
but this one it's very easy and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.210 
but this one it's very easy and
clickable<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.799> fingerprint<00:01:13.799> scanner<00:01:14.040> wise

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
clickable so fingerprint scanner wise

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.490 
clickable so fingerprint scanner wise
I've<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.580> any<00:01:14.760> problems<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.600> that's<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:15.960> good

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.749 

so<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> back<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> camera<00:01:20.610> cut

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
so on the back we have the camera cut

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.310 
so on the back we have the camera cut
out<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> heart<00:01:21.479> rate<00:01:21.659> monitor<00:01:21.720> cut<00:01:22.200> out

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.230 
out and the heart rate monitor cut out
and<00:01:22.560> also<00:01:22.920> auto<00:01:23.159> focus<00:01:23.610> for<00:01:23.820> some<00:01:23.970> reason

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and also auto focus for some reason

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.600 
and also auto focus for some reason
don't<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.840> know<00:01:24.960> why<00:01:25.110> they<00:01:25.259> put<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.610> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
don't really know why they put that and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.370 
don't really know why they put that and
we<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> speaker<00:01:27.479> hole<00:01:27.780> here<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.340> yeah

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
we have the speaker hole here so yeah

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.929 
we have the speaker hole here so yeah
one<00:01:31.380> problem<00:01:31.650> i<00:01:31.799> did<00:01:31.950> find<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.340> there<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.700> no

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
one problem i did find is there is no

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.749 
one problem i did find is there is no
kind<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.420> bump<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> speaker<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.340> when<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
kind of bump for the speaker so when you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.910 
kind of bump for the speaker so when you
put<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> down<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> table<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.799> is

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
put it down and on the table this is

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.140 
put it down and on the table this is
what<00:01:38.040> happens

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.450 

so<00:01:46.150> yeah<00:01:46.540> but<00:01:47.290> part<00:01:47.500> from<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:47.980> really<00:01:48.310> like

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
so yeah but part from that I really like

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.520 
so yeah but part from that I really like
this<00:01:48.580> case<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:49.060> think<00:01:49.330> it's<00:01:49.600> really<00:01:49.780> good<00:01:49.900> it's

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
this case I think it's really good it's

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.710 
this case I think it's really good it's
really<00:01:50.590> thin<00:01:50.980> it<00:01:51.190> fits<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.790> foam<00:01:52.030> really<00:01:52.540> good

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
really thin it fits the foam really good

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.990 
really thin it fits the foam really good
and<00:01:52.900> I<00:01:53.680> just<00:01:53.890> really<00:01:54.250> think<00:01:54.400> it<00:01:54.580> adds<00:01:54.760> a<00:01:54.910> little

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
and I just really think it adds a little

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.600 
and I just really think it adds a little
bit<00:01:55.120> more<00:01:55.300> uniqueness<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.350> foam<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:57.340> yeah

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
bit more uniqueness to the foam so yeah

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.850 
bit more uniqueness to the foam so yeah
I<00:01:57.880> definitely<00:01:58.390> really<00:01:59.140> do<00:01:59.230> like<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.410> apart

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
I definitely really do like it apart

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.190 
I definitely really do like it apart
from<00:02:00.040> i<00:02:00.190> do<00:02:00.490> find<00:02:00.940> some<00:02:01.120> Hari<00:02:01.360> monitor

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
from i do find some Hari monitor

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.720 
from i do find some Hari monitor
problems<00:02:02.470> sometimes<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.310> doesn't<00:02:03.640> really

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
problems sometimes it doesn't really

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.080 
problems sometimes it doesn't really
detect<00:02:04.150> it<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.660> don't<00:02:05.230> really<00:02:05.320> know<00:02:05.500> why<00:02:06.090> but

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
detect it I don't really know why but

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.240 
detect it I don't really know why but
yeah<00:02:07.210> overall<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.170> think<00:02:08.350> this<00:02:08.590> case<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:08.860> really

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250
