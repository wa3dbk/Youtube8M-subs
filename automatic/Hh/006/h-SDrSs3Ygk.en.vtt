day you know I think that he has set the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.610 
day you know I think that he has set the
foundation<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.840> start<00:03:28.959> thinking<00:03:29.230> about<00:03:29.380> that

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
foundation to start thinking about that

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.319 
foundation to start thinking about that
down<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.919> road<00:03:29.950> but<00:03:30.220> right<00:03:30.430> now<00:03:30.579> he's<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:31.030> think

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
down the road but right now he's I think

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.610 
down the road but right now he's I think
he's<00:03:31.540> played<00:03:31.810> in<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:31.959> majors<00:03:32.230> make<00:03:32.410> four<00:03:32.590> or

five<00:03:32.769> six<00:03:33.069> years<00:03:33.130> he's<00:03:33.669> probably<00:03:33.849> need

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
five six years he's probably need

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.610 
five six years he's probably need
another<00:03:34.329> five<00:03:34.750> years<00:03:34.780> when<00:03:35.200> he<00:03:35.230> continues<00:03:35.590> to

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
another five years when he continues to

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.409 
another five years when he continues to
hit<00:03:35.799> at<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.220> high<00:03:36.459> level<00:03:36.489> or<00:03:36.940> maybe<00:03:37.150> add<00:03:37.389> some

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
hit at a high level or maybe add some

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.110 
hit at a high level or maybe add some
power<00:03:37.810> maybe<00:03:38.680> be<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.069> threat<00:03:39.310> for<00:03:39.430> MVP<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.910> couple

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
power maybe be a threat for MVP a couple

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.180 
power maybe be a threat for MVP a couple
times<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.750> went<00:03:41.139> a<00:03:41.169> couple<00:03:41.349> more<00:03:41.560> batting

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
times and went a couple more batting

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.860 
times and went a couple more batting
titles<00:03:42.519> but<00:03:42.669> certainly<00:03:43.030> he's<00:03:43.419> at<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:43.690> point

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
titles but certainly he's at the point

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.539 
titles but certainly he's at the point
where<00:03:44.109> if<00:03:44.349> he<00:03:44.440> continues<00:03:44.889> on<00:03:45.069> the<00:03:45.160> path<00:03:45.190> he's

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
where if he continues on the path he's

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.460 
where if he continues on the path he's
at<00:03:45.730> right<00:03:45.880> now<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.419> have<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.230> start<00:03:47.380> thinking

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
at right now you have to start thinking

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.519 
at right now you have to start thinking
