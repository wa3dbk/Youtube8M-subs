00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.980
 and well hi to all and worlds where 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.039
 the four and today we find ourselves 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.960
 for a new short video 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.380
 I hope you have me well 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.269
 really great and I'm really very 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.900
 very happy because as you can 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.410
 see on the screen 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.669
 I finally found a way to film 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.079
 the screen of my ipod 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.559
 so it's called record mask rim is 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.719
 in celebration 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.820
 I could not get downloaded because all 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.670
 the youtube hours that made me the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.430
 tutorial forget he says to say he 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.590
 had to change the date because in fact 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.260
 apple had blocked this application in 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.480
 2013 and therefore must settle the date in 2012 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.129
 so just before when you could the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.460
 see i said coucou and youtube 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.339
 and now we're going to get a little 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.930
 attack so I'm live after 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.720
 this attack i'm going to show you with 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.030
 a building I'm just going to say what I 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.869
 will do like that you see you that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.490
 I am well live here so we're going 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.110
 try to attack this village 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.979
 so in fact I have a technique of 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.920
 form which is to be 17 miles and 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.340
 trophies was just waiting I'm concentrating 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 quickly done and therefore be at 17000 trophy 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.000
 and finally attacked only with archers 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.150
 and barbarians but I showed you in 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.369
 end of video how to program his 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.409
 troops for it to take the least so much 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.729
 is that it consumes the least delusion for 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.790
 to be able to make maximum profits 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.020
 so in the castle of Clermont but 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.610
 have asked broken bricks and put 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.649
 four breaks brick in case if we have 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.299
 then not to be able to move itself 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.350
 even so what makes us try to 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.219
 manage your attack well 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.719
 we put some barbarians to fart the 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.290
 king or queen who is drawn into a 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.680
 corner we're going to take the troops out of the castle 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.680
 Clan 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:19.000
 and once that's done we'll 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:22.190
 if my sufferings if I believe 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.580
 swung the barbarians to where he 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.530
 are the resources by half then 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.420
 half of the archers are waiting a little 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.860
 and we do the same again and then we 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.840
 wait for it to happen 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.560
 I do not take so because it 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.680
 cost of delors and and the bear is when 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.500
 even at this moment quite rare the elixir that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.300
 go again so I did two 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.970
 small improvements so now 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.670
 I balance everything hopefully that 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.860
 make a small carnage 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.720
 oh shit I forgot about that yes 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.590
 so it's pretty good 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.880
 if you 're not thrown to have to case 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.010
 where a kind of lightning to fart 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.860
 mortars because the mortars with the 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.930
 archers to look at it really is 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.140
 devastating in a little bit worse 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.410
 t20 and that it sa longer fair and we 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.630
 attack that's good me I do not think that 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.500
 I have his ex ir for now it's this 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.460
 I wanted to have 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.230
 I might have a star no 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.820
 do not know good that's why they went 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.930
 headed there why they did not shoot 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.060
 on the election why why 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.740
 youth 47% leaf attacks 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.770
 shit good 128000 gold was not too bad 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.920
 well, that's okay it's reasonable 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.460
 so we will go back to my village 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.870
 So, I was told youtube 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.150
 so we will ask for troops then 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.740
 now i'm going to show you how 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.450
 prepare his troops then he must 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:59.960
 put in each barracks a 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:03.140
 breakout so I just spent 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.940
 parenthesis I spent my black barracks 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.880
 finally she is under construction for the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.190
 level 4 long live the golems so here we 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.090
 puts a brick break in each barracks 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:19.130
 so you have to have 2,200 classes in 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:22.790
 your military camp or so finally for 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.910
 number so put a breakage bricks in 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.740
 each barracks times to have four and 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:34.190
 then you split in equal shares 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:37.700
 of drinking and darche bar and so you 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.640
 put 24 archers and 24 barbarians in 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.430
 each barracks and if you have 200 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.490
 miles for 200 places in your camp 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.210
 military that's it that will fall all 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.660
 stack and I believe well 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:05:00.220
 wait, I do not know anymore let me 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:05.660
 think a little bit was waiting 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:08.990
 nineteen minutes in all to create all 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.580
 that's it with the money of battle 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.320
 I had I just bought a 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.550
 town hall more and that's in 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.830
 the endorsement that I'm going to do little 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.460
 tours with my town hall so in 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.350
 the very second I will take my camp 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.540
 military and take a ppt and hop ride 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.820
 hop here so I'm really saying and 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.550
 there I am doing a troop of the army 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.590
 so it's at most yes but I do not 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.780
 would not find so I'm really 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.170
 nothing so I tell you chao and at the 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.850
 next 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.850
 a little early to chew
