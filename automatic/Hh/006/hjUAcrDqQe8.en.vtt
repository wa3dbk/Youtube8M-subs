 I welcome you on June 2 but bring 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.920
 presentations remain exactly one month therefore 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.929
 while I tell you how to set icons on 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.879
 in fact, everything is extremely simple for 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:02.449
 start go to the special page on 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.820
 address horrified with dot com slash with 8 with 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.520
 Your ios device link is in 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.040
 description under this video and choose from 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.090
 galleries the icon that you need and and 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.820
 Tap on it 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.130
 here is available as expected icons from with 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.380
 8 and some others like google 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.090
 play sitting in front of us appears 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.250
 instructions for installing the icon and 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.930
 it is written what to do next but still 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.720
 let's tell palm trees already took up 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.150
 this thing further tap on the icon 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.640
 add home to the screen and click 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.830
 ready and we immediately appear 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.140
 selected hong kong desktop and here 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.970
 so that's all just of course because this 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.370
 the icon is essentially saved 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.780
 no practical reference 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.120
 functional she carries 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.890
 and if we did it on it we get to 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.980
 page on the site with instructions for 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.240
 installation removes the icon as well 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.730
 like any iphone app 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.610
 enough for keeping a finger on a couple 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.980
 seconds on the icon and click the cross in 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.840
 principle in so here is prosaic and just 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.250
