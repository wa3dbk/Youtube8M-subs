00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
that even though the FaceTime works you

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.290 
that even though the FaceTime works you
have<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.800> app<00:02:59.920> it's<00:03:00.190> activated<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.880> may<00:03:01.120> not

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
have the app it's activated it may not

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.050 
have the app it's activated it may not
work<00:03:01.360> because<00:03:01.900> certain<00:03:02.620> service<00:03:03.610> providers

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
work because certain service providers

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.880 
work because certain service providers
certain<00:03:04.510> Internet<00:03:04.930> service<00:03:05.200> providers<00:03:05.590> block

certain Internet service providers block

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.130 
certain Internet service providers block
it<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.790> have<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.090> use<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.239> VPN<00:03:07.450> for<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.019> but

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
it so you have to use a VPN for that but

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.920 
it so you have to use a VPN for that but
most<00:03:08.319> of<00:03:08.500> them<00:03:08.650> don't<00:03:08.800> at<00:03:09.099> least<00:03:09.130> in<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.489> UAE

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.380 
most of them don't at least in the UAE
do<00:03:10.930> does<00:03:11.140> not<00:03:11.319> block<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.620> but<00:03:11.890> le<00:03:12.160> Salado<00:03:12.550> so<00:03:13.000> if

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
do does not block it but le Salado so if

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.509 
do does not block it but le Salado so if
you<00:03:13.510> are<00:03:13.600> not<00:03:13.720> ISA<00:03:13.930> not<00:03:14.080> Wi-Fi<00:03:14.500> just<00:03:14.769> remember
