00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.740
 Good day to all my name is 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.219
 weiss and I decided to play assassin creed 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.860
 4 black flag and at the moment I decided 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.580
 sink 1 of 4 legendary ships 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.279
 this game this ship is called for 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.560
 house negro Spanish rakes 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.640
 maybe he existed in real 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.000
 life but i'm too lazy to google 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.380
 this 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.079
 but it was enough for me to fight with laziness so that everyone 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.290
 sit back remember control to this 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.230
 and the game and yet all the same for the writer 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.840
 This video is the first thing you need 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.410
 say about this opponents is that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.820
 his right and left side is covered and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.610
 iron shields 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.910
 because of what our volleys almost do not cause 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.309
 no damage to him 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.219
 really do damage he needs to wet 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.000
 him in his 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.610
 tailgate pairs right I forgot how 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.369
 this part of the ship is called up necessary 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.670
 it was googling yes I'm not no you are no longer 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.729
 important shorter need to drench it in the ass if 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.430
 do you want to damage him shoot 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.340
 ass so it will not just be him 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.390
 quietly make you still open 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.009
 his weaknesses where already later 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.100
 point shoots and you will put it 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.650
 additional damage and he turn 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.350
 will try to produce for you too 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.049
 volleys but he's pretty not apt and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.780
 overall will not try to get you 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.210
 the cores are ordinary mostly it will 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.430
 try to drown you using mortars 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.210
 this ship is equipped with very powerful 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.420
 mortars 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.549
 which shoots not like ordinary 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.510
 assassin ships creed 4 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.170
 he will shoot as if 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.090
 a little bit ahead of you so 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.720
 in order not to fall under his 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.550
 shots 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.210
 that moment when he sees that he shoots 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.970
 immediately turn the other way he 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.600
 shot turned all the damage he didnâ€™t 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.520
 inflicted he will have there breaks there 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.050
 to recharge your mortars into these 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.720
 moments are you trying to cut 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.650
 distance swim up and shoot him 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.690
 ass yes it is the key to success and of course 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.880
 don't forget to periodically shoot yourself 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.950
 him his mortars barrels of gunpowder that 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.590
 they can, if possible, periodically 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.160
 dump but basically use them 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.790
 little because this ship despite 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.860
 its dimensions are pretty nimble he 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.260
 easily unfold float away in 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.920
 the direction in which he needs to 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.860
 ram go he will not try but may 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.860
 do under them there in one of the attempts 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.500
 record this video 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.840
 gave really that he rammed but that is not 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.459
 his main tactic is basically yes he 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.840
 will wet the mortars 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:10.970
 and wet with mortars so about 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.120
 picking up your ship I can say 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.860
 that i entered this ship never 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.050
 pumping your ship to the maximum 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.530
 the only thing that I managed to pump 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.700
 at most it's probably protection 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.130
 everything else I have left 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.910
 pumped 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.090
 at almost the highest level by 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.750
 it took me time 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.460
 somewhere a little less than two hours before I think 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.160
 two hours of continuous play any 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.690
 will be able to sink the ship attempts and made 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.460
 about 15 this yes in general will sink 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.470
 the ship is quite real 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.510
 if you have any questions then 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.850
 the monster almost fails then write about 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.130

 volits 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.399
 two ride a kite

 Sarov
