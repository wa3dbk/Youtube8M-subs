but<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.190> has<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.640> migrated<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> lot

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
but now has really migrated out to a lot

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
but now has really migrated out to a lot
of<00:01:03.809> other<00:01:03.960> HP<00:01:04.350> systems<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.129> next

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
of other HP systems you know what next

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.070 
of other HP systems you know what next
to<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> macbook<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.450> probably<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> biggest

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to a macbook it's probably the biggest

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
touch pan out there at the same time

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.700 
touch pan out there at the same time
it's<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.600> quite<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.110> good<00:01:10.229> because<00:01:10.409> you've

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it's not quite as good because you've

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.140 
it's not quite as good because you've
got<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.979> left<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.369> mouse<00:01:11.729> buttons

built-in<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> bottom<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.380> eats

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
built-in on the bottom there that eats

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.770 
built-in on the bottom there that eats
up<00:01:13.799> some<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> touchpad<00:01:14.580> space<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
up some of the touchpad space and the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.570 
up some of the touchpad space and the
multi-touch<00:01:16.470> gestures<00:01:17.009> especially<00:01:17.460> the

multi-touch gestures especially the
two-finger<00:01:17.970> scrolling<00:01:18.210> still<00:01:19.140> little<00:01:19.350> wonky

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
two-finger scrolling still little wonky

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.980 
two-finger scrolling still little wonky
does<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.340> work<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.700> easily<00:01:20.939> as<00:01:21.299> Apple's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
does not work as easily as Apple's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.420 
does not work as easily as Apple's
MacBook<00:01:22.170> touchpad<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.100> don't<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
MacBook touchpad and you don't have that

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.550 
MacBook touchpad and you don't have that
inertial<00:01:23.909> scrolling<00:01:24.140> that's<00:01:25.140> what<00:01:25.290> makes<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
inertial scrolling that's what makes the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.870 
inertial scrolling that's what makes the
scrolling<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:25.950> apple<00:01:26.220> stuff<00:01:26.369> kind<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.700> feels

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
scrolling on apple stuff kind of feels

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.749 
scrolling on apple stuff kind of feels
so<00:01:27.000> natural<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.780> 14.5<00:01:28.650> inch<00:01:28.860> screen<00:01:29.100> has<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> 16

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
so natural the 14.5 inch screen has a 16

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.330 
so natural the 14.5 inch screen has a 16
by<00:01:29.939> 9<00:01:30.240> resolution<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.740> lot<00:01:31.829> nicer<00:01:32.070> than

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
by 9 resolution that's a lot nicer than

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.690 
by 9 resolution that's a lot nicer than
the<00:01:32.490> usual<00:01:32.960> 1366<00:01:33.960> x<00:01:34.110> 768<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.310> pretty

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the usual 1366 x 768 you see on pretty
