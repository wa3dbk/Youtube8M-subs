00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
speaker that's going to be mounted here

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.470 
speaker that's going to be mounted here
and<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.569> front<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:03.930> panel<00:03:04.410> there's

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
and just in front of that panel there's

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.199

this<00:03:06.480> quarter<00:03:07.170> panel<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.730> can<00:03:08.790> see<00:03:08.910> that

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
this quarter panel and you can see that

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.080 
this quarter panel and you can see that
all<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.420> plastics<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:11.459> can<00:03:11.580> imagine<00:03:11.760> how

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
all the plastics and you can imagine how

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.000 
all the plastics and you can imagine how
that<00:03:12.150> would<00:03:12.360> actually<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.440> tap<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:15.890> so<00:03:16.890> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
that would actually just tap it so the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.370 
that would actually just tap it so the
opportunity<00:03:17.880> there<00:03:18.030> for<00:03:18.060> rattles<00:03:18.599> albeit

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
opportunity there for rattles albeit

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.710 
opportunity there for rattles albeit
last<00:03:19.560> Eclipse<00:03:19.799> alumina<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:21.150> um<00:03:21.330> this<00:03:21.569> will

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
last Eclipse alumina but um this will

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.250 
last Eclipse alumina but um this will
all<00:03:21.810> be<00:03:21.930> treated<00:03:22.200> with<00:03:22.610> Dane<00:03:23.610> arena<00:03:24.049> and<00:03:25.049> then

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
all be treated with Dane arena and then

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.289 
all be treated with Dane arena and then
when<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.860> quarter<00:03:26.340> problems<00:03:26.670> reapplied<00:03:27.060> in

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
when the quarter problems reapplied in

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.449 
when the quarter problems reapplied in
front<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.660> us<00:03:27.870> speak<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.140> up<00:03:28.230> grid<00:03:28.440> nice<00:03:29.280> to
