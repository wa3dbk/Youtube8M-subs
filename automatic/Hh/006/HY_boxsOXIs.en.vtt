they don't always fit in an urban
setting<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:30.299> you're<00:02:30.510> going<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.689> put<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.109> big

jungle<00:02:31.530> giant<00:02:31.950> like<00:02:32.099> this<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.609> need<00:02:32.790> space

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
jungle giant like this you need space

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:33.910 
jungle giant like this you need space
for

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
for

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.950 
for
insufficient<00:02:34.920> space<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.610> present<00:02:36.540> for<00:02:36.780> these

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
insufficient space is present for these

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.920 
insufficient space is present for these
large<00:02:37.230> trees<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.460> this<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.300> result

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
large trees and so this is the result

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.020 
large trees and so this is the result
they've<00:02:40.260> been<00:02:40.500> headed<00:02:40.830> down<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.250> stumps<00:02:41.700> over

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
they've been headed down to stumps over

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.090 
they've been headed down to stumps over
the<00:02:42.120> years<00:02:42.330> again<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:42.960> again<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.920> is

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
the years again and again and this is

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.120 
the years again and again and this is
how<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.310> find<00:02:44.670> them<00:02:44.940> now
