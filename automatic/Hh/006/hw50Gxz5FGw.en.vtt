chartplotter / sounder that most units
have<00:00:45.449> this<00:00:46.449> specifically<00:00:47.410> this<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.800> 78<00:00:48.430> real

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
have this specifically this a 78 real

that's<00:00:51.190> part<00:00:51.519> of<00:00:51.579> the<00:00:51.670> reason<00:00:51.969> i<00:00:52.059> really<00:00:52.329> like

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
that's part of the reason i really like

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.479 
that's part of the reason i really like

problem at all now one of the big things

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.300 
problem at all now one of the big things
is<00:04:59.569> being<00:04:59.750> able<00:04:59.900> to<00:05:00.080> set<00:05:00.349> waypoints<00:05:00.530> quickly

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
is being able to set waypoints quickly

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.330 
is being able to set waypoints quickly
and<00:05:01.460> efficiently<00:05:01.729> if<00:05:02.300> I<00:05:02.780> see<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:02.990> crab<00:05:03.349> pot<00:05:03.379> if<00:05:03.949> I

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
and efficiently if I see a crab pot if I

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.100 
and efficiently if I see a crab pot if I
see<00:05:04.550> any<00:05:04.729> sort<00:05:04.969> of<00:05:05.090> obstruction<00:05:05.569> that<00:05:05.960> would

end<00:05:06.259> up<00:05:06.379> damaging<00:05:06.919> my<00:05:07.069> boat<00:05:07.310> I'm<00:05:07.490> going<00:05:07.669> to<00:05:07.729> be

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
end up damaging my boat I'm going to be

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.700 
end up damaging my boat I'm going to be
able<00:05:07.879> to<00:05:08.030> set<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.240> waypoint<00:05:08.479> on<00:05:08.930> that<00:05:09.110> track

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
able to set a waypoint on that track

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.740 
able to set a waypoint on that track
so<00:05:10.129> I<00:05:10.159> know<00:05:10.430> where<00:05:10.879> that's<00:05:11.030> at<00:05:11.300> when<00:05:11.659> I'm

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
so I know where that's at when I'm

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.779 
so I know where that's at when I'm
following<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.259> track<00:05:12.530> back<00:05:12.830> you<00:05:13.430> got<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.610> be

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
following the track back you got to be

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.369 
following the track back you got to be
able<00:05:13.879> to<00:05:14.000> set<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.330> quick<00:05:14.599> if<00:05:15.050> you're<00:05:15.199> running

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
able to set it quick if you're running

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.559 
able to set it quick if you're running
30<00:05:15.740> 40<00:05:16.099> miles<00:05:16.250> an<00:05:16.550> hour<00:05:16.669> and<00:05:16.849> it<00:05:16.940> takes<00:05:17.150> you<00:05:17.270> 20

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
30 40 miles an hour and it takes you 20

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.180 
30 40 miles an hour and it takes you 20
seconds<00:05:17.960> to<00:05:18.139> set<00:05:18.379> that<00:05:18.530> Waypoint

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
seconds to set that Waypoint

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.309 
seconds to set that Waypoint
it's<00:05:19.340> going<00:05:19.550> to<00:05:19.610> be<00:05:19.699> pretty<00:05:19.940> far<00:05:20.210> off<00:05:20.240> point<00:05:20.750> by

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 
it's going to be pretty far off point by

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.050 
it's going to be pretty far off point by
the<00:05:21.409> time<00:05:21.620> you<00:05:21.740> finally<00:05:21.919> get<00:05:22.159> it<00:05:22.250> set<00:05:22.430> so<00:05:22.460> easy

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
the time you finally get it set so easy

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.129 
the time you finally get it set so easy
enough<00:05:23.389> with<00:05:23.569> the<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:23.719> 78<00:05:24.259> all<00:05:24.409> yet<00:05:24.590> do<00:05:24.889> Waypoint

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
enough with the a 78 all yet do Waypoint

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.290 
enough with the a 78 all yet do Waypoint
place<00:05:27.139> Waypoint<00:05:27.620> that<00:05:27.740> vessel<00:05:28.159> and<00:05:28.310> then

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
place Waypoint that vessel and then

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.680 
place Waypoint that vessel and then
accept<00:05:30.020> it<00:05:30.169> easy<00:05:30.469> enough<00:05:31.009> and<00:05:31.370> you've<00:05:32.360> got<00:05:32.539> the

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
accept it easy enough and you've got the

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.540 
accept it easy enough and you've got the
waypoint<00:05:33.139> set<00:05:33.469> so<00:05:33.889> that<00:05:34.069> way<00:05:34.190> when<00:05:34.400> you're

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
waypoint set so that way when you're

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.279 
waypoint set so that way when you're
following<00:05:34.759> the<00:05:35.180> track<00:05:35.419> back<00:05:35.689> you<00:05:35.900> get<00:05:36.080> a<00:05:36.110> good

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
following the track back you get a good

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.990 
following the track back you get a good
idea<00:05:36.680> of<00:05:36.800> when<00:05:36.979> you<00:05:37.099> need<00:05:37.250> to<00:05:37.279> really<00:05:37.610> keep

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
idea of when you need to really keep

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.850
