what you pretty much have to do is to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.610 
what you pretty much have to do is to

shows<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.969> awesomeness<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.960> fists

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
shows the awesomeness of the with fists

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
shows the awesomeness of the with fists
and<00:00:44.219> my<00:00:44.340> helicopter<00:00:44.910> getting<00:00:45.149> knocked<00:00:45.329> down

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
and my helicopter getting knocked down

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.770 
and my helicopter getting knocked down
but<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.579> way<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.789> get<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> hunters<00:00:48.390> interest

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
but the way you get the hunters interest

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.869 
but the way you get the hunters interest
is<00:00:48.989> by<00:00:49.170> shooting<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> or<00:00:50.100> hitting<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.700> one

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
is by shooting it or hitting it with one

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.460 
is by shooting it or hitting it with one
of<00:00:51.000> your<00:00:51.120> abilities

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.950 

so<00:00:56.470> I'm<00:00:57.160> gonna<00:00:57.280> bring<00:00:57.670> it<00:00:57.880> normal<00:00:58.450> speed<00:00:58.720> here

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
so I'm gonna bring it normal speed here

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.240 
so I'm gonna bring it normal speed here

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
grabbing a real big trouble with the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.120 
grabbing a real big trouble with the
helicopters<00:01:26.110> just<00:01:26.229> use<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.650> lock<00:01:26.920> on

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
helicopters just use the lock on

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:38.090 
helicopters just use the lock on
missiles<00:01:28.170> boom<00:01:29.670> bitch

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.590 

so<00:01:39.100> now<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.700> you're<00:01:39.820> in<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:39.940> helicopter<00:01:40.120> this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
so now that you're in a helicopter this

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.210 
so now that you're in a helicopter this
is<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.840> easiest<00:01:41.260> way<00:01:41.410> i<00:01:41.440> found<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.920> i<00:01:42.070> mean

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
is the easiest way i found it i mean

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.620 
is the easiest way i found it i mean
i've<00:01:42.370> never<00:01:42.610> tried<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:42.940> on<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.270> foot<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:46.570> way

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
i've never tried it on the foot this way

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.080 
i've never tried it on the foot this way
just<00:01:47.050> was<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.890> way<00:01:48.010> i<00:01:48.040> did<00:01:48.190> it<00:01:48.430> my<00:01:48.640> first<00:01:48.880> time

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
just was the way i did it my first time

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.030 
just was the way i did it my first time
and<00:01:49.420> how<00:01:49.600> i<00:01:49.630> did<00:01:49.750> this<00:01:49.870> time<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:50.740> what<00:01:50.830> you<00:01:50.920> want

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
and how i did this time so what you want

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.410 
and how i did this time so what you want
to<00:01:51.100> do<00:01:51.190> is<00:01:51.310> just<00:01:51.340> pretty<00:01:51.610> much<00:01:51.850> switch<00:01:52.120> to<00:01:52.330> your

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
to do is just pretty much switch to your

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.680 
to do is just pretty much switch to your
really<00:01:52.870> weak<00:01:53.080> guns<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.860> every<00:01:54.850> time<00:01:55.060> his<00:01:55.330> bar

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
really weak guns and every time his bar

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.000 
really weak guns and every time his bar
goes<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:57.420> pretty<00:01:58.420> low<00:01:58.720> like<00:01:59.350> I<00:01:59.530> suggest

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
goes a pretty low like I suggest

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.130 
goes a pretty low like I suggest
shooting<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.430> maybe<00:02:00.580> every<00:02:00.940> 10<00:02:01.210> or<00:02:01.240> 5<00:02:01.540> seconds

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
shooting and maybe every 10 or 5 seconds

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.110 
shooting and maybe every 10 or 5 seconds
um<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.890> don't<00:02:03.040> think<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.550> he<00:02:03.760> can<00:02:03.910> take<00:02:04.060> damage

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
um I don't think that he can take damage

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.139 
um I don't think that he can take damage
so<00:02:07.120> at<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.140> point<00:02:08.619> at<00:02:08.770> least<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.850> just<00:02:10.030> keep

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
so at this point at least so just keep

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.690 
so at this point at least so just keep
lowering<00:02:10.479> him<00:02:10.750> if<00:02:11.650> he<00:02:11.920> has<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.070> full<00:02:12.310> interest

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
lowering him if he has a full interest

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.100 
lowering him if he has a full interest
but<00:02:12.850> he<00:02:12.970> doesn't<00:02:13.360> look<00:02:13.450> like<00:02:13.600> he's<00:02:13.720> falling

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
but he doesn't look like he's falling

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.690 
but he doesn't look like he's falling
you<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.410> keep<00:02:14.560> moving<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.040> he'll<00:02:15.190> like<00:02:15.340> jump

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
you just keep moving and he'll like jump

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.890 
you just keep moving and he'll like jump
big<00:02:15.910> time<00:02:17.940> up<00:02:18.940> here<00:02:19.209> I<00:02:19.240> had<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.450> real<00:02:19.690> problem

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
big time up here I had a real problem

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.980 
big time up here I had a real problem
with<00:02:20.410> watching<00:02:21.130> my<00:02:21.670> back<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.600> ended<00:02:22.870> up
