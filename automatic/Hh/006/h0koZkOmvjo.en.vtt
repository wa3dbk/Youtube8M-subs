00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
though it's not spill proof or leak

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.610 
though it's not spill proof or leak
proof<00:00:49.460> I<00:00:49.850> have<00:00:50.659> not<00:00:50.809> had<00:00:50.960> this<00:00:51.079> happen<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.469> me

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
inevitably I always end up with a little

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.929 
inevitably I always end up with a little
puddle<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:06.860> water<00:01:07.010> at<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.310> bottom<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.820> it<00:01:07.909> is

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
puddle of water at the bottom and it is

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.800 
puddle of water at the bottom and it is
so<00:01:08.270> frustrating<00:01:08.829> so<00:01:09.939> I'm<00:01:10.939> gonna<00:01:11.090> let<00:01:11.630> the

so frustrating so I'm gonna let the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.350 
so frustrating so I'm gonna let the
camera<00:01:12.259> run<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:12.860> we'll<00:01:13.280> see<00:01:13.549> how<00:01:14.030> long<00:01:14.060> it

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
camera run and we'll see how long it

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.730 
camera run and we'll see how long it
takes<00:01:14.630> for<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:17.119> traditional<00:01:17.719> straw<00:01:18.380> sippy

drinking out of a straw sippy cup

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.820 
drinking out of a straw sippy cup

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
it's gonna eventually spill which is

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.840 
it's gonna eventually spill which is
pretty<00:02:39.840> frustrating<00:02:40.490> when<00:02:41.490> you're<00:02:41.640> buying

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
pretty frustrating when you're buying

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.600 
pretty frustrating when you're buying
and<00:02:42.300> spending<00:02:42.600> money<00:02:42.990> on<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.380> on<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.070> cup<00:02:44.400> that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
is considered to be leak proof and then

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.900 
is considered to be leak proof and then
we<00:02:48.990> have<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.320> la<00:02:49.470> loca<00:02:49.800> which<00:02:50.100> has<00:02:50.640> not

can see it's definitely even even on its
side<00:03:08.990> it<00:03:09.990> will<00:03:10.140> start<00:03:10.410> leaking<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:13.820> you

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
side it will start leaking and this you

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.680 
side it will start leaking and this you
know<00:03:14.940> if<00:03:15.150> your<00:03:15.330> if<00:03:15.630> your<00:03:15.690> toddler<00:03:16.110> goes<00:03:16.680> and

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
watching a show and then they leave it

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.150 
watching a show and then they leave it
and<00:03:22.140> they<00:03:22.230> don't<00:03:22.320> have<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.650> sitting<00:03:22.890> upright

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
and they don't have it sitting upright

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.420 
and they don't have it sitting upright
it<00:03:23.490> still<00:03:23.850> isn't<00:03:24.030> spelling<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:26.040> one<00:03:26.250> is

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
it still isn't spelling this one is

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.280 
it still isn't spelling this one is
actually<00:03:26.700> not<00:03:27.000> spilling<00:03:27.510> which<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.810> good<00:03:27.960> but

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
actually not spilling which is good but

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.270 
actually not spilling which is good but
usually<00:03:29.040> that's<00:03:29.220> not<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.610> case<00:03:29.760> now<00:03:31.280> the

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
usually that's not the case now the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.910 
usually that's not the case now the
lollacup<00:03:32.640> will<00:03:33.150> start<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.840> drip<00:03:34.140> if<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:34.590> you

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
lollacup will start to drip if it's you

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.680 
lollacup will start to drip if it's you
know<00:03:35.040> turned<00:03:35.370> upside<00:03:35.730> down<00:03:35.760> but<00:03:36.270> for<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.540> most

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
know turned upside down but for the most

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.020 
know turned upside down but for the most
part<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.710> doesn't<00:03:37.920> drink<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.190> much<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:38.730> they

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
part it doesn't drink that much but they

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.020 
part it doesn't drink that much but they
don't<00:03:39.270> claim<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:39.870> spill<00:03:40.230> proof<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.490> you

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
don't claim that spill proof so that you

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.250 
don't claim that spill proof so that you
can't<00:03:42.240> really<00:03:42.390> fault<00:03:42.660> them<00:03:42.720> for<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.020> because

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
can't really fault them for that because

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.860 
can't really fault them for that because
they<00:03:43.500> do<00:03:43.560> say<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:44.010> not<00:03:44.130> spill<00:03:44.370> proof<00:03:44.550> but<00:03:45.330> you

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
they do say it's not spill proof but you

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.290 
they do say it's not spill proof but you
can<00:03:46.050> put<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.410> in<00:03:46.590> your<00:03:46.710> diaper<00:03:46.920> bag<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:48.150> can

you know as short a small amount of
liquid<00:04:28.979> left<00:04:29.310> in<00:04:29.550> there<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:30.210> straw<00:04:30.539> will

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
liquid left in there the straw will

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.150 
liquid left in there the straw will
actually<00:04:31.139> be<00:04:31.259> able<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.440> get<00:04:31.620> it<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:31.919> if<00:04:32.039> they

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.060 
actually be able to get it and if they
turn<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.729> side<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.810> straw<00:04:34.139> will<00:04:34.440> go

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
turn it to the side the straw will go

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.550 
turn it to the side the straw will go
with<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.550> liquid<00:04:35.910> it'll<00:04:36.690> follow<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:37.169> whereas

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
with the liquid it'll follow it whereas

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.560 
with the liquid it'll follow it whereas
this<00:04:37.800> these<00:04:38.280> straws<00:04:38.639> there's<00:04:39.090> there's<00:04:39.509> a

this these straws there's there's a

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.290 
this these straws there's there's a
pretty<00:04:39.840> good<00:04:40.050> gap<00:04:40.410> between<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:41.639> bottom<00:04:41.669> and

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
pretty good gap between the bottom and

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.070 
pretty good gap between the bottom and
the<00:04:42.389> straw<00:04:43.259> and<00:04:43.830> it's<00:04:44.220> not<00:04:44.430> weighted<00:04:44.820> so<00:04:45.270> when

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
the straw and it's not weighted so when

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.300 
the straw and it's not weighted so when
they<00:04:46.199> have<00:04:46.380> you<00:04:46.530> know<00:04:46.650> just<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.919> little<00:04:47.130> bit<00:04:47.220> of

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
they have you know just a little bit of

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.620 
they have you know just a little bit of
liquid<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:47.820> they're<00:04:47.910> trying<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.210> drink<00:04:48.419> it
