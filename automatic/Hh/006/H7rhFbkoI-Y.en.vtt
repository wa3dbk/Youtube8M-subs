 Yup 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.690
 once upon a time 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.090
 in a land in london 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.790

 and I promise we go strength I raven 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.369
 was about to make the most important choice 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.740
 of his life 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.420
 what are you doing to start from 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.310
 day of promise instead okay for 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.080
 only one narrator at least begins 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.200
 from the beginning where the division comes from 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.720
 between real yesterday man 2 goes well listen 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.580
 all carefully this is the story 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.580
 of ever rai auctions 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:38.080
 a school for the children of the characters 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.390
 of the most famous fairy tales of all but 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.020
 this year was very special the i 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.479
 ever after all students 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.159
 listen to the story of raven a rebel 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.840
 this was the year it would be 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.030
 celebrated the day of the promise 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.070
 a very important event during 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.039
 which students would have sworn to 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.530
 follow in your parents' footsteps in 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.509
 it will be better for them otherwise in other words 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.070
 I'm told the story if not 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.759
 his and those who do not both stop 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.680
 fight over all the cups you stand with 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.870
 talking to storytellers of course 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.350
 you certainly can't hear them raven alone 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.420
 I can 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.640
 yes I agree and I can speak now 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.739
 I'm sick that everyone is convinced that 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.910
 I am evil because my mother is 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.590
 bad queen 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:32.530
 it's not fair nobody thinks about you 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.430
 and sometimes you seem crazy to me 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.320
 it is the height 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.230
 the daughter of the hatter mad by me 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.660
 of the map you have to stop 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.450
 worry everyone at school loves you 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:51.200
 it would appear in Corinne escaped and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:03:03.110
 Evil escapes have you seen 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:10.190

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:13.220

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.590
 it was always easy to feel sad about it 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.330
 rightly so its destiny is of 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.790
 being bad can't keep quiet for 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.460
 30 seconds

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.720

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.230
 who wants to start 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.060

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.780

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.430
 in fact tilke i 'm school i can't 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.350

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.970
 question is means i will become like 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.540
 my dad after that i wo n't be like 2 al 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.690
 next one 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:44.010
 i am raven queen and i promise to 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:47.190
 follow my destiny as spouses I would 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:50.340
 a question is what i was wondering 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:55.050
 here is what would happen if I 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:57.750
 I didn't want to make the promise what I have 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.910
 only asked a question but certainly now 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.780
 I'll explain if you won't promise to follow 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.040
 his destiny 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.900
 his story will cease to exist 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.700
 will cease to exist 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:13.070
 then in that case it will be me 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.070
 also line will cease to exist 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:25.389
 so Miss Queen wants to continue 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:25.389
 Cricket principals I have to think about 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.180
 in the depths of the underground school 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.039
 there were some forgotten fables 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.060
 that he felt what was happening 

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:43.159
 what screen the brother of the principal myth 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.849
 the bold stands out the flight fights his 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:50.210
 reputation 

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:55.520
 but what will happen if they get up tide already 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:57.020
 what ever will happen here is so 

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.430
 that you conclude your story that 

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.879
 it doesn't go down that my suggestion 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.879
 craft
