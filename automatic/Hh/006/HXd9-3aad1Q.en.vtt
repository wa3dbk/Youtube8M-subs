in any medium and for us which feel like
the<00:02:49.410> only<00:02:49.530> way<00:02:49.680> we<00:02:49.980> could<00:02:50.100> really<00:02:50.460> get<00:02:50.670> into

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
the only way we could really get into

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.370 
the only way we could really get into
that<00:02:50.970> those<00:02:51.420> kind<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.660> emotions<00:02:51.780> if<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.230> buy

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
that those kind of emotions if you buy

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.450 
that those kind of emotions if you buy
into<00:02:52.530> what's<00:02:52.770> at<00:02:52.920> stake<00:02:53.220> for<00:02:53.250> these

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
into what's at stake for these

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.430 
into what's at stake for these
characters<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.210> that's<00:02:54.750> kind<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.050> been<00:02:55.170> why

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
characters and that's kind of been why

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.380 
characters and that's kind of been why
we've<00:02:55.770> approached<00:02:56.250> tension<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.880> violence<00:02:57.060> in

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
we've approached tension and violence in

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.140 
we've approached tension and violence in
such<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.600> realistic<00:02:58.170> level<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:59.220> violence<00:02:59.790> is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
such a realistic level that violence is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.870 
such a realistic level that violence is
is<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:01.080> show<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.370> there<00:03:02.610> are<00:03:02.640> real

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
is to show you that there are real

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.000 
is to show you that there are real
consequences<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.380> course<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.800> plays

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
consequences and of course this plays

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.250 
consequences and of course this plays
into<00:03:05.340> strategies<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.240> player<00:03:06.480> we're

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
into strategies for the player we're

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.570 
into strategies for the player we're
giving<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> lot<00:03:07.620> more<00:03:07.890> opportunities<00:03:08.460> that's

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
giving a lot more opportunities that's

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.770 
giving a lot more opportunities that's
probably<00:03:08.790> one<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.060> more<00:03:09.180> system<00:03:09.630> based
