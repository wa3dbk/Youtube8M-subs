we found here in the mushroom biome it

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.300 
we found here in the mushroom biome it
occurs<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.000> me<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.510> might<00:00:18.660> be<00:00:18.840> fun<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.560> try<00:00:20.160> to

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
occurs to me it might be fun to try to

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.700 
occurs to me it might be fun to try to
watch<00:00:20.640> what<00:00:21.029> happens<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> mob<00:00:22.020> trap<00:00:22.350> from

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
watch what happens in the mob trap from

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.570 
watch what happens in the mob trap from
the<00:00:22.890> inside<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
the inside and so I think I have the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.519 
the inside and so I think I have the
correct<00:00:26.789> inventory<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.539> try<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:28.199> I

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
correct inventory to try this out I

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.259 
correct inventory to try this out I
don't<00:00:29.160> know<00:00:29.310> quite<00:00:29.550> enough<00:00:30.029> about

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
don't know quite enough about

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.659 
don't know quite enough about
invisibility<00:00:30.869> potions<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:32.130> basically<00:00:32.309> I've

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
invisibility potions but basically I've

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.340

got<00:00:32.880> an<00:00:32.969> invisibility<00:00:33.390> potion<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350

got an invisibility potion and a
night-vision<00:00:34.559> potion<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:36.530> how<00:00:37.530> do<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.680> get

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
night-vision potion and how do I get

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.580 
night-vision potion and how do I get
down<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.399> that's<00:00:39.000> right<00:00:39.210> right<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.629> okay

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
down here that's right right here okay

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.139 
down here that's right right here okay
and<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.100> now<00:00:41.250> i'm<00:00:41.489> at<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> place<00:00:41.850> where<00:00:42.030> I'm

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and so now i'm at the place where I'm

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.380 
and so now i'm at the place where I'm
spawning<00:00:42.450> mobs<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.489> I<00:00:44.489> know<00:00:44.550> there<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.149> way

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
spawning mobs and I know there is a way

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.630 
spawning mobs and I know there is a way
that<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.809> kind<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.260> dig<00:00:46.530> into<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that I can kind of like dig into the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.310 
that I can kind of like dig into the
side<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.329> zombie<00:00:48.629> portion<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> trap

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
side of the zombie portion of the trap

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.799 
side of the zombie portion of the trap
right<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.670> I'm<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.270> drink<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
right here and so I'm going to drink a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
right here and so I'm going to drink a
potion<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.039> invisibility<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:55.219> a<00:00:56.219> night

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
potion of invisibility and a night

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.979 
potion of invisibility and a night
vision<00:00:56.579> potions<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.420> can<00:00:57.539> actually<00:00:57.629> see

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
vision potions that we can actually see

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.860 
vision potions that we can actually see
what's<00:00:58.140> happening<00:00:58.500> inside<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.579> then<00:01:00.480> i<00:01:00.510> am

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
what's happening inside and then i am

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.009 
what's happening inside and then i am
going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.579> hop<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.789> inside<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.510> trap<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
going to hop on inside the trap and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.170 
going to hop on inside the trap and
hopefully<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> monsters<00:01:05.189> will<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:05.670> see<00:01:06.000> me

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
hopefully the monsters will not see me

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.560 
hopefully the monsters will not see me
and<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.049> they<00:01:07.170> won't<00:01:07.380> interact<00:01:07.650> with<00:01:08.040> me<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
and so they won't interact with me and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.969 
and so they won't interact with me and
we<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.020> feel<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.619> what<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.860> would

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
we can just get a feel for what it would

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.640 
we can just get a feel for what it would
be<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> monster<00:01:12.570> inside<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.350> trap

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
be like to be a monster inside this trap

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.219 
be like to be a monster inside this trap
so<00:01:13.890> first<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.220> all<00:01:14.280> close<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.850> off<00:01:15.080> but<00:01:16.080> here

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
so first of all close this off but here

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.050 
so first of all close this off but here
are<00:01:16.320> some<00:01:16.350> zombies<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.220> spawn<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:17.970> we

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
are some zombies or just spawn but so we

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.399 
are some zombies or just spawn but so we
could<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.240> pretend<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
could just pretend that I was one of the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
could just pretend that I was one of the
zombies<00:01:19.770> who<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.100> spawn<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
zombies who just spawn that I just you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
zombies who just spawn that I just you
know<00:01:21.479> won't<00:01:22.140> hit<00:01:22.290> anything<00:01:22.530> other<00:01:22.890> than<00:01:23.070> jump

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
know won't hit anything other than jump

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.510 
know won't hit anything other than jump

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
around occasionally and got this nice

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.730 
around occasionally and got this nice

with you oh and there's a little flaw in

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.740 
with you oh and there's a little flaw in
the<00:01:59.430> mob<00:01:59.610> trap<00:01:59.909> there's<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> Ledge<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the mob trap there's a Ledge that the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.270 
the mob trap there's a Ledge that the
zombie<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.200> stand<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.680> he's<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> be

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
zombie can stand on he's going to be

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.530 
zombie can stand on he's going to be
slowing<00:02:02.490> things<00:02:02.700> down<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.390> something

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
slowing things down that's something

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.170 
slowing things down that's something
that<00:02:03.689> we'll<00:02:03.840> need<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.079> go<00:02:04.170> back<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.530> fix<00:02:05.180> any

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
that we'll need to go back and fix any

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
regaining some health and then we get

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.460 
regaining some health and then we get
over<00:02:19.580> here<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.970> mob<00:02:20.120> evader<00:02:20.450> I've<00:02:21.140> got<00:02:21.440> a

over here to the mob evader I've got a

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.860 
over here to the mob evader I've got a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
torch here but that was it's far enough

away that the light that it's giving off
doesn't<00:02:26.030> interfere<00:02:26.710> with<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.830> ability<00:02:27.920> for

doesn't interfere with the ability for
mobs<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.820> spawn<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:30.290> then<00:02:30.890> mobs<00:02:31.130> just<00:02:31.460> like<00:02:31.640> to

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
mobs to spawn and then mobs just like to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.400 
mobs to spawn and then mobs just like to
swim<00:02:32.060> up<00:02:32.240> although<00:02:33.020> they're<00:02:33.170> getting<00:02:33.380> a

that's what it looks like to be a mob

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.740 
that's what it looks like to be a mob
inside<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.190> mob<00:03:16.370> trap<00:03:16.670> I<00:03:16.970> just<00:03:17.480> thought<00:03:17.570> that

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
inside the mob trap I just thought that

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.600 
inside the mob trap I just thought that
that<00:03:17.840> would<00:03:17.960> be<00:03:18.080> fun<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.320> do<00:03:18.680> well<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.340> still

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
that would be fun to do well I still

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.770 
that would be fun to do well I still
have<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.850> night<00:03:20.000> vision<00:03:20.300> potion<00:03:20.690> I'm

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
have the night vision potion I'm

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.240 
have the night vision potion I'm
probably<00:03:20.960> going<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.230> go<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.560> try<00:03:21.710> to<00:03:21.770> fix<00:03:22.010> the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
probably going to go and try to fix the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.940 
probably going to go and try to fix the
little<00:03:22.490> flaw<00:03:23.270> in<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.600> trap<00:03:23.840> it's<00:03:24.200> over<00:03:24.530> here<00:03:24.800> I

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
little flaw in the trap it's over here I

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.970 
little flaw in the trap it's over here I
think<00:03:25.100> it's<00:03:25.220> like<00:03:25.340> right<00:03:25.520> over<00:03:25.550> here<00:03:25.850> actually

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
think it's like right over here actually
