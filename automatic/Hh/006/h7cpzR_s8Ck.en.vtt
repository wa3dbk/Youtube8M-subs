00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
special idea of yours is that's

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.580 
special idea of yours is that's
plagiarizing<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:00.960> honestly<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.380> wouldn't

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
plagiarizing and honestly I wouldn't

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.929 
plagiarizing and honestly I wouldn't
want<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> plagiarize<00:02:02.130> anyone<00:02:02.520> I'd<00:02:02.700> want

want to plagiarize anyone I'd want

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.639 
want to plagiarize anyone I'd want
whoever<00:02:03.360> has<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.810> idea<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.229> able<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> get

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
whoever has that idea to be able to get

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.569 
whoever has that idea to be able to get
it<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.860> there<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.219> their<00:02:05.399> own

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
it out there on their own

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.789 
it out there on their own
and<00:02:06.000> not<00:02:06.600> someone<00:02:06.840> else<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.439> for<00:02:07.649> them

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and not someone else to do it for them

and not someone else to do it for them
because<00:02:08.550> then<00:02:08.879> if<00:02:09.420> someone<00:02:09.780> takes<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:10.020> idea

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
because then if someone takes your idea

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.690 
because then if someone takes your idea
a<00:02:10.500> your<00:02:10.830> your<00:02:11.280> feeling<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.819> crap

a your your feeling like crap

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.100 
a your your feeling like crap
you<00:02:12.970> didn't<00:02:13.180> get<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.450> do<00:02:13.540> your<00:02:13.660> idea<00:02:13.930> and

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
you didn't get to do your idea and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.000 
you didn't get to do your idea and
that's<00:02:14.200> your<00:02:14.440> idea<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.010> then<00:02:16.200> be<00:02:17.200> they<00:02:17.709> might

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
that's your idea and then be they might

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.380 
that's your idea and then be they might
do<00:02:18.310> some<00:02:18.489> things<00:02:18.670> with<00:02:18.819> it<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.209> don't

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.360 
do some things with it that you don't
like<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.900> it's<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.830> creates<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.220> whole

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
like and it's just it creates a whole

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.339 
like and it's just it creates a whole
bunch<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.730> like<00:02:22.150> problems<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.050> that's<00:02:23.140> why

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
bunch of like problems and that's why

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.949 
bunch of like problems and that's why
you<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:24.610> kind<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.060> don't<00:02:25.450> want<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.690> give<00:02:25.840> out
