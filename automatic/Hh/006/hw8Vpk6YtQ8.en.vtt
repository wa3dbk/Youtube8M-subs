00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone with you love your supreme and 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.480
 Today we will talk about the pit when I 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.760
 thinking about makeup using this 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.920
 pencil miracle then light comes to mind 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.599
 and no matter how neat Hannah's makeup 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.940
 series pretty little liars 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.550
 we will try it with you today 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.680
 repeat makeup is very simple and fast 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.109
 we need only three products 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.720
 base mascara and female i 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.060
 We start with the fact that we put a base on everything 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.220
 movable eyelid can be a finger but I 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.220
 got used to doing it with a synthetic brush 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.390
 by the way, I chose a bit darker color 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.950
 body seems to me perfect 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.410
 for daily makeup 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.540
 if you want to make the image brighter then 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.180
 can choose a base with a touch of plum or 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.160
 a bit greenish but now turn 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.890
 to the star of this makeup kayale 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.770
 I put a pencil along the lash line 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.660
 focusing on the outer corner and quite 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.010
 do not touch the inside so that the makeup does not 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.469
 seemed dirty and the next step would be 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.660
 feathering I'll take a short flat 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.710
 my brush from the new collection of sigma 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.470
 color pay off 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.330
 maximum color returns really 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.150
 very bad brush which is easy 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.210
 work and I neatly along the growth line 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.590
 eyelashes shading a black pencil 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.900
 since the base we have is cream in it 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.500
 pencil shade easily and as per 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.119
 butter 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.930
 exactly for this i advise you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.549
 use cream texture as base 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.860
 By the way, great makeup will work with 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.840
 by others to real this same series of blue 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.090
 perfectly complement the brown eyes and green 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.299
 swampy to lem blue eyes begin to play 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.840
 new color little advice not to display 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.369
 feathering above half a century moving 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.530
 the list will easily sum up the top line 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.630
 eyelash growth is almost the same level as 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.110
 cilia and slightly affect the water 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.869
 line 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.090
 just to make the look filled 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.369
 the next step we take at will 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.159
 sum up the lower lash line 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.350
 but for reference like Hannah's makeup 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.610
 lower eyelid always underlined and 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.219
 thick enough 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.280
 after liner line don't forget i 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.520
 to shade 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.100
 The final third is a product of my mascara 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.560
 falls lash papillon from loreal perfect 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.810
 option for such a make accent 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.420
 only on the outer corner of the eye and 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.730
 surely share and dried up we ended up with 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.360
 eyes and left to arrange small 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.760
 accents 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.340
 from rouge I need freshness today 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.310

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.470

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.989
 smiled Khan's lip is also always very 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.720
 fresh it will not help you to achieve 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.100
