00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
type okay then there's vortex gyro he's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.719

a<00:01:17.640> tech<00:01:18.030> tech<00:01:18.350> ITEC<00:01:19.350> although<00:01:19.740> he<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.250> convert

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
a tech tech ITEC although he can convert

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.539 
a tech tech ITEC although he can convert
to<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.939> stamina<00:01:21.299> type<00:01:21.479> he's<00:01:22.170> got<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.890> spike

in so she's got like a flat kick and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.499 
in so she's got like a flat kick and
then<00:01:32.220> we've<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:33.979> Blizzard<00:01:34.979> hunter<00:01:35.549> thunder

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
then we've got Blizzard hunter thunder

balance<00:02:03.930> tech<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.500> pretty<00:02:04.979> sure<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.770> then

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
balance tech I'm pretty sure and then

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.300 
balance tech I'm pretty sure and then
there's<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:11.009> guy<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:12.090> call<00:02:12.900> wait<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.470> minute<00:02:14.360> on
