bring down the waste generation but they

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.789 
bring down the waste generation but they

is not only polluting our air but most

is not only polluting our air but most
of<00:01:27.010> all<00:01:27.159> is<00:01:27.370> taking<00:01:28.120> the<00:01:29.250> resources<00:01:30.250> away<00:01:30.900> by

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
oppose this beacons narrator they had to

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.200 
oppose this beacons narrator they had to
pay<00:01:50.080> some<00:01:50.530> big<00:01:50.890> amount<00:01:51.189> because<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.880> contract

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
pay some big amount because the contract

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.990 
pay some big amount because the contract
was<00:01:52.330> not<00:01:52.510> done<00:01:52.720> but<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.700> benefits<00:01:54.700> they<00:01:54.790> will

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
was not done but the benefits they will

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.780 
was not done but the benefits they will
gain<00:01:55.210> from<00:01:55.930> better<00:01:56.409> recycling<00:01:57.130> better<00:01:57.369> reuse

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
gain from better recycling better reuse

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.390 
gain from better recycling better reuse
and<00:01:58.000> prevention<00:01:58.540> are<00:01:58.740> much<00:01:59.740> bigger<00:02:00.009> than<00:02:00.189> that

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
and prevention are much bigger than that

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.550 
and prevention are much bigger than that
the<00:02:00.970> energy<00:02:01.150> from<00:02:01.570> burning<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.110> almost

the energy from burning is almost

the energy from burning is almost
nothing<00:02:02.820> that's<00:02:03.820> why<00:02:03.970> installation<00:02:04.479> is<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.600> bad

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
nothing that's why installation is a bad

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.710 
nothing that's why installation is a bad
idea<00:02:04.810> we<00:02:05.710> have<00:02:05.890> already<00:02:06.159> an<00:02:06.700> overcapacity<00:02:07.270> of

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
idea we have already an overcapacity of

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.610 
idea we have already an overcapacity of
waste<00:02:07.930> inspiration<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:09.250> this<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.409> we<00:02:11.409> have<00:02:11.590> to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
waste inspiration so this is we have to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.100 
waste inspiration so this is we have to
learn<00:02:11.829> a<00:02:12.099> lesson<00:02:12.610> from<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.870> we<00:02:13.959> should

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
learn a lesson from this and we should

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.229 
learn a lesson from this and we should
not<00:02:14.290> build<00:02:14.500> any<00:02:14.650> new<00:02:14.950> incineration<00:02:15.489> some

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
not build any new incineration some

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.640 
not build any new incineration some
people<00:02:16.510> argue<00:02:16.629> that<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.019> incineration<00:02:17.409> is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
people argue that the incineration is

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.589 
people argue that the incineration is
getting<00:02:18.010> rid<00:02:18.159> of<00:02:18.189> waste<00:02:18.579> and<00:02:18.909> getting<00:02:19.239> rid<00:02:19.540> of

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
getting rid of waste and getting rid of

getting rid of waste and getting rid of
landfills<00:02:20.760> in<00:02:21.760> fact<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.209> is<00:02:22.360> big<00:02:22.870> lie<00:02:23.050> because

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
landfills in fact it is big lie because

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.290 
landfills in fact it is big lie because
it<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.590> not<00:02:25.740> often<00:02:26.150> thought<00:02:27.150> through<00:02:27.870> that
