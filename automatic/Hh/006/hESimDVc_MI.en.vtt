00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.920 
so that'll all still allow me to see all
my<00:01:20.770> instruments<00:01:21.770> up<00:01:22.130> here<00:01:22.509> without<00:01:23.509> anything

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
my instruments up here without anything

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.800 
my instruments up here without anything
being<00:01:24.229> in<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.530> way<00:01:25.119> if<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:26.240> wanted<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.570> in

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
being in the way if I wanted to in

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.600 
being in the way if I wanted to in
flight<00:01:27.170> I<00:01:28.240> could<00:01:29.240> pull<00:01:29.420> this<00:01:29.450> out<00:01:30.369> move<00:01:31.369> it<00:01:31.490> up

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
flight I could pull this out move it up

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.010 
flight I could pull this out move it up
higher<00:01:31.880> and

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
higher and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.499 
higher and
that's<00:01:33.619> closer<00:01:35.679> it<00:01:36.679> will<00:01:36.920> interfere<00:01:37.219> with<00:01:38.030> my

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
that's closer it will interfere with my

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.929 
that's closer it will interfere with my
ability<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.990> see<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.170> turn<00:01:39.439> coordinator<00:01:39.939> and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
ability to see the turn coordinator and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.249 
ability to see the turn coordinator and
the<00:01:41.270> altimeter<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.860> GPS<00:01:43.159> CDI<00:01:44.049> so<00:01:45.049> that

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
the altimeter and the GPS CDI so that

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.160 
the altimeter and the GPS CDI so that
may<00:01:45.380> not<00:01:45.530> be<00:01:45.610> advisable<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:47.689> then<00:01:47.810> I<00:01:47.899> can<00:01:48.049> live

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
may not be advisable and then I can live

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.310 
may not be advisable and then I can live
it<00:01:48.319> all<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.979> way<00:01:49.069> up<00:01:49.189> here

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.649 

if<00:01:53.830> I<00:01:54.010> really<00:01:54.280> wanted<00:01:54.550> to<00:01:54.730> that's<00:01:55.360> another

anyway that gives you an idea of the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.410 
anyway that gives you an idea of the
adjustment<00:02:15.640> capabilities<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:17.440> you've<00:02:17.620> got

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
adjustment capabilities that you've got

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.540 
adjustment capabilities that you've got
with<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.570> course<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.020> can<00:02:20.200> change<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.310> tilt

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
with this course you can change the tilt

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.100 
with this course you can change the tilt
angle<00:02:22.320> as<00:02:23.320> much<00:02:23.680> as<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.950> want<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.020> will

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
angle as much as you want and that will

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.170 
angle as much as you want and that will
also<00:02:26.290> help<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.739> kind<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.040> keep<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.340> with<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.060> out

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
also help to kind of keep it with it out

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.290 
also help to kind of keep it with it out
of<00:02:28.300> your<00:02:28.360> way<00:02:28.510> down<00:02:28.720> here<00:02:29.850> I've<00:02:30.850> got<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.060> full

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
of your way down here I've got a full

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.400 
of your way down here I've got a full
range<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.630> motion<00:02:31.959> for<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.650> flare

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.340 

so<00:02:37.560> now<00:02:38.560> let's<00:02:38.770> turn<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.870> just<00:02:41.200> see

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
so now let's turn it on and just see

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:54.630 
so now let's turn it on and just see
what<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.590> looks<00:02:41.770> like<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:44.700> GPS<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.350> whether

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:10.090 

you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.160 

you
