00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:11.219
 Hey, people, beauty , welcome, one more. 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.559
 video in this series I show the games that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.260
 I find it more interesting in terms of 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.500
 gameplay graphics is like I always 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.630
 I usually say it's the games that show 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.250
 games that are heavy so it is necessary 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.920
 a slightly more robust device for 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.439
 to run is at last let 's go there 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.690
 The first game of today is this here is the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.100
 Frontline Command is a very heavy game is 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.309
 if you play third person I'll show you 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.610
 for you here the store for you will buy 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.500
 new weapons and such a game to go 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.020
 in World War II and here you 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.379
 choose missions or maps go 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.949
 choose this first option here 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.180
 Here you are, choice is yours. 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.550
 also here the second mission in the first 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.620
 I already went and here is the weapon that you will play 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.369
 Okay, the game takes a while to load. 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.540
 As I said, it 's heavy, but it's normal. 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.960
 Come on, let's start the gameplay. 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.729
 they started to crash from the times it's normal it 's 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:22.979
 as the following here you appear to 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:26.909
 take the enemy for a grenade and here 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.670
 it also looks simple is that it shoots 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.119
 it's not a game that you go out there 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.700
 walking killing everyone is much more 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.950
 bridge click 150 so but it's alright 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.140
 For example, I'm going to eliminate this 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:49.280
 affection're here I'll get mine here 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.280
 ok Itamira the pope here shooting clothes 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.030
 So it's really cool , it's really cool and it has 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.980
 a very good graphic I see there're 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.830
 I talked to the heavy game because it's a 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:04.080
 granada beauty here 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.210
 So it's a great game there. 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.240
 I liked the caramba, only problem is that 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.010
 the game needs a robust phone 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.570
 to run so it will not run in 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.610
 most appliances because it is well 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.490
 heavy but so if you have a device 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.490
 It is nice and runs games heavy games 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.730
 I recommend this game that simulates war so 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:28.050
 It's really cool, and here's another great one. 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.300
 game for you will the next game the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.210
 Next game is the zombie 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.950
 I really liked this game. 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.190
 Why did you remind me a little, right? 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.830
 totally equal or whatever it is reminds me 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.250
 the resident evil given when playing at 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.950
 playstation 1 and this is pretty cool from yen 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:53.100
 young third person that story is 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:55.140
 always the same, the zombie i ve e tauÃ¡ that 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.310
 you assume the character of a little face and 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.430
 also in the middle of the match you can 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.260
 exchange for a woman is also possible 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.600
 buy weapons and everything 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:09.030
 and it's very interesting to show you 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.459
 here the zombie the beauty gac charged that the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.320
 zombie here we go 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:18.150
 the law can see very cool 3d graphic 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.580
 when you start the match game 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.610
 there is a scheme for you to win one of the 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.800
 awards and such 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:32.830
 Let's go there and nothing. 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.660
 I got it, okay, here 's your money. 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.300
 It is with this money you can buy new 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.070
 items in the game weapons and equipment 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.170
 When are you going to kill a zombie if you 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.710
 win is more money to buy 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.750
 these new items here you control 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.170
 The character in here is a shot and that's what 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.850
 carries 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.420
 If I come here I can change 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.390
 character can get the woman I're 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.850
 I liked and if there was any gameplay 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.459
 ac third person with the camera on top 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.209
 It's really nice here, a plan for you. 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:10.560
 win the prizes 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:15.430
 here you can come buy the gun ak 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:18.040
 shopping in various weapons is interesting 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.560
 come back 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.620
 and here you choose the mission you want 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.240
 play here a random mission only 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:33.250
 then test the scenario well 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:37.720
 cool apocalyptic , even the zombie is good 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.250
 are coming to the hordes also block 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.010
 that this 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.950
 the entries that build a wall and 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.260
 protection while you kill is well 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.550
 complicated but it's okay to do when 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:54.550
 finished your ammo you go on the knife 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.470
 so year can not get ammunition in 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:01.660
 half of the match let 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:07.419
 business to be more secure than the 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.919
 area in which or in the east and northeast to 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.680
 in July when we have to read a 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.260
 book that explodes in the most 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.720
 in which position you are not well 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.580
 cool I recommend this game I'm talking 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.919
 a little more and I talked more about him because he is 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.210
 One that I liked, and I recommend it. 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.330
 There the zombie 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.210
 the water here we go next game the next 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.050
 game is mib's game I never imagined that 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.890
 they would make a game for android is 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.270
 sensational is mainly for those who 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:39.400
 likes the film or the three films is I 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.419

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.419
 do the missions 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:49.240
 to kill monsters is to develop here 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.970
 new items can buy car for you 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.920
 and do the missions if you can build 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.960
 things new inside the headquarters is 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.910
 seeing the places that have nothing to 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.250
 can build new technologies and such 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.140
 I found it sensational 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.840
 You have your money too. 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.030

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.590
 what to do here is the frank who says that 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.200
 Gotta do it so we'd sleep. 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.630
 there was an invasion a beauty salon 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.030
 I do not know where the scene is at its best. 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.920
 you prepare to choose a salon 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.310
 of beauty in flames did not happen 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.950
 thing there probably some alien 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.930
 what's up with the terror there they have here is 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:45.280
 take a look then we'll find a 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:48.610

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.230
 Business analysis is a graph're well

 game and three days sim on super graphics 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.880
 I think it's cool and graphic. 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:28.699
 fun and I recommend everyone is 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.590
 so this was the last game of today not 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:34.010
 They want to wrap up a lot to stay with us. 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:36.949
 very big but I'll leave the link 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.630
 download of each game is the last one 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.880
 game it is not so heavy so it goes 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.370
 and run on most devices 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.750
 the first two games are a bit 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.340
 heavier then you will need a 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:50.080
 device a little stronger but anyway 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.530
 There are three great games for 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:58.690
 android 

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:58.690
 ok a big hug to all and thanks
