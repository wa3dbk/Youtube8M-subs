 good kids and beautiful guaporé traigo 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.730
 a new online gta 5 video of the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.379
 series of hidden secret vehicles and 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.970
 strangers and today I bring you new five 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.290
 vehicles remember that you will have the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.969
 previous episode in the description and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.349
 One thing I wanted to say is that good 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.450
 some of the cars that come out in this 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.340
 series appear at a certain time of day or 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.750
 when we passed a certain level as 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.400
 Today's first vehicle I bring you a 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.080
 piece of military truck that we can 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.300
 find then in this area of ​​just 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.490
 above the map on the side of the store 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.779
 of weapons and good ammunition simply 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.550
 we have to look to the side and here what 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.599
 we will find and good is a vehicle 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.669
 pretty good because we can 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.950
 transport a lot of people I think that 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.079
 If I'm not mistaken, I can fit two forward and 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.550
 eight back adding a total of we could 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.079
 carry up to ten people so good 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.850
 it's pretty good and it's also a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.829
 pretty hard vehicle that we can not 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.539
 ravage the only point on the road 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.010
 weak that you have to c4 be destroyed 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.930
 so be very careful with that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.070
 as second vehicle today I bring you 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.780
 the quad of the beach watchmen 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.340
 that we can find it in this 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.440
 zone that I'm marking from the map that 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.550
 basically in the coastal area and good 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.289
 It is a pretty nice vehicle and 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.270
 fun that will let us keep it in the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.100
 garage without any problem and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.719
 well one thing I had to say is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.220
 that this vehicle can be found 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.500
 About the hour 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.300
 by day when we see that there are people with 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.730
 the umbrella and such on the beach 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.770
 surely it will be more or less 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.690
 noon because we can find no 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.370
 no problem and well I do not know if also 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.590
 has some level requirement and I 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.570
 I found at level 58 I leave it as data 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.150
 because our insurance if you see that you go 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.410
 there at noon and you see that there are people in 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.030
 the beach and everything if you do not find the 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.220
 vehicle will be because you need 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.660
 certain level is worth as third vehicle 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.190
 today I bring you an excavator that the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.780
 it's true that he's pretty handsome for another 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.130
 lear and to burst people and 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.840
 vehicles and good is found 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.070
 exactly in this location too 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.600
 have another place where we can 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.920
 find it but good as the fourth 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.500
 vehicle we can also find it 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.940
 here I teach you this and good 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.920
 truth is that we can keep it in the 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.140
 garage with the trick that I show you before 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.580
 of yesterday in theory it will leave us worth 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.740
 but if that is the trick yes you can 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.170
 save and one is pretty fun already 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.670
 how good we can move the shovel towards 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.710
 up and down and we can lift 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.479
 vehicles lift people from everything like this 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.979
 that is pretty cool and one the fourth 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.479
 we have it right here at 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.850
 side as I told you is a piece of 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.680
 truck works that none is more 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.989
 even harder than a tank and 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.330
 we can literally step on cars 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.500
 bursting everything is a real software 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.540
 I love going out there trampling 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.610
 people and stepping cars so good 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.110
 it's a good vehicle and this one I think 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.420
 that you can not keep it in the garage anymore 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.370
 which is quite large and is that what 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.900
 you can not even approach the door so 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.220
 nothing can be a good vehicle like 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.020
 fifth and last vehicle today 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.700
 I bring a pretty good and unique car 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.560
 it's about the merriweather vehicle 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.870
 good the only way to get it 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.790
 is the next one we do not have to take out the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.680
 mobile call merriweather and send a 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.150
 mercenary to someone not if it can be that 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.040
 be near our self for example then 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.960
 with my colleague you see him here with his 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.280
 consent of course and the only 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.870
 what do we have to do then is that call 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.550
 send him a mercenary and you'll see how 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.310
 will appear the car of this not that it is a 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.500
 4x4 yes big enough and is unique not 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.610
 you can only get it this way 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.560
 you just have to kill those in 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.030
 emery weather you can take the car and 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.040
 take it to your garage will leave us 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.780
 save it to save it completely without 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.280
 no problem and good is enough 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.110
 good either by road or by 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.750
 mountain if we put him we can put him 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.830
 the wheels that we want we can 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.720
 tune in a way the truth quite 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.860
 special and pretty cool so nothing 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.390
 kids, these are all 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.830
 vehicles that I bring you in the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.880
 today I hope you liked it and we 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.880
