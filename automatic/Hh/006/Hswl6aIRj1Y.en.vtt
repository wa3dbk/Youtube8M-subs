so<00:00:01.589> here<00:00:01.980> we<00:00:02.100> are<00:00:03.710> placing<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.950> head<00:00:05.100> gasket

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
so here we are placing the head gasket

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.879 
so here we are placing the head gasket
on<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.880> 88<00:00:06.180> mr2<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:07.730> the<00:00:09.469> crankshaft<00:00:10.469> pulley

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
on a 88 mr2 and the crankshaft pulley

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.999 
on a 88 mr2 and the crankshaft pulley
needs<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.339> come<00:00:11.519> off<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.659> I<00:00:13.259> do<00:00:13.379> not<00:00:13.619> have<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
needs to come off and I do not have the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.570 
needs to come off and I do not have the
special<00:00:14.190> service<00:00:14.730> tool<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.509> pull<00:00:15.989> it<00:00:16.110> off<00:00:16.580> will

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
special service tool to pull it off will

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.100 
special service tool to pull it off will
do<00:00:17.700> hold<00:00:17.910> steady<00:00:18.240> while<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.600> turn<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.930> bolt

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
do hold steady while you turn the bolt

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.380 
do hold steady while you turn the bolt
so<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.460> have<00:00:20.670> come<00:00:20.850> up<00:00:20.880> with<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.150> workaround<00:00:23.390> you

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
so we have come up with a workaround you

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.160 
so we have come up with a workaround you
can<00:00:24.630> see<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:27.830> that<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.100> 13<00:00:29.760> dollars<00:00:30.240> worth<00:00:30.900> of

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
can see this that is 13 dollars worth of

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.610 
can see this that is 13 dollars worth of

breaker bar on the crankshaft pulley and

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:41.329 
breaker bar on the crankshaft pulley and
it<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.659> wedged<00:00:39.960> against<00:00:40.199> the<00:00:40.319> ground<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.069> I'm

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
it is wedged against the ground and I'm

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.180

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
gonna go ahead and turn the key and if

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.549 
gonna go ahead and turn the key and if
we're<00:00:44.370> lucky<00:00:44.489> we<00:00:45.359> will<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:46.050> break<00:00:46.229> anything

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
we're lucky we will not break anything
