 the most anticipated picture is back 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.660
 by Corinthians fans that the frame 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.140
 inside the work where you lead 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.360
 Corinthians to the inside of our house to 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.040
 to monitor the development of the 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.910
 our arena 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.320
 we are here at the close of the lawn 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.880
 provisional subject 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.590
 now what catches the eye are those 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:46.840
 workers look at the detail they stand 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.310
 practically hung 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.310
 close to artur 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.059
 look how cool that sensational detail 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.539
 it's really work 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.609
 very interesting that the worker has 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.570
 that being very brave is not afraid of 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.570
 store height 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.650
 the detail for you 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.360
 You can realize this video is that 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.160
 the cover member has already 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.840
 extending 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:41.979
 in the back part of the goal in the match 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.100
 leaving from the east and 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.420
 consequently it will connect the western part 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.320
 for this video we can also see the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.350
 reflectors 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.789
 some people were some doubt 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.979
 It has been reflected in the northern part and 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.189
 part I feel that this video can 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.960
 to perceive the reflectors being placed 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.960
 also back then look there 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.390

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:20.690
 and here in part 1 only has a tower for 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.690
 be removed from the others have already 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.150
 the hours continue the part of the glasses 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.739
 there where it's going to be 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.739
 the restaurant 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.770
 we can see the afternoon in cabins 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.750

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:54.490
 also the other glass and the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:57.010
 in the northern part continued 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.510
 being built we have some 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.230
 workers 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.290

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:30.219
 the stadium starts here 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:33.540
 in the middle of the field we can also analyze 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:37.920
 if there are two more rows there the fire 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.920
 soon it will be complex 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.530
 and here 20 and the legal notion 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.490

 interesting the emotion in the towers a 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.860
 some of it was disassembled 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.870
 and consequently 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.810
 removed between the spans beyond the 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.020
 module truss looks what detail 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.020

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.300
 ask there passes exactly 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.790
 this one always does exactly module 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.750
 after the withdrawal is following a 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.750
