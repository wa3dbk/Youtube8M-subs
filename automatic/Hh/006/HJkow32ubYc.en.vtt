00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
would be our triceps goes up the back of

straight in the golf swing all the time
it's<00:00:46.469> mainly<00:00:46.829> our<00:00:47.160> triceps<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.090> working

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
it's mainly our triceps that's working

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.650 
it's mainly our triceps that's working
don't<00:00:48.870> use<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> lot<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.559> bicep<00:00:50.340> muscle<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
don't use a lot of bicep muscle in the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
don't use a lot of bicep muscle in the
gosling<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:52.530> bend<00:00:52.890> our<00:00:53.160> arms<00:00:53.579> much<00:00:53.910> in

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
gosling we don't bend our arms much in

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.420 
gosling we don't bend our arms much in
there<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:55.320> good<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.739> them<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.010> taught

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
there it's good for them to be taught

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.610 
there it's good for them to be taught
but<00:00:57.090> they<00:00:57.239> don't<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.899> exceptionally

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
but they don't have to be exceptionally

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.160 
but they don't have to be exceptionally
strong<00:00:58.920> next<00:00:59.879> would<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.180> our<00:01:00.420> rotor<00:01:00.780> cups

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
strong next would be our rotor cups

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.349 
strong next would be our rotor cups
across<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.859> top<00:01:02.070> first<00:01:02.370> shoulders<00:01:02.910> there's

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
across the top first shoulders there's

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.390 
across the top first shoulders there's
actually<00:01:03.840> been<00:01:03.989> some<00:01:04.049> studies<00:01:04.559> done<00:01:04.739> at<00:01:05.159> Tour

players<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:06.150> much<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.600> 10<00:01:06.869> times<00:01:07.110> stronger<00:01:07.560> in

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
players as much as 10 times stronger in

the rotor cups as as the average golfer
average<00:01:12.299> player<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:13.560> work<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:14.010> those<00:01:14.220> but

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
average player is they work on those but

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.240 
average player is they work on those but
basically<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.420> need<00:01:15.689> those<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:17.070> we

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
basically we need those because when we

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.609 
basically we need those because when we
swing<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.030> turn<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:18.930> some<00:01:19.409> terrific

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
swing and we turn we have some terrific

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
swing and we turn we have some terrific
ofourse<00:01:20.189> well<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.580> centrifugal<00:01:21.150> force<00:01:21.540> is

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
ofourse well that centrifugal force is

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.109 
ofourse well that centrifugal force is
trying<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.140> pull<00:01:22.799> our<00:01:23.070> arms<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.729> away<00:01:24.090> from

trying to pull our arms out away from
our<00:01:24.540> body<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.950> strong<00:01:26.340> enough<00:01:26.700> in

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
our body we have to be strong enough in

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.120 
our body we have to be strong enough in
our<00:01:27.030> upper<00:01:27.450> body<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.380> able<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.680> keep<00:01:28.890> our

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
our upper body to be able to keep our

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.179 
our upper body to be able to keep our
arms<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.729> close<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.509> our<00:01:30.540> body<00:01:30.869> here<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.860> rotor

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
arms in close to our body here so rotor

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.399 
arms in close to our body here so rotor
cuffs<00:01:32.549> become<00:01:32.970> very<00:01:33.240> important<00:01:33.720> next

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
cuffs become very important next

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.060 
cuffs become very important next
naturally<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.119> lower<00:01:36.390> back<00:01:36.869> area<00:01:37.070> where

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
naturally is the lower back area where

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.090 
naturally is the lower back area where
we<00:01:38.340> bend<00:01:38.729> at<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> hip<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.659> set<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.170> actually

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
we bend at the hip and set out actually

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.910 
we bend at the hip and set out actually
that's<00:01:41.310> very<00:01:41.840> connected<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.350> our<00:01:43.380> glutes

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that's very connected with our glutes

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
that's very connected with our glutes
our<00:01:44.280> glutes<00:01:44.610> are<00:01:44.909> said<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.479> one<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
our glutes are said to be one of the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.929 
our glutes are said to be one of the
most<00:01:45.990> important<00:01:46.560> parts<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.950> our<00:01:47.490> golf<00:01:47.759> swing

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
most important parts of our golf swing

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.389 
most important parts of our golf swing
because<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.540> what's<00:01:48.810> able<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> held<00:01:49.799> us<00:01:50.100> in

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
because it's what's able to held us in

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.840 
because it's what's able to held us in
our<00:01:51.210> spine<00:01:51.689> angle<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.280> my<00:01:53.460> spine

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
our spine angle so you can see my spine

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.830 
our spine angle so you can see my spine
is<00:01:54.060> tilted<00:01:54.950> forward<00:01:55.950> at<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.490> waist<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> need

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
is tilted forward at the waist so I need

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.130 
is tilted forward at the waist so I need
to<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.110> able<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.469> hold<00:01:59.090> that<00:02:00.090> spine<00:02:00.630> angle

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
to be able to hold that spine angle

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.410 
to be able to hold that spine angle
there<00:02:01.409> if<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.219> very<00:02:02.490> weak<00:02:02.790> glutes<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
there if I have very weak glutes the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.109 
there if I have very weak glutes the
tendency<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.290> as<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.860> commend<00:02:05.369> us<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.700> move<00:02:05.880> in

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
tendency is as I commend us to move in

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.350 
tendency is as I commend us to move in
under<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.590> way<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.759> glutes<00:02:09.060> don't

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
under it this way then the glutes don't

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.900 
under it this way then the glutes don't
hold<00:02:09.569> me<00:02:09.750> up<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.170> lose<00:02:10.470> my<00:02:10.830> spine<00:02:11.220> angle<00:02:11.459> and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
hold me up and I lose my spine angle and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
hold me up and I lose my spine angle and
lose<00:02:12.599> my<00:02:12.900> contacts

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
lose my contacts

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.229 
lose my contacts
my<00:02:14.260> glutes<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.950> lower<00:02:15.459> body<00:02:15.790> right<00:02:16.209> here

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
my glutes and lower body right here

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.130 
my glutes and lower body right here
become<00:02:16.720> very<00:02:17.019> important<00:02:17.560> next<00:02:18.310> would<00:02:18.459> be<00:02:18.640> our

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
become very important next would be our

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.440 
become very important next would be our
thighs<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.680> our<00:02:21.060> our<00:02:23.340> hamstrings<00:02:24.450> hamstrings

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
thighs and our our hamstrings hamstrings

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.940 
thighs and our our hamstrings hamstrings
become<00:02:25.900> very<00:02:26.170> important

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
become very important

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.890 
become very important
not<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.670> there's<00:02:27.879> they<00:02:28.180> need<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.540> be<00:02:28.689> so

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
not that there's they need to be so

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.539 
not that there's they need to be so
incredibly<00:02:29.049> strong<00:02:29.680> they<00:02:29.980> need<00:02:30.159> to<00:02:30.220> be<00:02:30.340> very

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
incredibly strong they need to be very

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.849 
incredibly strong they need to be very
flexible<00:02:30.819> if<00:02:31.750> my<00:02:31.959> hand<00:02:32.260> strings<00:02:32.680> are

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
flexible if my hand strings are

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.330 
flexible if my hand strings are
inflexible<00:02:33.370> then<00:02:34.209> I<00:02:34.480> have<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.079> lose<00:02:35.470> my<00:02:35.739> ability

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
inflexible then I have I lose my ability

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.429 
inflexible then I have I lose my ability
to<00:02:36.370> turn<00:02:36.790> very<00:02:37.090> well<00:02:37.239> because<00:02:37.780> they<00:02:37.930> tighten

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
to turn very well because they tighten

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.559 
to turn very well because they tighten
up<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.769> they'll<00:02:39.370> grab<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.090> then<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.359> don't

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
up and they'll grab and then I don't

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.190 
up and they'll grab and then I don't
turn<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.230> that's<00:02:41.409> my<00:02:41.590> my<00:02:42.359> my<00:02:43.359> hamstrings

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
turn so that's my my my hamstrings

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.379 
turn so that's my my my hamstrings
become<00:02:44.709> more<00:02:44.950> flexible<00:02:45.519> my<00:02:45.760> glutes<00:02:46.090> get

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
become more flexible my glutes get

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.680 
become more flexible my glutes get
stronger<00:02:46.840> I'm<00:02:47.370> more<00:02:48.370> able<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.940> make<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.329> full

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
stronger I'm more able to make a full

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.710 
stronger I'm more able to make a full
body<00:02:50.019> turn<00:02:50.379> holding<00:02:51.370> my<00:02:51.639> knee<00:02:51.849> position<00:02:52.540> in

the Gosling versus let it out third our

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.009 
the Gosling versus let it out third our
next<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.799> would<00:02:56.859> guess<00:02:57.220> as<00:02:57.489> we<00:02:57.819> work<00:02:58.030> down<00:02:58.299> would

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
next I would guess as we work down would

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.710 
next I would guess as we work down would
be<00:02:59.049> our<00:02:59.349> calves<00:02:59.760> calves<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.120> lot<00:03:01.389> to<00:03:01.569> do

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
be our calves calves have a lot to do

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.679 
be our calves calves have a lot to do
with<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.049> pushing<00:03:02.650> motion<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:04.030> legs<00:03:04.299> just

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
with the pushing motion of the legs just

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.559 
with the pushing motion of the legs just
like<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.900> pitcher<00:03:05.439> would<00:03:05.680> throw<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.970> push<00:03:07.269> off

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
like a pitcher would throw and push off

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.309 
like a pitcher would throw and push off
in<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:09.040> in<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.549> guy<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:10.000> downswing<00:03:10.629> portion

in in in a guy in the downswing portion

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.520 
in in in a guy in the downswing portion
