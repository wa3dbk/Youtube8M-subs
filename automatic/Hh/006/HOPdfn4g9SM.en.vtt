00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.190
 the first images of the 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.350
 flight to h 50 17 from air algerie that 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.750
 disappeared to the radar and then it was confirmed 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.660
 that had crashed in the east of 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.660
 mali yesterday July 24, 2014 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.810
 last night the authorities 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.329
 They said they had found the place 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.870
 where the plane had impacted but that 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.720
 this one was disintegrated the same 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.280
 statement said that because of the location and 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.280
 the security problems in the region 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.690
 it was unlikely that medical help 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.420
 arrive at the place during the day 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:54.460
 among the passengers were 50 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:57.399
 French 24 Burkinese 8 Lebanese six 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.640
 Algerian Five Canadians Four 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:04.210
 German two Luxembourgers as well as a 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:08.520
 mali cameroonian belgian ukrainian romanian 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.520
 Swiss Nigerian and an Egyptian 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.799
 on July 17, 2014 the plane m 17 of 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.070
 malaysia airlines was shot down with 298 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.860
 people on board today eight days later 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.020
 has not yet found a responsible and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.820
 the family of this flight are still 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.400
 have an explanation 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.890
 for a change it 's an old news for 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.620
 the means for which will be another news 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.400
 that will remain in the mystery 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.450
 also 139 days have passed since the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.380
 flight m 370 from malaysia airlines 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.380
 disappeared without any explanation 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.780
 then we pose the question 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.640
 if it is normal that in our times the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.460
 planes are lost and nobody gets 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.680
 responsible for demolishing airplanes without 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.110
 find a culprit and that the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.460
 airlines and authorities work 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.460
 please so that nobody does anything 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.130
 I leave you with this so that we are not 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.250
 forget that the only ones we can demand 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.670
 answer is us if we 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.560
 we sleep governments companies and so on 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.870
 they will continue acting as if nothing and the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.870
 we will always be affected
