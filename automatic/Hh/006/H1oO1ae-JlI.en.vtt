00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.019
 Welcome to the machine use guide 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:08.019
 for large format sheets 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.850
 unpacking the machine 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.530
 we have the paper cutter 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.230
 press lever 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.670
 The main body of the machine 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.710
 the machine components here 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.520
 we have the main lever for the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.520
 charlotte press 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.040
 well included together with the machine a 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.300
 circular cutter of 40 centimeters 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.300
 adjustable diameter 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.140
 includes spare knives 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.960
 and the main body of the morning 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.860
 now we will install the main lever 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.399
 we will screw this lever to 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.399
 Main body of the machine 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.130
 we must make sure that the lever is 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.440
 completely firm to the main body 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.920
 to be able to exert pressure in a 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.920
 correct 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.130
 the whale has a rotating mold 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.610
 there we will put part 1 and 2 of the body 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.610
 of the sheets 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.270
 the mole of israel I get some rings 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.350
 special for different types of bases 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.350
 for sheet metal 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.710
 we can remove or add the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.710
 grams backgrounds 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.240
 now as an example we will make a relationship 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.530
 first we print on the image of 18 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.530
 centimeters of the boat 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.400
 is in its center has a brand 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.400
 inviting the center of the image 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.069
 we adjust the diameter according to the image 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.379
 with the circular cutter we cut the 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.000
 image stepping on the center of the cutter 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.390
 created with the brand that contains the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.390
 figures 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.250
 we add the arm 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.450
 and we start cutting in the direction of the edge 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.450
 of the knife that is in it 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.760
 we return we want a figure 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.760
 perfectly round 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.390
 now we put the pieces of the sheet 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.390
 clock in the first mold of the machine 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.050
 we start by placing the stage to which 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.120
 We previously made a 0.8 hole 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.840
 centimeters in the center to put the 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.840
 watch piece 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.100
 or in the image 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.979
 we must always watch to be 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.930
 the protective mica 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.280
 we turn the base of the mass of miami 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.790
 and we apply with the press in a way 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.230
 this will make the first part of the 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.010
 sheet has in just waiting for the 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.010
 second part 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.340
 for this start plate model 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.340
 powdered 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.090
 and we add the plastic base of such 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.090
 way that is asked up 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.229
 and we go mold the machine 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.919
 and we apply pressures 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.210
 As we will see, the machine has put together 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.139
 two parts of the clock remaining 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.139
 perfectly united 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.140
 you can perform these and other 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.590
 large veneers consult your
