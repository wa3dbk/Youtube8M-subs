sometimes<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.960> lot<00:02:39.080> of<00:02:39.200> times<00:02:39.320> actually<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:39.860> do

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
sometimes a lot of times actually you do

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.950

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
execute so that's kind of what makes

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.970 
execute so that's kind of what makes
some<00:02:44.060> players<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.720> know<00:02:44.870> better<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.680> be<00:02:45.860> able

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
to get more gameplays and other

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.090 
to get more gameplays and other
youtubers<00:02:48.020> because<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.740> know<00:02:48.830> they<00:02:48.980> just

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
youtubers because you know they just

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.070 
youtubers because you know they just
have<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.490> ability<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.910> execute<00:02:50.360> more<00:02:50.720> often

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
have the ability to execute more often

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.660 
have the ability to execute more often
in<00:02:51.230> these<00:02:51.320> lobbies<00:02:51.800> I<00:02:51.980> mean<00:02:52.340> sure<00:02:52.520> they

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
in these lobbies I mean sure they

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.070 
in these lobbies I mean sure they
probably<00:02:52.880> get<00:02:53.120> more<00:02:53.270> lobbies<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.720> more

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
probably get more lobbies and more

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080 
probably get more lobbies and more
chances<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.890> can<00:02:55.100> go<00:02:55.250> into<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.670> equation

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
on this gameplay I do call my dogs and

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.740 
on this gameplay I do call my dogs and
swarm<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.130> at<00:03:28.250> separate<00:03:28.580> times<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:29.120> know<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.600> lot

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
same time I just really think that makes

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.780 
same time I just really think that makes
them<00:03:33.500> compete<00:03:33.950> for<00:03:34.130> kills<00:03:34.340> that's<00:03:34.550> not<00:03:34.700> the

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
them compete for kills that's not the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.150 
them compete for kills that's not the
best<00:03:34.970> way<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.240> go<00:03:35.390> in<00:03:35.540> my<00:03:35.660> opinion<00:03:35.960> but<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.560> few

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
best way to go in my opinion but a few

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.830 
best way to go in my opinion but a few
tips<00:03:37.400> for<00:03:37.670> playing<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.000> map<00:03:38.150> arrayed<00:03:38.390> is

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
stress because there's something that

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.480 
stress because there's something that
really<00:03:41.870> goes<00:03:42.110> well<00:03:42.350> for<00:03:42.560> me<00:03:42.680> when<00:03:42.830> when<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:43.280> play

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
all spawning right now just because it's

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.920

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
know you guys see me play the obj quite

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.150 
know you guys see me play the obj quite
a<00:04:35.930> bit<00:04:36.169> in<00:04:36.199> this<00:04:36.350> gameplay<00:04:36.560> which<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:36.979> think

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
a bit in this gameplay which I think

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.010 
a bit in this gameplay which I think
makes<00:04:37.310> it<00:04:37.460> extremely<00:04:37.699> entertaining<00:04:38.090> because

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
makes it extremely entertaining because

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.170 
makes it extremely entertaining because
a<00:04:39.229> lot<00:04:39.500> of<00:04:39.530> games<00:04:39.830> are<00:04:40.039> you<00:04:40.250> expecting<00:04:41.060> that

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
a lot of games are you expecting that

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.760 
a lot of games are you expecting that
flawless<00:04:41.479> game<00:04:41.810> me<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.199> pretty<00:04:42.380> much<00:04:42.500> never

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
flawless game me to pretty much never

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.890 
flawless game me to pretty much never
even<00:04:43.009> look<00:04:43.220> at<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.370> flag<00:04:43.669> to<00:04:43.880> touch<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.090> flag<00:04:44.419> but

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
even look at a flag to touch a flag but

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.390 
even look at a flag to touch a flag but
I<00:04:44.960> think<00:04:45.110> it<00:04:45.199> get<00:04:45.320> about<00:04:45.470> six<00:04:45.800> flag<00:04:46.100> capture

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
I think it get about six flag capture

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.460 
I think it get about six flag capture
this<00:04:46.669> in<00:04:46.820> this<00:04:46.940> game<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:47.389> can't<00:04:47.960> be<00:04:48.139> literally

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
this in this game I can't be literally

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.779 
this in this game I can't be literally
like<00:04:48.590> two<00:04:48.889> or<00:04:49.039> three<00:04:49.070> times<00:04:49.400> you<00:04:49.699> guys

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
like two or three times you guys

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.760 
like two or three times you guys
probably<00:04:50.090> seen<00:04:50.360> and<00:04:50.600> that's<00:04:51.410> something<00:04:51.590> I

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
probably seen and that's something I

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.020 
probably seen and that's something I
think<00:04:51.979> that<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.190> makes<00:04:52.340> this<00:04:52.460> game<00:04:52.639> play<00:04:52.850> so

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
think that it makes this game play so

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.820 
think that it makes this game play so
much<00:04:53.180> better<00:04:53.419> as<00:04:53.660> you<00:04:54.110> know<00:04:54.229> how<00:04:54.500> much<00:04:54.650> I

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
much better as you know how much I

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.070 
much better as you know how much I
played<00:04:55.039> the<00:04:55.220> flag<00:04:55.630> but<00:04:56.630> this<00:04:56.780> is<00:04:56.930> probably

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
played the flag but this is probably

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.050 
played the flag but this is probably
hands<00:04:57.440> down<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:58.009> smartest<00:04:58.490> game<00:04:58.699> of<00:04:58.880> call<00:04:59.030> of

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
hands down the smartest game of call of

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.270 
hands down the smartest game of call of
duty<00:04:59.419> I've<00:04:59.509> ever<00:04:59.660> played<00:04:59.900> because<00:05:00.259> you<00:05:01.130> know<00:05:01.250> I

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.909 
second half and the game actually ended
like<00:05:32.449> two<00:05:32.659> and<00:05:32.780> a<00:05:32.810> half<00:05:32.930> minutes<00:05:33.169> early<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.650> I

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
like two and a half minutes early and I

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.860 
like two and a half minutes early and I
ended<00:05:34.159> with<00:05:34.310> a<00:05:34.340> dog<00:05:34.639> in<00:05:34.820> a<00:05:34.880> swarm<00:05:35.150> my<00:05:35.270> pocket<00:05:35.720> so

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
ended with a dog in a swarm my pocket so

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.839 
ended with a dog in a swarm my pocket so
maybe<00:05:36.110> I<00:05:36.229> could<00:05:36.409> have<00:05:36.470> ended<00:05:36.620> like<00:05:36.860> 170<00:05:37.669> though

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
maybe I could have ended like 170 though

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.420 
maybe I could have ended like 170 though
118<00:05:38.419> though<00:05:38.570> but<00:05:39.139> I'll<00:05:39.199> take<00:05:39.349> 145<00:05:40.039> and<00:05:40.220> now<00:05:40.310> I'm

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
118 though but I'll take 145 and now I'm

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.370 
118 though but I'll take 145 and now I'm
