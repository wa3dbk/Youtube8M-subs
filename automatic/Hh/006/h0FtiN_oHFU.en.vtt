00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.700
 In 1993, shortly after the decay of the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.690
 Soviet Union I visited for the first time 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.690
 Ukraine 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.520
 I wanted something about mine 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.980
 to find out Russian Orthodox names 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:32.550
 but also the legendary plaster cave 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:35.870
 explore tips caves are one 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.879
 rare and often very big 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.540
 those in western ukraine belong to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.540
 the biggest 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.100
 in the second largest of the 127 kilometers 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.089
 long so-called cave I made one 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.089
 surprising discovery 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.290
 There were remains of a cooking digging trenches 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.060
 were dug 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.930
 tables and benches made of earth 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.560
 Shaped I realized that the whole thing already 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.390
 A certain age we wanted one 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.030
 bit in the earth and came up 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.720
 drug cans and buttons many 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.399
 buttons remnants of leather shoes 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.909

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:38.800

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.800
 what had he lost in the cave? 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.710
 Behind these things hid themselves 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.400
 human fates I necessarily 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:57.350

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.780
