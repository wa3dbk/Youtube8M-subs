okay<00:00:06.490> so<00:00:06.910> we're<00:00:07.060> going<00:00:07.180> to<00:00:07.240> demo<00:00:07.420> the<00:00:07.870> s107<00:00:08.590> RC

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
okay so we're going to demo the s107 RC

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.600 
okay so we're going to demo the s107 RC
helicopter<00:00:09.700> and<00:00:09.910> be<00:00:10.360> connect<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.980> I'm<00:00:12.309> going

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
helicopter and be connect so I'm going

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.750 
helicopter and be connect so I'm going
to<00:00:12.700> get<00:00:12.820> started<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:14.139> student<00:00:14.530> position

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
to get started the student position

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.630 
to get started the student position
alright<00:00:15.760> so<00:00:16.090> we're<00:00:16.240> going<00:00:16.360> to<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:18.400> first

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
alright so we're going to the first

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.060 
alright so we're going to the first
interlock<00:00:22.080> second<00:00:23.080> interlock<00:00:23.560> now<00:00:23.800> it's

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
interlock second interlock now it's

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.340 
interlock second interlock now it's
ready<00:00:24.430> to<00:00:24.460> fly<00:00:24.790> so<00:00:25.210> I<00:00:25.240> raised<00:00:25.780> my<00:00:25.990> arms<00:00:26.230> up

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
ready to fly so I raised my arms up

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:34.380 
ready to fly so I raised my arms up
slowly<00:00:28.980> my<00:00:29.980> left<00:00:30.220> hand<00:00:30.490> is<00:00:30.670> the<00:00:30.789> throttle<00:00:33.390> term

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
slowly my left hand is the throttle term

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.860 
slowly my left hand is the throttle term
I<00:00:34.719> knew<00:00:34.960> this<00:00:35.140> motion<00:00:35.649> let's<00:00:35.860> turn<00:00:36.190> right<00:00:36.870> or

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
I knew this motion let's turn right or

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.430 
I knew this motion let's turn right or
left

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
left

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.790 
left
and<00:00:38.589> then<00:00:38.769> forward<00:00:39.280> back<00:00:39.640> will<00:00:39.940> be<00:00:40.089> like<00:00:40.300> this

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and then forward back will be like this

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:53.120 
and then forward back will be like this
let's<00:00:40.920> go<00:00:41.070> show<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:45.120> hover

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:22.330 

going<00:00:53.430> forward<00:00:54.410> every<00:00:55.410> morning

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:34.350 

sir

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:53.800 

back

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.170 

and<00:01:54.810> we're<00:01:55.380> done<00:01:56.450> all<00:01:57.450> right<00:01:58.580> okay<00:01:59.580> so<00:01:59.790> what<00:02:00.090> I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
and we're done all right okay so what I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.150 
and we're done all right okay so what I
want<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:00.480> now<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.660> just<00:02:01.050> kind<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.320> give<00:02:02.070> you

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
want to do now is just kind of give you

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.140 
want to do now is just kind of give you
a<00:02:02.220> general<00:02:02.640> idea<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.970> what<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.690> did<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:03.990> suppose

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
a general idea of what I did I suppose

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.270 
a general idea of what I did I suppose
the<00:02:06.150> last<00:02:06.300> video<00:02:06.750> was<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.560> demonstration<00:02:07.830> of

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
the last video was the demonstration of

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.520 
the last video was the demonstration of
me<00:02:08.400> flying<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.880> helicopter<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:10.380> wasn't

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
me flying the helicopter and that wasn't

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.790 
me flying the helicopter and that wasn't
the<00:02:10.680> greatest<00:02:11.010> video<00:02:11.160> ever<00:02:11.490> but<00:02:11.820> it<00:02:12.420> works<00:02:12.800> so

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the greatest video ever but it works so

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.690 
the greatest video ever but it works so
to<00:02:14.280> get<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.580> s107<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.570> fly<00:02:15.840> we<00:02:16.830> take<00:02:17.430> input

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
to get the s107 to fly we take input

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.000 
to get the s107 to fly we take input
from<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.650> Xbox<00:02:20.040> Kinect<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:22.560> sends<00:02:22.920> a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
from the Xbox Kinect and it sends a

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.230 
from the Xbox Kinect and it sends a
signal<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.550> my<00:02:23.670> computer<00:02:24.420> over<00:02:25.050> there<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:27.000> the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
signal to my computer over there and the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.960 
signal to my computer over there and the
computer<00:02:27.720> reads<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.230> information<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.980> sends

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
computer reads the information and sends

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.530 
computer reads the information and sends
that<00:02:30.000> information<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.640> Arduino<00:02:33.510> board

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
that information to the Arduino board

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.630 
that information to the Arduino board
down<00:02:34.170> here<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.650> floor<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:37.250> based<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.490> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
down here on the floor and based on the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.150 
down here on the floor and based on the
information<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.240> gets<00:02:39.510> from<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.870> computer<00:02:40.320> it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
information it gets from the computer it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.940 
information it gets from the computer it
decodes<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.540> sends<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:43.680> little

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
decodes it and sends it up this little

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.050 
decodes it and sends it up this little
infrared<00:02:44.670> LED<00:02:45.330> which<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:46.610> flickering<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.940> can

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
infrared LED which is flickering you can

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.610 
infrared LED which is flickering you can
see<00:02:48.210> there<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.570> kind<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:48.930> blurry<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.470> you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
see there it's kind of blurry but you

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.280 
see there it's kind of blurry but you
get<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.860> idea<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.720> that's<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> signal<00:02:52.140> that

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
get the idea and that's the signal that

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.190 
get the idea and that's the signal that
the<00:02:52.530> s107<00:02:53.070> receives<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:54.600> it's<00:02:54.840> been<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.020> fun

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
the s107 receives so it's been a fun

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.970 
the s107 receives so it's been a fun
little<00:02:55.350> project<00:02:55.700> kind<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.790> pointless<00:02:57.060> but

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
little project kind of pointless but

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.190 
little project kind of pointless but
unless<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.340> did<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.739> all<00:03:01.739> right<00:03:01.830> take<00:03:02.160> care
