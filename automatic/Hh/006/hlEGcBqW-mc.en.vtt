00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 We will introduce to you 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.950
 It's yellow 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.049
 It is said that 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.049
 It is integrated amplifier It is not this application 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.630
 A mouse is cheap 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.050
 On the other hand, Director Angels has been increasing since 2000 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.529
 I have a headphone amplifier 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.310
 Usually estimated 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 But I'm talking 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.710
 I'm starting to move from country to region 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.710
 Continued early 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.840
 Specifically, how much changed in this way 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.550
 Pastry shop can 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.750
 At first we will design nine people. 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.790
 It's something that's a tendency to feel strong 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.270
 It became 7 and did 7 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.570
 There is something 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.220
 That unique feeling when I woke up in Tokyo Hibiya Park 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.580
 Relocation of 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.320
 It is a faint feeling. Keiko Reiko 58 software is decided 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.690
 It is funny that there is no longer any start of it 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.790
 Yes, but a little upscale switch 9 days before any time 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.770
 In that way 32 years 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.940
 Flat glass court calendar contacts and 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.900
 Good news in the moment I used this all the time 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.250
 I said that most batter 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.520
 Among them 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.680
 Fujikawa has 16 saved eyes 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.300
 Then class 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.840
 Another thing to explain this on the 20th 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.960
 The important point is the controller 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.520
 right 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.580
 It is a role by having the controller attached 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.730
 There is no controller to operate that iphone 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.520
 It is a translation, even when using it for iphone only 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.070
 Even if it does not take out from the idle report pocket 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.080
 Controller in that it comes to borrowing individual 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.460
 The purpose is to add 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.320
 I will do well after Yamashita 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.760
 commitment 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.850
 My favorite earphone headphones 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.530
 There are a million things that have not been done early 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.179
 I confess there is no controller 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.959
 Trouble with headphone adapter 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.339
 Became an agency leaving, but have sms and take the body 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.069
 Suspicion of stabbing and killing with tbs is not good 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:24.659
 I think it's alive 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.619
 Please check it
