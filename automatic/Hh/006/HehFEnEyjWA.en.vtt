00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.080 
if you think that's a good idea in the
comments<00:01:25.110> section<00:01:25.170> below<00:01:25.830> cuz<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> may<00:01:26.850> indeed

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
comments section below cuz I may indeed

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.399 
comments section below cuz I may indeed
do<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.600> only<00:01:27.780> seven<00:01:28.020> thousand<00:01:28.259> five

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
do that it's only seven thousand five

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.810 
do that it's only seven thousand five
hundred<00:01:28.439> coins<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> potential

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
hundred coins and I have the potential

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.149 
hundred coins and I have the potential
to<00:01:30.119> make<00:01:30.630> something<00:01:31.079> off<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.829> there<00:01:32.009> is

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
to make something off it so there is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
to make something off it so there is
that<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.060> risk<00:01:33.270> reward<00:01:33.659> factor<00:01:34.229> anyways

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that a bit of risk reward factor anyways

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.800 
that a bit of risk reward factor anyways

game<00:05:50.880> was<00:05:51.480> probably<00:05:52.200> one<00:05:52.410> of<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.560> weirdest

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
game was probably one of the weirdest

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.980 
game was probably one of the weirdest
games<00:05:53.370> in<00:05:53.610> terms<00:05:53.880> of<00:05:54.000> intensity<00:05:54.600> that<00:05:54.750> I've

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
games in terms of intensity that I've

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.550 
games in terms of intensity that I've
ever<00:05:55.050> played<00:05:55.890> on<00:05:56.250> FIFA<00:05:56.790> across<00:05:57.360> any<00:05:57.810> of<00:05:58.050> any

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
ever played on FIFA across any of any

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.030 
ever played on FIFA across any of any
games<00:05:58.890> are<00:05:59.190> like<00:05:59.400> it<00:05:59.460> was<00:06:00.000> just<00:06:00.240> such<00:06:00.540> a<00:06:00.570> high

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
games are like it was just such a high

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.850 
games are like it was just such a high
high<00:06:02.040> temple<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:02.700> fast<00:06:03.450> paced<00:06:03.840> game<00:06:04.020> and<00:06:04.440> it<00:06:04.770> was

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
high temple a fast paced game and it was

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.500 
high temple a fast paced game and it was
just<00:06:04.980> back<00:06:05.220> and<00:06:05.430> forth<00:06:05.490> it<00:06:05.820> was<00:06:05.850> soap<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.450> I

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
just back and forth it was soap and I

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.030 
just back and forth it was soap and I
felt<00:06:06.780> like<00:06:06.840> my<00:06:06.900> defensive<00:06:07.440> line<00:06:07.590> was<00:06:07.770> playing

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
felt like my defensive line was playing

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.650 
felt like my defensive line was playing
so<00:06:08.580> much<00:06:08.760> higher<00:06:09.000> than<00:06:09.210> it<00:06:09.330> usually<00:06:09.450> does

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
so much higher than it usually does

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.420 
so much higher than it usually does
there<00:06:10.200> was<00:06:10.320> quite<00:06:10.470> a<00:06:10.560> few<00:06:10.650> goals<00:06:10.980> I<00:06:11.160> actually

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
there was quite a few goals I actually

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.640 
there was quite a few goals I actually
went<00:06:11.640> 3<00:06:11.940> and<00:06:11.970> I'll<00:06:12.120> obviously<00:06:12.270> here<00:06:12.780> at<00:06:12.990> very

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
went 3 and I'll obviously here at very

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:14.960 
went 3 and I'll obviously here at very
fortunate<00:06:14.100> to<00:06:14.160> keep<00:06:14.250> that<00:06:14.400> in<00:06:14.520> with<00:06:14.640> demaria

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
fortunate to keep that in with demaria

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.090 
fortunate to keep that in with demaria
but<00:06:15.090> a<00:06:15.120> nice<00:06:15.240> header<00:06:15.540> by<00:06:15.720> Benzema<00:06:16.170> but<00:06:16.620> yeah<00:06:16.950> he

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
but a nice header by Benzema but yeah he

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.710 
but a nice header by Benzema but yeah he
did<00:06:17.250> grab<00:06:17.490> one<00:06:17.700> back<00:06:17.880> to<00:06:18.030> see<00:06:18.180> here<00:06:18.360> Robin

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
did grab one back to see here Robin

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.030 
did grab one back to see here Robin
takes<00:06:18.930> it<00:06:19.020> on<00:06:19.080> the<00:06:19.140> chance<00:06:19.410> and<00:06:19.500> on<00:06:19.590> the<00:06:19.710> volley

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
takes it on the chance and on the volley

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.890 
takes it on the chance and on the volley
Casilla<00:06:20.670> stood<00:06:20.970> no<00:06:21.210> chance<00:06:21.240> there<00:06:21.780> we

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
Casilla stood no chance there we

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.000 
Casilla stood no chance there we
probably<00:06:22.110> should<00:06:22.440> have<00:06:22.500> done<00:06:22.560> a<00:06:22.680> bit<00:06:22.890> better

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
probably should have done a bit better

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.040 
probably should have done a bit better
but<00:06:23.400> yeah<00:06:23.490> this<00:06:23.610> game<00:06:23.760> was<00:06:23.940> very<00:06:24.180> weird<00:06:24.510> I<00:06:24.690> did
