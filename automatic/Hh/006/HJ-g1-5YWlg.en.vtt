00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
peripheral vision is basically like

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.880 
peripheral vision is basically like
holding<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.070> seven-inch<00:00:50.910> screen<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.890> couple

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
now you're wearing an oculus rift take

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.580 
now you're wearing an oculus rift take
your<00:01:26.070> hand<00:01:26.220> away<00:01:26.900> get<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.960> lot<00:01:28.080> more<00:01:28.110> peripheral

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
your hand away get a lot more peripheral

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.310 
your hand away get a lot more peripheral
vision<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.850> that's<00:01:30.240> still<00:01:30.509> pretty<00:01:30.570> good<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
vision but that's still pretty good and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.460 
vision but that's still pretty good and
your<00:01:31.770> vertical<00:01:32.220> field<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.579> view<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.960> almost<00:01:34.290> as

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
your vertical field of view is almost as

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.170 
your vertical field of view is almost as
good<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.710> your<00:01:34.890> life<00:01:35.040> there's<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.030> little

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
good as your life there's just a little

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.230 
good as your life there's just a little
bit<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.420> black<00:01:36.540> there<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.229> 3d<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.240> perfect

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
bit of black there the 3d is is perfect

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.639 
bit of black there the 3d is is perfect
in<00:01:39.509> these<00:01:39.960> glasses<00:01:40.500> because<00:01:42.110> what<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.320> is

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
in these glasses because what they do is

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.289 
in these glasses because what they do is
they<00:01:43.860> put<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> divider<00:01:44.520> inside<00:01:45.329> inside<00:01:46.049> here<00:01:47.299> so

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
they put a divider inside inside here so

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.120 
they put a divider inside inside here so
you're<00:01:48.450> right<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.930> can't<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> left<00:01:50.009> side

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
you're right I can't see the left side

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.069 
you're right I can't see the left side
of<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.490> screen<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.939> left<00:01:51.149> eye<00:01:51.360> can't<00:01:52.020> see

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
of the screen your left eye can't see

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.719 
of the screen your left eye can't see
the<00:01:52.259> right<00:01:52.470> side<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.979> screen<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.610> they

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the right side of the screen so they

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.600 
the right side of the screen so they
show<00:01:53.909> different<00:01:54.210> images<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> world<00:01:56.340> that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
show different images of the world that

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.609 
show different images of the world that
you're<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:57.020> from<00:01:58.020> slightly<00:01:58.409> different

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
you're in from slightly different

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.459 
you're in from slightly different
perspectives<00:01:59.840> giving<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.170> three

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
perspectives giving you that three

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.649 
perspectives giving you that three
perfect<00:02:02.070> 3d<00:02:02.369> effect<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.000> 3d<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.479> not

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
perfect 3d effect so this 3d it's not

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.020 
perfect 3d effect so this 3d it's not
overlapped<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:05.130> doesn't<00:02:05.549> give<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.729> any<00:02:05.909> sort

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
overlapped it doesn't give you any sort

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.580 
overlapped it doesn't give you any sort
of<00:02:06.180> eyestrain<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.140> might<00:02:07.320> if

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
of eyestrain like it might if

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.759 
of eyestrain like it might if
watching<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> TV<00:02:08.640> at<00:02:09.269> home<00:02:09.300> or<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.019> or<00:02:10.739> a

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
watching it on a TV at home or a or a

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.479 
watching it on a TV at home or a or a
movie<00:02:11.190> theater<00:02:11.930> because<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.290> side<00:02:14.280> by

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
movie theater because this is side by

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.670 
movie theater because this is side by
side<00:02:14.819> 3d<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.750> 3d<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.379> is<00:02:16.530> very

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
side 3d so 3d and this is very

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.729 
side 3d so 3d and this is very
convincing<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:18.300> feels<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.560> can

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
convincing it really feels like you can

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.770 
convincing it really feels like you can
reach<00:02:19.920> out<00:02:20.129> and<00:02:20.400> touch<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.879> characters<00:02:21.569> in

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
reach out and touch the characters in

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.050 
reach out and touch the characters in
the<00:02:21.870> games<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:23.250> feels<00:02:23.489> like<00:02:23.670> they're<00:02:23.879> standing

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the games it feels like they're standing

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.550 
the games it feels like they're standing
right<00:02:24.810> next<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
right next to you

it's a little bit it's me it's it's kind
of<00:02:40.739> warped<00:02:41.250> because<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.900> convex<00:02:43.290> lenses

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
of warped because the convex lenses

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.720 
of warped because the convex lenses
inside<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.299> oculus<00:02:45.900> rift<00:02:46.640> are<00:02:47.750> warped<00:02:48.750> and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
inside the oculus rift are warped and

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.100 
inside the oculus rift are warped and
when<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.819> look<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.060> through<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.329> lenses<00:02:51.780> it

when you look it through the lenses it
doesn't<00:02:52.470> look<00:02:52.560> warped<00:02:52.950> anymore

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.880 

so<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.240> kind<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.600> lets<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.110> see<00:03:04.560> what<00:03:04.710> it's

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
so that kind of lets you see what it's

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.220 
so that kind of lets you see what it's
like<00:03:05.070> inside<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.700> oculus<00:03:06.120> rift<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.900> that

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
like inside the oculus rift so that

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.260 
like inside the oculus rift so that
