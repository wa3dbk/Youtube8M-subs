but<00:00:10.920> as<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.280> water<00:00:11.460> progresses<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.179> gets

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
but as the water progresses it gets

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.499 
but as the water progresses it gets
colder<00:00:12.900> all<00:00:13.080> that's<00:00:13.620> going<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.920> stop<00:00:14.160> unless

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
colder all that's going to stop unless

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.120 
colder all that's going to stop unless
we<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.660> build<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.929> cold<00:00:16.170> frame<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.859> first

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
we can build a cold frame the first

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.279 
we can build a cold frame the first
thing<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.400> do<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.820> get<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> solid<00:00:18.449> base<00:00:18.660> all

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
thing to do is to get a solid base all

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.779 
thing to do is to get a solid base all
you<00:00:19.590> want<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:19.980> make<00:00:20.160> sure<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.460> can<00:00:20.640> make

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
you want to do is make sure you can make

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.790 
you want to do is make sure you can make
the<00:00:20.910> frame<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.480> all<00:00:21.689> sides<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> nice

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the frame on all sides and have a nice

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.279 
the frame on all sides and have a nice
sturdy<00:00:23.430> box<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.300> now<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> first<00:00:24.840> layer<00:00:25.109> is

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
sturdy box so now the first layer is

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.980 
sturdy box so now the first layer is
complete<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.949> level<00:00:26.369> comes<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> only<00:00:27.599> tricky

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
complete and level comes the only tricky

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.779 
complete and level comes the only tricky
part<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.439> whole<00:00:28.650> thing<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.760> to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
part in this whole thing and that is to

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.540 
part in this whole thing and that is to
make<00:00:30.150> our<00:00:30.359> slanted<00:00:31.109> sides<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.160> we're<00:00:32.340> going<00:00:32.460> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
make our slanted sides so we're going to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.270 
make our slanted sides so we're going to
take<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.910> 1<00:00:33.300> piece<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.780> aside<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.620> then<00:00:35.160> we're

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
take a 1 piece of aside and then we're

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.459 
take a 1 piece of aside and then we're
going<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.520> cut<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.910> into<00:00:36.059> two<00:00:36.239> before<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.260> put

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
going to cut it into two before I put

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.410 
going to cut it into two before I put
the<00:00:37.559> next<00:00:37.800> layer<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.100> I'm<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.210> cut<00:00:39.390> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the next layer on I'm going to cut a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.880 
the next layer on I'm going to cut a
couple<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:40.050> 6-inch

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
couple of 6-inch

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.810 
couple of 6-inch
guides<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:42.059> go<00:00:42.239> inside<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.829> box<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.730> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
guides to go inside of the box and so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
guides to go inside of the box and so
now<00:00:44.940> we've<00:00:45.059> got<00:00:45.180> two<00:00:45.420> posts<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.469> are<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
now we've got two posts that are on the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.420 
now we've got two posts that are on the
inside<00:00:47.480> now<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.600> help<00:00:48.809> guide<00:00:49.050> us<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.920> our<00:00:50.160> next

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
inside now to help guide us for our next

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.689 
inside now to help guide us for our next
layer<00:00:50.629> now<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.960> attach<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.129> not

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
layer now we can attach this one not

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.029 
layer now we can attach this one not
only<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> interior<00:00:54.930> little<00:00:55.289> guide<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
only to the interior little guide that

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.510 
only to the interior little guide that
we<00:00:56.160> had<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:57.149> also<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> back<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.190> now<00:00:59.340> we've

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
we had but also to the back so now we've

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.610 
we had but also to the back so now we've
got<00:00:59.670> everything<00:00:59.910> attached<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.960> our<00:01:01.140> basic

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
got everything attached is our basic

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.250 
got everything attached is our basic
shape<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.760> still<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.960> this

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
shape but we still have not this

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.380 
shape but we still have not this
stinking<00:01:04.799> has<00:01:04.979> too<00:01:05.430> much<00:01:05.580> play<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> sides

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
stinking has too much play on the sides

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.660 
stinking has too much play on the sides
so<00:01:07.200> I'm<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.500> anchor<00:01:07.680> man<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> couple

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
so I'm going to anchor man with a couple

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.950 
so I'm going to anchor man with a couple
of<00:01:08.760> screws<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> make<00:01:09.659> sure<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:09.869> don't

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
of screws is to make sure they don't

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.440 
of screws is to make sure they don't
move<00:01:10.140> we're<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> measure<00:01:11.010> 4<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.909> 40<00:01:12.299> inch

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
move we're going to measure 4 to 40 inch

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.020 
move we're going to measure 4 to 40 inch
pieces<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:13.020> hold<00:01:13.260> open<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.890> top<00:01:14.130> now<00:01:14.850> let's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
pieces to hold open the top now let's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.780 
pieces to hold open the top now let's
attach<00:01:15.150> them<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.200> now<00:01:16.320> we've<00:01:16.500> got<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.790> nice

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
attach them so now we've got a nice

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.859 
attach them so now we've got a nice
lever<00:01:18.799> that'll<00:01:19.799> help<00:01:19.920> hold<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.659> now<00:01:21.659> this

that we have I'm actually going to use a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.620 
that we have I'm actually going to use a
joist<00:01:28.020> bracket<00:01:28.670> on<00:01:29.670> attach<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> side

that<00:01:46.049> works<00:01:46.259> well<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.979> wide<00:01:47.220> open

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
that works well to have it wide open

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.730 
that works well to have it wide open
when<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> work<00:01:48.240> inside<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.470> we<00:01:49.560> need

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
when I want to work inside but we need

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.039 
when I want to work inside but we need
another<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.000> prop<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.420> open

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
another one just to prop it open

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.740 
another one just to prop it open
whereas<00:01:52.590> occasionally<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.340> hot<00:01:53.640> our<00:01:54.329> next

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
whereas occasionally to hot our next

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.350 
whereas occasionally to hot our next
step<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.500> put<00:01:55.680> together<00:01:55.799> these<00:01:56.640> two<00:01:57.030> flex

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
step is to put together these two flex

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.609 
step is to put together these two flex
seeds<00:01:57.630> into<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.320> 69<00:01:58.950> by<00:01:59.460> 48<00:01:59.909> sheet<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.469> had

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
seeds into a 69 by 48 sheet so we had

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.090 
seeds into a 69 by 48 sheet so we had
our<00:02:01.649> 69<00:02:02.399> by<00:02:02.850> 46<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> half<00:02:03.899> inch<00:02:04.140> box<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:05.009> we

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
our 69 by 46 and a half inch box and we

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.459 
our 69 by 46 and a half inch box and we
needed<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.460> put<00:02:05.670> together<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.570> Plexiglas<00:02:07.200> in

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
needed to put together the Plexiglas in

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.889 
needed to put together the Plexiglas in
a<00:02:07.560> way<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.369> fit<00:02:08.849> across<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.300> whole

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
a way so that it fit across the whole

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.930 
a way so that it fit across the whole
thing<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.470> going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.489> some<00:02:11.730> way<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
thing and going to have some way to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.710 
thing and going to have some way to
raise<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.420> up

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
raise it up

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.050 
raise it up
down<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> put<00:02:13.620> hinges<00:02:14.040> on<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.280> back<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.880> make<00:02:15.000> it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
down I put hinges on the back to make it

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.360 
down I put hinges on the back to make it
even<00:02:15.420> easier<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.900> get<00:02:16.080> up<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.410> down<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.190> I'll

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
even easier to get up and down so I'll

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.720 
even easier to get up and down so I'll
test<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.850> hinges<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:19.560> that's<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.100> cold

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
test the hinges and that's it cold

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.360 
test the hinges and that's it cold
