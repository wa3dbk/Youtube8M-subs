model with clicking on letter a and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
model with clicking on letter a and
there<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> brand<00:01:11.640> new<00:01:11.939> feature<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
there is a brand new feature on the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.179 
there is a brand new feature on the
right<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:14.030> with<00:01:15.030> mesh<00:01:15.630> debug<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.009> an

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
right here with mesh debug it is an

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.390 
right here with mesh debug it is an
overlay<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.119> top<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:19.049> your<00:01:19.320> mesh<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.220> can

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
overlay on top of your mesh that can

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.219 
overlay on top of your mesh that can
give<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.729> information<00:01:21.090> about<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.840> state<00:01:22.080> of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
give you information about the state of

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.450 
give you information about the state of
it<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.520> enable<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.950> already<00:01:25.950> we

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
it so I will enable this and already we

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.660 
it so I will enable this and already we
can<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:27.060> turns<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.659> entire<00:01:27.780> mesh<00:01:28.640> into<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
can see it turns the entire mesh into a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.130 
can see it turns the entire mesh into a
nice<00:01:30.180> gray<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.380> gray<00:01:31.409> means<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.060> fine<00:01:33.390> so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
nice gray the gray means this is fine so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.890 
nice gray the gray means this is fine so
everything<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:34.799> gray<00:01:35.250> should<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.210> fine<00:01:36.570> no

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
everything that's gray should be fine no

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.100 
everything that's gray should be fine no
matter<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:37.619> checking<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.780> be<00:01:39.780> aware

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
matter what you're checking for be aware

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.649 
matter what you're checking for be aware
that<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.009> modifiers<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.180> have

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
that if you have modifiers like I have

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.190 
that if you have modifiers like I have
here<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.439> right<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.610> enabled<00:01:45.509> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
here on the right if it is enabled you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.060 
here on the right if it is enabled you
can<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.490> mesh<00:01:48.000> debug<00:01:48.479> doesn't<00:01:48.960> work<00:01:49.229> so

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
can see the mesh debug doesn't work so

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.929 
can see the mesh debug doesn't work so
be<00:01:50.549> sure<00:01:50.850> you've<00:01:51.409> disabled<00:01:52.409> your<00:01:53.340> modifiers

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
be sure you've disabled your modifiers

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.270 
be sure you've disabled your modifiers
you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.420> either<00:01:54.570> disable<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.530> only<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.040> edit

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
you can either disable it only for edit

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.730 
you can either disable it only for edit
mode<00:01:56.460> or<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.909> disable<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> view<00:01:57.990> completely

to see about thickness now these values

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.970 
to see about thickness now these values
are

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
are

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.580 
are

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
micrometres is very very thin you can

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.220 
micrometres is very very thin you can
see<00:02:17.620> there<00:02:18.069> is<00:02:18.189> only<00:02:18.370> one<00:02:18.670> face<00:02:19.060> or<00:02:19.870> as

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
see there is only one face or as

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.990 
see there is only one face or as
actually<00:02:20.799> two<00:02:21.159> or<00:02:21.430> three<00:02:21.790> they<00:02:21.969> are

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
actually two or three they are

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.630 
actually two or three they are
highlighted<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.019> could<00:02:23.349> have<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.859> problem

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
highlighted that could have a problem

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.890 
highlighted that could have a problem
what<00:02:25.599> I<00:02:25.629> will<00:02:25.959> do<00:02:26.109> is<00:02:26.349> make<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.799> maximum<00:02:27.010> two

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
what I will do is make the maximum two

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.319 
what I will do is make the maximum two
millimeters<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:30.129> can<00:02:30.159> see<00:02:30.519> everything

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
millimeters and you can see everything

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.629 
millimeters and you can see everything
that<00:02:31.750> has<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.959> wall<00:02:32.319> thickness<00:02:32.620> under<00:02:33.400> two

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:33.639 
that has a wall thickness under two

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:38.610 
that has a wall thickness under two
millimeters<00:02:34.239> gets<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.200> nice<00:02:35.530> color<00:02:36.629> and<00:02:37.629> we<00:02:38.469> can

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
millimeters gets a nice color and we can

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.009 
millimeters gets a nice color and we can
set<00:02:38.829> a<00:02:38.950> lower<00:02:39.250> limit<00:02:39.639> as<00:02:39.879> well<00:02:40.209> which<00:02:40.840> is

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
set a lower limit as well which is

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.750 
set a lower limit as well which is
really<00:02:41.049> nice<00:02:41.590> for<00:02:41.620> instance<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.370> will<00:02:42.579> set<00:02:42.730> it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
really nice for instance I will set it

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.720 
really nice for instance I will set it
to<00:02:43.030> one<00:02:43.299> millimeter<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:45.040> everything<00:02:45.549> that<00:02:45.579> is

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
to one millimeter so everything that is

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.879 
to one millimeter so everything that is
less<00:02:46.239> than<00:02:46.540> one<00:02:46.930> millimeter<00:02:47.260> becomes

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
less than one millimeter becomes

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.520 
less than one millimeter becomes
completely<00:02:48.370> red<00:02:48.840> everything<00:02:49.870> that's<00:02:50.079> less

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
completely red everything that's less

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.199 
completely red everything that's less
than<00:02:50.560> two<00:02:50.950> millimeter<00:02:51.400> gets<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:52.000> color

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
than two millimeter gets a color

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.710 
than two millimeter gets a color
gradually<00:02:53.109> going<00:02:53.379> from<00:02:53.680> blue<00:02:54.099> to<00:02:54.819> green<00:02:54.849> which

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
gradually going from blue to green which

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.780 
gradually going from blue to green which
is<00:02:55.900> more<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.409> a<00:02:56.500> problem<00:02:56.739> from<00:02:57.159> green<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.760> red

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
is more of a problem from green to red

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.860 
is more of a problem from green to red
which<00:02:58.329> is<00:02:58.510> really<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:58.959> problem<00:02:59.260> so<00:03:00.189> red<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:01.030> one

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
which is really a problem so red is one

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.199 
which is really a problem so red is one
millimeter<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.500> lower<00:03:02.829> in<00:03:03.069> this<00:03:03.219> case<00:03:03.489> under

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
millimeter and lower in this case under

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.179 
millimeter and lower in this case under
two<00:03:04.419> millimeters<00:03:04.959> could<00:03:05.230> be<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.650> green<00:03:05.950> or

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
two millimeters could be the green or

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.629 
two millimeters could be the green or
these<00:03:06.609> and<00:03:06.879> we<00:03:07.659> can<00:03:07.840> edit<00:03:08.129> whilst<00:03:09.129> we're

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
these and we can edit whilst we're

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.089 
these and we can edit whilst we're
looking<00:03:10.000> at<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.329> which<00:03:11.079> is<00:03:11.260> very<00:03:11.319> very<00:03:11.859> nice

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
looking at this which is very very nice

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.190 
looking at this which is very very nice
so<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.579> can<00:03:12.849> see<00:03:13.090> there's<00:03:13.359> a<00:03:13.450> problem<00:03:13.900> with<00:03:14.079> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
so I can see there's a problem with the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.119 
so I can see there's a problem with the
leg<00:03:14.409> if<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:15.430> go<00:03:15.669> make<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.030> thicker<00:03:16.569> by<00:03:17.129> shrinking

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
leg if I go make it thicker by shrinking

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.009 
leg if I go make it thicker by shrinking
or<00:03:18.280> fattening<00:03:18.699> it<00:03:18.940> if<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.269> fatten<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:19.750> enough

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
or fattening it if I fatten it enough

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.689 
or fattening it if I fatten it enough
you<00:03:20.199> can<00:03:20.319> see<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.769> value<00:03:21.159> updates

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:21.699 
you can see the value updates

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.059 
you can see the value updates
automatically<00:03:22.389> this<00:03:23.290> can<00:03:23.620> make<00:03:23.859> your

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
automatically this can make your

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.759 
automatically this can make your
computer<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.579> little<00:03:24.940> bit<00:03:25.239> slow<00:03:25.510> but<00:03:26.319> it<00:03:26.440> gives

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
computer a little bit slow but it gives

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.309 
computer a little bit slow but it gives
you<00:03:26.979> an<00:03:27.220> instant<00:03:27.879> update<00:03:28.150> about<00:03:28.569> whether<00:03:29.019> or

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
you an instant update about whether or

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.960 
you an instant update about whether or
not<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.829> fixed<00:03:30.280> your<00:03:30.669> problem<00:03:30.699> and<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:33.819> way

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
not you fixed your problem and the way

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.729 
not you fixed your problem and the way
to<00:03:34.030> deal<00:03:34.479> with<00:03:34.689> this<00:03:34.870> sort<00:03:35.139> of<00:03:35.229> thing<00:03:35.290> really

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
to deal with this sort of thing really

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.479 
to deal with this sort of thing really
is<00:03:36.129> to<00:03:36.159> use<00:03:36.669> the<00:03:37.389> mesh<00:03:37.599> debug<00:03:38.169> to<00:03:39.010> fix

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
is to use the mesh debug to fix

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.280 
is to use the mesh debug to fix
everything<00:03:39.879> you<00:03:40.150> just<00:03:40.180> keep<00:03:40.629> this<00:03:40.840> as<00:03:41.079> an

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
everything you just keep this as an

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.979 
everything you just keep this as an
overlay<00:03:41.919> to<00:03:42.189> show<00:03:42.759> you<00:03:42.819> whether<00:03:43.239> you're

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
overlay to show you whether you're

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.379 
overlay to show you whether you're
actually<00:03:44.229> fixing<00:03:44.949> the<00:03:45.069> problem<00:03:45.430> if<00:03:45.579> you<00:03:46.090> want

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
actually fixing the problem if you want

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.530 
actually fixing the problem if you want
to<00:03:46.569> make<00:03:46.780> sure<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:47.500> fixed<00:03:48.040> everything<00:03:48.299> you<00:03:49.299> go

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
to make sure you fixed everything you go

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.289 
to make sure you fixed everything you go
into<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.019> 3d<00:03:50.439> print<00:03:50.769> tools<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.370> click<00:03:51.879> on<00:03:52.120> the

not four for one as it is in this case
you<00:03:58.329> really<00:03:59.109> fixed<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.739> this<00:03:59.979> is<00:04:00.159> a<00:04:00.189> nice

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
you really fixed it this is a nice

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.640 
you really fixed it this is a nice
visual<00:04:00.879> overlay<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.959> you<00:04:02.109> use<00:04:02.349> whilst
