00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 serious doubts about frandroid with tony 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.080
 battie let 's do the presentation for 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.480
 iphone 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.910
 we had missed too so this is there a 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.599
 flop elsewhere congress with clement 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.580
 clement 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.250
 here I am marketing manager 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.870
 Asus France is therefore welcome on his 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.430
 asus I will introduce you a little bit 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.050
 the iphone which is products that we 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.939
 announced at the 6th at the beginning of the year what 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.189
 they have to offer either in europe or in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.080
 current lease is ok iphone 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.849
 it's a range of smartphones from a 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.710
 full range with iphone 4 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.019
 a second volume 5 and Lausanne in Switzerland 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.279
 which obviously corresponds to the table 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.110
 legal taïb 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.960
 still 50 cent is so short of agreement 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.030
 we start with second flowers so 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.160
 the particularity it will be true on all 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.020
 the iphone is to have a shell 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.040
 interchangeable at the back okay here 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.239
 she is black of the others 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.129
 products use white 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.270
 it looks arm color red 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.710
 blue three episodes 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.390
 okay whoever says that make it change 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.579
 battery removable battery 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.620
 actually removable on the es4 and 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.570
 es5 would not trust the six for 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.280
 questions of engineering it's not 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.870
 serious I counted on him six on lucy 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.850
 punch at the thai thales rail will be 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.939
 exchangeable is necessarily good old 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.070
 shell demons we will have these five hulls of 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.840
 colors can also stop more 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.240
 baky and laugh an extra shell 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.280
 or via biase 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.990
 gm manufacturers of tuning accessories 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.450
 who could make hulls 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.829
 sized to store them so we 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.759
 well how many schools of color we have 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.950
 exactly for the five today 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.900
 today the white from far we have here 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.700
 also from 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.290
 georgia m is going to have a turquoise blue 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.660
 that I could come up sooner and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.180
 yellow rock ok so five colors 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.650
 okay today its assessors 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.690
 princess and the colors what we saw 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.180
 with us that they buy belgian and 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.430
 several builders seized will be a 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.890
 pretty interesting design what is it 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.600
 plastic section it's a real clasico 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.210
 as then actually it's a 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.800
 material that is a plastic 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.210
 who was really worked to have 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.250
 still a quality finish 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.440
 finish case it's pretty interesting 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.110
 face beautiful we recreated youtube and 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.850
 razors finally we do not see the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.840
 traces of edge we call the need 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.550
 to clean 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.060
 unlike motorcycle which I in my 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.979
 pocket and compare that's enough it's 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.330
 pretty blatant motorcycle in the phrases 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.650
 perspiration permeates the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.610
 peaceful I'm not trying 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.660
 criticize the phone it's a very good 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.430
 telly during this month but the plastic 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.590
 is not beautiful at all here we are 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.090
 on a product a little more than 10 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.940
 what are you burning measure overlooks 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.099
 this case of thumb what argument put in 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.590
 before for the thumb case so it has 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.540
 see here the photo sensor of 5 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.819
 megapixels in the back it's in a 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.239
 second to the vacquerie slightly up 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.050
 the product there we have I do not know if I 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.480
 am in the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.820
 carbo is perfect here we have also so 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.540
 these products there are h more losses 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.250
 42 of which went to behind ok they 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.690
 will arrive a little later in 4g is 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.460
 raised for the moment it's products 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.810
 are with whom are hs who has more 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.360
 okay here's for info from 4 ago 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.000
 also then outside the material side 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.650
 we have so we do not see here 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.880
 what should I opens 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.100
 will of course be able to edit a small 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.200
 tick for we had the back side but 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.640
 as a matter of economics ago 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.870
 a question about about autonomy 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.120
 toughness phone daily that 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.560
 is that is that it is also a 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.600
 action at the software level 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.610
 what is the dispute included in 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.440
 quarters then the particularity also 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.420
 this time not written to integrate 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.450
 intel core intel atom processors 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.480
 so we will have the first 25 years 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.390
 models 7 25 80 on both fronts in 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.010
 the 5 and 6 intel why the choice of 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.629
 intel would have more reason 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.580
 you would really have to say it and 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.650
 of engineers we really worked 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.569
 together on these points of course there are 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.159
 also a question of performance and that 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.040
 these products are really very responsive 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.560
 and charter penalties processors 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.200
 intel are very very good to go to 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.849
 equality and then and then the latter 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.019
 argument is that such a pau who 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.640
 work on autonomy especially 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.140
 on its processors 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.790
 and it's true that today 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.590
 the autonomy of death is intel us 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.060
 will really make the seriousness of 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.980
 propose them on his emotions his cables 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.140
 okay so that's it for these 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.030
 reasons that are called choice of such 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.230
 hockey and on autonomy actually 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.790
 it was even important for us 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.349
 hear today we can take 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.849
 what to communicate on hours because 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.280
 that it obviously depends on the uses of 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.709
 everyone if you use a lot below 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.289
 telephony if you or a lot of 8.6 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.299
 on it so the battle due for 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.830
 you the only objective criterion is 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.419
 unfortunately one day that the mini ones 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.770
 loses so that means criteria 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.990
 objectives but which does not necessarily translate 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.129
 in uses note that this fact 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.009
 asked that we will obviously have 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.839
 mass production versions 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:38.279
 it's pretty low the tests does not compete with 

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:40.689
 have to give the hard ones and I would say 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:44.649
 of use and we will lend them for 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.069
 unpleasant you continue gersois are 

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:48.669
 from 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:50.259
 the 5 inches so it's full ideas 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.719
 fable format is suddenly we are talking 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.269
 bigger thing at the moment 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.139
 on the market we have a lot 5 inches there 

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:59.649
 we are on a trend all these ingredients 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.569
 the guen then it's always in the 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:03.580
 unlimited break of iphone products 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.769
 for the same quality of finish I will go 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.969
 on these products , that's all we 

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:08.229
 will mount a bridge in range in terms of 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:09.999
 this text which necessarily counts a 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.559
 processor of a small that powerful whose 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:13.509
 manage a screen display a little 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:15.490
 a bit of a notch of course we'll see 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.649
 a processor this time struck off the sigas 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.959
 or west giguère for both 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:22.300
 opportunities on stage like that we have 

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:23.319
 always this interface while he 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.999
 is not necessarily shown but I 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:29.589
 watch is far away as if this consciousness 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:31.029
 no more money but we find 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:32.919
 overall the same spect the same 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:35.379
 possibilities I can also remove the 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.699
 back shell is dark era the 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.800
 credits for iphone 4 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.620
 the deaf school i'm going to have some alkine 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.300
 location for a sim card and the 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.520
 micro sd with the ability to go 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.800
 up to 64 giga and more on the micro sd 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.620
 weekend here for the iphone 5 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.190
 I will also have a photo sensor not 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.289
 no more powerful and more precise wine 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.300
 with benoît and pixel of agreement and 2 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.610
 megapixels in place tahrir in Cairo 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.979
 that's it for format 5 just for 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.360
 return to the concept of the term travelex 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.379
 to consider again the holy christ 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.990
 like the smartphone 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.909
 yeah today the average in terms of 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.409
 shelves and all 3 inches and 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.180
 then I was finished as long as it's going to be 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:15.500
 here for us from the site are only 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.870
 nothing but excess posters of the 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.460
 tablet is really a 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.200
 a format that is still in the 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.670
 category smartphones the choir the 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.140
 market average scars today 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.310
 the management she grows she should 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.020
 to be closer to the five missions of 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.930
 inside that one we're on a 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.030
 format that actually is already over 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.400
 great since that's how 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.350
 this time then again in life in 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.150
 this idea of going upmarket with the 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.960
 slab size this time we have 1 13 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.960
 megapixels in the back 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.290
 camera okay we were going on a 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.460
 sensor in the front we will see 2 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:53.190
 megapixels we still have the duel so badly 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.800
 inside or sd we have a processor ti 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.050
 vct and is the giguère always intel 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.060
 of course a slab hd relay sound 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.800
 amazing because she 120 beds ps 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.570
 So here we are going to have a product 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.790
 really finishing or also
