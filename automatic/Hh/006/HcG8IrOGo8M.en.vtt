00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.730 
finger board and plug it in on like that
and<00:01:39.520> let's<00:01:39.999> see<00:01:40.179> if<00:01:40.209> we<00:01:40.389> can<00:01:40.569> get<00:01:41.349> this<00:01:41.529> thing

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
and let's see if we can get this thing

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.969 
and let's see if we can get this thing
to<00:01:41.859> slide<00:01:42.340> down<00:01:42.369> though<00:01:42.639> yeah<00:01:42.819> the<00:01:43.029> ramp<00:01:43.209> oh

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
to slide down though yeah the ramp oh

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.690 
to slide down though yeah the ramp oh
yeah<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:47.229> can<00:01:47.349> also<00:01:47.469> take<00:01:47.739> Rafael<00:01:48.219> and<00:01:48.429> your

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
yeah you can also take Rafael and your

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.399 
yeah you can also take Rafael and your
finger<00:01:48.969> board<00:01:49.209> and<00:01:49.419> plug<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.109> onto<00:01:50.380> the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
finger board and plug it onto the

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.589 
finger board and plug it onto the
fingerboard<00:01:50.770> just<00:01:51.639> like<00:01:51.759> this<00:01:51.939> so<00:01:52.359> just<00:01:52.509> make

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
fingerboard just like this so just make

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.969 
fingerboard just like this so just make
sure<00:01:52.719> you<00:01:52.810> plug<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.169> on<00:01:53.259> here<00:01:53.380> nice<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.590> tight

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
sure you plug it on here nice and tight

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.989 
sure you plug it on here nice and tight
the<00:01:54.700> ideal<00:01:55.029> is<00:01:55.289> take<00:01:56.289> my<00:01:56.319> Rafael<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.429> you<00:01:57.849> just

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
the ideal is take my Rafael and you just

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:59.849 
the ideal is take my Rafael and you just
kind<00:01:58.209> of<00:01:58.239> put<00:01:58.450> them<00:01:58.539> up<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.809> up<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.439> ramp<00:01:59.649> and

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
kind of put them up the up the ramp and

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.889 
kind of put them up the up the ramp and
put<00:02:00.459> them<00:02:00.639> put<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:00.880> wheels<00:02:01.059> on<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.359> indents

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
put them put the wheels on the indents

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.739 
put them put the wheels on the indents
here<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.409> there<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.759> idea<00:02:04.059> is<00:02:04.119> you're

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
here and there the idea is you're

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.029 
here and there the idea is you're
supposed<00:02:04.989> to<00:02:05.109> push<00:02:05.289> them<00:02:05.439> off<00:02:05.559> the<00:02:05.709> ramp<00:02:05.919> and

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
supposed to push them off the ramp and

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.130 
supposed to push them off the ramp and
you<00:02:06.159> spoke<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.520> roll<00:02:06.700> right<00:02:06.849> off<00:02:06.909> but<00:02:07.719> since<00:02:08.020> it

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
you spoke to roll right off but since it

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.959 
you spoke to roll right off but since it
has<00:02:08.259> stairs<00:02:08.560> it's<00:02:08.739> totally<00:02:09.340> possible<00:02:09.579> for

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:09.969 
has stairs it's totally possible for

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:11.850 
has stairs it's totally possible for
this<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.209> happen<00:02:10.299> so<00:02:11.019> I'm<00:02:11.079> just<00:02:11.200> gonna<00:02:11.319> cheat

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
this to happen so I'm just gonna cheat

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.130 
this to happen so I'm just gonna cheat
just<00:02:12.099> a<00:02:12.159> little<00:02:12.400> bit

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
just a little bit

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.190 
just a little bit
and<00:02:13.230> that's<00:02:13.620> what<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.890> supposed<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.190> look<00:02:14.310> like

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
and that's what is supposed to look like

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.410 
and that's what is supposed to look like
we're<00:02:16.200> gonna<00:02:16.290> try<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:16.950> one<00:02:17.220> more<00:02:17.400> time

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.699 

so<00:02:21.420> basically<00:02:21.870> when<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.110> bring<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.380> two<00:02:22.500> Rams

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
so basically when you bring the two Rams

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.300 
so basically when you bring the two Rams
together<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.819> what<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.150> get<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.190> is

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
together this is what you get so this is

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.160 
together this is what you get so this is
my<00:02:26.430> mouse<00:02:26.640> 94<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.330> my<00:02:27.450> video<00:02:27.690> review<00:02:27.720> you
