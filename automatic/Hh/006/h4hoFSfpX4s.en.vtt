have<00:01:56.399> added<00:01:56.729> more<00:01:56.909> legroom<00:01:57.149> over<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> years

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.370 

and<00:02:03.010> then<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:04.150> got<00:02:04.270> your<00:02:04.360> vortex<00:02:04.810> generators

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
and then you got your vortex generators

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.500

little<00:02:05.860> cusps<00:02:06.280> on<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.520> tail<00:02:07.030> lighting<00:02:07.330> on<00:02:07.420> the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
little cusps on the tail lighting on the

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
mirrors and what that'll do is kind of

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.199 
mirrors and what that'll do is kind of
cut<00:02:09.190> down<00:02:09.250> on<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.610> road<00:02:09.789> noise<00:02:09.910> and

time back here you're not going to have

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.400 
time back here you're not going to have
