these these are trailing hooks that they

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.560 
these these are trailing hooks that they
they<00:00:30.779> hook<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> back<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.910> gripper<00:00:32.910> like

they hook on the back of a gripper like

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that so when you pull it through you

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.549 
that so when you pull it through you
know<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.550> helps<00:00:35.820> pull<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.660> wood<00:00:37.020> through<00:00:37.350> your

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
know it helps pull the wood through your

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.930 
know it helps pull the wood through your
saw<00:00:37.860> or<00:00:38.070> whatever<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.790> their

sacrificial<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:39.809> they're<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.530> cool<00:00:41.010> I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
sacrificial but they're really cool I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.709 
sacrificial but they're really cool I
think<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.640> don't<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.239> want<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> use<00:00:42.600> them

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
think I don't really want to use them

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.150 
think I don't really want to use them
for<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.020> really<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:43.829> them<00:00:44.070> as

comments I got were questions about the

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.369 
comments I got were questions about the
antiquing<00:00:56.190> wax<00:00:56.489> I've<00:00:57.149> never<00:00:57.539> used<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.020> stuff

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
antiquing wax I've never used that stuff

antiquing wax I've never used that stuff
before<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.100> I'm<00:00:59.760> gonna<00:01:00.059> start<00:01:00.329> using<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
before and I'm gonna start using that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.660 
before and I'm gonna start using that
more<00:01:01.109> often<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:02.129> cool<00:01:02.340> because

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
more often it is really cool because

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.450 
more often it is really cool because
it's<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.090> applying<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.170> stain<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> goes

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it's like applying a stain but it goes

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
it's like applying a stain but it goes
on<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.880> easily<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.900> wipe<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.260> off<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
on so easily and you wipe it off and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.310 
on so easily and you wipe it off and
it's<00:01:07.860> dry<00:01:08.220> almost<00:01:08.790> instantly<00:01:09.450> since<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.020> my

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it's dry almost instantly since I do my

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.660 
it's dry almost instantly since I do my
videos<00:01:10.650> every<00:01:10.830> week<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.189> don't<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> lot<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
videos every week I don't have a lot of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.760 
videos every week I don't have a lot of
time<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.270> wait<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.450> finish<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.200> dry<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
time to wait for finish to dry and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
time to wait for finish to dry and
that's<00:01:13.890> one<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> drawbacks<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:15.150> staining

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
that's one of the drawbacks to staining

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.359 
that's one of the drawbacks to staining
a<00:01:16.229> project<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.130> need<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
a project because you really need to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.310 
a project because you really need to
stay<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> got<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.330> wait<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.689> least<00:01:18.840> 24

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
stay in then you got to wait at least 24

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.080 
stay in then you got to wait at least 24
hours<00:01:19.350> before<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.009> apply<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.340> finish<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
hours before you apply it finish and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.330 
hours before you apply it finish and
know<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.600> all<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.020> stuff<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.259> when<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.619> do

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
know that all that stuff so when you do

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.899 
know that all that stuff so when you do
that<00:01:23.610> wax<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.630> goes<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.979> coat<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
that wax it just goes on in one coat you

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.210 
that wax it just goes on in one coat you
wipe<00:01:27.150> off<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.570> excess<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.380> then<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.950> dry

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
wipe off the excess and then it's dry

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.370 
wipe off the excess and then it's dry
that's<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:29.939> probably<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> most<00:01:30.479> common

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that's it but probably the most common

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.679 
that's it but probably the most common

there's<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.829> science<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.820> it's

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
there's a lot of science in it and it's

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.210 
there's a lot of science in it and it's
fictional<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.899> really<00:01:49.290> science<00:01:49.649> fact

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
fictional but it's really science fact

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.649 
fictional but it's really science fact
sort<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.640> its<00:01:50.759> kind<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.240> takes<00:01:51.450> place<00:01:51.600> in

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
sort of its kind of it takes place in

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.080 
sort of its kind of it takes place in
the<00:01:51.810> near<00:01:52.200> future<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.040> everything<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.850> there

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the near future and everything in there

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.270 
the near future and everything in there
is<00:01:54.119> kind<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.540> what<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.049> think<00:01:55.380> NASA<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.250> working

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
is kind of what I think NASA is working

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.469 
is kind of what I think NASA is working
on<00:01:56.759> right<00:01:56.820> now

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
on right now

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.749 
on right now
seems<00:01:58.140> really<00:01:58.439> plausible<00:01:58.860> oh<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.520> speaking

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
seems really plausible oh and speaking

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.179 
seems really plausible oh and speaking
of<00:01:59.850> movies<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.390> went<00:02:00.750> out<00:02:00.960> last<00:02:01.409> night<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.740> saw

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the Mad Max movie that was really really

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.600 
the Mad Max movie that was really really
good<00:02:06.090> I'm<00:02:06.420> gonna<00:02:06.659> say<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.979> best<00:02:08.280> action

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
good I'm gonna say it's the best action

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.240 
good I'm gonna say it's the best action
movie<00:02:09.000> I've<00:02:09.479> ever<00:02:09.539> seen<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.649> does<00:02:10.890> exactly

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
movie I've ever seen it does exactly

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.910

what<00:02:11.580> an<00:02:11.670> action<00:02:12.060> movie<00:02:12.239> should<00:02:12.810> do<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.530> just

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
what an action movie should do is just

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.830 
what an action movie should do is just
stick<00:02:14.519> to<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.790> action<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.420> mean<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:15.690> pretty

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840
