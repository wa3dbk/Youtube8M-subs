great find if you look around here

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.200 
great find if you look around here
you'll<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.230> whole<00:00:49.500> tree<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.129> covered<00:00:50.910> in

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
you'll see this whole tree is covered in

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.560 
you'll see this whole tree is covered in
the<00:00:51.300> fruiting<00:00:51.629> body<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.430> artist<00:00:54.270> conch

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the fruiting body of the artist conch

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.630 
the fruiting body of the artist conch
meaning<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> fruiting<00:00:56.160> body<00:00:56.340> but

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
meaning this is the fruiting body but

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.900 
meaning this is the fruiting body but
inoculated<00:00:57.570> into<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.989> entire<00:00:58.910> partially

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
inoculated into this entire partially

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.290 
inoculated into this entire partially
rotten<00:01:00.239> tree<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:02.160> mycelium<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
rotten tree is the mycelium and the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.630 
rotten tree is the mycelium and the
remaining<00:01:03.780> reason<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.320> rotting<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.890> because

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
remaining reason it's rotting is because

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910 
remaining reason it's rotting is because
the<00:01:05.760> mycelium<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.200> artists<00:01:07.530> Punk<00:01:07.770> are

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the mycelium of the artists Punk are

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.510 
the mycelium of the artists Punk are
eating<00:01:08.189> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
eating it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100 
eating it
now<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:08.970> remnants<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.600> some<00:01:09.900> other

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
now there's remnants of some other

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.679 
now there's remnants of some other
mushrooms<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.119> decomposed

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
mushrooms and that have just decomposed

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.880 
mushrooms and that have just decomposed
fruit<00:01:13.080> bodies

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
fruit bodies

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.600 
fruit bodies
these<00:01:14.549> may<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:15.360> artists<00:01:16.500> they<00:01:17.340> may<00:01:17.549> be

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
these may be artists they may be

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.820 
these may be artists they may be
fungus<00:01:18.090> from<00:01:18.360> notorious<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.290> can't<00:01:19.530> tell

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
fungus from notorious I just can't tell

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.820 
fungus from notorious I just can't tell
oh<00:01:20.689> there's<00:01:21.689> definitely<00:01:21.840> some<00:01:22.320> other<00:01:22.530> species

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
oh there's definitely some other species

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.490 
oh there's definitely some other species
right<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.280> some<00:01:25.220> these<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:27.380> don't<00:01:28.380> know

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
right here some these are don't know

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.620 
right here some these are don't know
what<00:01:28.650> these<00:01:28.770> are

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
what these are

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.350 
what these are
can't<00:01:30.630> quite<00:01:30.780> tell<00:01:31.640> wow<00:01:32.640> there's<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.060> whole

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
can't quite tell wow there's a whole

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.410 
can't quite tell wow there's a whole
bunch<00:01:34.140> which<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.680> amazing<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.000> mycelium

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
bunch which is amazing that the mycelium

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.660 
bunch which is amazing that the mycelium
can<00:01:36.869> coexist<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.530> usually<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.100> mycelium

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
can coexist because usually the mycelium

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.670 
can coexist because usually the mycelium
are<00:01:38.759> competing<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.420> each<00:01:39.450> other<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
are competing with each other one of the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.520 
are competing with each other one of the
main<00:01:40.860> reasons<00:01:41.780> medicinal<00:01:42.780> mushrooms<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.350> so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
main reasons medicinal mushrooms are so

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.560 
main reasons medicinal mushrooms are so
healthy<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:44.310> us<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.759> because<00:01:44.909> they<00:01:45.180> contain

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
healthy for us is because they contain

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.460 
healthy for us is because they contain
anti<00:01:46.110> fungal<00:01:46.560> or<00:01:47.520> anti<00:01:47.880> mushroom<00:01:48.470> properties

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
anti fungal or anti mushroom properties

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.920 
anti fungal or anti mushroom properties
to<00:01:49.680> help<00:01:49.950> them<00:01:50.280> defend<00:01:51.270> against<00:01:51.750> their

to help them defend against their

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
competing other species but when taken

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.490 
competing other species but when taken
properly<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.579> tea<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:56.850> other<00:01:57.479> method<00:01:58.290> then

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.360 
leave these because we're heading out
tomorrow<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.620> don't<00:02:16.650> want<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> carry<00:02:17.220> these

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
tomorrow and I don't want to carry these

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.890 
tomorrow and I don't want to carry these
on<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.580> plane<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.060> these<00:02:18.270> will<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.540> continue

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
on the plane so these will just continue

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.380 
on the plane so these will just continue
to<00:02:19.050> put<00:02:19.650> out<00:02:19.800> more<00:02:20.040> spores<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:21.209> will

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
to put out more spores that will

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.880 
to put out more spores that will
hopefully<00:02:21.569> land<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.280> trees<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:24.050> grow<00:02:25.050> four

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
hopefully land on trees and grow four

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.390 
hopefully land on trees and grow four
more<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.130> us<00:02:26.340> when<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:26.640> come<00:02:26.819> back<00:02:26.940> next<00:02:27.239> year
