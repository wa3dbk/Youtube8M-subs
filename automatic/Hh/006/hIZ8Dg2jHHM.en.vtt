you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.420 

what<00:01:44.350> offense<00:01:44.650> has<00:01:44.770> been<00:01:44.830> tremendous<00:01:45.400> and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
what offense has been tremendous and

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.160 
what offense has been tremendous and
again<00:01:45.820> that's<00:01:45.970> gonna<00:01:46.240> be<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.450> big<00:01:46.510> focus<00:01:46.930> of

again that's gonna be a big focus of

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.260 
again that's gonna be a big focus of
ours<00:01:47.350> going<00:01:47.590> into<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:47.980> game<00:01:48.160> but<00:01:48.550> you<00:01:49.120> know<00:01:49.240> a

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
ours going into the game but you know a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.210 
ours going into the game but you know a
very<00:01:49.570> first<00:01:49.810> or<00:01:50.050> team<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.470> adaptable<00:01:50.980> and<00:01:51.130> I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
very first or team and adaptable and I

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.770 
very first or team and adaptable and I
think<00:01:51.430> you<00:01:51.490> know<00:01:51.520> we<00:01:51.790> can<00:01:51.940> we<00:01:52.330> can<00:01:52.479> play<00:01:52.630> out

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
think you know we can we can play out

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.150 
think you know we can we can play out
why<00:01:52.900> but<00:01:53.170> also<00:01:53.320> we've<00:01:53.620> got<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> very<00:01:53.950> dominant

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
why but also we've got a very dominant

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.190 
why but also we've got a very dominant
pack<00:01:54.520> very<00:01:54.820> strong<00:01:55.090> packing<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.810> think

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
pack very strong packing and I think

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.660 
pack very strong packing and I think
that's<00:01:56.320> certainly<00:01:56.620> gonna<00:01:56.800> take<00:01:57.340> us<00:01:57.490> through

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
that's certainly gonna take us through

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.850 
that's certainly gonna take us through
in<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.820> game<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.870> would<00:01:58.960> be<00:01:59.110> fantastic<00:01:59.290> you
