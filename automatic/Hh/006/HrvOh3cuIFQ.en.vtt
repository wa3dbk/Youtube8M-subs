00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
professor of law there but we're not

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.330 
professor of law there but we're not
talking<00:00:26.510> specifically<00:00:27.110> just<00:00:27.650> about<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.130> law

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
talking specifically just about the law

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.790 
talking specifically just about the law
we're<00:00:28.880> talking<00:00:29.270> about<00:00:29.330> medicine<00:00:29.990> as<00:00:30.140> I<00:00:30.619> said

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
we're talking about medicine as I said

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.589 
we're talking about medicine as I said
you<00:00:30.950> are<00:00:30.980> a<00:00:31.250> professor<00:00:31.760> of<00:00:31.880> law<00:00:32.029> yet<00:00:32.419> you're

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
you are a professor of law yet you're

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.630 
you are a professor of law yet you're
looking<00:00:32.870> a<00:00:32.960> lot<00:00:33.080> at<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:33.530> consequences<00:00:34.489> of

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
looking a lot at the consequences of

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.640 
looking a lot at the consequences of
medical<00:00:35.030> research<00:00:35.210> why<00:00:35.809> is<00:00:35.870> that<00:00:36.050> because

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
medical research why is that because

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.320 
medical research why is that because
it's<00:00:36.980> interesting<00:00:37.430> because<00:00:37.850> it's<00:00:38.150> so

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
it's interesting because it's so

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.540 
it's interesting because it's so
important<00:00:38.780> I<00:00:38.900> think<00:00:38.930> beyond<00:00:39.770> just<00:00:40.190> medicine

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
important I think beyond just medicine

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.880 
important I think beyond just medicine
so<00:00:41.330> for<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:41.510> last<00:00:41.629> 20<00:00:41.960> years<00:00:41.989> I've<00:00:42.410> worked<00:00:42.650> on

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
so for the last 20 years I've worked on

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.710 
so for the last 20 years I've worked on
ethical<00:00:43.370> legal<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:43.730> social<00:00:43.850> issues<00:00:44.510> in

brain and law and ethics well I think

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.270 
brain and law and ethics well I think
the<00:01:36.200> device<00:01:36.530> that<00:01:36.799> has<00:01:36.979> really

revolutionized this field more than
anything<00:01:39.259> else<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:39.950> MRI<00:01:40.310> machine<00:01:40.539> the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
legal issues we're going to have to

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.580 
legal issues we're going to have to
grapple<00:01:58.820> with<00:01:59.030> yeah<00:01:59.359> I<00:01:59.570> think<00:01:59.840> there<00:02:00.469> are<00:02:00.499> at

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
grapple with yeah I think there are at

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.310 
grapple with yeah I think there are at
least<00:02:00.619> six<00:02:01.249> different<00:02:01.520> categories<00:02:01.939> of<00:02:02.749> issues

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
where neuroscience is likely to really

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:08.200 
where neuroscience is likely to really
have<00:02:05.899> a<00:02:05.929> substantial<00:02:06.619> effect<00:02:06.740> on<00:02:07.100> our<00:02:07.850> society

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
hitting the courts in real life now yes

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.849 
hitting the courts in real life now yes
they're<00:03:46.180> both<00:03:46.359> I<00:03:46.750> mean<00:03:47.079> there<00:03:47.229> are<00:03:47.259> ivory

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
they're both I mean there are ivory

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.229 
they're both I mean there are ivory

practical<00:03:56.259> issues<00:03:56.590> yesterday<00:03:57.159> give<00:03:57.819> me

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
practical issues yesterday give me

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.460 
practical issues yesterday give me
examples<00:03:58.449> of<00:03:58.750> where<00:03:58.989> some<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.319> this

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
detection services based on fMRI I don't

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.479 
detection services based on fMRI I don't
think<00:04:20.169> we're<00:04:20.530> ready<00:04:20.650> for<00:04:20.829> it<00:04:21.099> yet<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.340> don't

think we're ready for it yet I don't
think<00:04:21.699> the<00:04:21.880> evidence<00:04:22.240> supports<00:04:22.719> it<00:04:22.870> there<00:04:23.229> is

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
think the evidence supports it there is

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.529 
think the evidence supports it there is
some<00:04:23.650> evidence<00:04:23.800> in<00:04:24.159> support<00:04:24.370> of<00:04:24.729> it<00:04:24.909> but

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
some evidence in support of it but

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.719 
some evidence in support of it but
what's<00:04:25.719> really<00:04:25.960> interesting<00:04:26.110> is<00:04:26.889> these

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
what's really interesting is these

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.930 
what's really interesting is these

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
there was very recently the first

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.350 
there was very recently the first
hearing<00:04:37.599> that<00:04:38.289> kept<00:04:38.710> in<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.669> case<00:04:39.880> in<00:04:40.150> Brooklyn

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
hearing that kept in a case in Brooklyn

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.340

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
that kept such a lie detector

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.560 
that kept such a lie detector
report-out<00:04:43.070> there's<00:04:43.760> another<00:04:44.000> one<00:04:44.210> coming<00:04:44.360> up

report-out there's another one coming up
very<00:04:44.840> soon<00:04:45.140> in<00:04:45.290> Tennessee<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.980> think<00:04:46.610> more<00:04:46.910> will

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
very soon in Tennessee I think more will

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.750 
very soon in Tennessee I think more will
follow<00:04:47.360> we<00:04:48.170> don't<00:04:48.410> have<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.800> luxury<00:04:48.980> of<00:04:49.490> time

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
follow we don't have the luxury of time

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.540 
follow we don't have the luxury of time
to<00:04:50.300> study<00:04:51.170> this<00:04:51.470> for<00:04:51.710> another<00:04:51.920> five<00:04:52.220> or<00:04:52.250> ten

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
to study this for another five or ten

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.280 
to study this for another five or ten
years<00:04:52.790> before<00:04:53.270> making<00:04:53.570> our<00:04:53.690> first<00:04:53.960> decision

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
years before making our first decision

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.410 
years before making our first decision
the<00:04:54.710> decisions<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.430> some<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.270> these<00:04:56.360> areas

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
the decisions and some of these areas

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.400 
the decisions and some of these areas
like<00:04:57.020> lie<00:04:57.230> detection<00:04:57.620> need<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:58.520> be<00:04:58.670> made<00:04:58.850> today

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
like lie detection need to be made today

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.640 
like lie detection need to be made today
so<00:05:00.410> these<00:05:00.560> are<00:05:00.800> questions<00:05:01.460> involving<00:05:02.650> ethical

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
so these are questions involving ethical

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.790 
so these are questions involving ethical
and<00:05:04.070> legal<00:05:04.130> questions<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.270> human<00:05:06.140> society<00:05:06.290> is

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
and legal questions the human society is

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.180 
and legal questions the human society is

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
questions because of this technology

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.660 
questions because of this technology
that's<00:05:15.350> just<00:05:15.590> emerging<00:05:16.040> yeah<00:05:16.220> I<00:05:16.250> mean<00:05:16.430> we've

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
different if we were better at reading
