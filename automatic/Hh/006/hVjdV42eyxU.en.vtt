00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.589
 my pigeons shook in general in general 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.050
 hello to all these thieves today 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.900
 I trained caparol flip ya for four years 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.849
 ago did the video lesson somersault here here 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.160
 Now whether the trend would like more details 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.810
 to make out for a start let's see 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.210
 element of slowdowns are still guys 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.580
 an important trick to previous teachers when 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 I did not know it wet after 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.990
 landings as soon as you have your hands 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.579
 off the ground after the kulby something that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.070
 you don't get them through the side like this 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.079
 bred and through the branches can be higher 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.629
 so that you go to the following items 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.120
 it was easier to be there to kill even somersaults 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.690
 forward and so on and so you have sickening 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 It was 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.989
 inertia of most that is here 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.989
 look about to 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.250
 It is still relatively fine and did 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.250
 earlier finish automatic look 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.629
 You see the hand below the body 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.980
 downstairs stayed on the second element harder 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.980
 getting out is very important 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.570
 well, the last nuance of the guys on kinematics 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.170
 movements to the topic of a coup forward 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.250
 already close once and for all probably 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.649
 be sure to pay attention to 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.840
 so that you do not sneak much body forward 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.909
 for this and need deflection in all departments 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.939
 spine here see what it is about 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.520
 goes land hands and lands 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.929
 leg first so that the gap between them was 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.240
 as little as possible to this 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.670
 ideally strive even less than 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.220
 me on the video right after the hand 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.709
 landed that first leg or both 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.840
 if you do at 2 of course led 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.240
 Flip this actually erased because 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.130
 what will you have height or when you cultivate 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.020
 from the height therefore most are able 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.420
 do from above but cannot do on 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.490
 planes hope water is fineness you 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.679
 understand understand learn how to do on 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.140
 plane so more beautiful you will be 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.240
 rail flip so guys let's still mine 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.429
 old video let's see one of the first 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:10.000
 attempts to somersault a and here we analyze 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:12.730
 Yes, that is, you see, you are very small 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.549
 run hands do not reach forward in the forest 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.340
 element a stretch down your back 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:21.760
 immediately rounded after them go further 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.650
 bent knees naturally fall 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.090
 there is practically no chance to screw it up 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.769
 no tass is too round 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.500
 More precisely does not try everything should be 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.720
 arched from the pelvis and ending 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.540
 upper spine so that 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.400
 you were just too comfortable to turn with 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.680
 figured it out now turn croil 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.109
 fliku 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.390
 actually physically much more 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.430
 comfortable doing rail flip you it will 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.400
 it is much easier to make them literally 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.859
 on relax this element to carry to 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.310
 somersault from the height itself will be possible 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.719
 even a little relax but 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.700
 psychologically definitely harder it 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.700
 do you will be afraid to fall 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.840
 naturally before moving on to elf 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.030
 Lipu need to learn how to do 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.609
 small elevation headquarters bosom either with 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.310
 heights so it will be x logical 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.019
 firstly well, it is easier secondly you already 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.750
 rest assured that you can do something 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.639
 sag well holder and already on rails 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.859
 faces you do not repeat the same you to 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.780
 fall back straight on the obstacle here 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:28.010
 a small hillock for ideally you 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.600
 must learn to make a place 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.760
 here is a small slope so that you have 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.860
 run very large do not take because 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.600
 why do you need him as if heavier 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.060
 will orient better to start 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.630
 two three steps maximum i have to take 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.630
 waltz 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.890
 photos are now son of grass of course do 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.110
 see here on python on asphalt not 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.990
 wants to and because slip above 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.910
 grip odds aren't exactly better at 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.640
 grass is preferably not as wet as 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.340
 this weather on dry grass 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.170
 we really guys support now 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.890
 without input everything is exactly the same as 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.160
 somersault on a plane that is you stretch 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.940
 exactly 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.130
 gives up and from here do not bend on 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.580
 they are so special and natural 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.580
 way 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.810
 then you straighten to max arms 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.610
 naturally knees back and all departments 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.620
 spine you keep straight 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:27.410
 that is, ideally from a place you can even 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:30.500
 will do then that's how I pulled it already 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.560
 back saw that's well, actually better 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.550
 so pull back than it bend and 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.040
 it will be possible because so here 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.980
 barely pushing and hitting is important 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.640
 what else is sure to hold your hands up 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:48.340
 the end that is it is even longer than on 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.340
 scramble off 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.870
 exchange and only then from this 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.940
 handspring hawaii movement why 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.870
 content in america is called something later 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.950
 she already goes to me 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.960
 experiment try on different 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.030
 lanes from different heights reached on 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.000
 small so you already have an item 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.160
 settled into 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.650
 do almost anywhere about how 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.970
 hard then there she staggers infection 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.960
 wow so check 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.640
 letting you knit it thought thought thought 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.920
 well worth it there is no such things 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.720
 can and break 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.370
 Of course I would like to add that the 2 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.650
 high by the easier to learn precisely by 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.900
 such a technique or rail flip or 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:37.950
 somersault with height then another somersault 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:40.620
 to start a mod that you can handle 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.169
 there is somersault wheel on the wheel me two 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.090
 video lesson whole one with mats here with 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.610
 my operator in the second already without mats 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.800
 more detailed can see and 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.169
 when you are used to go to the second 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.090
 element that is the wheel can do 2 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.120
 somersault is exactly the same when you are already more 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.550
 feel comfortable in flight so 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.460
 here the young viewers have come up therefore 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.090
 let's do two somersault and here are two 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.090
 up to 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.599
 and so is it worth saying that somersault 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:15.610
 very important topic especially dug flip when 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.539
 performing some bundles well my 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.539
 favorite show now 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.669
 trained to waved i also have it so 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.099
 look and align these two elements 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.259
 you will understand that you are soaring right above the ground 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:35.809
 then you can still back or waffles 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:39.439
 before the box has not yet learned but already in 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:42.620
 process guys already in process guys he 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:44.930
 said pardon not that camera but oh 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.639
 common bullets vitrail flip or somersault with 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.189
 heights through the alleys it is more 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:52.069
 comfortable child the usual somersault he 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.879
 help you learn 2 culby then do 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:54.860
 more easily 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.680
 He will help to generally understand the main 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.469
 technique somersault and me he is very 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.029
 like so learn to develop and 

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:04.029
 see new guys
