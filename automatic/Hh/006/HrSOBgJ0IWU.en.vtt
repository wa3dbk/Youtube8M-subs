little video someone asked me to run a
3dmark<00:00:09.030> Vantage<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.660> see<00:00:09.870> what<00:00:10.019> score<00:00:10.349> I

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
3dmark Vantage and see what score I

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.289 
3dmark Vantage and see what score I
could<00:00:10.679> come<00:00:10.830> up<00:00:10.860> with<00:00:11.660> for<00:00:12.769> some<00:00:13.769> reason<00:00:14.299> it's

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.920 
ten nine sixty which my cpu score is 12
400<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:30.790> I'm<00:01:30.940> whooping<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:31.800> pretty<00:01:32.800> good<00:01:32.979> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
400 so I'm whooping that pretty good and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.859

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
GPU score 13 691 n minus 13 956 now I

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.430 
GPU score 13 691 n minus 13 956 now I
don't<00:01:43.869> know<00:01:44.080> exactly<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:45.610> they're

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
don't know exactly if they're

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.340 
don't know exactly if they're
overclocked<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.650> their<00:01:47.740> CPU<00:01:48.160> or<00:01:48.190> not<00:01:48.430> but<00:01:49.060> as

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
overclocked and their CPU or not but as

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.320 
overclocked and their CPU or not but as
you<00:01:50.350> can<00:01:50.470> see<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:53.259> right<00:01:53.470> now<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:55.180> the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
you can see as of right now I have the

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:03.450 
you can see as of right now I have the
fast<00:01:55.570> one<00:01:55.930> of<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.080> fastest<00:01:56.820> x4<00:02:00.660> phenoms

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
fast one of the fastest x4 phenoms

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.649 
fast one of the fastest x4 phenoms
with<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.180> 4890<00:02:04.690> combo<00:02:06.420> running<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.540> that's

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
with the 4890 combo running and that's

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.610 
with the 4890 combo running and that's
running<00:02:07.869> at<00:02:08.050> 3.6<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:10.110> others<00:02:11.110> probably<00:02:11.380> have

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
running at 3.6 so others probably have

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.470 
running at 3.6 so others probably have
higher<00:02:11.890> scores<00:02:12.130> but<00:02:12.700> they<00:02:12.819> need<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.060> post<00:02:13.270> them

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
higher scores but they need to post them

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.610 
higher scores but they need to post them
online<00:02:14.490> cuz<00:02:15.490> on<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.030> official<00:02:16.390> site<00:02:16.470> with<00:02:17.470> my

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.740 
resident evil 5 benchmark to show you
how<00:02:45.459> much<00:02:45.519> smoother<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.239> thing<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.600> running

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
how much smoother that thing is running

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.509 
how much smoother that thing is running
now<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.230> i<00:02:47.410> got<00:02:47.500> those<00:02:47.769> tight<00:02:48.010> timings<00:02:48.430> on

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
now that i got those tight timings on

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.820 
now that i got those tight timings on
the<00:02:48.610> ram<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.750> cpu<00:02:50.170> running<00:02:50.290> all<00:02:50.530> good<00:02:50.709> and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
the ram and the cpu running all good and

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.940 
the ram and the cpu running all good and
everything<00:02:51.100> like<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:51.570> i'll<00:02:52.769> post<00:02:53.769> that
