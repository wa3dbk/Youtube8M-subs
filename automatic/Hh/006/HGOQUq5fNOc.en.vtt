00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.330
 hello all good again welcome 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.920
 to the channel and as you can see in the title 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.230
 this time I come to talk about 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.809
 a box that is a subscription 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.879
 monthly and I'm going to leave all the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.359
 Company information below 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.910
 video and it's called beauty of fire the 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.500
 so it looks like this and it's basically 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.109
 as many know these are 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.740
 monthly subscriptions and the cost of 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.560
 this is 12 dollars you can 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.360
 You can cancel the subscription when 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.120
 when you want and I 'm going to 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.640
 show him what I 'm taking the account then 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:46.000
 and another very important point that remains 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.590
 well from 4 to 5 to 5 products either for 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.250
 Care of hair care of 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.140
 our skin or those that are cosmetic and 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.449
 well in the box of the part of 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.430
 inside looks like this comes with what it is 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.070
 and in the back of what is the 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.019
 limit the company and in the part of 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.820
 back brings what it contains in the box 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.190
 and the prices of each of the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.750
 products that they send and then the first thing 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.470
 what I'm wearing is this one that's bright 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.799
 hunger 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.250
 this is the small size and then this one 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.370
 basically what it does 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.280
 is let 's say if we have some hook 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.590
 something we can offer it that way or also 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.950
 bring this from here that you can put what 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.920
 that leaves a mirror and this is to fill 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.770
 our makeup as brochita 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.170
 basically this way he keeps it and already for 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.780
 remove it is pulled up it makes me 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.880
 very practical more when one leaves 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.430
 trip or something to have it in what it is 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.850
 our bathroom in the mirror for some 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.830
 emergency or something is very practical and 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 the price of this as I tell you this is 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.050
 the small size there are another six is 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.200
 available in two sizes as the size 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.590
 of the price of this pardon is 469 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.630
 I think it's pretty practical and what 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.470
 next that comes to me in the box are 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.620
 this voice are wipes that are for not 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.390
 remove what is your accumulated oil 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.520
 after sometimes many hours having 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.510
 our makeup because this one already 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.549
 help remove the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.720
 what is the shine to our face 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:30.519
 contains what are 50 pieces of paper and the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:34.000
 price that they sell this is 199 because I 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.519
 It looks very nice and the packaging also 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.890
 it's pretty practical, like 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.610
 to bring our portfolio to our 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.799
 cosmetiquera then very good and for the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.530
 amount that are 50 was more than 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.629
 excellent and good the next thing that I 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.480
 it arrived is this 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:56.769
 lip liner of the brand model and 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.440
 Well, I'm going to show you the eyeliner and 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.799
 Well basically it looks like this is a size 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.400
 unique and as you see here brings what is a 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.139
 sharpener for when the eyeliner is 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.940
 the tip ends here we have it 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:15.940
 and we take it out and the color can show 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.489
 it is a very beautiful skin color a tone 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.579
 quite practical for when we use 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.400
 without lips not very strong and the price of 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.540
 this one between 20 dollars for the price that 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.269
 they sell it then 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.159
 very very good and I sincerely never 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.250
 I had heard of this company but 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:35.859
 crazy to mistreat new things that's why 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.400
 these boxes are not because things come 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.980
 that you do not know what they are or what 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.840
 I know myself and well the following ones that I 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.920
 I wear 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.280
 these two our quotes from the brand the 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:57.340
 three and then basically these are two 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.739
 samples and that are mint are more 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.319
 some moisturizing wipes for the 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.810
 body like for example when we feel 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.530
 stress or we feel tired like that 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.319
 so this helps you to like 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.730
 relax a little bit what is the body and 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.040
 It is very good for the skin that are 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.430
 dry or dry and they are basically 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.910
 these two and the price they sell the 24 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.070
 wipes is 999 so to me 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.880
 two more three appointments came our nothing 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:34.229
 more and as I finally got that 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.840
 is an eye shadow and this one of the brand 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:41.620
 brace in cosmetics comes like this looks like this 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.650
 it brings a lip and there comes the name 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.050
 of the company and this is the green tone and 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.229
 sweet and the size that came to me is from 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.300
 three grammy cough can small and by the 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:58.030
 full size of this one they sell it for 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:02.280
 749 that of 0.18 ounces I'm going to show you 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:06.070
 the tone well in a tone like skin color 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.150
 quite natural then let's see how 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:13.570
 I see myself and if it is very natural and feels 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.390
 super soft and throw like a shine 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.510
 very nice is here I hope eurocup 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.610
 also very visual very natural then and 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.940
 Well basically this was what I 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:28.330
 I carry in the bag in the box and then 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.640
 this is the box for the month of April and 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.590
 Well, basically, it was all like 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.340
 I always tell them any question or 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.900
 doubt let me know in a comment and 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.540
 I also think that leaving all the 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.490
 information of the company that is in the 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.020

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.540
 that there sometimes I put things very 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.260
 important later but I liked them 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.060
