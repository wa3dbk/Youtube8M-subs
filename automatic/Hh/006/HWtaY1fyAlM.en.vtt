00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 welcome from the hp discover 2013 as 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.820
 bastler with the hp seebuck 14 that is 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.460
 the world's first ultrabook with amd 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.660
 firepro so a workstation as 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 ultrabooks, so to speak 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.560
 dell has done a little bit now 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.090
 I heard but here we have 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.240
 his evening the firepro in it again 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.100
 intel graphics intel processor to one 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.170
 webcam and microphone a touch screen 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.779
 ie can also how the cembra 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.939
 cause or other things 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.920
 but especially for cat designers 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.960
 this should be exciting because 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.610
 Here, for example, in the car for a short time 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.899
 change or if we do similar things 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.700
 which one might be traveling app for 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.500
 Of course this will have to be corrected 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.930
 to cope wonderfully 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.250
 we have a keyboard here 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.239
 which is also to look very beautiful 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.489
 backlit as you like 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.920
 seen with the little lip here 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.940
 with that as well then according to mouse 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.239
 is usable as in the song book of 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.430
 hp a metal case which I am very beautiful 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.840
 We feel like we have many connections 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.510
 Professional field also of meaning 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.339
 fÃ©in smartcard reader usb3 vega and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.930
 kensington on the left 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.420
 side on the front we only have 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.340
 a few status leds otherwise 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.650
 wedge-shaped it slightly cold- shaped 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.170
 design then an accordingly 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.659
 headphone jack display port usb 3 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 again twice a network connection 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.909
 the doc and of course electricity is not allowed 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.460
 absence 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.430
 otherwise we still have here from the outside 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.560
 nice rubberized design what i like to 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.070
 all my bus would have felt great 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.159
 on 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.950
 With the metal outside rubber looks 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.079
 also very good by heart, but like already 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.610
 the 1 0 down because they feel 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.350
 also a few interesting things 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.360
 like for example that one the complete one 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.040
 bottom can make um to the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.840
 festplatten then ran everything to come and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.649
 maybe they also exchange 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.490
 and so on sd card reader 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.380
 correspondingly also available here below 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.820
 among the other connections we would have 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.350
 we would not have seen that at all 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.670
 from and also look at us and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.740
 Otherwise the possibility here 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.570
 one 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.950
 flat agro here complete one 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.220
 That's why you see 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.290
 here 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.159
 also these little plastic holes 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.240
 we can do that accordingly 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.759
 correspondingly even more battery power 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.190
 rausholen because a workstation needs 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.989
 of course, a bit of electricity if we have them 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.670
 weight wonderfully with one hand 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.050
 hinged and that was it 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.470
 even with the first impression of the 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.819
 cover of discover 2030 with the hp 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.560
 seebuck 14 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.050
 if you need more power with 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.120
 Photo by nvidia for example 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.130
 You can also do this 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.620
 accordingly the others on the right 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.750
 devices but until then should be the same 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.510
 zone have the firepro sufficient in the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.600
 cult single ultrabook allegedly as 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.640
 vision here from hp until next time 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.480
 My name is Oscar and that was that 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.480
