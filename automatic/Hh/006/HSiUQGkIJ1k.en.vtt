00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.569
 artem and i'm here a little sick but this is not 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.090
 relieves me from doing 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.059
 guides for you and up guys about 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.790
 there is no sound on it because 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.060
 connections with the new patch that were made 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.189
 days the sound disappears but at least they 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.920
 increased the number of tickets to the server and 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.050
 that at least it pleases about and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.820
 claims that they will not 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.449
 engage in any other projects 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.030
 until I finish bf4 they seem to me 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.910
 nothing else will do for their career 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.770
 because bf4 they seem to me with such 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.530
 pace finish seven years later 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.930
 probably if with each patch they 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.680
 correct one mistake but allow as 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.770
 at least three 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.420
 and still wild sags fps and lags and 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.910
 well balanced shaft which 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.739
 kills with one bullet 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.500
 but still I had the strength to do 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.989
 this guide is therefore enough lyrical 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.340
 departures so today we 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.140
 consider such a wonderful 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.880
 singapore light machine gun 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.700
 street name ultimax 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.159
 100 or as it is called in bf4 empty 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.869
 mk5 multi-max 100 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.420
 this is singapore manual machine gun 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.790
 using cartridge 556 nato 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.759
 developed singapore technologies 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.409
 engineering lcd engineering team under 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.509
 by james sullivan 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.530
 participated in the development of machines 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.310
 ar-15 and the famous m16 this machine gun 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.740
 used in the war in afghan 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.229
 and now consider multi-max in bf4 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.210
 ultimax is originally a manual machine gun 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.460
 only available for support fighters 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.079
 it is from him that your path begins 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.880
 opening barrels and gadgets for 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.820
 machine gunner 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.710
 look at the characteristics of the bushes 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.119
 standard damage maximum 25 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.130
 minimum 18 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.939
 the beginning of falling damage from eight meters 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.030
 endings at 65 meters rate of fire 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.630
 590 minute shots are quite low 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.479
 collect rate of fire 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.369
 650 bullet velocity 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.039
 meters per second using 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.599
 strangler she cut to as much as 300 meters 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:13.310
 for seconds that is 330 meters for a second 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.370
 possession of a bullet 15 meters per second in 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.800
 square magazine size 46 cartridge 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.670
 patronage 556 nato 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.269
 same patronage m16 card recharge 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.000
 empty recharges in 3.9 seconds it 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.620
 very slowly and recharge with the rest 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.310
 cartridges in the store 2.75 seconds this 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.610
 also not very fast return here 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.640
 things are wonderful return up 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.690
 0.25 is a very small task 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.370
 horizontal return 0.2 in both directions 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.799
 if you compare the mouth with other lungs 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.959
 machine guns we can see that 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.630
 bushes longer maximum distance 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.360
 more than the initial speed of a bullet and 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.489
 less scatter when shooting still 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.680
 and a little less recoil 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.870
 that is, for the first machine guns it 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.459
 great because if you're new and 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.340
 people are playing against you 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.670
 machine guns 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.459
 then you have a chance to make them and now 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.500
 maps and modes which resist to 5 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.580
 will show itself as a leader 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.860
 this is of course a bunch of teams and 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.849
 superiority but you have them 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.000
 some problems due 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:31.209
 rate of fire because resist to 5 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.010
 suitable for long and medium distances 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.610
 long distance empty 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.519
 just demolishing the tower you yourself will 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.930
 shocked how powerful on the near 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.450
 distance you can kill the enemy 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.870
 if only you are very lucky 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:51.030
 either your opponent well therefore I recommend 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.459
 modes such as extermination and capture 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.360
 so now the recommendation of the modules for 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.049
 stand back to 5 there are a few fees this wounds 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.650
 tenga 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.349
 or high licked far in people 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.599
 we first consider the random sborochku 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.940
 sight any 1 short that is, besides 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.150
 taro or starved accessories 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.700
 lt lu or flashlight barrel muzzle brake 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.769
 or ordinary from compensators use not 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.530
 will be 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.510
 economical handle help you feel 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.600
 hold his weapon 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.670
 nevermind better shooting from the hip trying 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.580
 hill for lovers to sit on the spot 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.310
 sight 4 faucet or single 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:36.140
 using 1 file accessories 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.440
 lt lu or magna ps2 thickened or 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.810
 capacitor to reduce scatter 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.750
 Well, in place of the handles of course lead 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.280
 bipod to be honest with this machine gun 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.220
 I do not really recommend the second build 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.040
 but it still bother you well, on this 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.520
 thanks for watching subscribe 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.560
 put likes 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.350
 and we'll see you next 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.250
 why write in comments as well 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.250
 good luck to all 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.050
 everything is about Maidan
