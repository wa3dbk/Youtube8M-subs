00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
at this time we can divide another time

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:19.620 
at this time we can divide another time
in<00:02:10.250> two<00:02:10.400> parts<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:12.860> one<00:02:13.130> in<00:02:13.340> four<00:02:13.640> parts

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
keep on cutting let's divide another

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.680 
keep on cutting let's divide another
time<00:02:29.240> this<00:02:29.540> part<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.260> leg

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
when they are big we can cut diamond off

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.550 
when they are big we can cut diamond off
after<00:02:42.820> having<00:02:43.120> cut<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.450> rabbit<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:43.870> pieces<00:02:44.320> we

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
after having cut the rabbit in pieces we
