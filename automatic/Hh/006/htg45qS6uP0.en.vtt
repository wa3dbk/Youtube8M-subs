00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.300
 Trains in the changing metropolitan area railways 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:13.830
 It is metropolitan area rail topics 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:18.650
 This time, a large scale was conducted last week from late night to early morning in the underground section of the Odakyu Electric Railway Shimokitazawa yard. 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.650
 It was in close contact with the induction training of such passengers 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:32.550
 After 1 am on the 15th 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.550
 The final train will leave from Odakyu Line Shimokitazawa Station . 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:49.539
 A large induction train is about to start in the station where the shutter is closed 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:55.409
 In this training assumption that train over a long period of time trouble occurs between near stops 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.409
 Station staff and driver and 200 people participate and are performed 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:04.380
 These underground trains also use induction trains using vehicles on sales routes. 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.380
 It is the first time as Odakyu Railway 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:20.800
 Notification of trouble occurrence arrived from station director's room 3 command office 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:22.659
 Station crews quickly go to the site to guide passengers from inside the train to the ground 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:29.819
 Need yes 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.819
 Now that no break in the array has been found, the wilderness will go to relief 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:50.200
 Because underground does not know state of the surroundings even in the daytime, it is probably 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:53.200
 At the time, I think that I feel more uneasy than on the ground. 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:58.439
 I can act properly before it happens 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.439
 Pre- order ^ especially there was snow etc more 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:10.509
 It is not the Asama induction method 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:16.930
 Takano appointed captain to beginner flowers to be umbrella eagle today 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:21.810
 First of all in this training assuming an evacuation distance of 320 meters for 170 passengers. 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:27.709
 You need to calmly guide the passengers to a safe place 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.709
 For that purpose, it is important to repeat training regularly 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:42.100
 For example, if it is the first party in such a case, people are as today 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.170
 Lr 4 I think another calm behavior of N'n'o customers that said they whether really take Masu' 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.580
 This kind of firefighting police from now on 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.470
 Or performed it is together, if everyone needed training 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.470
 I think I want to stop I would like to 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:02.380
 Underground section no longer apt for urban railways 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.620
 How safe if you if trouble here has occurred 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:10.560
 Smoothly guide passengers 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.560
 It seems to be a major issue for railway companies
