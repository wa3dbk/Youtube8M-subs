00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
what I got here today is an echo GT 2103

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.920 
what I got here today is an echo GT 2103
grass<00:00:04.440> trimmer<00:00:04.890> it's<00:00:05.759> very<00:00:06.029> similar<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.569> the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
grass trimmer it's very similar to the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.190 
grass trimmer it's very similar to the
GT<00:00:07.400> 1100<00:00:08.400> as<00:00:08.519> well<00:00:08.730> now<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.630> problem<00:00:10.080> with

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
GT 1100 as well now the problem with

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.169 
GT 1100 as well now the problem with
this<00:00:10.349> machine<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.340> bogs<00:00:11.610> down

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
this machine is that it bogs down

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.930 
this machine is that it bogs down
I've<00:00:12.330> tried<00:00:12.630> adjusting<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> carb<00:00:13.620> many<00:00:14.549> times

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
I've tried adjusting the carb many times

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.330 
I've tried adjusting the carb many times
and<00:00:15.299> there's<00:00:15.719> still<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> problem<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.039> just

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
and there's still a problem so I just

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.700 
and there's still a problem so I just
did<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.640> two<00:00:17.789> screws<00:00:18.240> down<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.230> low<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
did the two screws down here the low and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.830 
did the two screws down here the low and
the<00:00:19.890> high<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> idling<00:00:21.689> and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the high and this is for the idling and

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380 
the high and this is for the idling and
to<00:00:22.800> no<00:00:22.920> avail<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.670> I'm<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> take<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
to no avail so I'm going to take the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.990 
to no avail so I'm going to take the
carburetor<00:00:24.750> off<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.380> check<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.369> diaphragms

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
carburetor off and check the diaphragms

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.050 
carburetor off and check the diaphragms
in<00:00:27.240> there<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.349> first<00:00:28.650> start<00:00:28.980> by<00:00:29.160> removing<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
in there so first start by removing the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.749 
in there so first start by removing the
air<00:00:30.240> breather<00:00:30.630> cover<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:32.040> one<00:00:32.369> screw<00:00:32.700> is

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
air breather cover just one screw is

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.440 
air breather cover just one screw is
going<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.000> come<00:00:33.120> off<00:00:35.120> next<00:00:36.120> you'll<00:00:36.270> need<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
going to come off next you'll need to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.180 
going to come off next you'll need to
remove<00:00:36.780> these<00:00:36.989> two<00:00:37.050> screws<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
remove these two screws here with a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:48.840 
remove these two screws here with a
Phillips<00:00:38.640> screwdriver

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.560 

so<00:00:49.850> you<00:00:49.910> can<00:00:50.120> pull<00:00:50.360> this<00:00:50.539> cover<00:00:51.140> off<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.590> carb

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
so you can pull this cover off the carb

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.660 
so you can pull this cover off the carb
next<00:00:53.570> remove<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:53.870> throttle<00:00:54.469> cable<00:00:54.649> from<00:00:55.430> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
next remove the throttle cable from the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.329 
next remove the throttle cable from the
carburetor<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:56.570> just<00:00:56.809> basically<00:00:57.129> push<00:00:58.129> out

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
carburetor so just basically push out

00:00:58.339 --> 00:00:59.889 
carburetor so just basically push out
the<00:00:58.430> cable<00:00:58.760> like<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.059> and<00:00:59.300> lift<00:00:59.449> up<00:00:59.690> and

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
the cable like that and lift up and

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.740 
the cable like that and lift up and
that's<00:01:00.530> off<00:01:00.800> all<00:01:01.640> that's<00:01:01.969> left<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.329> remove<00:01:02.540> now

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
that's off all that's left to remove now

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.109 
that's off all that's left to remove now
is<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.019> fuel<00:01:03.229> line<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:04.309> usually<00:01:04.759> just<00:01:05.000> by

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
is the fuel line so usually just by

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.560 
is the fuel line so usually just by
simply<00:01:05.600> twisting<00:01:06.229> it'll<00:01:06.470> come<00:01:06.680> off<00:01:07.540> now<00:01:08.540> a

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
simply twisting it'll come off now a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.480 
simply twisting it'll come off now a
closer<00:01:08.869> look<00:01:09.080> at<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:09.440> carb<00:01:09.740> shows<00:01:10.009> it's<00:01:10.280> a

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
closer look at this carb shows it's a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.020 
closer look at this carb shows it's a
sama<00:01:11.180> carburetor<00:01:11.780> made<00:01:12.110> in<00:01:12.259> China<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:12.979> if<00:01:13.909> you

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
sama carburetor made in China and if you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.060 
sama carburetor made in China and if you
look<00:01:14.210> right<00:01:14.509> down<00:01:14.750> inside<00:01:14.960> this<00:01:15.500> hole<00:01:15.740> here

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
look right down inside this hole here

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.719 
look right down inside this hole here
says<00:01:16.909> c1u<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.740> that's<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.160> series<00:01:19.550> of

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
says c1u so that's the series of

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.690 
says c1u so that's the series of
carburetor<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.770> exact<00:01:21.770> model<00:01:22.009> number<00:01:22.670> of

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
carburetor and the exact model number of

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.779 
carburetor and the exact model number of
the<00:01:22.880> carb<00:01:23.149> here<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.690> k-12<00:01:24.580> nineteen<00:01:25.580> eight

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
the carb here is a k-12 nineteen eight

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.940 
the carb here is a k-12 nineteen eight
so<00:01:26.450> when<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.720> go<00:01:26.810> get<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:27.020> car<00:01:27.320> kit<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:27.800> need

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
so when you go get a car kit you need

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.210 
so when you go get a car kit you need
these<00:01:28.130> letters<00:01:28.490> here<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.530> these<00:01:30.530> digits<00:01:31.009> here

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
these letters here and these digits here

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.880 
these letters here and these digits here
as<00:01:31.369> well<00:01:32.229> now<00:01:33.229> I'll<00:01:33.350> just<00:01:33.409> take<00:01:33.679> your

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
as well now I'll just take your

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:47.250 
as well now I'll just take your
carburetor<00:01:34.340> apart

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.420 

there's<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.310> metering<00:01:48.700> diaphragm<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:51.100> said

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
there's the metering diaphragm this said

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.130 
there's the metering diaphragm this said
die<00:01:51.610> if<00:01:51.730> I'm<00:01:51.910> here<00:01:52.150> looks<00:01:52.360> good<00:01:52.570> it's<00:01:52.750> nice<00:01:52.900> and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
die if I'm here looks good it's nice and

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.250 
die if I'm here looks good it's nice and
soft<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.770> it's<00:01:54.010> round<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.720> I'm<00:01:55.780> not<00:01:55.960> going<00:01:56.170> to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
soft and it's round so I'm not going to

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.510 
soft and it's round so I'm not going to
replace<00:01:56.500> this<00:01:56.860> one<00:01:59.010> next<00:02:00.010> I'll<00:02:00.250> pick<00:02:00.400> apart

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
replace this one next I'll pick apart

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.240 
replace this one next I'll pick apart
the<00:02:00.880> other<00:02:01.000> side

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.699 

now<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.610> simply<00:02:09.030> remove<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.110> whole<00:02:10.350> cover

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
now just simply remove this whole cover

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.309 
now just simply remove this whole cover
and<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> pump<00:02:13.560> diaphragm<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:15.319> can

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
and this is the pump diaphragm I can

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.420 
and this is the pump diaphragm I can
tell<00:02:16.500> there's<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.800> problem<00:02:17.069> with<00:02:17.280> this

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
tell there's a problem with this

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.970 
tell there's a problem with this
diaphragm<00:02:17.760> because<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.480> tabs<00:02:18.830> should<00:02:19.830> be

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
diaphragm because the tabs should be

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.180 
diaphragm because the tabs should be
shut<00:02:20.280> flat<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.990> body<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.470> carb<00:02:22.770> to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
shut flat on the body of the carb to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.750 
shut flat on the body of the carb to
seal<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.670> holes<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.209> for<00:02:24.989> some<00:02:25.140> reason

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
seal the holes and for some reason

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.990 
seal the holes and for some reason
they're<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:27.090> sticking<00:02:27.720> up<00:02:27.959> like<00:02:28.020> that

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
they're just sticking up like that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.900 
they're just sticking up like that
that's<00:02:30.000> probably<00:02:30.420> from<00:02:30.900> wear<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.170> tear<00:02:31.560> or

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
that's probably from wear and tear or

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.790

and now line up the holes here they only
go<00:05:43.580> one<00:05:43.880> way<00:05:43.910> and<00:05:49.450> I'll<00:05:50.450> put<00:05:50.660> the<00:05:50.750> screws<00:05:51.050> back

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
go one way and I'll put the screws back

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.890 
go one way and I'll put the screws back
on<00:05:51.850> make<00:05:52.850> sure<00:05:52.880> you<00:05:53.180> tighten<00:05:53.390> up<00:05:53.510> the<00:05:53.690> cover

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
on make sure you tighten up the cover

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.700 
on make sure you tighten up the cover
evenly<00:05:54.410> so<00:05:54.560> I'll<00:05:54.620> just<00:05:54.770> snug<00:05:55.039> one<00:05:55.280> end

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
evenly so I'll just snug one end

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.370 
evenly so I'll just snug one end
and<00:05:57.000> then<00:05:58.000> tighten<00:05:58.450> up<00:05:58.510> the<00:05:58.720> other<00:05:58.870> end<00:05:59.170> and

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
and then tighten up the other end and

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.010 
and then tighten up the other end and

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
then tighten up the other screw what

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.350 
then tighten up the other screw what
this<00:06:05.200> does<00:06:05.380> is<00:06:05.560> it<00:06:05.710> puts<00:06:05.740> on<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.400> cover<00:06:06.730> evenly

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
this does is it puts on the cover evenly

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.280 
this does is it puts on the cover evenly
and<00:06:07.570> prevents<00:06:08.410> air<00:06:08.590> leaks<00:06:08.950> or<00:06:09.190> fuel<00:06:09.790> leaks<00:06:10.290> now

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
and prevents air leaks or fuel leaks now

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.570 
and prevents air leaks or fuel leaks now
for<00:06:11.500> the<00:06:11.590> pump<00:06:11.830> side<00:06:12.070> you<00:06:12.280> would<00:06:12.400> have<00:06:12.550> a

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
for the pump side you would have a

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.760 
for the pump side you would have a
gasket<00:06:13.090> like<00:06:13.240> this<00:06:13.420> and<00:06:13.720> you<00:06:14.170> would<00:06:14.320> put<00:06:14.590> this

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
gasket like this and you would put this

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.340 
gasket like this and you would put this
on<00:06:14.980> first<00:06:15.280> to<00:06:16.270> your<00:06:16.480> cover<00:06:16.860> like<00:06:17.860> that<00:06:19.320> now<00:06:20.320> I

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
on first to your cover like that now I

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.680 
on first to your cover like that now I
have<00:06:20.590> another<00:06:20.890> diaphragm<00:06:21.670> to<00:06:22.060> replace<00:06:22.420> the

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
have another diaphragm to replace the

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.750 
have another diaphragm to replace the
old<00:06:22.780> one<00:06:23.020> and<00:06:23.230> it's<00:06:23.350> made<00:06:23.560> of<00:06:23.710> a<00:06:23.830> thin<00:06:24.430> plastic

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
old one and it's made of a thin plastic

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.200 
old one and it's made of a thin plastic
and<00:06:25.590> I<00:06:26.590> would<00:06:26.770> reinsert<00:06:27.370> this<00:06:27.700> one<00:06:27.940> on<00:06:28.090> the

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
and I would reinsert this one on the

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.490 
and I would reinsert this one on the
cover<00:06:28.420> as<00:06:28.630> well<00:06:30.630> they<00:06:31.630> only<00:06:31.810> go<00:06:32.080> in<00:06:32.230> one<00:06:32.260> way

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
cover as well they only go in one way

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.170 
cover as well they only go in one way
because<00:06:32.980> all<00:06:33.130> the<00:06:33.250> holes<00:06:33.460> will<00:06:33.970> line<00:06:34.000> up<00:06:36.180> just

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
because all the holes will line up just

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.240 
because all the holes will line up just
like<00:06:37.330> that

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
like that

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.460 
like that
so<00:06:39.250> now<00:06:39.370> you<00:06:39.430> can<00:06:39.730> grab<00:06:39.910> your<00:06:40.180> cover<00:06:40.600> keep<00:06:41.230> it

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
so now you can grab your cover keep it

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.400 
so now you can grab your cover keep it
upside<00:06:42.160> down<00:06:42.190> like<00:06:42.340> this<00:06:42.580> and<00:06:43.230> insert<00:06:44.230> the

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
upside down like this and insert the

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.860 
upside down like this and insert the
side<00:06:44.710> with<00:06:45.250> the<00:06:45.340> throttle<00:06:45.580> mechanism<00:06:46.330> toward

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
side with the throttle mechanism toward

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.860 
side with the throttle mechanism toward
the<00:06:47.110> screw<00:06:47.800> here<00:06:48.070> and<00:06:48.390> you<00:06:49.390> may<00:06:49.540> want<00:06:49.720> to

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
the screw here and you may want to

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.530 
the screw here and you may want to
depress<00:06:50.290> this<00:06:50.950> a<00:06:51.010> bit<00:06:51.340> when<00:06:51.490> you<00:06:51.610> do<00:06:51.790> it<00:06:51.910> makes

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
depress this a bit when you do it makes

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.990 
depress this a bit when you do it makes
it<00:06:52.690> a<00:06:52.750> bit<00:06:52.930> easier<00:06:52.960> to<00:06:53.350> put<00:06:53.530> on<00:06:53.680> and<00:06:54.400> now<00:06:54.700> just

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
it a bit easier to put on and now just

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.180 
it a bit easier to put on and now just
line<00:06:55.660> up<00:06:55.690> the<00:06:55.900> holes<00:06:56.230> till<00:06:56.680> it<00:06:56.800> locks<00:06:56.980> in<00:06:59.190> until

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
line up the holes till it locks in until
