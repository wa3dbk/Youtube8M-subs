00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
hundred forty jolts of caffeine now what

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
hundred forty jolts of caffeine now what
a<00:01:00.510> measurement<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.050> jolt<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.470> I<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.800> no<00:01:02.160> idea

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
a measurement of jolt is I have no idea

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.010 
a measurement of jolt is I have no idea
whatsoever<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.420> apparently<00:01:03.750> there's<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
whatsoever but apparently there's a

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:11.510 
whatsoever but apparently there's a
hundred<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.440> forty<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.920> them<00:01:05.009> oh<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.490> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
hundred and forty of them oh and then I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.969 
hundred and forty of them oh and then I
guess<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> side<00:01:12.180> its<00:01:12.450> power<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.860> how

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
guess on the side its power I like how

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.560 
guess on the side its power I like how
they've<00:01:14.130> done<00:01:14.160> this<00:01:14.430> power<00:01:14.700> remaining<00:01:15.300> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
they've done this power remaining and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.850 
they've done this power remaining and
they've<00:01:15.660> got<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.020> little<00:01:16.110> meter<00:01:18.860> clearly

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
they've got like a little meter clearly

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.080 
they've got like a little meter clearly
too<00:01:20.009> much<00:01:20.190> of<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.610> would<00:01:20.759> imagine<00:01:20.880> would

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
too much of this I would imagine would

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.380 
too much of this I would imagine would

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.910 
clear it would be very it would be very
cool<00:03:04.510> if<00:03:04.570> it<00:03:04.750> was<00:03:04.810> actually<00:03:05.050> a<00:03:05.200> silver<00:03:05.650> color

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.659 
drink all of it
but<00:04:35.380> today's<00:04:35.590> random<00:04:35.950> spot<00:04:36.190> we're<00:04:36.370> having<00:04:36.610> a

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
but today's random spot we're having a

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.909 
but today's random spot we're having a
look<00:04:36.820> at<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.240> jolt<00:04:37.630> silver<00:04:38.200> energy<00:04:38.650> drink

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
look at the jolt silver energy drink

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.810 
look at the jolt silver energy drink
it's<00:04:39.640> positive<00:04:40.180> reinforcement<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:41.820> it's

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
it's positive reinforcement and it's

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.240 
it's positive reinforcement and it's
also<00:04:43.150> positively<00:04:43.690> full<00:04:44.350> of<00:04:44.500> caffeine<00:04:44.919> no

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
doubt 140 jolt again whatever that means

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.950 
doubt 140 jolt again whatever that means
