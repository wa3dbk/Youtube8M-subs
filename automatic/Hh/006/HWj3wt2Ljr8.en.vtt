00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
as big as the liquors and I think

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.150 
as big as the liquors and I think
they're<00:00:24.390> not<00:00:24.570> else<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:25.050> bigger<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.680> way

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
they're not else is bigger they are way

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.150

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and I think their depth because the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.130 
and I think their depth because the
lakers<00:00:37.260> bench<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:38.210> not<00:00:39.210> there<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.899> no

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
lakers bench is not there to have no

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.869 
lakers bench is not there to have no
depth<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.680> I'm<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> upset<00:00:41.790> in

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
depth and I'm going with the upset in

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.319 
depth and I'm going with the upset in
this<00:00:42.059> series<00:00:42.800> jet<00:00:43.800> how<00:00:44.550> strongly<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.239> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
this series jet how strongly do you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.170 
this series jet how strongly do you
disagree<00:00:45.629> oh<00:00:46.050> very<00:00:46.680> strongly<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.309> think<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
disagree oh very strongly I think you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.549 
disagree oh very strongly I think you
know<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.480> size<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.020> talent<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
know the size and the talent of the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.459 
know the size and the talent of the
Lakers<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.420> overall<00:00:51.750> when<00:00:51.989> Kobe<00:00:52.289> was

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
Lakers and I think overall when Kobe was

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.229 
Lakers and I think overall when Kobe was
out<00:00:52.649> he<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.250> an<00:00:53.370> opportunity<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.120> how

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
out he got an opportunity to see how

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.729 
out he got an opportunity to see how
well<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.530> interior<00:00:56.219> play<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.809> thought

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
well the interior play was I thought

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.930 
well the interior play was I thought
that<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:59.039> big<00:00:59.870> it<00:01:00.870> was<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.219> it<00:01:02.219> was<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.370> timely

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
that was big it was a it was a timely

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.390 
that was big it was a it was a timely
injury<00:01:03.420> meaning<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.739> gave<00:01:05.010> them<00:01:05.250> an

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
injury meaning that it gave them an

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.399 
injury meaning that it gave them an
opportunity<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:06.570> games<00:01:07.080> actually

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
opportunity to see when games actually

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.100 
opportunity to see when games actually
still<00:01:07.920> mattered<00:01:08.430> how<00:01:08.939> bynum<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.510> gasol<00:01:09.630> can

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
still mattered how bynum and gasol can

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.410 
still mattered how bynum and gasol can
still<00:01:10.380> dominate<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.189> times<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.790> i<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.299> that

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
still dominate at times and i think that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.789 
still dominate at times and i think that
will<00:01:12.570> give<00:01:12.750> them<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> confidence<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.590> take

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
will give them the confidence to take

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.070 
will give them the confidence to take
