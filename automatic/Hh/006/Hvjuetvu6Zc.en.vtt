 There's also something where you can do that 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.319
 looks here already usual things that 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.670
 one that I'm pretty bad at that 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.410
 play or just 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.209
 played through and pretty much 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.519
 have relinquished related players 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.989
 so comparable yes another 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.989
 It's just that I'm the new things 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.410
 Now here, too, can easily buy that 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.450
 I can buy the things via pc now 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.730
 or ipad tablet and that i do the things 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.799
 my xbox will be at home 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.299
 or I let her on when I did 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.340
 'm on the road and just from looking after 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.230
 on the outside , but so now I have 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.190
 bock on batman and then he starts that 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.380
 from here that would be for example 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.510
 the work - just when you to 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.510
 example, the walking dead wants to start 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.040
 So then you do not right click then 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.810
 Do one left then yes I can now 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.019
 play player trailer here 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.690
 or just play xbox on xbox 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.980
 session_ID leave if this yes we 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.980
 we want to leave the xbox meeting 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.810
 so and now is just on my xbox 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.810
 The walking dead started 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:59.680
 a game with 100 years of walking a year 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:02.799
 dead so hard to get 100% yes 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.209
 In any case, that was not it 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.079
 not yet, by and large though 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.500
 I 'm not mistaken I have it 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.500
 to forget 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:22.740
 we have one thing we think 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:24.270
 forget the xbox control yes that 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.520
 is actually a tablet now 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.680
 function here 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.120
 I do not have a touchscreen pc worth 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.940
 Monika does not reward the whole thing for 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.620
 me but that is a tablet function 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.570
 but with the tablet as 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.610
 controller can play 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.360
 whatever the reason is 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.820
 become a kind of view function 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.190
 that means, as you all know, in the eu 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.229
 yes there is this little controller with 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.690
 the screen in there and you should stop 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.360
 next touchscreen the part again 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.740
 extra languages ​​and blue and blood and yes 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.050
 That would be the last renewal 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:04.290
 from the xbox smart yes that's just what 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.090
 like the iks view sometime xd view 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.600
 represent and yes that's why they exist 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.210
 Dogs on the pc feeble-minded because of me 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.250
 can press me was dead now but I 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.720
 do not know if that brings something because 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.450
 I just can not see my xbox 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.669
 all on a tv and yes on 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.289
 In any case , that was it for the first time and me 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.580
 I hope I buy something now 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.060
 press from the whole time 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.590
 That's why we prefer to press yes 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:34.289
 Anyway that's it, I hope so 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:37.320
 I showed you the smart nerves a bit 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.740
 and yes download is worth it on everyone 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.669
 case can not go wrong 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:48.500
 But that's just nothing until then 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.500
 your mark sanchez
