 another video about hair 15 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.860
 Specifically this clearing drainage 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:18.060
 door openings if you don't know 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.609
 in the doorway to the water which 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.830
 got inside the door the trickle exists 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.689
 drain hole they are in all 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.550
 the four doors, and today I tell you 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.010
 I will show you how to clean them. 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.080
 either a screwdriver is better of course you are flat 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.630
 no better course better flat or either 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.430
 legs substance to this beast where is there 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.820
 these drain hole is located they 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.920
 under the bottom of the door and so now I tell them to you 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:53.149
 show mod climbs under the bottom of the door and 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:55.829
 see here it will now be you 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.059
 best seen in his car to see him then 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.969
 on from now to this is a drainage hole 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.589
 she often gets littered with trash so 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.500
 take a screwdriver and so here 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.619
 cleansing so that the water does not stagnate on 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.619
 3 and the door did not start to rust as well 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.259
 here, too, there is such a drainage 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.600
 take the attack hole clean 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:25.040
 screwdriver so here from the right more 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.040
 no such holes so 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:37.220
 now show you the other side of the door 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:40.310
 let's go logical you can do on 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.760
 all kinds of car you have there everywhere 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.710
 all the same in principle, that's different 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:54.850
 the door here we also have the first hole 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:02:00.920
 drain here so here we have the second 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:04.509
 second drainage holes and so it is visible 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.910
 you do not have 3 drainage hole in worries 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.209
 we take and clean them very very often 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.239
 especially after a long drive 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.750
 clogged with dirt and water does not drip on 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:21.310
 this door starts to rot therefore it 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.370
 it is important to do everything constantly 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.370
 thanks to all
