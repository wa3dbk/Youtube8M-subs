role within the team what did my mom

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069 
role within the team what did my mom
Pellegrini<00:00:39.059> sites<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.390> about<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.719> position

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
Pellegrini sites you about your position

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.410 
Pellegrini sites you about your position
and<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.469> place<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> team<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.579> think<00:00:42.180> they

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and your place in the team I think they

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
and your place in the team I think they
play<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> little<00:00:43.079> bit<00:00:43.290> different<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:44.760> way<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
play a little bit different the way the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
play a little bit different the way the
Chelsea<00:00:45.390> plays<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:46.739> i<00:00:46.770> play<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
Chelsea plays so I think there i play a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.639 
Chelsea plays so I think there i play a
little<00:00:47.309> bit<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:48.210> far<00:00:48.480> from<00:00:48.719> from<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> go<00:00:49.379> so

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
little bit more far from from the go so

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.860 
little bit more far from from the go so
so<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> bit<00:00:50.789> hard<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.059> me<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.719> good

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
so it's a bit hard for me but was good

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.860
