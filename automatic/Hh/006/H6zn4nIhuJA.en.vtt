00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
ROM 220 to 250 around then okay can be

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:18.540 
ROM 220 to 250 around then okay can be
lower<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.580> pico<00:02:09.970> projector<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.980> using<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
lower if the pico projector is using the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.080 
lower if the pico projector is using the
a<00:02:18.989> knowledge<00:02:19.989> we<00:02:20.110> call<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.440> L<00:02:20.620> cost<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.880> is<00:02:22.060> a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
a knowledge we call the L cost this is a

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.910 
a knowledge we call the L cost this is a
mini<00:02:22.390> projector<00:02:22.630> or<00:02:23.530> using<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.950> single<00:02:24.280> LED

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.229 

projector<00:02:29.920> intensive<00:02:30.760> three

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
projector intensive three

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.540 
projector intensive three
okay<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.720> last<00:02:32.020> about<00:02:32.260> an<00:02:32.770> hour<00:02:32.950> also

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
okay the last about an hour also

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.270 
okay the last about an hour also
whatever<00:02:34.330> an<00:02:34.840> hour<00:02:35.020> also<00:02:35.500> like<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.040> high

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
whatever an hour also like a high

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.729 
whatever an hour also like a high
intensity<00:02:36.880> or<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.180> low<00:02:37.330> one<00:02:37.510> high<00:02:38.200> intensity

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
intensity or the low one high intensity

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.220 
intensity or the low one high intensity
but<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.459> course<00:02:39.670> we<00:02:39.820> have<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.630> projector<00:02:40.989> is

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
but of course we have the projector is

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.199 
but of course we have the projector is
just<00:02:41.440> an<00:02:41.530> added<00:02:41.800> function<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:42.670> by<00:02:42.910> far<00:02:43.180> is

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
just an added function this by far is

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.600 
just an added function this by far is
still<00:02:43.620> camcorder<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.950> other<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.370> last

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
still camcorder and other this last

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.170 
still camcorder and other this last
double<00:02:45.910> camcorder<00:02:46.360> function<00:02:46.720> and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
double camcorder function and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.660 
double camcorder function and
I<00:02:47.349> think<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.409> box<00:02:48.590> was<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.159> want<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.459> learn

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
I think the box was you want to learn

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.970 
I think the box was you want to learn
CPUs<00:02:50.180> exactly<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.109> Nestle's<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.560> camera

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
CPUs exactly and I Nestle's a camera

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.500 
CPUs exactly and I Nestle's a camera
here<00:02:52.219> do<00:02:53.120> as<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.269> camera<00:02:54.370> yeah<00:02:55.400> few<00:02:56.120> couplers

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
here do as a camera yeah few couplers

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.449 
here do as a camera yeah few couplers
and<00:02:56.719> you<00:02:56.840> can<00:02:56.989> record<00:02:57.290> what<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.799> camera<00:02:58.099> can

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
and you can record what a camera can

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.490 
and you can record what a camera can
shouldn't<00:02:59.180> steal<00:02:59.540> pictures<00:02:59.780> of<00:03:00.109> farming<00:03:00.439> a

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
shouldn't steal pictures of farming a

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.280 
shouldn't steal pictures of farming a
Pyxis<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.370> for<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.879> camcorder<00:03:02.329> is<00:03:02.689> up<00:03:03.079> to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
Pyxis and for the camcorder is up to

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.030 
Pyxis and for the camcorder is up to

QVC<00:03:15.109> yeah<00:03:15.950> but<00:03:16.189> a<00:03:16.219> project<00:03:16.430> for<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.180> moment<00:03:17.629> but

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
QVC yeah but a project for a moment but

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.059 
QVC yeah but a project for a moment but
we<00:03:18.560> will<00:03:18.829> come<00:03:19.040> up<00:03:19.189> with<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.370> VGA<00:03:19.700> then<00:03:20.919> 10<00:03:21.919> to

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
we will come up with a VGA then 10 to

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.300 
we will come up with a VGA then 10 to
the<00:03:22.129> 0<00:03:22.340> key<00:03:22.609> ok<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:24.019> can<00:03:24.290> do<00:03:24.439> up<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.590> 1080<00:03:25.129> in

the 0 key ok and it can do up to 1080 in
the<00:03:25.400> future<00:03:25.790> but<00:03:26.419> you<00:03:26.810> can<00:03:26.989> in<00:03:27.109> Sderot<00:03:27.439> depend

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
the future but you can in Sderot depend

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.949 
the future but you can in Sderot depend
on<00:03:27.859> the<00:03:27.950> cross<00:03:28.159> device<00:03:28.579> that<00:03:29.510> would<00:03:29.599> depend<00:03:29.810> on
