00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.540
 today's video will be dedicated 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:17.490
 strawberries namely strawberries in the garden well 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:22.640
 But with our autumn planted garden 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.269
 strawberries snowed through the winters she 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.269
 seems to be OK 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.840
 need to be here now 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.370
 some cosmetic work 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.460
 later when the weather stabilizes 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.510
 and the average daily temperature will be 5 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.410
 degrees of heat we will start spraying 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.460
 biologics 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.460
 for protection 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.030
 I love 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.400
 we have grown here so beautiful 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:30.480
 Berry today 10 June 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:35.660
 middle of the collection I year we 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.660
 today we have collected 14 kilograms 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:44.770
 there are two bands 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.450
 each lane with 150 pieces expected and 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.020
 collect their kilogram about 30 and 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.520
 why actually 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:58.390
 strawberries and why in the garden as you can see 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.220
 grow apples on medium height you 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.790
 two 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.850
 their height reaches 3 meters between the rows 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.649
 is two and a half meters this 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.970
 the area we constantly empty that 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.940
 once summer weeds something else something 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.870
 sensible here you will not plant tall 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.550
 and just and it turns out to handle and 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.660
 expensive and not always enough for it 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:30.820
 time so we decided 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:33.060
 square work out fertilize cover 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:38.850
 with agrofiber and plant on it 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.940
 strawberry garden seedlings took their 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.100
 proven with dressed august-september 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.940
 last year that is it is with us 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.050
 here is 1 year next year harvest by 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:57.340
 the idea should be more 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:59.580
 brought out the drip irrigation system and in 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.230
 In general, we have succeeded 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:07.090
 before landing there were some doubts 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.570
 tom will she grow here mate 2 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.910
 of light and will she have enough power since 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.880
 apple trees under which it grows already 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.110
 quite adult and their root system 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.500
 not spread between rows 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.390
 that is, is it enough in the water with that 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.910
 the apple tree will pull on itself big 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.130
 part and we saw that with cable 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.300
 watering system is pretty good 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.300
 the result was 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.030
 satka 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.919
 as 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:43.340
 now about our miscalculation process 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:49.230
 cultivation we had d problems 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:53.330
 then the first is ants and 2 is what 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.990
 part of the berry we began to rot 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.660
 raising berries 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.840
 due to the fact that there is excess moisture 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.310
 excess moisture for the reason that we have 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.220
 this year the summer is rainy and even here in 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.600
 the garden 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:15.080
 turned out to be very wet i would they not 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:18.900
 have time to evaporate excess moisture therefore 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.380
 on the remaining row spacing we still have 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.320
 one 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:27.320
 one more strip on strawberries will be 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:31.070
 to sit down on a low ridge and thereby 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.630
 try to solve the problem of heating 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:38.660
 then the second question is a question 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:41.720
 associated with the inhabitants of any 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:45.050
 more or less environmentally friendly garden 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.050
 these are ants 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:52.880
 vital activity of ants and berries 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.900
 this is also a lot of anteater really 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:00.410
 problem for us and since our garden 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:04.950
 tries to use toxic chemicals 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:06.090
 the amount of drugs from the ants still kind of 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:11.670
 as if not found 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:14.400
 but in any case, the method of such a landing 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.720
 is quite cost-effective for 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.950
 small cottage or backyard 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.230
 plot 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:24.320
 I have a little area to grow some 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:29.340
 raise trees you can always plant 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.680
 strawberries on the agrofiber and drip 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:36.270
 the system is also no problem in our 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:39.150
 time is another plus planting strawberries on 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:44.300
 mulch that's just fiber or which 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.300
 any other dregs berry 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:52.629
 on agrofibre and without it 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:02.549
 slightly dirty it's always clean 

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:09.319
 it was always raining yesterday we are 

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:09.319
 we collect such result
