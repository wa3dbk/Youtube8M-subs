00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.400 

when<00:00:13.850> I'm<00:00:13.940> explaining<00:00:14.360> this<00:00:14.600> just<00:00:15.110> think<00:00:15.350> of

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
when I'm explaining this just think of

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.590 
when I'm explaining this just think of
this<00:00:15.530> ordinary<00:00:15.980> tap<00:00:16.280> water<00:00:16.310> with<00:00:17.000> the<00:00:17.180> water

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
this ordinary tap water with the water

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.870 
this ordinary tap water with the water
are<00:00:17.840> suspended<00:00:18.410> up<00:00:19.010> here<00:00:19.340> by<00:00:19.490> negative

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
are suspended up here by negative

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.210 
are suspended up here by negative
pressure<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.020> higher<00:00:21.470> in<00:00:21.680> here<00:00:21.920> than<00:00:22.070> it<00:00:22.160> is

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
pressure so higher in here than it is

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.279 
pressure so higher in here than it is
down<00:00:22.460> here<00:00:24.430> what<00:00:25.430> we<00:00:25.550> have<00:00:25.760> is<00:00:26.090> a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
down here what we have is a

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.460 
down here what we have is a
cross-section<00:00:27.289> drawing<00:00:27.920> three<00:00:28.250> stages<00:00:28.520> of

the machine the transfer force machine
which<00:00:33.620> will<00:00:33.800> generate<00:00:33.920> more<00:00:34.309> power<00:00:34.489> than<00:00:35.360> it

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
which will generate more power than it
