00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.780
 a special stage but sown 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.369
 pitfalls today for cars the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.750
 longer stage of this dakar offers us 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.610
 a new leader the Spanish carlos 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.020
 have a few bike surprises on the bike 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.220
 arrival especially for cyril després 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.220
 who gives up 40 minutes 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.410
 the dakar is a race really 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.900
 strange one day you can be at the top 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.190
 and the next day not at all and the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.809
 hopes of victory can quickly 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.610
 dissipate especially for stéphane 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.050
 peterhansel who played yesterday unlucky 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.879
 by bursting and we are wrong in 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.809
 of routes he finished with almost 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.150
 30 minutes late 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.080
 without the race escape us in any case 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.510
 we feel that it will be much more 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.040
 complicated yes but that's the experience of 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.210
 record of victories over the dakar a 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.309
 still been important today 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.440
 peterhansel on his mini took over from 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.000
 time to his predecessors in general he 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 finishes 2nd of the stage behind 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.020
 carlos healthy buggy driver does 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.910
 better than to resist the mini he takes the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.129
 orders of the general by winning the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.050
 special of everything on the end of the race 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.310
 before that it was nasser al attiyah who 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.640
 dominated the debates before finishing 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.660
 third the day was good for 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.680
 we apart from a small puncture I am 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.680
 rather happy with our performance 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.740
 as yesterday we find at the outposts 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.240
 line with so at the tia but also 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.899
 villagra roma and terra nova which 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.550
 complete the top 6 giniel de villiers 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.899
 on his toyota a time stopped like 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.270
 robbie gordon in this special 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.009
 finishes 7th today and remains 6th of 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.400
 general within 40 minutes of the new 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.400
 leader 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.540
 the bikes did not have any assistance 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.980
 is then the long step between san 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.240
 rafael and without rights nor so it took 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.980
 pay attention to the tires 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.900
 today almost five thirty 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.600
 for the best ones to cover the 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.400
 350 2 km in a far west setting 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.780
 announced as the most beautiful step with 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.790
 a lot of navigation this fourth 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.380
 special will have been fatal to cyril després 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.540
 who had a mechanical failure 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.650
 always close to coma since the start 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.690
 French riding his yamaha 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.310
 let go about 40 minutes on the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.660
 competition so that loans 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.160
 the man of the second weeks will have to 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.460
 now filled a chasm he is 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.170
 now 6th of the general it is not the 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.270
 only to have known the leader's worries 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.710

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.480

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.550
 minutes but keeps the head of the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.280
 ranking for only 3010 on marc 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.690
 coma always so regular I got 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.490
 stopped sometimes because I did not know 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.680
 where I was and it was pretty 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.300
 stressful I also fell suddenly 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.100
 I had to accelerate to catch up with 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.690
 wasted time 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.580
 I'm doing it but it's been hard and I have 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.230

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.100
 podium 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.630
 Alain duclos ends him far 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.870
 today but keeps his fourth 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.760
 square 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.010
 but the surprise of the day came from 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.170
 juan pedrero garcia 5th of the last dakar 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.950

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.720
 year of rosario 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.920
 he offered himself the stage but remains to 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.920
 more than an hour and a half from the head 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.620
 after a visit to the dakar in 2007 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.329

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.159

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.120
