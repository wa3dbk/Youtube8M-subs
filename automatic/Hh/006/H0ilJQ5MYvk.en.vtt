city once again look below the city in

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.039 
city once again look below the city in
the<00:01:29.909> center<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:30.420> which<00:01:30.540> looks<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.930> has

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the center there which looks like it has

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.539 
the center there which looks like it has
a<00:01:31.079> giant<00:01:31.409> Sphinx<00:01:31.770> or<00:01:32.040> something<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.460> the
