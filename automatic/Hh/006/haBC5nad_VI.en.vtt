00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940
 good turtles are no longer good 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.940
 turtles end 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.300
 whom the bank friends remember the series in '87 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.430
 about ninja turtles believe believe want 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 No, but it was the best cartoon of mine 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.270
 childhood and then there was still warner 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.579
 brothers and disney 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.920
 beautiful Soviet cartoons and the same 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.860
 most pokemon but no one could 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.829
 match up with gorgeous turtle 4 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.989
 I'll clarify right now I'm a fan of her own franchise 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.270
 namely the series I am enough 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.909
 superficially familiar with the original source yes 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.100
 and in general almost never read comics 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.350
 hentai ones comic chain lanell course 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.019
 so for me it remains the moon 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 exactly turtles from the cartoon and here 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.149
 quite by accident I'm here for myself 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.629
 shot 2012 which stepped in 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.690
 make a turtle three-dimensional 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.350
 first mickey mouse now and you but how 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.210
 not strange 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.220
 I liked the visual solution 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.070
 turtles do not look too childish 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.350
 but at the same time quite plausible 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 and still it reminds well made 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.550
 quality toys 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.230
 although everyone understands that the series and so 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.230
 must sell toys 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.560
 and in many scenes modern 3d 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.030
 graphics go great with 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.420
 classic drawing under comics 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.920
 so hateful to me three-dimensional animation 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.110
 quite justified by quality 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.260
 camera work and especially cool 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.400
 battles are also staged here 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.520
 mark screensaver 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.290
 i love the intro from the original and about 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.440
 panic new series me too 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.260
 liked although speaking frankly me 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.710
 just bought taking motives from the old 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.710
 series 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.260
 the very beginning warns us that 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.160
 we are not just turtles mutants 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.390
 ninja 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.690
 but teenagers are a hero here for 15 years and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.300
 sometimes unreal behave like children i 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.790
 I can not call it a minus Novak 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.209
 turtles from the old series were 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.900
 great friends it was real 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.900
 turtles friendship 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.269
 and here are turtles of 2012 me just 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.360
 upset they constantly fight and 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.340
 it seems they do not get along with each other 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.410
 distinctive features too much 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.600
 exaggerated Raphael who is here 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.330
 stronger than all the others sometimes behaves 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.260
 like a real bastard that is unthinkable for 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.570
 old rafi 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.090
 donatella is unnecessarily boring here 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.970
 constantly corrects all what causes 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.400
 real annoyance but the worst 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.769
 what did they do with michelangelo from 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.150
 witty and naughty fun 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.640
 turned into a moron 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.910
 he is literally retarded all 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.350
 remember the outline of the book 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.770
 Yes 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.770
 sure to explain 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:36.420
 can repeat once more did not understand humor 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.570
 and a couple of words about the splinter and who are here 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.120
 not bad but poorly reminiscent of the wise 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.840
 mentor and sometimes he says 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.960
 quite contradictory things in battle 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.170
 these cannot work 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:55.980
 achieve victory and dishonesty of the good 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.580
 there are no more turtles and I knew that 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.640
 have to talk about it you knew so 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.700
 which he drank in the eighty-seventh year 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.270
 managed to create the perfect epril o'nil and 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:14.540
 it is clear that this ideal surpass 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.540
 but at least you can hope 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.830
 okay let's finish the sets talk about 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.430
 villains 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.870
 swede here you made really strong 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.570
 at the first meeting he is easy 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.390
 cracks down on all the bugs 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.060
 and this bloodthirsty type has nothing 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.010
 in common with the old shader that was 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.390
 just whipping boy 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.010
 Well, here I could not insert 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:55.740
 join me for fried 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:59.220
 nails you do not want I asked fried 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.900
 nails do not want no but the rest 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.770
 the villains on his google background is enough 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:08.390
 faded and higher resemble Pokemon than 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.700
 dangerous opponents bio pie herd were 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.380
 cooler but overall I'm glad that the turtles 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.560
 ninjas remain popular 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.260
 shot 2012 there are not enough stars with 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.500
 sky but i can safely recommend it 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.060
 view and you were there for Ilya Shura 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.810
