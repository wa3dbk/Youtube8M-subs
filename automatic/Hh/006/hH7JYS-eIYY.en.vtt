it is the concept series hammer drawn
the<00:00:18.869> reason<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.289> was<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.830> harder<00:00:20.189> to

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the reason it was one of the harder to

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.160 
the reason it was one of the harder to
think<00:00:20.369> figures<00:00:21.060> was<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.390> was<00:00:21.480> one<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.869> last

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
think figures was it was one of the last

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.140 
think figures was it was one of the last
and<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> we've<00:00:22.769> if<00:00:23.340> you're<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> star<00:00:23.850> Wars<00:00:23.880> fan

you love knowing this from some of the
the<00:00:26.789> final<00:00:27.269> waves<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.660> get<00:00:28.039> from<00:00:29.039> Star<00:00:29.340> Wars

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the final waves we get from Star Wars

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.150 
the final waves we get from Star Wars
yet<00:00:30.090> upon<00:00:30.359> year<00:00:30.539> highs<00:00:30.779> will<00:00:31.050> often<00:00:31.650> release

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
yet upon year highs will often release

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.180 
yet upon year highs will often release
waves<00:00:32.930> which<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.200> really<00:00:34.440> bloody<00:00:34.980> hard

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
waves which is just really bloody hard

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.330 
waves which is just really bloody hard
to<00:00:35.340> get<00:00:35.489> because<00:00:35.850> they're<00:00:36.000> very<00:00:36.210> short<00:00:36.660> packed

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
to get because they're very short packed

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.729 
to get because they're very short packed
so<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> figure<00:00:39.090> here<00:00:39.420> it's

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
so this is the figure here it's

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.319 
so this is the figure here it's
practically<00:00:40.739> identical<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> weapon

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
practically identical to the weapon

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.670 
practically identical to the weapon
assault<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:42.960> which<00:00:43.110> I'll<00:00:43.260> show<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
assault one which I'll show you in a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.420 
assault one which I'll show you in a
minute<00:00:44.420> but<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.870> was<00:00:46.050> very<00:00:46.379> very<00:00:46.500> hard<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
minute but this was very very hard to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.569 
minute but this was very very hard to
get<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.329> short<00:00:48.660> packed<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.860> this

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
get because it was short packed so this

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.270 
get because it was short packed so this
guy<00:00:50.850> was<00:00:51.090> at<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.480> point<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.500> 50<00:00:53.100> bucks

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.649 
me a quick look at that but the only
difference<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.580> this<00:01:50.729> other<00:01:50.939> hammered<00:01:51.390> ruling

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
difference on this other hammered ruling

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.410 
difference on this other hammered ruling
was<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> head<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.030> weapons

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
was the head but this is this weapons

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.330 
was the head but this is this weapons
assault<00:01:54.689> drawing<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.440> basically<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
assault drawing here so basically the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950 
assault drawing here so basically the
same<00:01:56.550> figure<00:01:56.880> cat<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.330> peg<00:01:57.569> whole<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
same figure cat the peg whole of the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.330 
same figure cat the peg whole of the
back<00:01:58.110> which<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.500> very<00:01:58.740> similar<00:01:59.069> to<00:01:59.310> another

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
back which is very similar to another

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.270 
back which is very similar to another
figure<00:02:00.330> which<00:02:00.929> was<00:02:01.110> then<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.289> joins<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.130> that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
figure which was then the joins so that

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.430 
figure which was then the joins so that
the<00:02:02.399> drawings<00:02:02.759> were<00:02:02.850> at<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> end<00:02:03.179> of<00:02:03.330> armor<00:02:04.140> -

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
the drawings were at the end of armor -

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.800 
the drawings were at the end of armor -
if<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.710> recall<00:02:04.860> his<00:02:05.340> various<00:02:05.819> Wednesday<00:02:06.539> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
if you recall his various Wednesday and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.960 
if you recall his various Wednesday and
this<00:02:07.229> was<00:02:07.440> from<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.740> ear<00:02:08.100> soldier<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.789> this

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
this was from the ear soldier on this

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.479 
this was from the ear soldier on this
plug-in<00:02:09.660> piece<00:02:10.080> there<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.440> would<00:02:10.590> basically

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
plug-in piece there you would basically

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.789 
plug-in piece there you would basically
plug<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.299> kind<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.540> jetpack<00:02:13.049> aspect<00:02:13.560> to

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
plug in this kind of jetpack aspect to

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.009 
plug in this kind of jetpack aspect to
Swaney<00:02:14.760> back<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.239> figure<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.540> sports<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
Swaney back to the figure of sports to

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.960 
Swaney back to the figure of sports to
be<00:02:16.110> showing<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.400> as<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.610> hammer

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
be showing you and this as the hammer

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.750 
be showing you and this as the hammer
are<00:02:18.090> drawn<00:02:18.299> so<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.230> head<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:20.190> completely

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
are drawn so the head is completely

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.660 
are drawn so the head is completely
different<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.750> was<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:22.650> concept<00:02:23.340> you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
different and it was this concept you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.300 
different and it was this concept you
don't<00:02:24.269> truly<00:02:24.870> get<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.110> see<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.950> movie

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
don't truly get to see this in the movie

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.120 
don't truly get to see this in the movie
looking<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.380> we<00:02:28.380> get<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.739> see<00:02:28.920> one

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
looking like this we get to see one

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.970 
looking like this we get to see one
point<00:02:29.459> where<00:02:29.989> what<00:02:30.989> flash<00:02:31.200> basically<00:02:31.859> is

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
point where what flash basically is

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.819 
point where what flash basically is
putting<00:02:32.340> together<00:02:32.519> some<00:02:32.940> drawings<00:02:33.359> and<00:02:33.829> we

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
putting together some drawings and we

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.500 
putting together some drawings and we
have<00:02:35.010> these<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.549> lane<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:35.910> I'm<00:02:36.060> not<00:02:36.239> quite

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
have these on a lane but I'm not quite

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.970 
have these on a lane but I'm not quite
looking<00:02:36.959> like<00:02:37.079> this<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.590> hair<00:02:37.769> department

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
looking like this in the hair department

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.670 
looking like this in the hair department
so<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> little<00:02:38.880> bit<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.180> concept<00:02:39.660> as<00:02:39.930> has

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
so it's a little bit of a concept as has

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.590 
so it's a little bit of a concept as has
move<00:02:40.980> towards<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.579> base<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.060> repack<00:02:42.390> is

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
move towards the base of the repack is

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.530 
move towards the base of the repack is
this<00:02:42.829> it's<00:02:43.829> a<00:02:43.920> it's<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.250> very<00:02:44.280> cool<00:02:44.820> figure<00:02:45.150> and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
this it's a it's a very cool figure and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.390 
this it's a it's a very cool figure and
it's<00:02:45.660> very<00:02:46.140> worth<00:02:46.470> ten<00:02:46.920> dollars

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
it's very worth ten dollars

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.580 
it's very worth ten dollars
that<00:02:48.000> she's<00:02:48.329> healing<00:02:48.630> what<00:02:48.959> fifty<00:02:49.350> is<00:02:49.440> this

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that she's healing what fifty is this

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.740 
that she's healing what fifty is this
thing<00:02:49.799> was<00:02:49.980> going<00:02:50.190> for<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.299> seemed<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.720> be

getting clear date in some places in the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.050 
getting clear date in some places in the
u.s.<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.660> t.j.maxx<00:02:55.160> as<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.340> guys<00:02:56.519> have<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.970> in

u.s. and t.j.maxx as you guys have it in

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.210 
u.s. and t.j.maxx as you guys have it in
the<00:02:57.120> USA<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.410> prey<00:02:58.620> sees<00:02:58.829> were<00:02:58.950> coming

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
the USA and the prey sees were coming

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.680 
the USA and the prey sees were coming
down<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.489> this<00:02:59.609> thing<00:02:59.850> was<00:03:00.060> getting<00:03:00.269> flushed

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
down and this thing was getting flushed

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.900 
down and this thing was getting flushed
out<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.049> stores<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.160> someone<00:03:02.489> put<00:03:02.609> this<00:03:02.760> up

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
out of stores and so someone put this up

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.849 
out of stores and so someone put this up
online<00:03:03.090> expecting<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.900> make<00:03:04.019> fifty<00:03:04.350> bucks<00:03:04.500> and

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
online expecting to make fifty bucks and

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.380 
online expecting to make fifty bucks and
they<00:03:05.370> maintained

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
they maintained

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.390 
they maintained
so<00:03:08.020> really<00:03:08.500> there's<00:03:08.770> not<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.920> great<00:03:09.130> deal<00:03:09.280> of

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
so really there's not a great deal of

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.770 
so really there's not a great deal of
features<00:03:09.730> on<00:03:09.880> this<00:03:10.030> figure<00:03:10.330> it<00:03:10.420> does<00:03:10.600> have

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
features on this figure it does have

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.480 
features on this figure it does have
these<00:03:10.960> always<00:03:11.590> with<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:11.830> flaps<00:03:12.100> when<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.400> do

these always with the flaps when I do

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.210 
these always with the flaps when I do
reviews<00:03:12.910> at<00:03:13.090> these<00:03:13.270> flaps<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.170> come<00:03:14.470> down<00:03:14.860> on

paintwork a nice transfer to put on to

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.930 
paintwork a nice transfer to put on to
the<00:03:22.210> figure<00:03:22.720> itself<00:03:23.280> there's<00:03:24.280> nothing<00:03:24.610> in<00:03:24.760> see

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
great deal so not quite sure whether

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.180 
great deal so not quite sure whether
there<00:03:34.270> if<00:03:34.510> any<00:03:34.690> noise<00:03:34.990> let<00:03:35.230> me<00:03:35.350> know<00:03:35.470> there<00:03:36.040> is

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
there if any noise let me know there is

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.860 
there if any noise let me know there is
some<00:03:36.459> nice<00:03:36.730> touches<00:03:37.090> you'll<00:03:37.480> see<00:03:37.840> just

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
designs them up to that so we get the

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.500 
designs them up to that so we get the
hammer<00:03:44.370> brand<00:03:45.370> mark<00:03:45.730> piece<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.209> futon

that there and that is most have been

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.650 
that there and that is most have been
that<00:03:48.810> kind<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:49.900> change<00:03:50.320> so<00:03:50.560> these<00:03:50.739> go<00:03:51.040> but<00:03:52.030> some

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
that kind of change so these go but some

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.750 
that kind of change so these go but some
legs<00:03:52.870> touch<00:03:53.110> use<00:03:53.320> all<00:03:53.440> these<00:03:53.560> little<00:03:53.770> crash

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
can see them in the fade to the hammer a

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.949 
can see them in the fade to the hammer a
little<00:04:04.360> boys<00:04:04.540> there<00:04:06.270> yet<00:04:07.270> there's<00:04:07.780> not<00:04:07.930> a

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
little boys there yet there's not a

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.710 
little boys there yet there's not a
great<00:04:08.230> deal<00:04:08.260> of<00:04:08.680> other<00:04:09.280> additions<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.420> Fagin

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
great deal of other additions the Fagin

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.330 
great deal of other additions the Fagin
it<00:04:10.840> can't<00:04:11.110> do<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.380> great<00:04:11.650> deal<00:04:11.799> in<00:04:11.980> terms<00:04:12.190> of

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
it can't do a great deal in terms of

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.460 
it can't do a great deal in terms of
articulation<00:04:12.970> he<00:04:13.390> does<00:04:13.660> have<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.930> fear<00:04:14.230> mode

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
articulation he does have a fear mode

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.080 
articulation he does have a fear mode
but<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.890> is<00:04:14.980> pretty<00:04:15.160> limited<00:04:15.640> because<00:04:15.760> of<00:04:16.030> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
but it is pretty limited because of the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.190 
but it is pretty limited because of the
chunky<00:04:16.479> makes<00:04:16.720> room

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
chunky makes room

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.580 
chunky makes room
so<00:04:17.620> we<00:04:17.769> do<00:04:18.010> get<00:04:18.250> this<00:04:18.430> ball<00:04:18.669> joint<00:04:18.910> ahead<00:04:19.590> but

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
so we do get this ball joint ahead but

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.040 
so we do get this ball joint ahead but
it<00:04:20.709> does<00:04:21.010> it<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.669> limited<00:04:22.120> in<00:04:22.390> terms<00:04:22.870> of

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
it does it is limited in terms of

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.920 
it does it is limited in terms of
rotation<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.620> can't<00:04:23.860> move<00:04:24.010> too<00:04:24.370> far<00:04:24.669> we<00:04:25.360> do<00:04:25.600> get

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
rotation it can't move too far we do get

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.659 
rotation it can't move too far we do get
these<00:04:26.169> I'm<00:04:26.770> gonna<00:04:26.950> take<00:04:27.220> these<00:04:27.310> off<00:04:27.550> because

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
these I'm gonna take these off because

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.010 
these I'm gonna take these off because
it<00:04:27.850> love<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.180> follow<00:04:28.390> just<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.780> show<00:04:28.930> you

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
it love it to follow just to show you

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.320 
it love it to follow just to show you
these<00:04:29.470> do<00:04:29.740> clip-on<00:04:30.280> recently<00:04:30.880> into<00:04:31.210> the

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
these do clip-on recently into the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.630 
these do clip-on recently into the
sockets<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.260> underneath<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.770> arms<00:04:33.070> and

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
sockets that underneath the arms and

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.310 
sockets that underneath the arms and
that<00:04:33.790> allows<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.360> automate<00:04:34.900> that<00:04:35.140> out

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
that allows you to automate that out

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.010 
that allows you to automate that out
with<00:04:35.970> Spears<00:04:36.970> that<00:04:37.030> come<00:04:37.360> with<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.600> which<00:04:37.990> is

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
with Spears that come with it which is

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.250 
with Spears that come with it which is
these<00:04:38.950> are<00:04:39.370> two<00:04:39.669> of<00:04:39.700> these<00:04:40.060> long<00:04:40.510> chain<00:04:40.960> saws

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
these are two of these long chain saws

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.159 
these are two of these long chain saws
and<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.310> short-term<00:04:42.790> rations<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.510> you<00:04:43.960> can

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
and to the short-term rations so you can

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.490 
and to the short-term rations so you can
basically<00:04:44.380> just<00:04:44.890> plug<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:45.700> in<00:04:45.910> underneath

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
basically just plug that in underneath

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.390 
basically just plug that in underneath
look<00:04:47.500> at<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.650> wrong<00:04:47.890> ones<00:04:48.070> which<00:04:48.250> would

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
look at the wrong ones which would

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.470 
look at the wrong ones which would
really<00:04:48.550> help<00:04:48.669> with<00:04:48.850> that<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.060> right<00:04:49.240> one

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.450 

as<00:04:53.840> opposed<00:04:54.170> to<00:04:54.230> the<00:04:54.380> short<00:04:54.410> version<00:04:54.800> my

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
as opposed to the short version my

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.000 
as opposed to the short version my
preferences<00:04:56.030> for<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.210> shorter<00:04:56.630> one<00:04:56.840> but<00:04:57.110> it's

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
preferences for the shorter one but it's

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.280 
preferences for the shorter one but it's
you<00:04:58.190> recall<00:04:58.690> so<00:04:59.690> there<00:04:59.840> we<00:04:59.900> go<00:04:59.930> that's

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
you recall so there we go that's

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.220 
you recall so there we go that's
basically<00:05:01.130> that<00:05:01.220> in<00:05:01.790> terms<00:05:02.060> of<00:05:02.270> aspects<00:05:02.990> into

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
basically that in terms of aspects into

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.620 
basically that in terms of aspects into
it<00:05:03.470> ball<00:05:03.740> jointed<00:05:04.100> shoulder<00:05:05.060> get<00:05:05.210> back<00:05:05.420> to<00:05:05.540> the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
it ball jointed shoulder get back to the

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.110 
it ball jointed shoulder get back to the
articulation<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.740> can<00:05:06.920> just<00:05:07.190> see<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.610> ball

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
articulation you can just see the ball

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.210 
articulation you can just see the ball
go<00:05:08.330> in<00:05:08.360> there<00:05:08.630> with<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.170> the<00:05:09.440> socket<00:05:09.860> again

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
go in there with the the socket again

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.900 
go in there with the the socket again
kind<00:05:10.880> of<00:05:10.940> limited<00:05:11.330> because<00:05:11.510> of<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:12.730> armor<00:05:13.730> on

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
kind of limited because of the armor on

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.400 
kind of limited because of the armor on
top<00:05:14.120> of<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.330> figure<00:05:14.510> we've<00:05:15.080> got<00:05:15.350> a<00:05:15.380> swivel

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
top of the figure we've got a swivel

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.800 
top of the figure we've got a swivel
elbow<00:05:18.410> which<00:05:19.250> doesn't<00:05:19.910> do<00:05:20.060> anything<00:05:20.480> else<00:05:20.630> it

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
elbow which doesn't do anything else it

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.600 
elbow which doesn't do anything else it
can't<00:05:21.080> really<00:05:21.320> rotate<00:05:21.770> at<00:05:21.890> all<00:05:22.070> so<00:05:22.340> you<00:05:22.460> can

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
can't really rotate at all so you can

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.280 
can't really rotate at all so you can
just<00:05:22.880> see<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.120> joint<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.630> that's<00:05:23.750> as<00:05:23.960> far<00:05:23.990> as

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
just see the joint and that's as far as

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.760 
just see the joint and that's as far as
it<00:05:24.410> goes

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
it goes

so<00:05:40.520> pretty<00:05:40.790> movin<00:05:41.120> all<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:41.330> you<00:05:41.420> can<00:05:41.630> really

do a fetal dance if you want to you go

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.110 
do a fetal dance if you want to you go
he<00:05:46.520> can<00:05:47.000> move<00:05:47.210> same<00:05:47.930> for<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.170> knees<00:05:48.320> is<00:05:48.650> on<00:05:48.800> the

he can move same for the knees is on the

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.760 
he can move same for the knees is on the
elbow<00:05:50.120> is<00:05:50.180> pretty<00:05:50.480> much<00:05:50.660> he<00:05:50.840> does<00:05:51.170> have<00:05:51.530> a

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
elbow is pretty much he does have a

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.670 
elbow is pretty much he does have a
swivel<00:05:52.130> joint<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:52.730> it<00:05:52.790> is<00:05:52.940> double<00:05:53.450> jointed<00:05:53.900> so

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
swivel joint and it is double jointed so

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.260 
swivel joint and it is double jointed so
there's<00:05:54.860> a<00:05:54.920> fair<00:05:55.250> amount<00:05:55.340> of<00:05:55.730> movement<00:05:55.940> there

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
there's a fair amount of movement there

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.060 
there's a fair amount of movement there
but<00:05:56.390> again<00:05:56.450> it<00:05:56.750> can't<00:05:56.990> really<00:05:57.230> routine<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:57.920> do

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
but again it can't really routine to do

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.250 
but again it can't really routine to do
anything<00:05:58.310> else<00:05:58.700> is<00:05:58.820> limited<00:05:59.240> and<00:05:59.390> that<00:05:59.450> is

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
anything else is limited and that is

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.120 
anything else is limited and that is
slightly<00:06:01.100> articulated<00:06:02.110> ankles<00:06:03.110> you<00:06:03.560> can<00:06:03.740> just

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
slightly articulated ankles you can just

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.340 
slightly articulated ankles you can just
see<00:06:04.340> the<00:06:04.460> socket<00:06:04.880> here<00:06:05.060> and<00:06:05.690> then<00:06:05.870> move<00:06:06.170> a

see the socket here and then move a
little<00:06:06.650> bit<00:06:06.860> range<00:06:07.130> but<00:06:07.340> again<00:06:07.610> blocked<00:06:08.510> by

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
little bit range but again blocked by
