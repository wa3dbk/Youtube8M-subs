00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
because I honestly didn't think that I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.550 
because I honestly didn't think that I
did<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.299> I'm<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.810> good<00:01:57.960> with<00:01:58.020> series<00:01:58.409> all

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560

did that I'm not so good with series all
the<00:01:58.619> time<00:01:59.030> and<00:02:00.030> then<00:02:00.540> finally<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.200> last<00:02:01.229> one

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the time and then finally the last one

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.830 
the time and then finally the last one
was<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.829> read<00:02:02.009> at<00:02:02.159> least<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.490> classic<00:02:03.360> womp

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840

was to read at least one classic womp
womp<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.380> don't<00:02:04.619> think<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.799> i<00:02:04.890> read<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> classic

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.010 
womp I don't think that i read a classic
but<00:02:05.909> whatever<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.360> okay<00:02:06.600> we'll<00:02:06.750> try<00:02:06.869> again

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
but whatever that's okay we'll try again

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.960 
but whatever that's okay we'll try again
next<00:02:07.170> year<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.890> those<00:02:08.069> are<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.459> my<00:02:08.580> goals<00:02:08.789> i

from 75 to 50 so the reason that I did

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.670 
from 75 to 50 so the reason that I did
this<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:22.030> because<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.420> am<00:02:22.600> planning<00:02:23.200> on<00:02:23.320> reading
