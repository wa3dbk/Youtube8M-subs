00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.150
 we have four different expressions which 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.469
 I want to think which of these expressions is 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.349
 equal to minus 2 over three 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.830
 I'll ask you to pause the video and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.850
 try to do 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.840
 Let's start with this first 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.939
 expression 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.250
 I have one over nine and I will add with 5 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.460
 over 9 what will be the result 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.360
 I had a ninth now I am adding 5 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.700
 I will be six if I have one 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.530
 something but 5 of that same thing 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.829
 in which case this thing is a fraction whose 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.899
 denominator is 91 ninth plus 5 9th is six 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.820
 numbers, it is possible to simplify 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.469
 somehow the six and nine are 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.360
 indivisible by three then let's 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.780
 divide the two by three and try 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.640
 simplify that fraction 6/3 is 29/3 to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.370
 3 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.059
 is equal to two-thirds although people 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.580
 is behind -2 on three therefore 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.280
 this expression is not equal to minus 2 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.470
 About three then I'm going to write is not good. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.720
 here we will move on to this 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.450
 green expression will increase the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.520
 space has minus 1 over six plus - one 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.040
 about two we can see how 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.810
 Just being just to clarify now. 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.970
 negative sign stands in front of a 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.520
 about six and another negative sign in 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:35.250
 front of one on two but that's the same 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:39.030
 unless one of the six most - one on 2 - 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.860
 1 on two equals minus 1/2 that is 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.229
 a way of thinking about it 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.729
 The reason I did this is so that the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.770
 people can simplify the signals 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.899
 negative and they are only in our 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.520
 numerator whenever we add two 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.659
 fractions we must have the same 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.119
 denominator 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.070
 we see that six is ​​already a multiple of 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.450
 two then you can leave this first 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.299
 fraction as it is 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.520
 we can rewrite how - one about 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.219
 6 the second fraction can be rewritten 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.369
 like something about six to go from 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.140
 2 to 6 you need to multiply by three 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.500
 let's multiply our numerator 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.870
 also for 3 - 1 times 3 is 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.010
 the three then have less 1 on 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.180
 six and somo with minus 3 on 6 will be 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.230
 one-sixth plus 3 baskets that is 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.480
 equal to minus four sixths let's see 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.910
 now if we can simplify 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.060
 4 so as six are indivisible 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.560
 for two then we will divide the two by 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:48.840
 two in the numerator now has minus 4/2 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:51.600
 gives less 26/2 is 3 - 2/3 equals 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.550
 at least 2 out of 3 which is exactly what 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.630
 number that we are looking for so 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.840
 yes this green expression equals 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.420
 at least 2 out of three we'll move on now 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.860
 for this there is less a third 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.770
 * - 2 if we multiply less one per 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.980
 least one we will get a positive and get 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.590
 one-third positive times 21 way of 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.500
 think and it will be equal to one third 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.230
 2 times there are two ways to think about whether 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.660
 has a third and will multiply by two 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.299
 the result is two-thirds 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.890
 now has two- thirds another form of 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:34.200
 think is equal to a third times 2 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.989
 about one and you know that when 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.110
 we multiplied two fractions this time 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.390
 we expressed o2 as a fraction of people 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.420
 can multiply numbers to pains is a 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.980
 2 on the product of their 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:53.040
 denominators three times one that gives 2 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:58.410
 three of the two forms will always be 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:02.130
 plus two-thirds - 11 times minus one 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:05.310
 a positive will be two-thirds more and 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.130
 not less than two-thirds in the same way as 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.269
 the first expression is not equal to less 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.900
 two thirds 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:17.519
 we go to this one - two-thirds / 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.930
 half will write so less a third / 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:26.100
 one half is equal to minus one-third I will 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:30.870
 use other colors green 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:37.560
 What blue is here for you to see? 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:41.790
 better one third / one half is the same 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:47.490
 at least one-third times the inverse of a 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:52.130
 middle is 2 on one and this will be the same 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:58.470
 here instead of seeing as at least a third 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:05:00.870
 could see how - 1/3 because it can 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.430
 help not to forget the signs 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.020
 I'll write only to leave the 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:13.380
 clearer things 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:18.930
 I will write as - 1/3 our 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:21.300
 numerator will now be minus 11 times 2 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.310
 when they multiply two fractions and 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.470
 simply multiply the two 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:31.140
 numerator es to get the new number to 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:33.150
 pain and it is equal to three times 1 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.950
 usually do not have to do all 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.750
 these steps but I'm only doing it for 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.040
 ensure that they understand what is 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.860
 happening 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:50.220
 then it will be equal to minus 1 time 2 - 2 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:53.250
 - 2 and 3 times one is 3 - 2 over three is 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.970
 equal to minus two-thirds 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:00.140
 So here it is, it is equal to 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.140
 two thirds less
