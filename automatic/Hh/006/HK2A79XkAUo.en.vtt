00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.540
 these bubbles we are suffering 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.990
 before the work still there of a potting soil 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.780
 is not what I wrote on my 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.550
 previous that I got to know so 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:34.620
 I find it here it'll be a cloud I 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:40.309
 am not yet in case of down by the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.379
 terrible shock in the nature of battery 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.719
 so you'll tell me yeah the year there 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:52.110
 not to put 0.8 to put 10 of fall 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.059
 simply that the the low cost and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.270
 the ram and that is much higher 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.750
 that the only warrant this place there so 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.500
 I took the measurements at the laser level 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.720
 with the 6th there is exactly 0 8 of fall 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.030
 ie between the new high of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.500
 the water in the bin and entered two 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.680
 Bédié worlds seems to me it's like that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.340
 we measure 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.930
 here have not loosened the defect and 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.600
 shares but in reality this new 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.460
 others superior that lies in the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.630
 little tank that's where where is 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.660
 a lot less young who for me 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.820
 fabrice shoe here is the system of the 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:42.070
 wallonia blu ray of this point there if 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.229
 between dismantled ram here and at 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.600
 laser level accurately and all the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.420
 time it takes and there is a master 08 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.420
 exercising and that's it's there i'm having 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.700
 pretty good 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.520
 I have not jamie sewart we are a little 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.790
 before in this moment it turns me axa 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.490
 sell higher we extract hours 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.920
 but good accompanied some 100 g 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.770
 maybe it's already huge 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:24.280
 it means to show law 42 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:25.780
 meters only with the m 0,8 of the ch 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.700
 would only be a few bits of bone that 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.660
 you will surely have it 40 meters away 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.460
 it's here it's just for for the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:40.620
 principle to explain the principle of 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:40.620
 velib blow it's still huge 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.250
 his figure really but likes to 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.250
 to work 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.870
 markelov subject to constraints 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:15.150
 enormous 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:20.010
 thankfully that I have welded well and 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:25.200
 that's it goes up again I spent the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:32.700
 4 bars on the future stabilize the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.900
 seniors who is president brig and there 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.959
 they are watching over the berries books 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.959
 scholars agree that it explodes this ram 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.930
 he may be right besides 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:47.720
 stop right moment our I will not say 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:50.630
 that's it it's good to play either 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.410
 stayed all day in front of it all goes 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:58.820
 to simply say that is more or less 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:02.090
 accuracy that's m bathing with a 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.820
 082 fall guy can go to sour sour 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.300
 and that his share the pressure 'al-hakim 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.110
 will dig us down what I wanted 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.110
 to show his wounds 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.080
 I'm really surprised by that
