00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.750

 they also make light croissants integral 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.700

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.410
 to those of measure and these two a cake 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.319

 I know if you too are 129 calories per price 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.709

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.239
 plumcake those a little bigger with the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.909

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.950

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.669
 hamburger for the diet that daniele is 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:42.579
 doing that in the end I'm doing too 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:45.430
 I have so many with him now 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.230
 sometimes things based on seitan and tofu 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.090
 yesterday I went to a store in mine 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.430
 area to buy the side to me not 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.530
 I'll never do it again because of that 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.959
 grilled they wanted 5 euro 80 instead 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.939
 for the basic version of 80 euros 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.709
 many of you have recommended me the 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.569
 Seitan of the crush for this is known 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.299
 sent but unfortunately I did not find it 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.879
 so i took these 22 burgers that 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.400
 instead of paying them 3 euros and 50 has them 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.650
 paid two euros and 2 euros and 15 then 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.449
 I am very curious to renew them and they seem 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.810
 microwaves can also be good 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:19.720
 because you have known me for a while, you know that 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.090
 I'm the woman of the micron and then that with 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.009
 the other purchased or purchased we say 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.099
 I'll show you the wipes I have 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:29.769
 bought face wipes e 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.689
 miseries that I have used for a very long time and 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.669
 when I worked as a make-up artist I used to 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:35.680
 so much on the models that i 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.989
 they like a lot and they cost very little e 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.269
 they are excellent wipes and then has 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.799
 bought these that not only for the face 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.979
 but they are wet wipes 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:48.549
 to clean the apple surfaces that me 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:50.199
 I pay about 150 chris from lidl and you have to 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.239
 know let's ask for a white table that 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.919
 we always use for lunch and dinner 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.739
 that can be opened when there are 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.239
 friends and get dirty super easily 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.699
 so I always need wipes 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.729
 things and modified to clean it and these 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:06.340
 they are wonderful for this purpose 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:08.260
 then what surprised me I took the 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.750
 kind rusks 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.480
 who only paid 90 cents e 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:19.840
 are integral rusks there is the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.820
 cat section you do and and paid for it 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.139
 so few point I am very happy with 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.210
 You have found them so little these 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.100
 moments at breakfast is always eating 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.440
 the rusks pardoned in the meantime 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.419
 I caress the cat I was curious about 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.910
 try a new type even if me 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.820
 I always send those of yours to those 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.110
 Danish that are really beautiful then 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.600
 he took this smoked salmon here 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.490
 of trodica is really a great deal 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.410
 because I saw it with other brands in 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.350
 better known supermarkets 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.750
 sold not to the double but much more 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.090
 we have already been accounts I pay it I have it 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.520
 paid about 250 are slices of 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.440
 salmon which is not raw but is 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.930
 simply smoked and really a lot 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.680
 very good certainly not very few 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.830
 calories because a piece at 305 calories 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.320
 that is, the cat that is crazy is though 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.710
 very very good and when I eat fish 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.020
 novel itself and then damn it adores it a 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.389
 there are various lunches at work 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.849
 dill types at the peak to the natural 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.500
 for example it is also used by the rich and 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.500
 they make you pay enough with some 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.229
 vegetables for vegetables but it is necessary 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.870
 really very very good and a moment 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.550
 alternatively not too big 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.270
 for a quick lunch the company 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.849
 one salads you did then I took 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.699
 not the product the discount or six works 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.760
 that of bread and I asked myself I don't know if 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:48.500
 antique which establishes guilt or coal 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.180
 which is wonderful today 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.590
 so now go the fashion field 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.980
 perhaps because precisely there is the 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.600
 coal in the dough to a little more 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.320
 I believe it is digestible, however 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.390
 lot 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.460
 use pin alternate body have 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.950
 integral now I eat practically alone 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.320
 wholemeal bread and sometimes I allow myself 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.350
 this rip I enjoy my bread at 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.080
 charcoal then the last thing I got 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.950
 yes in my shopping at the tabasco the 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.960
 tabasco the sauce that I love is kind of 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.460
 a little spicy a little vinegar and the 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.980
 day often with couscous 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.050
 or to the open sandwiches flavors of 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.230
 soy burgers that are in fact 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.450
 those of the debugger spin that I adore and 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.550
 I like it a lot anyway 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.220
 who did n't tremble so it's not heavy 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.980
 and really very very good 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.230
 therefore having said this, excuse me, I expect 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.270
 however I hope that the or the vis is liked of 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.530
 having given you some advice 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.780
 interesting I can't wait to go back 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.670
 to the eurospin because lately there is not 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.060
