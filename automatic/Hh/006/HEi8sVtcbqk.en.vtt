the max prestige level and give you
notoriety<00:03:10.239> this<00:03:10.959> might<00:03:11.200> be<00:03:11.230> similar<00:03:11.680> to

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.650 
notoriety this might be similar to
regular<00:03:12.129> package<00:03:12.760> I'm<00:03:12.970> not<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.450> hundred

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.780 
regular package I'm not a hundred
percent<00:03:13.780> sure<00:03:14.230> but<00:03:14.980> I'm<00:03:15.160> thinking<00:03:15.640> that's

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
percent sure but I'm thinking that's

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.559 
percent sure but I'm thinking that's
probably<00:03:16.360> what<00:03:16.569> it's<00:03:16.690> about<00:03:17.430> okay<00:03:18.430> so

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
probably what it's about okay so

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.150 
probably what it's about okay so
resetting<00:03:19.569> all<00:03:19.660> stats<00:03:19.959> is<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.650> last<00:03:20.890> and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
resetting all stats is the last and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.150 
resetting all stats is the last and
