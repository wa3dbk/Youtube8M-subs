00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.960
 we hesitate my dear because our 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.239
 attention vector directed more at 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.549
 other people lower on themselves that way 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.280
 at the time of restraint of another's opinion 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.150
 man is more important to us than ours 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.920
 own opinion and it is very very 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.960
 bad my good if we want to be 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.670
 happy and successful then vector 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.460
 our attention should be directed 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.390
 first of all on myself it is not in any way 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.670
 case is not selfish you can look at 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.280
 the world with your own eyes you can look at 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.560
 world of yourself and yet be extremely 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.049
 fly altruistically extremely 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.220
 successful extremely kind person 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.070
 noble and so forth but on the world it is necessary 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.659
 look out of yourself and your own eyes a for 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.009
 this vector of your attention should 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.860
 I am sent a quote that is 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.619
 example suppose the person before 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.280
 who are constantly shy shy 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.049
 you are in front of him because you are too 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.579
 strong 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.210
 focus on his thoughts on his 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.460
 feelings neglecting your in this 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.580
 the moment you have to the contrary we are good 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.679
 concentrate on yourself and ask 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.540
 yourself as well as I will be more comfortable and 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.440
 how I want this person to become 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.550
 communicated 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.440
 and how I want to go dialogue how I want 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.820
 for a decision to be made you must 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.990
 look at the world with your own eyes from yourself 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.180
 it's actually quite simple 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.610
 make my good every time you 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.350
 will communicate or face those 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.350
 people before whom you can 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.450
 be shy you should direct the vector 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.070
 attention in yourself and lead 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.710
 internal dialogue it will be asking 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.350
 myself as i want to have a dialogue with this 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.400
 a man like i want to be taken 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.040
 decision and communication with these communication solutions 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.800
 so what decisions will you make 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.950
 these questions were answered further 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.400
 build and dialogue and further relationships 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.500
 with these people and so my good when 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.640
 you encounter other people and before 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.910
 which are you shy 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.710
 look at yourself in the hangar more 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.060
 they should be important to you before 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.220
 all in their opinion they are his opinions for 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.130
 you should be important your decision and 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.650
 your worldview they are events 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.860
 this person and this is by no means we 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.290
 well poured what you will lead 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.200
 selfishly that you will water a 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.790
 there is no other person to any person 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.820
 must be treated with respect and so 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.580
 further so the other but you have to look 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.080
 on the world with your own eyes and your vector 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.180
 attention must be directed before 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.300
 all of yourself and so what other ways are there 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.459
 not to be shy 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.860
 my good maybe sad but 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.760
 we shy when we have 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.160
 not high enough self-esteem and to 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.410
 feel free to learn more 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.430
 respect yourself more than yourself 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:05.600
 and for this there are two colossally 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:10.410
 useful and very effective exercises 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:13.019
 The first is the development of the spiritual realm 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.550
 there we can learn to appreciate ourselves and 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.550

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.150
 yourself to instill that you are super successful that you 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:05:00.180

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.630
