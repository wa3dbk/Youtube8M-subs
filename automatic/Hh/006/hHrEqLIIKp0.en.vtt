00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.599
 And then everyone back beauty here. 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.809
 now with my nokia lumia 925 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.269
 I came to talk about an interesting subject. 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.830
 and it is must have seen in the title but 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.720
 come on the white background is spend more 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.400
 drums 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.330
 well this is an interesting subject 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.330
 many people have this doubt and I already 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.219
 I saw some people talking about it there. 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.380
 so I decided to do a test of 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.469
 search for dinho and I'll talk some 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.620
 thing now to you guys say the bottom 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.450
 white spends more battery on the screen 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.000
 in the case of numbers 9 and 25 820 and 10 20 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.469
 I think these are just saying that the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.789
 amoled screen spends more then I went 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.039
 to take a test I gave a searched 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.370
 before making it very clear that it does not 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.489
 I'm a specialist in working screen 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.860
 I only gave a quick search 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:10.229
 and find out some things then the screen 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.770
 the battery banks the button on the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.180
 Back here, I did the tests. 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.509
 follows that I left 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.220
 20 minutes with screen comply with 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.490
 maximum fashion seeing you are seeing here 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.710
 brazil at the most and screen on for 20 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.259
 minutes 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.500
 Let's here the first print 100% shot 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:40.500
 charger beats hold you 20 minutes 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.329
 then 97% using the black screen on the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.170
 black background 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.850
 now passing here white background already 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.170
 pulling boot beats print 100 by 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:57.450
 one hundred twenty minutes later 95 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:02.130
 So how can you see 2% of me 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:06.310
 She spent more time on it then she is esteled 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.200
 spend more battery with the background well 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.170
 just to explain an airplane one more time 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.060
 to have none is no expense of 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.890
 battery with the mobile network issue is 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.740
 of it at most on screen lit time 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.930
 everything then why this woman of 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.690
 spend more with white background 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.120
 I gave a searched is as follows 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.550
 It seems like I'm not an expert but 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.720
 I researched is the following the screen amoled 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.110
 her great characteristic is her 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.420
 can turn on the pixels 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.820
 independently they each axis and 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.769
 by themselves 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.489
 is the following when the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:52.850
 black hospitals are off 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.340
 they are not receiving energy then 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.550
 apply the device uses less battery 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.920
 with this when it is with white background 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.620
 This means that the mobile phone 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.320
 is throwing light to the pixels is 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.959
 increasing the pixels so it spends more 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.850
 battery is I do not have not got one 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.400
 phone with a tele ps now to do 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.799
 the test did not have to take the test but 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.030
 When will I take the test and bring 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:28.549
 for you but say that the species does not 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:32.510
 spent by the following in fact at ips 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:35.060
 all the animals are lit say by 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.660
 the black pixels are accepted let's say 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.030
 they are pixels painted black have the 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.720
 Pixels Neon Flowers and Blacks are 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.239
 painted black on painted species 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.430
 in quotes right 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.299
 already in the kid like I said this black is 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.519
 pixels in light is pixels off then 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.880
 spend less battery is why the 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:02.030
 ips screen consuming more power than 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.060
 amoled because amoled when price is 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.850
 black she takes luiz saving thus 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.780
 battery already and ps no it always is 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.760
 lit 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.819
 so this is it personal canvas woman from 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:18.459
 so spent more battery with the bottom 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:21.340
 the bank of which with black background and when 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.470
 you have a device there with a campus that 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.240
 Think again, I'll do the test. 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.030
 bring him to you 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.539
 in theory is to not spend more 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.460
 let's see in practice so this was a 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.539
 interesting subject if you 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.669
