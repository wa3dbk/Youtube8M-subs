well<00:00:23.410> in<00:00:23.529> my<00:00:23.650> video<00:00:23.980> getting<00:00:24.310> started<00:00:24.670> with

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
well in my video getting started with

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.480 
well in my video getting started with
the<00:00:24.850> pentatonic<00:00:25.210> scale<00:00:25.660> I<00:00:25.990> teach<00:00:26.710> you<00:00:26.950> how<00:00:26.980> to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
the pentatonic scale I teach you how to

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:36.660 
the pentatonic scale I teach you how to
play<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.450> scale<00:00:28.750> and<00:00:29.050> groups<00:00:29.230> of<00:00:29.410> three<00:00:35.670> well

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
play the scale and groups of three well

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.210 
play the scale and groups of three well
what<00:00:36.820> about<00:00:37.090> playing<00:00:37.390> in<00:00:37.570> groups<00:00:37.750> of<00:00:37.870> four

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
what about playing in groups of four

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.619 
what about playing in groups of four
well<00:00:39.220> that's<00:00:39.520> how<00:00:39.640> I<00:00:39.670> started<00:00:40.059> this<00:00:40.120> video<00:00:40.270> out

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
well that's how I started this video out

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.060 
well that's how I started this video out
playing<00:00:41.020> in<00:00:41.140> groups<00:00:41.230> of<00:00:41.440> four<00:00:41.710> is<00:00:41.800> a<00:00:41.830> little

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
playing in groups of four is a little

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.799 
playing in groups of four is a little
bit<00:00:42.160> more<00:00:42.280> difficult<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.300> I<00:00:43.390> don't<00:00:43.449> recommend

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
bit more difficult and I don't recommend

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.320 
bit more difficult and I don't recommend
you<00:00:44.020> try<00:00:44.260> it<00:00:44.290> until<00:00:44.680> after<00:00:44.980> you've<00:00:45.100> mastered

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
you try it until after you've mastered

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.680 
you try it until after you've mastered
playing<00:00:46.330> in<00:00:46.480> groups<00:00:46.660> of<00:00:46.780> three<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:48.479> if<00:00:49.479> you

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
playing in groups of three but if you

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.850 
playing in groups of three but if you
can<00:00:49.870> play<00:00:50.019> through<00:00:50.229> all<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.500> pentatonic

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
can play through all the pentatonic

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.340 
can play through all the pentatonic
patterns<00:00:51.309> and<00:00:51.489> various<00:00:51.760> keys<00:00:52.140> ascending<00:00:53.140> and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
patterns and various keys ascending and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.420 
patterns and various keys ascending and
descending<00:00:53.940> using<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.120> sequence<00:00:55.570> of<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
descending using the sequence of the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.549 
descending using the sequence of the
triplet<00:00:57.729> sequence<00:00:58.150> then<00:00:58.960> now<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.199> might<00:00:59.409> want

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
triplet sequence then now you might want

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.500 
triplet sequence then now you might want
to<00:00:59.589> try<00:00:59.769> playing<00:01:00.010> in<00:01:00.159> groups<00:01:00.339> of<00:01:00.489> four<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.360> all

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
to try playing in groups of four and all

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.850 
to try playing in groups of four and all
you<00:01:01.629> do<00:01:01.780> is<00:01:01.930> just<00:01:02.080> start<00:01:02.290> at<00:01:02.409> the<00:01:02.440> beginning<00:01:02.559> of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
you do is just start at the beginning of

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.439 
you do is just start at the beginning of
a<00:01:02.920> pattern<00:01:03.100> I'm<00:01:03.400> using<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.879> minor<00:01:04.120> pentatonic

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
a pattern I'm using a minor pentatonic

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.240 
a pattern I'm using a minor pentatonic
pattern<00:01:04.809> one<00:01:05.350> here<00:01:06.310> at<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.490> 5th<00:01:06.700> fret<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:12.159> you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
pattern one here at the 5th fret so you

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.649 
pattern one here at the 5th fret so you
start<00:01:12.520> on<00:01:12.640> note<00:01:13.030> 1<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:13.570> you<00:01:13.630> play<00:01:13.810> up<00:01:13.990> 4<00:01:14.380> notes

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
start on note 1 and you play up 4 notes

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.820 
start on note 1 and you play up 4 notes
then<00:01:16.659> you<00:01:16.750> start<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.140> 2nd<00:01:17.470> note<00:01:17.619> in<00:01:17.740> the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
then you start in the 2nd note in the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.230 
then you start in the 2nd note in the
scale<00:01:17.950> play<00:01:18.549> up<00:01:18.700> 4<00:01:19.000> notes<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:20.320> so<00:01:20.950> on

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.390 

now<00:01:25.890> when<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:26.950> play<00:01:27.130> groups<00:01:27.550> of<00:01:27.760> 4<00:01:29.400> you're

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
now when you play groups of 4 you're

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
now when you play groups of 4 you're
going<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:30.670> have<00:01:30.760> to<00:01:30.880> do<00:01:31.000> some<00:01:31.210> finger

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
going to have to do some finger

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.130 
going to have to do some finger
substituting<00:01:32.320> because<00:01:33.250> you<00:01:33.970> just<00:01:34.270> things

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
substituting because you just things

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.770 
substituting because you just things
just<00:01:35.230> really<00:01:35.680> get<00:01:35.880> kind<00:01:36.880> of<00:01:37.000> twisted<00:01:37.360> around<00:01:37.660> a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
just really get kind of twisted around a

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.950 
just really get kind of twisted around a
little<00:01:37.900> bit<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:38.290> you'll<00:01:38.440> notice<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:39.960> instead

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
little bit so you'll notice that instead

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.140 
little bit so you'll notice that instead
of<00:01:41.020> just<00:01:41.110> using<00:01:41.530> my<00:01:41.680> 1st<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.400> ring<00:01:42.550> finger<00:01:42.970> I

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
of just using my 1st and ring finger I

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.399 
of just using my 1st and ring finger I
get<00:01:43.540> my<00:01:43.660> second<00:01:44.050> finger<00:01:44.230> involved<00:01:44.860> here

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:55.440 

I<00:01:49.590> guess<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:50.710> could<00:01:50.920> flatten<00:01:51.189> my<00:01:51.399> third<00:01:51.670> out<00:01:54.450> but

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
I guess I could flatten my third out but

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.179 
I guess I could flatten my third out but
I<00:01:55.509> don't<00:01:55.569> like<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:55.780> do<00:01:56.049> that<00:01:56.289> so<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:56.950> might

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
I don't like to do that so you might

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.160 
I don't like to do that so you might
have<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.429> experiment<00:01:57.759> with<00:01:57.969> that<00:01:58.060> too<00:01:58.299> and<00:01:58.600> as

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
have to experiment with that too and as

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.510 
have to experiment with that too and as
you<00:01:59.259> do<00:01:59.409> this<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.710> should<00:01:59.740> continuously

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
you do this you should continuously

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:13.100 
you do this you should continuously
alternate<00:02:01.090> your<00:02:01.209> pick<00:02:01.479> just<00:02:02.259> like<00:02:02.380> this<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
alternate your pick just like this and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.809 
alternate your pick just like this and
after<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.319> get<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.620> feel<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.190> this<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.670> can

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
after you get the feel of this you can

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.400 
after you get the feel of this you can
practice<00:02:16.150> doing<00:02:16.269> it<00:02:16.420> backward<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.170> start

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
practice doing it backward just start

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.320 
practice doing it backward just start
with<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.099> highest<00:02:18.400> pitched<00:02:18.610> note<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.120> go

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
with the highest pitched note and go

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:33.509 
with the highest pitched note and go
backward<00:02:20.230> for<00:02:20.500> scale<00:02:21.040> degrees<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:32.310> think<00:02:33.310> it's

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
backward for scale degrees I think it's

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.860 
backward for scale degrees I think it's
got<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> neat<00:02:33.849> sound<00:02:34.060> when<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.329> go<00:02:34.420> backward

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
got a neat sound when you go backward

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.449 
got a neat sound when you go backward
and<00:02:35.140> then<00:02:35.500> once<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.769> get<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.010> hang<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.310> this

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
and then once you get the hang of this

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.190 
and then once you get the hang of this
you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.790> try<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:40.269> other<00:02:40.599> patterns<00:02:41.049> in

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
you can try it and other patterns in

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.420 
you can try it and other patterns in
fact<00:02:41.379> I<00:02:41.500> think<00:02:41.560> it's<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.799> good<00:02:41.890> idea<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.310> go

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
fact I think it's a good idea to go

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.009 
fact I think it's a good idea to go
through<00:02:42.459> all<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.910> pentatonic<00:02:43.269> patterns<00:02:43.810> and

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
through all the pentatonic patterns and

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.229 
through all the pentatonic patterns and
in<00:02:44.500> various<00:02:44.859> keys<00:02:45.099> this<00:02:45.579> is<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.760> great<00:02:46.030> way<00:02:46.209> just

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
in various keys this is a great way just

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.360 
in various keys this is a great way just
to<00:02:46.540> develop<00:02:46.959> some<00:02:47.109> technique<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:48.129> a<00:02:48.160> great

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
to develop some technique it's a great

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.280 
to develop some technique it's a great
workout<00:02:48.760> for<00:02:49.060> your<00:02:49.150> left<00:02:49.390> hand<00:02:49.660> fingers<00:02:50.079> and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
workout for your left hand fingers and
