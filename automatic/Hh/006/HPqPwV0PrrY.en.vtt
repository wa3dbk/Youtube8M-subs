 for the top 10 which episode 9 already so 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.599
 multi call of duty that we talk about everything 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.789
 in a strong way iii black ops from black 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.630
 ops we go through all the codes 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.309
 possible and unimaginable 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.750
 so we say a holiday day yes 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.610
 unfortunately the rise and resumes 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.659
 course it's unfortunate but good so I 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.100
 let you discover this odyssey 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:40.720
 episode 9 just before the arrival of code 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.120
 kids because after ben i'll do 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.829
 certainly only on as if 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.930
 ghost for a little while and then 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.640
 we will return state surprises 10 fun or 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.839
 what to train we'll see all that we talk about it 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.290
 at the end of the top 10 I wish you a 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.290
 good video 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.590
 10th place we find rfu of so on 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.670
 hadji code with his tickey when he gets 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.080
 take a little you like in the mouth 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.460
 a wad finally guillaume a grenade 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.629
 or even earlier but that does not stop 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.440
 to do it quietly it's easy 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.440
 lead judges to you 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.410
 in second place we find claw on 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.330
 newton so with his little arms in 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.130
 diamonds and his visa way detector 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.630
 target so here it is that already 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.100
 few who sees the shareholder indeed 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.870
 quietly he goes to the only 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.280
 spot of the enemies it is done more in 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.470
 general so he makes a first chad 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.880
 that would imitate the friends ex to small 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.270
 it's this little submachine gun which 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.680
 makes sense 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.480
 he makes us here is a small quad 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.560
 quietly he will return to the spot 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.000
 unfortunately the enemies can not 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.770
 do not even ask yourself this is the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.720
 first act october on some modes 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.450
 of play so sail and continues he has 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.190
 almost killed at his insertion and 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.970
 no worry he's still doing 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.800
 a few small leaves quietly 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.370
 that's for a total of about 10 that he 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.370
 judge yours 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.320
 8th place what they are worth 2 on black 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.090
 ops exxon is sincere when he makes a 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.890
 first kill a second a third 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.480
 shutter does not even let the friends go 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.600
 and a fourth for all the cua of 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.600
 fitte 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.909
 we pass street blackops with aya plane 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.440
 effect in seventh position so with a 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.720
 sniper whose name I do not know 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.310
 unfortunately I have not been on this code 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.480
 so I can not tell you what a welcome 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.129
 late maps I'm not very stuck on 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.269
 scott but good separable performed 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.480
 first four kills that I can you the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.519
 say 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.680
 a fourth for slats with the stand 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.120
 which is not without a fifth and a 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.349
 sixth who are trying to hide in 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.700
 the car but it does not matter he has it 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.530
 still quiet here yesterday 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.690
 charge he makes himself the seventh magnificent 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.799
 the 8th and pay attention a little ninth 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.129
 for the road it would be perfect and good 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.129
 here 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.340
 the position is back to christopher 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.260
 the one with his n 94 years old you'll see 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.550
 that's funny there are still some and you 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.739
 go see he does not hide his balls a 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.120
 one bullet per enemy is the mess 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.349
 it's wrong so here's a ball 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.940
 share admitted for the moment after he goes 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.770
 get a little loose and there is so 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.140
 already makes the first four kills the cua 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.000
 of 8.5 fidh are boxers o'neill the 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.380
 meniscus h he avoids the enemies in the 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.170
 spawn and a half, but do not care that's it 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.980
 is already seven he or 6.7 who sees there 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.380
 8.9 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.080
 he continues he makes a tenth he 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.060
 see there he will wait a little bit that 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.980
 the enemies calm down went to him 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.880
 in his rival and he wants to finish his clip 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.440
 but unfortunately there is more 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.959
 of enemies so here he has his microphone in 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.600
 more and his system um 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.860
 he puts his micro system that knows and so 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.170
 he's going to look for the last enemy for 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.480
 finish his clip and make a total of 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.630
 twelve they have very little time 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.630
 beware, judge yours 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.760
 5th place psycho shot so surely do 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.800
 three on hard hat if my memories are 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.910
 good as a specialist he's here 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.490
 go get the enemies away from the facts 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.020
 a first kill and the tension the wave 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.730
 unleash life and all enemies 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.190
 five years ago this is something 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.720
 sick I saw that I was on the ass there 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.460
 So we did the five enemies here 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.540
 we feel like a girl says there she took 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.650
 any liquid especially there was the 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.860
 allies around it is frankly a clip 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.860
 crazy 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.580
 4th place sir dracula 35 on the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.440
 map mission mr dracula 35 excuse me 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.640
 so it already that the first two 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.659
 pessimistic spear he has all the trumps 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.280
 specialists see here and there frankly 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.870
 it's raining bowls on its 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.599
 enemies it's a sick thing for a 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.290
 total of what they judge to you 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.440
 oh oh alerted google return goal is 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.440
 year 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.900
 then in third position of wanted 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.020
 gamer say so surely have three 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.009
 with that the bar is 50 at that age there 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.440
 play and I can tell you 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.340
 so he makes a first faithful triple 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.780
 at the triple screen 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.800
 he will quietly hide himself because 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.240
 they see that it's starting to heat up 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.650
 there are full and mikari via more allies 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.180
 found there anyway because it is a 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.039
 sick he remakes a second triple 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.400
 screen for all the footy but I 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.400
 Jadwa 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.719
 on the place excalibur is elected only that 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.949
 give there words that he is on black 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:54.019
 ops scythe of the name he already makes us 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.489
 a triple screen with glue is the 

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:56.539
 fourth so there's no 

00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:58.789
 reappearing must know it 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.349
 so here he goes on he goes then there he 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.389
 go a little galley to you the law I you 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.349
 the cache not go there for the beam and 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.939
 then after I do not know what's going on 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.649
 the scope does not pass he calls luck 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.389
 there he goes there he passes the fifth 

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:11.709
 be careful the sixth for the full team 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.709
 krt to the judges to you 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.710
 and so the nothing of this top 10 this reflex 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.580
 tick off with his drawing 50 so here it is 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.870
 makes a product that you will see 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.820
 the team is pretty amazing 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.960
 he's doing a collection here he is super 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.330
 pressing but who is already here 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.750
 lakhouad so here I am here are five 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.280
 fidh 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.870
 attention to the eyes recharge it will not 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.980
 pay them to x and x who knows they're going 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.350
 better the team he remakes a 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.090
 simple column and one last is for 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.190
 the five civilians produced from with both 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.490
 quads inscribed a beautiful clip I 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.490
 Jatoi 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.169
 go as it may be the last 

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:46.309
 top 10 multi code before the arrival of 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.869
 ghost is maybe the last one 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:52.189
 short eh ben I put you a little bonus 

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:53.479
 sent by auriga mox or oric origami 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:55.249
 either I told myself how to pronounce it 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.319
 and form so he's surely doing 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:59.959
 three with the msr very good weapons in 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.209
 so going on honecker servers 

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:03.319
 surely on pc 1 and I do not hide 

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:04.369
 that there can be very good players 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:05.899
 of which what the clip is enough 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:07.099
 finally the series is quite impressive 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.300
 dispense also I wanted to tell me that 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.800
 that's the brothel everyone is asking 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.629
 on others and all and in the back 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.789
 others it's galley but him it 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.719
 the giro it does not bother me here it is 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.129
 done quietly it's it's 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:18.110
 it's you and loire who makes us a 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.249
 very very very long series but that's it 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.860
 he will not stop at a little bit of 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:24.349
 time and I congratulate him for that 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.999
 so here's passing so that allows me 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.159
 a little bit of telling you that I'm going to buy 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:30.080
 that kid I'll be there and that ben 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.550
 would have I'll tell you after but 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.749
 future top 10 will be in a prime 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.849
 time overcharge ghost and then after we 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:37.159
 will see so here it goes cc which 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:38.330
 send him there he's usually puts it 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.539
 live on the half hours it's pretty 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.979
 accurate anyway and that like ending 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:44.809
 a moment since the clip was already 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.139
 far enough a minute it's a trick of 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.269
 sick 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.499
 and here it is so it will stop very beautiful 

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:48.889
 gold pats or bonuses that makes 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:51.139
 pleasure 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.369
 so here it was auriga mox and that's it 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.559
 the top 10 he episodes 9 and finally 

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:56.180
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:57.829
 so going on with episode i it's going to be 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.490
 a bit of a renewal as radicals 

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:00.949
 left etc 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.779
 so if you are jfx at introduces me écoeure 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:04.579
 wanted to make me an animation for a 

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:06.229
 for the future top 10 but do not hesitate 

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:07.999
 not looking for one it will do a little bit 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.969
 to a small revival of the design all that 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:12.319
 can be nice so if the code comes out 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:14.300
 the 5 left is counting on you to mount 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:15.740
 for less than eight shock clip complaints like 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.990
 Chinese and what do you do with it? 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.309
 you do not see yourself to be 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.559
 almost sure to go if you view 

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:23.599
 first who are quality so that's it 

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:25.669
 as usual I hope this top 10 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.800
 you will have liked six cases do not forget to 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:28.910
 show your presence with a jet but 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.230
 a comment 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.460
 and so we were told very soon for 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.940
