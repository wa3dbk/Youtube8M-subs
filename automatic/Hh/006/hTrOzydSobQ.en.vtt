 Hello everyone, farmina and today we are 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.980
 for now 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.889
 let's say a video tutorial on how to install 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.280
 root game is digging 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.590
 and such a new game is like mincraft but 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.190
 she already someone and heard no one can 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.880
 already and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.350
 and played or someone wants very much 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.939
 play but you can install 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.550
 I 'll post a link to download but also 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.820
 on this is a pirated version so to speak 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.670
 and just send this folder there 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.600
 where is your game should lie here with me 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.590
 us in games to find the disk c there games 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.340
 and here's the game when you click here on 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.840
 this label think about you play now but 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.930
 no you don't start 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.560
 and there are all sorts of problems like there and 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.360
 wait for the completion of work so that 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.690
 avoid it and run normal 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.199
 the game should open the redist folder and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.950
 install all files clean everything all here 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.440
 these here are files from one to another here 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.960
 but I can't do it of course 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.240
 show what to do but no, I'm not 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.400
 I think you will understand me personally 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.290
 I had to stop only this file 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.320
 probably all others are set to 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.660
 computer either don't know this one at all 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.070
 does not open in any way but to me 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.490
 that was enough 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.149
 and can d-lex 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.600
 set everything well, sort of farther you 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:41.259
 click on the shortcut and the game opens until 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:46.149
 in the window unfortunately to change this 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:49.180
 problem, click on the general chart next 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.430
 It is changing the screen resolution is 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.520
 will be such a low for everyone 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.650
 and press fullscreen on ok and he 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.150
 asks so restart 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:05.550
 that's all seemed to show everything 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.550
 thanks for watching good luck
