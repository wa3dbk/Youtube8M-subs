00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the drop at the end it has the length of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.039 
the drop at the end it has the length of
the<00:01:49.350> UMP<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.159> pretty<00:01:50.549> much<00:01:50.790> looks<00:01:51.149> exactly

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the UMP it pretty much looks exactly

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.560 
the UMP it pretty much looks exactly
like<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.710> UMP<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.549> I'm<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.420> say

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
like the UMP and I'm just going to say

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.520 
like the UMP and I'm just going to say
now<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.680> hope<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:58.320> last

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
now I really hope it was and the last

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.450 
now I really hope it was and the last
