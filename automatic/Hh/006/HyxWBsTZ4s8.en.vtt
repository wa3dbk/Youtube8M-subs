00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.260
 com.mx greets Christian Martinoli 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 we talked a little about the league 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.800
 that will start today there are a couple of 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.080
 teams that entered in a way 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.790
 truly outrageous and when I say 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.020
 outrageous is for the subject strictly 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.119
 of the percentage of points that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.400
 they got you to aspire to be 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.320
 champion of any tournament in any 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.090
 part of the world with less than 50 per 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.759
 hundred of the units harvested me 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.020
 It seems truly laughable without 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.790
 However, we already know what the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.680
 rules of the game and there's no way to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.500
 erase them we speak strictly of 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.480
 monterrey and of guadalajara equipment that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.329
 they have potential they have good staff 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.160
 they have quality players some of 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.359
 selection of course that items that 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.579
 they can even get to mark the 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.620
 important difference when it comes to 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.670
 who are at their best in their 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.649
 better performance 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.359
 the fact is they will be able to 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.920
 beat the two big favorites that 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.659
 exist in the league for many like 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.909
 are toluca and how is the set of 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.790
 tijuana del guadalajara 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.920
 some even think in this way 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.230
 Laughing johan think he came forward 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.430
 said the Dutch let's qualify in 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.870
 the next two years we go back and for 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.940
 the good liguilla stepped forward is 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.130
 they went through the window but in the end 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.840
 it is nailed a the liguilla has the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.820
 enough capacity to face the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.300
 Toluca can defeat the general leader 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.490
 of the competition is to make up the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.200
 season to reach a semifinal may 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 get it looks very, very, very 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.190
 complicated is true that the goals of 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.790
 visitor can truly make you 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.830
 the point other than what is handled and 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.440
 Guadalajara that aspect has done well 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.660
 in guadalajara is a team that gets more 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.680
 goals as a visitor that as a local was 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.380
 even the team that scored the most goals 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.430
 got out of his house that could 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.930
 give some advantage to the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.550
 confrontation against the toluca but 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.980
 honestly always looks good 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.210
 complicated and the other side 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.620
 monterrey a team that possibly 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.510
 is thinking about the club world cup 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.220
 more than in the league that works like 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.900
 a great workout but we can 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.790
 say it and what will it serve you more 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.950
 play two games and after being 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.270
 practically three weeks without activity 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.620
 competitive 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.210
 I believe that monterrey should aspire 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.170
 to try to win the championship beyond 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.360
 that could wear it out 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.770
 possibly to reach the World 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.450
 clubs where teams usually 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.150
 of concacaf ends up making a fool of himself 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.290
 in the first exchange but monterrey 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.730
 he has a better team than Guadalajara 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.180
 from my point of view it's a team 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.680
 much more 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.209
 is a team that has experience is a 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.799
 team that surprisingly as saints 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.049
 lagoon did not play well despite having a 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.760
 great football team and that 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.950
 possibly have a chance to face 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.060
 to tijuana los chonos the only time that 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.890
 has gotten into the group was against 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.439
 scratched the previous semester and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.540
 they finished that out of the championship by 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.939
 the set of vucetich seems that 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.069
 monterrey if he gets hooked he could make a 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.349
 very good match in the technological to the 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.329
 cholos the scratch of scratches is to get you 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.459
 a field where you play on a field 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.290
 that only tijuana has and that 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.659
 only tijuana is adapted and that 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.239
 perfectly delimit the matches with 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.700
 ball stopped or evidently with 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.319
 pelotazo play the rebound and the pitch 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.109
 in tijuana the cholos and they have got 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.810
 tremendous results have 15 games 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.150
 consecutive without defeat the directed ones 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.819
 by mohamed will be capable of the monterrey in 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.739
 the technological maybe in tijuana you see 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.480
 almost impossible to play on the pavement 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.969
 he only does not know the xolos of tijuana 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.889
 so two teams that would not deserve 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:22.280
 is in the league for conditions 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.510
 football players could aspire 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.940
 obviously legitimately to be 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.470
 champions but in the strict sense 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.310
 would be 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.020
 that four points even have 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.180
 aspirations reached semifinals 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.890
 I send strong hug and we will see these two 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.980
 teams are able to surprise 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.900
 against the 1 and the 2 of the championship that 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.130
 my point of view could be both 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.130
 finalists a hug
