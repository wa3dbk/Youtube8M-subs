okay so now we're going to go over the

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.619 
okay so now we're going to go over the
ports<00:00:01.560> on<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.920> side<00:00:02.100> of<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.250> laptop<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.970> top

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
ports on this side of the laptop a top

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.180 
ports on this side of the laptop a top
here<00:00:03.810> which<00:00:03.929> is<00:00:04.080> interesting<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.589> first<00:00:05.069> time

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
here which is interesting the first time

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.590 
here which is interesting the first time
I<00:00:05.250> looked<00:00:05.430> at<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.609> didn't<00:00:05.850> actually<00:00:05.940> notice<00:00:06.299> it

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
I looked at I didn't actually notice it

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.760 
I looked at I didn't actually notice it
but<00:00:06.690> if<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:06.930> can<00:00:07.109> see<00:00:07.350> here<00:00:07.560> these<00:00:07.710> are

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
but if you can see here these are

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.400 
but if you can see here these are
actually<00:00:08.280> media<00:00:09.269> playback<00:00:09.510> buttons<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.110> stop

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
actually media playback buttons so stop

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.320 
actually media playback buttons so stop
forward<00:00:10.860> play<00:00:11.070> pause<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.790> back<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.240> that's

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
forward play pause and back so that's

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.759 
forward play pause and back so that's
actually<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.719> pretty<00:00:12.750> slick<00:00:13.170> place<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.590> put

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
actually a pretty slick place to put

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.829 
actually a pretty slick place to put
them<00:00:13.950> kudos<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.519> HP<00:00:14.730> for<00:00:14.880> doing<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.719> have

out I would love to have seen this be a
DVI<00:00:27.420> port<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.930> much<00:00:28.140> rather<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> DVI<00:00:28.949> port

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
DVI port I much rather have a DVI port

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.130 
DVI port I much rather have a DVI port
here<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.820> use<00:00:29.939> an<00:00:30.060> adapter<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:30.840> I'm

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
here and have to use an adapter if I'm

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.299 
here and have to use an adapter if I'm
hooking<00:00:31.320> up<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.740> an<00:00:31.800> old-school<00:00:32.189> projector

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
hooking up to an old-school projector

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.150 
hooking up to an old-school projector
but<00:00:32.940> putting<00:00:33.239> vga<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.840> me<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.710> seems<00:00:34.829> kind<00:00:35.100> of

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
but putting vga to me just seems kind of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.040 
but putting vga to me just seems kind of
lame<00:00:35.370> because<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.360> course<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.690> you're<00:00:36.960> going

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
lame because of course if you're going

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.630 
lame because of course if you're going
to<00:00:37.110> use<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.380> hooked<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> desktop

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
to use this hooked up to a desktop

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.819 
to use this hooked up to a desktop
monitor<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.390> run<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.960> know<00:00:40.079> fairly<00:00:40.320> high<00:00:40.559> res

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.250 
monitor and run you know fairly high res
you<00:00:41.280> want<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> use<00:00:41.640> DVI<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:42.210> possible<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:43.140> an

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
you want to use DVI if possible as an

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.900 
you want to use DVI if possible as an
expansion<00:00:43.530> port<00:00:43.950> here<00:00:44.070> that's<00:00:44.280> probably<00:00:44.610> for

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
expansion port here that's probably for

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.350 
expansion port here that's probably for
docking<00:00:45.539> stations<00:00:46.700> there's<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.789> ethernet

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
docking stations there's a ethernet

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.850 
docking stations there's a ethernet
there's<00:00:48.750> no<00:00:48.870> indication<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> side<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.739> the

there's no indication on the side of the

there's no indication on the side of the
box<00:00:50.039> whether<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.460> not<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.809> 100<00:00:51.809> megabit

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.439 
box whether or not this is 100 megabit
or<00:00:52.350> gigabit<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.520> I'm<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> assume<00:00:53.910> us<00:00:54.059> 100

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
or gigabit so I'm going to assume us 100

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.600 
or gigabit so I'm going to assume us 100
megabit<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.809> I'll<00:00:54.989> verify<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.559> another<00:00:56.250> USB

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
megabit and I'll verify that another USB

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.420 
megabit and I'll verify that another USB
port<00:00:57.120> over<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.690> which<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.260> nice<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.129> now

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
port over here which is nice because now

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.310 
port over here which is nice because now
that<00:00:59.460> means<00:00:59.760> we<00:01:00.000> far<00:01:00.270> we've<00:01:00.600> discovered<00:01:00.629> three

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that means we far we've discovered three

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.160 
that means we far we've discovered three
USB<00:01:01.590> ports<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.070> total<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.750> USB

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
USB ports in total and that is one USB

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.730 
USB ports in total and that is one USB
port<00:01:04.530> more<00:01:04.949> than<00:01:05.280> my<00:01:05.430> dell<00:01:05.640> XPS<00:01:06.119> m1330<00:01:06.420> has<00:01:07.170> now

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
port more than my dell XPS m1330 has now

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.340 
port more than my dell XPS m1330 has now
down<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:09.540> looks<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
down here this looks like it's going to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.740 
down here this looks like it's going to
be<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.740> port<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> stylist<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:12.630> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
be a port for a stylist and there is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.240 
be a port for a stylist and there is
nothing<00:01:12.960> actually<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.920> i'll<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
nothing actually there so i'll have to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.520 
nothing actually there so i'll have to
see<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.729> found<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.750> stylist<00:01:16.200> although<00:01:16.409> it's

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
see if I found a stylist although it's

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.719 
see if I found a stylist although it's
interesting<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.009> don't<00:01:17.220> remember<00:01:17.369> actually

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
maybe not maybe this is for the extra

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.520 
maybe not maybe this is for the extra
antenna<00:01:20.250> who<00:01:20.700> knows<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.720> confusing<00:01:22.080> all

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
this is the Express card slot so this is

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.370 
this is the Express card slot so this is
where<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.670> put<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> Express<00:02:00.210> card<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.840> I'm

where you put the Express card and I'm
going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.619> verify<00:02:01.979> my<00:02:02.189> hypothesis<00:02:03.060> by<00:02:03.450> putting

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
going to verify my hypothesis by putting

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260 
going to verify my hypothesis by putting
this<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.040> mixing<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.790> fits<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
this in here and mixing if it fits and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.330 
this in here and mixing if it fits and
yes<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.750> does<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.229> if<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.799> don't<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.099> an

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
yes it does so if you don't have an

including<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:52.009> Delete<00:04:52.699> key<00:04:52.729> and<00:04:53.210> these<00:04:53.570> are

including the Delete key and these are

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.110 
including the Delete key and these are
incredibly<00:04:54.500> tiny<00:04:54.830> I'm<00:04:55.160> actually<00:04:55.460> I<00:04:55.850> don't

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
incredibly tiny I'm actually I don't

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.820 
incredibly tiny I'm actually I don't
think<00:04:56.240> I've<00:04:56.330> ever<00:04:56.360> seen<00:04:56.840> keys<00:04:57.560> on<00:04:57.800> the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
think I've ever seen keys on the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.230 
think I've ever seen keys on the
keyboard<00:04:58.039> this<00:04:58.460> small<00:04:58.760> and<00:04:58.970> what's<00:04:59.120> the

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
keyboard this small and what's the

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.939 
keyboard this small and what's the
laptop<00:04:59.600> itself<00:04:59.750> as<00:05:00.139> you<00:05:00.260> know<00:05:00.350> like<00:05:00.530> about

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
laptop itself as you know like about

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.980 
laptop itself as you know like about
that<00:05:01.160> big<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:01.610> these<00:05:02.060> are<00:05:02.120> really<00:05:02.449> little<00:05:02.840> the

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
that big so these are really little the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.260 
that big so these are really little the
Delete<00:05:03.260> key<00:05:03.289> is<00:05:03.770> fairly<00:05:04.100> small<00:05:04.550> not<00:05:05.060> a<00:05:05.090> big

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
Delete key is fairly small not a big

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.730 
Delete key is fairly small not a big
deal<00:05:05.419> because<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.780> back<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.229> backspace<00:05:06.710> key

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
deal because the back the backspace key

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.450 
deal because the back the backspace key
is<00:05:07.660> is<00:05:08.660> a<00:05:08.720> decent<00:05:08.960> size<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:10.220> then<00:05:10.340> of<00:05:10.430> course

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
is is a decent size and then of course

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.370 
is is a decent size and then of course
up<00:05:10.820> here<00:05:11.330> we<00:05:11.600> have<00:05:11.750> a<00:05:11.780> couple<00:05:12.110> of<00:05:12.199> other

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
up here we have a couple of other

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.900 
up here we have a couple of other
buttons<00:05:12.770> on<00:05:12.949> the<00:05:13.070> actual<00:05:13.310> tablet<00:05:13.699> actually

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
buttons on the actual tablet actually

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.710 
buttons on the actual tablet actually
what<00:05:14.000> I'm<00:05:14.060> going<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.210> do<00:05:14.360> is<00:05:14.449> I'm<00:05:14.539> just<00:05:14.570> going

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.640 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to<00:05:15.370> transform<00:05:16.599> to<00:05:17.599> that's<00:05:18.380> some<00:05:18.500> nice

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
to transform to that's some nice

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.850 
to transform to that's some nice
reflection<00:05:19.220> we're<00:05:19.729> gonna<00:05:19.849> transform<00:05:20.270> into

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
reflection we're gonna transform into

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.520 
reflection we're gonna transform into
sleep<00:05:21.860> mode<00:05:21.889> so<00:05:22.580> now<00:05:22.729> we<00:05:22.789> have<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.300> actual

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
sleep mode so now we have the actual

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.680 
sleep mode so now we have the actual
unit<00:05:24.530> in<00:05:24.740> in<00:05:25.039> slave<00:05:25.340> mode<00:05:25.370> here<00:05:25.849> again<00:05:26.509> it's

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
unit in in slave mode here again it's

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.029 
unit in in slave mode here again it's
kind<00:05:26.870> of<00:05:26.900> hard<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.110> fit<00:05:27.349> everything<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:27.889> need<00:05:28.010> a

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
kind of hard to fit everything I need a

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.560 
kind of hard to fit everything I need a
wide<00:05:28.250> angle<00:05:28.460> lens<00:05:28.789> on<00:05:28.940> this<00:05:29.060> camera<00:05:29.330> that's

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
wide angle lens on this camera that's

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.510 
wide angle lens on this camera that's
what<00:05:29.690> I<00:05:29.720> really<00:05:29.960> need<00:05:30.110> so<00:05:30.800> we<00:05:31.039> have<00:05:31.190> a<00:05:31.220> couple

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
what I really need so we have a couple

what I really need so we have a couple
of<00:05:31.580> extra<00:05:31.910> buttons<00:05:32.389> here<00:05:32.690> we<00:05:32.810> have<00:05:33.099> the<00:05:34.099> fact

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
of extra buttons here we have the fact

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.219 
of extra buttons here we have the fact
that<00:05:34.400> we<00:05:34.580> have<00:05:34.760> altec<00:05:35.389> lansing<00:05:35.900> speakers

know if HP saves you know fifty cents

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.909 
know if HP saves you know fifty cents
per<00:05:41.240> laptop<00:05:41.630> if<00:05:41.810> they<00:05:41.900> let<00:05:42.050> out<00:05:42.199> to<00:05:42.409> put<00:05:42.770> their

per laptop if they let out to put their
logo<00:05:43.070> there<00:05:43.400> but<00:05:43.610> I<00:05:43.820> would<00:05:44.210> just<00:05:44.389> as<00:05:44.510> soon<00:05:44.539> make

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
logo there but I would just as soon make

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.810 
logo there but I would just as soon make
that<00:05:45.349> vanish<00:05:45.770> I<00:05:45.949> don't<00:05:46.099> need<00:05:46.280> to<00:05:46.430> be<00:05:46.580> reminded

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
that vanish I don't need to be reminded

it's altec lansing speakers we have a
button<00:05:49.610> here<00:05:49.849> I'm<00:05:49.970> assuming<00:05:50.300> that's<00:05:50.360> going<00:05:50.539> to

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
button here I'm assuming that's going to

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:52.719 
button here I'm assuming that's going to
be<00:05:50.659> a<00:05:50.690> screen<00:05:50.960> rotation<00:05:51.349> a<00:05:51.800> button<00:05:52.430> that<00:05:52.460> has<00:05:52.580> a

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
be a screen rotation a button that has a

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:54.159 
be a screen rotation a button that has a
cog<00:05:53.120> I'm<00:05:53.389> assuming<00:05:53.720> there's<00:05:53.840> gonna<00:05:53.930> be<00:05:54.050> some

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
cog I'm assuming there's gonna be some

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.290 
cog I'm assuming there's gonna be some
kind<00:05:54.320> of<00:05:54.349> a<00:05:54.440> control<00:05:54.830> panel<00:05:55.039> and<00:05:55.370> there's<00:05:56.180> a

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
kind of a control panel and there's a

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.969 
kind of a control panel and there's a
couple<00:05:56.479> buttons<00:05:56.750> here<00:05:57.139> actually<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:57.770> take<00:05:57.919> that

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
couple buttons here actually I take that

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.740 
couple buttons here actually I take that
back<00:05:58.099> this<00:05:58.490> one<00:05:58.729> this<00:05:58.970> one<00:05:59.150> looks<00:05:59.330> like<00:05:59.389> screen

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
back this one this one looks like screen

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.439 
back this one this one looks like screen
rotation<00:06:00.080> there's<00:06:01.039> a<00:06:01.099> DVD<00:06:01.550> button<00:06:01.880> oh<00:06:02.060> hey

rotation there's a DVD button oh hey
look<00:06:02.570> at<00:06:02.690> that<00:06:02.720> now<00:06:03.050> the<00:06:03.110> laptop<00:06:03.650> is<00:06:03.800> actually

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
look at that now the laptop is actually

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.740 
look at that now the laptop is actually
booting<00:06:04.580> up<00:06:04.669> here<00:06:04.909> because<00:06:05.030> I<00:06:05.240> guess<00:06:05.479> want<00:06:05.659> to

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
booting up here because I guess want to

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.510 
booting up here because I guess want to
press<00:06:05.930> that<00:06:06.080> button<00:06:06.349> it<00:06:06.949> brought<00:06:07.159> it<00:06:07.280> out<00:06:07.370> of

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
press that button it brought it out of

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.120 
press that button it brought it out of
some<00:06:07.699> sort<00:06:07.909> of<00:06:07.970> a<00:06:08.090> suspend<00:06:08.870> state<00:06:09.199> so<00:06:09.560> it's

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
some sort of a suspend state so it's

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.500 
some sort of a suspend state so it's
actually<00:06:10.400> starting<00:06:10.550> to<00:06:10.729> boot<00:06:10.970> but<00:06:11.210> you<00:06:11.419> know

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
actually starting to boot but you know

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.580 
actually starting to boot but you know
we're<00:06:11.630> just<00:06:11.659> going<00:06:11.930> to<00:06:11.960> go<00:06:12.229> ahead<00:06:12.320> and<00:06:12.470> ignore

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
we're just going to go ahead and ignore

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.570 
we're just going to go ahead and ignore
that<00:06:12.830> up<00:06:13.400> here<00:06:13.729> we<00:06:13.849> have<00:06:14.030> a<00:06:14.300> microphone

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
that up here we have a microphone

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.010 
that up here we have a microphone
integrated<00:06:16.580> webcam<00:06:16.820> assuming<00:06:17.659> it's<00:06:17.780> probably

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
integrated webcam assuming it's probably

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.890 
integrated webcam assuming it's probably
a<00:06:18.220> you<00:06:19.220> know<00:06:19.340> vga<00:06:19.699> quality<00:06:19.909> but<00:06:20.270> I<00:06:20.300> will<00:06:20.539> verify

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
a you know vga quality but I will verify

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.439 
a you know vga quality but I will verify
that<00:06:21.430> second<00:06:22.430> microphone<00:06:22.669> here<00:06:23.060> so<00:06:23.240> you<00:06:23.330> can

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
that second microphone here so you can

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.870 
that second microphone here so you can
do<00:06:23.539> the<00:06:23.690> funky<00:06:23.870> array<00:06:24.440> thing<00:06:24.830> and<00:06:25.070> that's

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
do the funky array thing and that's

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.790 
do the funky array thing and that's
basically<00:06:26.180> at<00:06:26.599> oh<00:06:26.750> I<00:06:26.990> forgot<00:06:27.199> there's<00:06:27.710> a

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
basically at oh I forgot there's a

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.159 
basically at oh I forgot there's a
fingerprint<00:06:28.520> scanner<00:06:28.880> so<00:06:29.150> over<00:06:29.389> here<00:06:29.659> there's

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
fingerprint scanner so over here there's

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.140 
fingerprint scanner so over here there's
the<00:06:30.289> old<00:06:30.500> you<00:06:30.680> know<00:06:30.740> swipe<00:06:31.310> the<00:06:31.490> finger<00:06:31.820> over

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
the old you know swipe the finger over

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.719 
the old you know swipe the finger over
and<00:06:32.360> have<00:06:32.870> it<00:06:32.990> read<00:06:33.229> I'm<00:06:33.919> not<00:06:34.219> a<00:06:34.250> big<00:06:34.460> fan<00:06:34.490> of

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729 
and have it read I'm not a big fan of

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.370 
and have it read I'm not a big fan of
most<00:06:35.029> fingerprint<00:06:35.570> scanners<00:06:35.960> because<00:06:36.229> the

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
most fingerprint scanners because the

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.410 
most fingerprint scanners because the
software<00:06:36.919> on<00:06:37.070> for

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
software on for

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.110 
software on for
certainly<00:06:37.690> tends<00:06:38.500> to<00:06:38.710> really<00:06:38.980> suck<00:06:39.490> on<00:06:39.760> it<00:06:39.790> but

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
certainly tends to really suck on it but

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.630 
certainly tends to really suck on it but
hopefully<00:06:40.300> HP<00:06:40.960> has<00:06:41.200> better<00:06:41.800> software<00:06:42.250> then

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
hopefully HP has better software then

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.450 
hopefully HP has better software then
Adele<00:06:43.060> has<00:06:43.300> so<00:06:43.900> that<00:06:44.260> is<00:06:44.470> my<00:06:44.650> quick<00:06:45.070> unboxing
