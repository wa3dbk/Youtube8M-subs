00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.600
 My intense dreams 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.740
 with great torments 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.260
 just lead me to think that it never existed 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500
 But I can smell you 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.240
 on my pillow 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.580
 and start to remember everything I've lived 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.000
 Unusual Moments 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.180
 I'm romantic and in love 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.620
 I thought I'd never lose you 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.660
 Inside that motel room 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.200
 I loved you, in a way, I was never cruel. 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.040
 All I did was not lose you ... 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.820
 You're gone 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.360
 and left me 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.520
 they were injured 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.420
 that never go out at once 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.740
 only illusion 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.340
 What you felt was never love. 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.540
 it was not passion 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.340
 And he left me, 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.000
 they were injured 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.660
 that never go out at once 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.380
 only illusion 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.280
 What you felt was never love. 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.900
 it was not passion
