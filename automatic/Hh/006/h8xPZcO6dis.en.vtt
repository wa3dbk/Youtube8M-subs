like<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.220> don't<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.640> don't<00:00:26.699> really<00:00:26.970> care<00:00:27.240> for

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
like I don't I don't really care for

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.240 
like I don't I don't really care for
having<00:00:27.750> fingerprints<00:00:28.320> all<00:00:28.410> over<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.800> case

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
having fingerprints all over the case

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.999 
having fingerprints all over the case
because<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.789> phone<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.269> already<00:00:31.009> fingerprint

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
because the phone is already fingerprint

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.639 
because the phone is already fingerprint
magnet<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.700> back<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.440> don't<00:00:34.440> know<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
magnet on the back I don't know if you

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.410 
magnet on the back I don't know if you
can<00:00:34.800> tell<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.219> not<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.880> tracks

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
can tell or not but it tracks

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.350 
can tell or not but it tracks
fingerprints<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.290> crazy<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> decided<00:00:39.180> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
fingerprints like crazy so I decided to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.860 
fingerprints like crazy so I decided to
get<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.530> has<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> polycarbonate<00:00:42.030> external

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
get this it has a polycarbonate external

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.110 
get this it has a polycarbonate external
shell<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.770> doesn't<00:00:43.950> attract<00:00:44.340> fingerprints

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
shell so it doesn't attract fingerprints

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.450 
shell so it doesn't attract fingerprints
at<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.469> really<00:00:46.649> good<00:00:46.710> case<00:00:47.010> it's
