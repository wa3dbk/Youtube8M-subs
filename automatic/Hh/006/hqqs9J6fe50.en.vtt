00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
hi guys reviewing sims medieval but you

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.749 
hi guys reviewing sims medieval but you
might<00:00:03.990> have<00:00:04.020> seen<00:00:04.290> on<00:00:04.500> my<00:00:04.680> channel<00:00:05.100> I've<00:00:05.370> had

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
might have seen on my channel I've had

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.259 
might have seen on my channel I've had
the<00:00:06.210> unboxing<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.500> game<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.269> the

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
the unboxing of this game and the

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.610 
the unboxing of this game and the
gameplay<00:00:10.200> videos<00:00:10.559> which<00:00:11.490> are<00:00:11.900> probably<00:00:12.900> just

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
gameplay videos which are probably just

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.129 
gameplay videos which are probably just
as<00:00:13.799> good<00:00:14.009> Alice<00:00:14.759> actually<00:00:15.420> playing<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> game

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
as good Alice actually playing the game

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.830 
as good Alice actually playing the game
because<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.279> really<00:00:17.580> not<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.000> interactive

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
because it's really not that interactive

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.660 
because it's really not that interactive
so<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.529> might<00:00:19.800> as<00:00:19.920> well<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.250> watch<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
so you might as well just watch the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.240 
so you might as well just watch the
gameplay<00:00:21.090> videos<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> limited

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
gameplay videos this this is a limited

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.029 
gameplay videos this this is a limited
edition<00:00:23.449> but<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.480> haven't<00:00:24.689> entered<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> Kurds

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
edition but I haven't entered the Kurds

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.540 
edition but I haven't entered the Kurds
and<00:00:26.340> yet<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:27.060> get<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.480> bonus<00:00:28.380> items<00:00:29.039> it's

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
and yet to get the bonus items it's

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.130 
and yet to get the bonus items it's
probably<00:00:29.849> not<00:00:30.029> necessary<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.109> I

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
probably not necessary to get it but I

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.470 
probably not necessary to get it but I
think<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.710> my<00:00:31.949> websites<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.880> limited

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
think on my websites this limited

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.170 
think on my websites this limited
edition<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.930> cheaper<00:00:34.469> than<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.680> actual

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
edition is cheaper than the actual

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.840 
edition is cheaper than the actual
normal<00:00:36.180> edition<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> got<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.850> guide

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
normal edition and when I got the guide

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
normal edition and when I got the guide
to<00:00:39.149> dinner<00:00:39.360> which<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.739> got<00:00:40.890> this

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
to dinner which is this you got this

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.970 
to dinner which is this you got this
today<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.210> got<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> same

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
today and if you know it's got the same

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.920 
today and if you know it's got the same
front<00:00:43.980> cover<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.579> i<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
front cover so i think really the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869 
front cover so i think really the
limited<00:00:46.230> editions<00:00:46.710> probably<00:00:47.129> my<00:00:47.280> standard

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
limited editions probably my standard

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.610 
limited editions probably my standard
BAM<00:00:48.809> normal<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.789> anywhere<00:00:51.449> back<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
BAM normal then I can anywhere back to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.389 
BAM normal then I can anywhere back to
the<00:00:52.949> review<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.140> again<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.039> not

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the review of that again so this is not

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.849 
the review of that again so this is not
an<00:00:56.579> expansion<00:00:57.180> pack<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:58.489> thought<00:00:59.489> what<00:01:00.710> was<00:01:01.710> I

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
an expansion pack I thought what was I

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.429 
an expansion pack I thought what was I
the<00:01:01.920> only<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.309> who<00:01:02.460> was<00:01:02.579> misled<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.809> example

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the only one who was misled for example

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.500 
the only one who was misled for example
on<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.430> back<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.790> again<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.600> says<00:01:07.100> lead<00:01:08.100> your

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
on the back and again it says lead your

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.570 
on the back and again it says lead your
medieval<00:01:09.510> Sims<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> adventure<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
medieval Sims on the adventure that

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.780 
medieval Sims on the adventure that
their<00:01:11.880> lives<00:01:12.290> well<00:01:13.290> really<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.340> doesn't<00:01:14.490> shake

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
their lives well really it doesn't shake

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.340 
their lives well really it doesn't shake
their<00:01:14.970> lamps<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.810> you're

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
their lamps it's not like you're

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.649 
their lamps it's not like you're
completely<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.310> free<00:01:17.580> room<00:01:17.850> making<00:01:18.240> choices

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
completely in free room making choices

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.890 
completely in free room making choices
and<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.409> their<00:01:20.250> outcomes<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:21.420> literally

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
and to their outcomes it's literally

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.460 
and to their outcomes it's literally
just<00:01:22.049> quests<00:01:22.970> just<00:01:23.970> quest<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> quest<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
just quests just quest and the quest and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.140 
just quests just quest and the quest and
not<00:01:25.920> there's<00:01:26.790> no<00:01:27.530> thought<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.740> them<00:01:28.939> we<00:01:29.939> get

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
not there's no thought in them we get

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.730 
not there's no thought in them we get
choice<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.900> two<00:01:31.049> options<00:01:31.560> sometimes<00:01:32.270> but<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
choice of two options sometimes but I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
choice of two options sometimes but I
think<00:01:34.740> whichever<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.030> choose<00:01:36.090> you

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
think whichever one you choose you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.569 
think whichever one you choose you
probably<00:01:37.170> end<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> same<00:01:37.829> outcome

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
probably end up with the same outcome

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.030 
probably end up with the same outcome
not<00:01:39.509> sure<00:01:39.720> where<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.320> sure<00:01:40.650> it'll<00:01:40.860> tell

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
not sure where that but sure it'll tell

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950 
not sure where that but sure it'll tell
me<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> guide<00:01:41.490> about<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.750> means

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
me in the guide about that so this means

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.170 
me in the guide about that so this means
we<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.320> an<00:01:43.439> expansion<00:01:43.979> pack<00:01:44.009> we're<00:01:44.759> thinking

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
we do an expansion pack we're thinking

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.510 
we do an expansion pack we're thinking
that<00:01:45.210> mere<00:01:45.990> will<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> time<00:01:47.100> from<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that mere will be the time from that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.410 
that mere will be the time from that
early<00:01:47.880> mayor<00:01:48.119> since<00:01:48.960> generations<00:01:49.799> all<00:01:50.610> about

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
early mayor since generations all about

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.039 
early mayor since generations all about
the<00:01:52.079> kids<00:01:52.320> being<00:01:52.740> outside<00:01:53.810> should<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:54.899> good

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the kids being outside should be good

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.020 
the kids being outside should be good
much<00:01:55.500> better<00:01:55.770> than<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.070> anywhere<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.909> not

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
much better than this anywhere it's not

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.690 
much better than this anywhere it's not
an<00:01:57.149> expansion<00:01:57.719> pack<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.189> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
an expansion pack what is it it's a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.270 
an expansion pack what is it it's a
standalone<00:02:00.119> game<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:01.110> don't<00:02:01.320> need<00:02:01.469> sims<00:02:01.829> 3<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
disappointing you go to a quest you go

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.870 
disappointing you go to a quest you go
to<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.780> forest<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.310> need<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.760> go

presuming that this game is not

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.690 
presuming that this game is not
unlimited<00:05:43.500> it'd<00:05:44.500> be<00:05:44.770> nice<00:05:44.950> if<00:05:45.010> it<00:05:45.400> was<00:05:45.520> an

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
unlimited it'd be nice if it was an

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.190 
unlimited it'd be nice if it was an
incentive<00:05:46.210> like<00:05:46.390> could<00:05:46.660> you<00:05:46.690> all<00:05:46.840> requests
