00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.139
 if we already live very good and with that all 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.630
 those who listen to us obviously a 

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:11.900
 little sad power because I expected it to be 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.990
 I could save that opportunity and go to 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.060
 these five months to Spain and then see 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.430
 what happens but but good in the end the 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.920
 fifa makes the decision of the refusal that 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.720
 Obviously the one is respected but I do not know 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.220
 It's not nice to know what was lost 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.580
 that opportunity in these five months and 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.319
 of course now that they go to me I do not 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.819
 It was clear at the press conference that 

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:37.069
 the president does not lift me up 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:38.839
 Of course, do not be afraid, he heard you 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.879
 it was clear the explanation that they 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.829
 They gave about why finally 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.530
 your registration could not be made with the 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.899
 lift not only to hear the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.539
 conference but but good 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.819
 donkey kong to the friends of the medium that 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.609
 the fifa because there simply was not much 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:57.920
 reason more than more precisely the fact 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.879
 that arrived one minute later he 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.960
 signing all the documents now 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.909
 because well there we saw also the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.520
 times in which it was negotiating 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.880
 and there was no option that that had 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.549
 done with more advance brain request 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.520
 What happens is that I can not, because I did not want 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.689
 the loan option later is the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.030
 mind that has been validated by sale 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.880
 then to sell but two the option to 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.610
 loan not our hand even if 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.340
 well I was talking many times 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.110
 with them trying to convince them of 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.899
 that make me go on loan that the 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.130
 benefit for everyone and even stress to 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.069
 late afternoon if I was concentrating on 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.990
 to share of being able to try to live 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.420
 by when we achieve it and convince them 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.520
 health to convince them and I say everything 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.590
 the most pleasant and possible but in the end 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.270
 the proponent came late because the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.030
 boxcar did not want a bryant loan 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.180
 because they wanted a one-time sale 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.220
 good because with the advantage they feel 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.690
 that come to it seems that with that 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.710
 we understand that it was for having me in 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.149
 your computer before 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.700
 to measure these five months he tried to 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.890
 convince them that one hour will record a 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.000
 first division 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.000
 of the world 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.459
 everyone could all want to win them 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.760
 if things were done well a possible 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.760
 sale 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:42.230
 to try that all the coach and 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.380
 the leaders managed to understand it and and 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.540
 it was heard but but such now we must be 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.760
 clear bryant I understand that you are 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.160
 making an effort also around 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.019
 of the competitive part or that the 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.940
 final is not only an economic issue 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.640
 because someone could think that only 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.640
 you're thinking about that but in the end I 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.010
 It gives the impression that you're trying 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.930
 even if it's for less but to link you in 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.700
 the competitive team where you can 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.290
 maintain the level you achieved and even 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.910
 that you showed after the world 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.400
 this body that raise economically 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.530
 it's not a team port is the part 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.519
 economic here 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.890
 I did not notice any problem in my part 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.410
 the same thing I asked was that 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.170
 keep the same one knows what it was 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.599
 in trouble because the equipment that 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.069
 they will be happy but if the idea of ​​mine 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.860
 wants that in europe and I think after 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.500
 of world in love that never so much 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.450
 football as surely as 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.459
 and I think that is one of the reasons 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.380
 put no, I 'm not much with her because 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.989
 they know that it can help people who 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.530
 can help us a lot in a tournament this 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.620
 dangerous more than all are hundreds 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.849
 they have football in the sense of your 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.530
 thumb wants me wants me to stay 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.630
 here good I have contact with them 10 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.579
 despite fulfilling that contract 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.620
 Bryant showed that even in 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.120
 some means in Spain not only 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.849
 with the lift but also with others 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.400
 clubs was willing to go down a bit 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.829
 your economic conditions to be able 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.019
 play that's true whether you're doing 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.030
 that effort with the desire to be able to 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.709
 be competitive 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.709
 in this world at this moment in europe 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.910
 for me the most important thing is football 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.160
 from before the money but also 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.110
 of starting my family then what 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.900
 we are looking to try to reach a 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.730
 to a balance in both parts now 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.130
 get a motorbike touristy and 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.030
 advance the economic part of your future 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.640
 also from my family and my future in 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.260
 the economic part but the main thing 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.790
 here is to try to advance the towel well 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.590
 that I did not say that I'm going to give my 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.970
 salary nor that I'm going to get a lot 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.630
 previously I want a balance and the 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:59.050
 teams that those who have come for me already 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.810
 they know more or less how many are the 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.780
 commissions that one 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.400
 Bryant is amazing because good 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.560
 they are coming from the world we speak 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.410
 a lot on the subject but some still 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.980
 they had doubt in the world over let's say 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.750
 the leadership ability that in the end to 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.330
 Despite any doubt you had in the 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.610
 world is the best moment since my 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.180
 bryant perspective that proved everything 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.530
 it was in the world where definitely 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.580
 you had a great time but then you come 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.960
 all this bryant 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:36.349
 one expected to see you absolutely 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.050
 consolidated playing quite and being 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.449
 undisputed figure of the team that 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.439
 you were in europe in the situation was 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.389
 that is the second let's say that second 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:49.460
 division where fulham falls you think 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.669
 which is where the issue that happened is 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.669
 Really 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.980
 practically the same as I thought 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.460
 inherit worldwide this world name of 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.889
 the possibility of selling that was the idea 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.600
 of game or my idea also exists 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:09.270
 it's a spectacular world all good 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.270
 we know well that in memory all 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.850
 may my highest value and that the 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:22.660
 interested teams could get there 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.880
 have doubts and that is part of football 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.600
 without success it is the cutest thing that can 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.750
 to pass this is a business in which 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.730
 also and what they can 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.800
 I play football well and have the 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:40.320
 right to look for what I'm going for 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:43.240
 cuba yo wilde is everything for me 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:47.250
 physically and physically I am in my 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.630
 best time and I'm sure none 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.490
 You're in good spirits, you do not feel bad 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.729
 you are positive around all this 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.729
 what's going on 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:02.639
 of the transfer 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:16.599
 do not share it is part of what is 

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:20.069
 convinced us of our partner and 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:20.069
 nothing remains but equate
