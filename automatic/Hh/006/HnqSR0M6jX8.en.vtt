00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 let's see how to create a coil or spiral 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.880
 of wire in inventor 2003 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.269
 For this we click on the new 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.839
 start tab and here we go to 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.580
 select standard part millimeter and 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.039
 pp we create then here we have our 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.800
 drawing screen and in the part 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.439
 left we have origin we give a click and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.489
 here we have different planes we 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.270
 we click on create sketch and see the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.260
 xz plane has been placed in the part 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.989
 white on sale drawing xy flat 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.480
 recognize the planes and the xy plane if 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.360
 we want to create a coil in the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.219
 plane to xz then we should choose a 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:57.120
 z axis for the axis if we create a 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.180
 flat x and the sketch we should 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.329
 choose an axis I say then let's 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.559
 choose in this case flat x and y in 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.630
 our 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.259
 the set the flowerpot 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:16.329
 then we are going to create a more circle or 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:19.899
 less here we put a value of 5 and 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:22.329
 then we will be in 3d model and in the 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.250
 create panel we have on top 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:30.909
 We have coil or spiral wire 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.640
 we select with this button the z axis and 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.600
 that we have chosen a xy plane for 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.600
 xml code 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.700
 sketch then z axis and if the step is 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.240
 suitable as to draw then 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.349
 let's go to size tab and here we go to 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.439
 change for example to 10 laps in 

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:58.390
 this case the step between here and here is 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:01.060
 10 we press ok and we have finished 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.240
 our coil 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:09.039
 now let's see the other case we click on 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.010
 new standard millimeter and we create and 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:17.250
 let's choose now the xy plane 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.250
 then we created olan xy 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:27.569
 now we go circle click here 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:33.760
 5 in diameter now let's go to the part of 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:38.200
 3 coil flight and since we have 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.609
 chosen plane x and felix and back 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.900
 Vessel size is right here we go to 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:50.680
 give 7 units of laps press ok 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.129
 and now we visualize it with the house in 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.840
 3d mode see the difference 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:01.090
 this was created in the xz plane would be the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.219
 from here x zeta 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.349
 that is, this circle is located in the 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:10.060
 plane x eta and the z axis served as for 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.640
 do 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.090
 precisely and the editor up 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.700
 and in the other case we have here 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.370
 chosen the x plane and see that this 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.020
 circle is in the plane here yes and the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:29.459
 chosen axis is the one for a displacement 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:32.010
 vertical then this with the one here 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.120
 while in the other case then this 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:42.860
 with him and here we can not see here 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.860
 it was xz with aging ready
