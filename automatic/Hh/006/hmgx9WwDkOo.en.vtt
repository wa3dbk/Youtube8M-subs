00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.700 
requires that there be a specific
individual

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
individual

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.070 
individual
or<00:02:14.240> in<00:02:15.240> one<00:02:15.300> part<00:02:15.750> at<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.020> building<00:02:16.890> or

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
or in one part at a building or

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.760 
or in one part at a building or
organization<00:02:19.080> or<00:02:19.170> something<00:02:19.530> or<00:02:19.620> other

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
organization or something or other

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.810 
organization or something or other
that's<00:02:19.860> very<00:02:20.310> specific<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.000> identify<00:02:21.450> and

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
that's very specific and identify and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.660 
that's very specific and identify and
this<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> generalized<00:02:24.510> threat<00:02:24.870> and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
this is a generalized threat and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.290 
this is a generalized threat and
therefore<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:26.820> not<00:02:27.290> necessarily<00:02:28.290> a

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
therefore it's not necessarily a

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.080 
therefore it's not necessarily a
criminal<00:02:30.300> offense<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.490> why<00:02:32.670> did<00:02:32.940> they

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
criminal offense and so why did they

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.670 
criminal offense and so why did they
kill<00:02:33.300> him<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.600> mean<00:02:33.750> what's<00:02:33.960> behind<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.500> what

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
kill him I mean what's behind it what

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.490 
kill him I mean what's behind it what
exactly<00:02:35.280> were<00:02:35.430> they<00:02:35.610> trying<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.270> solve<00:02:37.140> or

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
exactly were they trying to solve or

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.070 
exactly were they trying to solve or
help<00:02:37.710> well<00:02:38.460> I<00:02:38.880> think<00:02:39.090> they<00:02:39.570> decided<00:02:39.960> maybe

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
help well I think they decided maybe

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.570 
help well I think they decided maybe
they<00:02:40.320> didn't<00:02:40.530> want<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.710> send<00:02:40.890> him<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.130> back<00:02:41.430> to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
they didn't want to send him to back to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.210 
they didn't want to send him to back to
Iraq<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:42.600> didn't<00:02:42.900> want<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.290> admit<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:44.010> they

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
Iraq but didn't want to admit that they

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.290 
Iraq but didn't want to admit that they
should<00:02:44.520> let<00:02:44.730> him<00:02:44.820> go

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
should let him go

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.890 
should let him go
so<00:02:45.840> they<00:02:46.430> created<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.640> situation<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.390> think<00:02:48.660> I

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
so they created the situation I think I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.440 
so they created the situation I think I
think<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.620> his<00:02:49.890> company<00:02:50.250> commander

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
think that his company commander

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.430 
think that his company commander
overreacted<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.600> maybe<00:02:51.810> his<00:02:51.990> battalion

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
overreacted and maybe his battalion

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.740 
overreacted and maybe his battalion
commander<00:02:52.890> once<00:02:53.820> they<00:02:53.970> listen<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.510> song

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
commander once they listen to the song

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.080 
commander once they listen to the song
and<00:02:55.310> felt<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.490> he<00:02:56.580> was<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> dangerous

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
and felt that he was a dangerous

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.430 
and felt that he was a dangerous
individual<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:59.240> did<00:03:00.240> what<00:03:00.420> they<00:03:00.570> thought<00:03:01.230> was

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
individual and did what they thought was

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.290 
individual and did what they thought was
correct<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.070> put<00:03:02.220> him<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.400> jail<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.150> could

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
correct and put him in jail and so could

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.090 
correct and put him in jail and so could
this<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.660> one<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.020> major<00:03:04.230> flaws<00:03:04.620> when<00:03:04.980> it

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
this be one of the major flaws when it

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.340 
this be one of the major flaws when it
comes<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.760> stop-loss<00:03:06.030> policy<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.990> if<00:03:07.080> so

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
comes to the stop-loss policy and if so

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.110 
comes to the stop-loss policy and if so
I<00:03:07.380> mean<00:03:07.650> why<00:03:07.830> does<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.190> army<00:03:08.370> continue<00:03:08.970> to

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
I mean why does the army continue to

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.200 
I mean why does the army continue to
employ<00:03:09.960> it<00:03:10.170> when<00:03:10.350> they've<00:03:10.560> met<00:03:10.920> their<00:03:11.310> goal<00:03:12.180> of

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
employ it when they've met their goal of

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.900 
employ it when they've met their goal of
having<00:03:12.600> around<00:03:13.050> 500,000<00:03:14.040> soldiers<00:03:14.310> even

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
having around 500,000 soldiers even

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.450 
having around 500,000 soldiers even
before<00:03:15.480> their<00:03:15.720> deadline<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.260> 2012<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.340> this

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
before their deadline of 2012 is this

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.980 
before their deadline of 2012 is this
really<00:03:17.730> necessary<00:03:17.910> anymore

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
really necessary anymore

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.260 
really necessary anymore
well<00:03:19.650> it's<00:03:19.800> necessary<00:03:20.160> because<00:03:20.280> they<00:03:21.060> may<00:03:21.210> be

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
well it's necessary because they may be

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.840 
well it's necessary because they may be
meeting<00:03:21.930> their<00:03:22.050> quotas<00:03:22.470> for<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:23.520> total

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
meeting their quotas for the total

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.340 
meeting their quotas for the total
number<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.120> soldiers<00:03:24.570> but<00:03:24.840> not<00:03:24.960> the<00:03:25.110> soldiers

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
number of soldiers but not the soldiers

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.680 
number of soldiers but not the soldiers
who<00:03:25.590> go<00:03:25.710> and<00:03:25.860> fight<00:03:26.100> all<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.340> time<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.820> mean<00:03:27.330> the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
who go and fight all the time I mean the

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.540 
who go and fight all the time I mean the
the<00:03:27.960> actual<00:03:28.650> fighters<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.700> infantry<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.600> the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
the actual fighters the infantry and the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.680 
the actual fighters the infantry and the
cavalry<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.850> artillery<00:03:33.300> and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
cavalry and the artillery and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.740 
cavalry and the artillery and
what-have-you<00:03:34.730> are<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.790> small<00:03:36.120> segment<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.660> the

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
what-have-you are a small segment of the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.010 
what-have-you are a small segment of the
whole<00:03:37.320> military<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:38.450> they're<00:03:39.450> always<00:03:39.750> short

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
whole military and they're always short

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.690 
whole military and they're always short
these<00:03:40.170> people<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.950> that's<00:03:41.430> where<00:03:41.670> he<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:42.030> and

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
these people and that's where he is and

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.630 
these people and that's where he is and
so<00:03:44.700> they<00:03:44.880> have<00:03:45.090> these<00:03:45.300> people<00:03:45.690> stopped<00:03:45.960> lost

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
so they have these people stopped lost

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.590 
so they have these people stopped lost
and<00:03:48.680> most<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.800> them<00:03:49.980> will<00:03:50.100> go<00:03:50.220> back<00:03:50.460> and<00:03:50.790> go<00:03:51.120> go

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
and most of them will go back and go go

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.890 
and most of them will go back and go go
back<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.960> Iraq<00:03:52.260> or<00:03:52.470> go<00:03:52.710> to<00:03:52.770> Afghanistan<00:03:53.460> but<00:03:53.640> a
