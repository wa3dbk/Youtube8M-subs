it<00:03:09.439> was<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:09.650> far<00:03:09.859> down<00:03:09.889> on<00:03:10.249> power<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.989> know<00:03:12.109> it

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
it was so far down on power you know it

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.440 
it was so far down on power you know it
we<00:03:12.950> stopped<00:03:13.219> and<00:03:13.340> put<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:13.549> new<00:03:13.609> TPS<00:03:14.180> in<00:03:14.329> it

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
we stopped and put a new TPS in it

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.179 
we stopped and put a new TPS in it
actually<00:03:14.719> in<00:03:14.810> between<00:03:15.079> stages<00:03:15.379> and<00:03:15.859> got<00:03:16.099> the

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
actually in between stages and got the

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.520 
actually in between stages and got the
laptop<00:03:16.310> out<00:03:16.669> and<00:03:16.849> retuned<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.419> and<00:03:17.540> that

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
laptop out and retuned it and that

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.409 
laptop out and retuned it and that
didn't<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:19.129> didn't<00:03:19.909> end<00:03:19.969> up<00:03:20.150> being<00:03:20.359> the

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
didn't that didn't end up being the

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.179 
didn't that didn't end up being the
issue<00:03:20.569> it<00:03:20.780> was<00:03:20.870> actually<00:03:21.260> water<00:03:21.469> down<00:03:21.709> down

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
issue it was actually water down down

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.449 
issue it was actually water down down
the<00:03:22.340> spark<00:03:22.579> plug<00:03:22.790> sir<00:03:23.030> yeah<00:03:23.870> just<00:03:24.500> is<00:03:25.250> that

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
the spark plug sir yeah just is that

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.949 
the spark plug sir yeah just is that
part<00:03:25.699> likely<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.209> rock<00:03:26.329> up<00:03:26.449> tonight<00:03:26.750> are<00:03:26.930> you

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
part likely to rock up tonight are you

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.240 
part likely to rock up tonight are you
going<00:03:27.139> to<00:03:27.260> do<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:27.469> same<00:03:27.650> for<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:27.919> purse<00:03:28.099> of

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.689 
yours tomorrow we've got a couple of
more<00:03:30.290> spares<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:30.829> will<00:03:30.980> persevere<00:03:31.280> with<00:03:31.519> that

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:31.699 
more spares so will persevere with that

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.939 
more spares so will persevere with that
and<00:03:31.939> we'll<00:03:32.419> glue<00:03:33.199> the<00:03:33.349> plug<00:03:33.530> leads<00:03:33.739> in

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
and we'll glue the plug leads in

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.530 
and we'll glue the plug leads in
hopefully<00:03:34.189> seal<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:34.639> up<00:03:34.730> nice<00:03:34.939> and<00:03:34.969> tight<00:03:35.239> and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
hopefully seal it up nice and tight and

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.599 
hopefully seal it up nice and tight and
make<00:03:36.409> it<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.560> bit<00:03:36.680> more<00:03:36.709> like<00:03:36.949> a<00:03:36.980> submarine<00:03:37.250> for

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.930 
can just get the thing you know the
engines<00:04:17.659> still<00:04:17.780> got<00:04:17.930> a<00:04:17.959> bit<00:04:18.049> of<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.229> Miss<00:04:18.940> we're

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
engines still got a bit of a Miss we're

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.759 
engines still got a bit of a Miss we're
pretty<00:04:20.509> close<00:04:20.750> with<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:21.079> suspension<00:04:21.500> setup

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
pretty close with the suspension setup

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.290 
pretty close with the suspension setup
now<00:04:21.889> I<00:04:21.919> think<00:04:22.039> and<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.430> you<00:04:22.699> know<00:04:22.789> I<00:04:22.820> just<00:04:22.909> I

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
now I think and I you know I just I

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.629 
now I think and I you know I just I
think<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.590> rest<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:24.919> us<00:04:24.979> just<00:04:25.039> mean<00:04:25.370> learning

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
think the rest of us just mean learning

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.700 
think the rest of us just mean learning
how<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:25.880> drive<00:04:25.969> it<00:04:26.270> so<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:27.380> know<00:04:27.440> if<00:04:27.530> we<00:04:27.590> could

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
how to drive it so you know if we could

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.800 
how to drive it so you know if we could
have<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.830> couple<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.130> clean<00:04:28.340> stages<00:04:28.849> no<00:04:29.570> you

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
have a couple of clean stages no you

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.300 
have a couple of clean stages no you
know<00:04:29.840> really<00:04:30.169> start<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.650> get<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.889> know<00:04:31.009> the<00:04:31.130> car

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
know really start to get to know the car

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.560 
know really start to get to know the car
a<00:04:31.340> bit<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:31.729> know<00:04:31.789> the<00:04:31.969> potential<00:04:32.270> is<00:04:32.479> endless

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
a bit you know the potential is endless

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.020 
a bit you know the potential is endless
for<00:04:32.930> this<00:04:33.020> thing<00:04:33.229> Mick<00:04:34.009> patent<00:04:34.430> didn't<00:04:34.729> quite

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
for this thing Mick patent didn't quite
