years<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.109> things<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.410> runners<00:00:22.769> are

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
years one of the things that runners are

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.019 
years one of the things that runners are
going<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> notice<00:00:23.220> when<00:00:23.400> they<00:00:23.490> first<00:00:23.730> pick<00:00:23.910> up

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
going to notice when they first pick up

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.790 
going to notice when they first pick up
the<00:00:24.180> shoe<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.570> we've<00:00:24.990> dropped<00:00:25.199> over<00:00:25.529> an<00:00:25.619> ounce

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the shoe is we've dropped over an ounce

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920 
the shoe is we've dropped over an ounce
and<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> half<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.460> weight<00:00:26.820> off<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.390> shoe<00:00:27.630> so

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
and a half of weight off of the shoe so

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.009 
and a half of weight off of the shoe so
it's<00:00:28.109> extremely<00:00:28.410> light<00:00:29.359> but<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.750> great<00:00:30.990> thing

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
it's extremely light but the great thing

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.630 
it's extremely light but the great thing
is<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.529> provides<00:00:31.800> all<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.160> great<00:00:32.369> stability

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
is it provides all that great stability

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400 
is it provides all that great stability
so<00:00:33.360> if<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.570> start<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.960> midsole<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
so if we start with the midsole and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.110 
so if we start with the midsole and
outsole<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.760> things<00:00:35.880> you'll

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
outsole here one of the things you'll

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.000 
outsole here one of the things you'll
notice<00:00:36.270> here<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.440> filled<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.860> this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
notice here is that we filled in this

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.040 
notice here is that we filled in this
medial<00:00:38.489> side<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.450> gives<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.750> great

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
medial side so it gives you great

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.700 
medial side so it gives you great
support<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:41.460> great<00:00:42.300> stability<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:43.500> you're

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
support in great stability as you're

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.950 
support in great stability as you're
starting<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.070> over<00:00:44.309> pronate<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.480> also<00:00:45.690> you'll

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
starting to over pronate but also you'll

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.389 
starting to over pronate but also you'll
notice<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.379> took<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> shank<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
notice that we took the shank out of the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.670 
notice that we took the shank out of the
mid-foot<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.120> basically<00:00:48.660> what<00:00:49.230> we've<00:00:49.350> done<00:00:49.500> is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
mid-foot so basically what we've done is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.709 
mid-foot so basically what we've done is
we've<00:00:49.829> taken<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.219> shank<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.210> provided

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
we've taken the shank out but provided

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
we've taken the shank out but provided
the<00:00:51.840> support<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> stability<00:00:52.680> from

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the support and the stability from

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.860 
the support and the stability from
really<00:00:53.430> engineering<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.300> midsole<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> be

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
really engineering this midsole to be

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.139 
really engineering this midsole to be
more<00:00:55.050> filled<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.489> mid-foot<00:00:56.820> area

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
more filled in in the the mid-foot area

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.360 
more filled in in the the mid-foot area
the<00:00:57.840> great<00:00:58.079> weight<00:00:58.320> savings<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:59.160> comes

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the great weight savings actually comes

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.580 
the great weight savings actually comes
from<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.670> compound<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.329> forefoot<00:01:01.050> which

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
from this compound on the forefoot which

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.500 
from this compound on the forefoot which
is<00:01:01.739> called<00:01:01.920> ibr<00:01:02.489> plus<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.390> an

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
is called ibr plus and this is an

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.479 
is called ibr plus and this is an
injection<00:01:04.080> blown<00:01:04.350> rubber<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.280> done

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
injection blown rubber so it's done

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.800 
injection blown rubber so it's done
different<00:01:05.820> than<00:01:05.939> traditional<00:01:06.060> blown<00:01:06.600> rubber

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
different than traditional blown rubber

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630 
different than traditional blown rubber
it's<00:01:07.080> actually<00:01:07.439> injected<00:01:08.040> into<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> mold

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
it's actually injected into a mold

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.450 
it's actually injected into a mold
instead<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.210> stamped<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.189> just<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.310> big

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
instead of stamped out of a just a big

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.340 
instead of stamped out of a just a big
sheet<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.729> rubber<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.600> advantages<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
sheet of rubber the advantages of that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.780 
sheet of rubber the advantages of that
is<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.860> allows<00:01:14.100> us<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> really

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
is it allows us to be a really

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.060 
is it allows us to be a really
consistent<00:01:15.210> compound<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
consistent compound so that it's the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.310 
consistent compound so that it's the
same<00:01:17.310> durometer<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.780> mid<00:01:18.960> foot<00:01:19.140> area

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
same durometer here in the mid foot area

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
same durometer here in the mid foot area
as<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.860> get<00:01:20.009> into<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.369> toe<00:01:20.520> off<00:01:20.729> area<00:01:21.119> so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
as you get into the toe off area so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.940 
as you get into the toe off area so
you're<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.960> real<00:01:22.170> smooth<00:01:22.619> ride

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
you're going to get a real smooth ride

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.580 
you're going to get a real smooth ride
from<00:01:23.250> heel<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> forefoot<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:25.200> other<00:01:25.380> thing

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
from heel the forefoot the other thing

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.749 
from heel the forefoot the other thing
that<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.369> high<00:01:26.549> abrasion

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
that we have is we have a high abrasion

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.700 
that we have is we have a high abrasion
rubber<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> heel<00:01:27.780> gives<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.530> great

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
rubber in the heel gives a great

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.880 
rubber in the heel gives a great
traction<00:01:29.040> great<00:01:29.549> durability<00:01:30.530> we<00:01:31.530> move<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.860> the

traction great durability we move to the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
traction great durability we move to the
mid-foot<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.790> our<00:01:32.820> SRC<00:01:33.479> crash<00:01:33.780> pad

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
mid-foot here we have our SRC crash pad

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.230 
mid-foot here we have our SRC crash pad
and<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> super<00:01:35.009> rebound<00:01:35.430> compound<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and this is a super rebound compound and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.300 
and this is a super rebound compound and
what<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.170> does<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.590> provides<00:01:37.890> great

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
what that does is it provides great

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.190 
what that does is it provides great
shock<00:01:38.640> absorption<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.720> heel<00:01:39.930> comes

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
shock absorption so when your heel comes

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.630 
shock absorption so when your heel comes
down<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.650> strikes<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> absorb

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
down and strikes it's going to absorb

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730 
down and strikes it's going to absorb
that<00:01:42.030> shock<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.570> your<00:01:42.750> body<00:01:42.869> doesn't<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.500> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that shock so your body doesn't have to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.580 
that shock so your body doesn't have to
and<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.149> our<00:01:45.329> progra<00:01:45.930> technology

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and then we have our progra technology

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.410 
and then we have our progra technology
in<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> mid-foot<00:01:47.130> here<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.210> does

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
in the mid-foot here so what that does

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
in the mid-foot here so what that does
is<00:01:48.450> provides<00:01:48.960> great<00:01:49.200> cushioning<00:01:49.680> from<00:01:50.340> heel

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
is provides great cushioning from heel

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.300 
is provides great cushioning from heel
to<00:01:50.549> four-foot<00:01:51.740> you'll<00:01:52.740> notice<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.189> we've

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
to four-foot you'll notice that we've

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.060 
to four-foot you'll notice that we've
posted<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> medial<00:01:54.540> side<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:55.619> again<00:01:55.950> it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
posted it on the medial side so again it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.280 
posted it on the medial side so again it
gives<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> great<00:01:56.969> stability<00:01:57.360> slows<00:01:58.049> down

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
gives you a great stability slows down

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.719 
gives you a great stability slows down
your<00:01:58.350> rate<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> pronation<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.369> start<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
your rate of pronation as you start to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.999 
your rate of pronation as you start to
over<00:02:00.000> pronate<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.540> then<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> upper<00:02:01.829> what

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
over pronate and then in the upper what

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.410 
over pronate and then in the upper what
we<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.280> wanted<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.909> use<00:02:03.060> real

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
we just wanted to do is use real

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.389 
we just wanted to do is use real
lightweight<00:02:03.750> breathable<00:02:04.170> meshes<00:02:04.770> that

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
lightweight breathable meshes that

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.399 
lightweight breathable meshes that
really<00:02:05.700> gives<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.600> shoe<00:02:06.810> some<00:02:07.049> real<00:02:07.229> nice

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
really gives the the shoe some real nice

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.979 
really gives the the shoe some real nice
flexibility<00:02:08.160> real<00:02:08.670> nice<00:02:08.849> comfort<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:09.840> then

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
flexibility real nice comfort but then

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.570 
flexibility real nice comfort but then
we<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.379> some<00:02:10.560> overlays<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.099> gives<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.340> great

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
we have some overlays it gives a great

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.610 
we have some overlays it gives a great
support<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.090> structure

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
support and structure

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.220 
support and structure
in<00:02:12.709> throughout<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.580> upper<00:02:13.849> and<00:02:14.599> on<00:02:15.110> the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
in throughout the upper and on the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.780 
in throughout the upper and on the
medial<00:02:15.500> side<00:02:15.530> we<00:02:15.890> have<00:02:16.010> our<00:02:16.129> technology<00:02:16.610> which

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
medial side we have our technology which

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.180 
medial side we have our technology which
is<00:02:16.940> arch<00:02:17.120> lock<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.720> what<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.019> is<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.470> just<00:02:19.040> a

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
is arch lock and what that is is just a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.130 
is arch lock and what that is is just a
configuration<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.150> really<00:02:20.659> locks<00:02:20.900> that

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
configuration that really locks that

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.899 
configuration that really locks that
arch<00:02:21.349> into<00:02:21.680> place<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.190> gives<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:22.700> great

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
arch into place and gives you great

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.970 
arch into place and gives you great
support<00:02:23.330> in<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.450> mid-foot<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.560> what<00:02:24.709> type<00:02:24.950> of

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
support in the mid-foot and what type of

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.610 
support in the mid-foot and what type of
runner<00:02:25.310> would<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:25.879> shoe<00:02:26.450> appeal<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:27.019> so<00:02:27.440> this

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
runner would this shoe appeal to so this

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.930 
runner would this shoe appeal to so this
is<00:02:27.769> going<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:27.950> be<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.069> run<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.730> has

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
is going to be the run of it that has

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.390 
is going to be the run of it that has
some<00:02:29.209> over<00:02:29.870> pronation<00:02:30.110> they<00:02:30.620> maybe<00:02:30.829> had<00:02:31.159> some

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
some over pronation they maybe had some

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.369 
some over pronation they maybe had some
knee<00:02:31.579> injuries<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.209> past<00:02:32.299> where<00:02:32.900> they've

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
knee injuries in the past where they've

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.410 
knee injuries in the past where they've
had<00:02:33.590> some<00:02:33.739> overuse<00:02:34.190> injuries<00:02:34.670> this<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.269> going

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
had some overuse injuries this is going

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.240 
had some overuse injuries this is going
to<00:02:35.480> really<00:02:35.690> kind<00:02:35.959> of<00:02:36.049> slow<00:02:36.620> down<00:02:36.799> that<00:02:36.950> rate<00:02:37.129> of

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
to really kind of slow down that rate of

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.680 
to really kind of slow down that rate of
pronation<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:37.790> really<00:02:38.030> work<00:02:38.209> on<00:02:38.360> their<00:02:38.510> gate

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
pronation and really work on their gate

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.259 
pronation and really work on their gate
all<00:02:39.680> right<00:02:39.890> great<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.519> when<00:02:40.909> is<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.150> available
