hey<00:00:05.549> what's<00:00:05.730> up<00:00:05.910> YouTube<00:00:06.150> psycho<00:00:06.720> man<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.049> fall

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
hey what's up YouTube psycho man a fall

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.509 
hey what's up YouTube psycho man a fall
and<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:07.830> figured<00:00:08.160> we'd<00:00:08.280> do<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.429> little

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
and I figured we'd do a little

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.250 
and I figured we'd do a little
comparison<00:00:09.150> video<00:00:09.630> looking<00:00:10.019> at<00:00:10.110> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
comparison video looking at the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.100 
comparison video looking at the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
kind of kind of looking a little

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.429 
kind of kind of looking a little
difference<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.980> how<00:00:28.980> some<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> them<00:00:29.580> worn<00:00:29.970> out

from<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> set<00:00:34.050> they<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.829> did<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
from the set they kind of did like a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.350 
from the set they kind of did like a
fake<00:00:36.780> wear<00:00:37.530> out<00:00:37.739> or<00:00:37.770> making<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.879> look<00:00:39.059> kind<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
fake wear out or making it look kind of

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.049 
fake wear out or making it look kind of
vintage<00:00:39.780> by<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> way<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:40.610> kind<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.760> scratch

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
vintage by the way they kind of scratch

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.049 
vintage by the way they kind of scratch
the<00:00:42.360> gold<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.110> ward<00:00:43.440> off<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.820> from

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the gold and ward off but I have from

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.970 
the gold and ward off but I have from
the<00:00:45.210> two<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.750> was<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.590> who<00:00:46.710> kind<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the two here that was one who kind of

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.520 
the two here that was one who kind of
compare<00:00:47.600> really<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.989> probably<00:00:49.320> how<00:00:49.500> most

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
compare really this is probably how most

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.639 
compare really this is probably how most
of<00:00:50.100> them<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.969> vintage<00:00:51.390> space<00:00:51.750> turn<00:00:52.469> out

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
of them the vintage space turn out

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.950 
of them the vintage space turn out
looking<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.610> gold<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.690> kind<00:00:54.899> of

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
looking like all that gold just kind of

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.020 
looking like all that gold just kind of
wears<00:00:55.199> off<00:00:55.469> over<00:00:55.860> time<00:00:56.070> I've<00:00:56.489> actually<00:00:56.640> got

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
wears off over time I've actually got

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.240 
wears off over time I've actually got
another<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.410> where<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.739> completely

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
another one here where it's completely

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.610 
another one here where it's completely
gone<00:00:59.280> look<00:00:59.910> at<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.260> that's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
gone look at that one so that's

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.729 
gone look at that one so that's
typically<00:01:02.489> how<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.270> would<00:01:03.480> wear<00:01:03.719> off<00:01:03.930> when

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
typically how they would wear off when

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.899 
typically how they would wear off when
you<00:01:04.920> look<00:01:05.549> at<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> old<00:01:05.939> space<00:01:06.330> sets<00:01:07.760> but<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.850> do

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
you look at the old space sets but I do

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.149 
you look at the old space sets but I do
have<00:01:09.150> an<00:01:09.270> example<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.930> one<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.439> really

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
have an example here of one that really

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.670 
have an example here of one that really
had<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> hard<00:01:11.970> time<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.500> one

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
had a hard time and you see this one

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.910 
had a hard time and you see this one
here<00:01:13.830> look<00:01:14.159> at<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.880> heads<00:01:15.150> chewed<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.920> but

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
here look at the the heads chewed on but

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.760 
here look at the the heads chewed on but
the<00:01:17.070> torso<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:18.000> pretty<00:01:18.570> much<00:01:18.750> completely<00:01:19.350> gone

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the torso is pretty much completely gone

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.910 
the torso is pretty much completely gone
I<00:01:20.159> mean<00:01:21.119> that's<00:01:21.330> more<00:01:21.780> closer<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.770> what

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
I mean that's more closer to what

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.390 
I mean that's more closer to what
they're<00:01:23.130> doing<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> new<00:01:23.880> one<00:01:24.259> but

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
they're doing with the new one but

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.370 
they're doing with the new one but
that's<00:01:26.400> probably<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.360> typical<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.170> what

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that's probably not typical of what

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.620 
that's probably not typical of what
you'd<00:01:28.590> find<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.400> did<00:01:29.939> wear<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.210> bunch<00:01:30.479> of

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you'd find but I did wear a bunch of

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.920 
you'd find but I did wear a bunch of
vintage<00:01:30.869> sets<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> got<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
vintage sets and I got one like that and

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.870 
vintage sets and I got one like that and
then<00:01:33.930> another<00:01:34.110> thing<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.530> was<00:01:34.650> wanting<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> look

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
then another thing I was wanting to look

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.060 
then another thing I was wanting to look
at<00:01:36.060> was<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.420> helmet<00:01:36.720> now<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:37.740> looking<00:01:37.979> at

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
at was this helmet now I'm looking at

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.190 
at was this helmet now I'm looking at
Benny's<00:01:38.430> helmet<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.900> how<00:01:40.020> they

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
Benny's helmet here you see how they

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.319 
Benny's helmet here you see how they
made<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.439> look<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.040> snapped<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:42.060> but

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
made it look like it snapped there but

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.560 
made it look like it snapped there but
it's<00:01:42.479> actually<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:43.909> molded<00:01:44.909> together<00:01:45.149> like

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it's actually just molded together like

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.719 
it's actually just molded together like
that<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.799> interesting<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.369> this

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that but it's interesting because this

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.620 
that but it's interesting because this
side<00:01:47.970> over<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.450> kind<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.590> bigger<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
side over here is kind of bigger and I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.569 
side over here is kind of bigger and I
actually<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> Benny's<00:01:52.799> helmet<00:01:53.399> right

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
actually have a Benny's helmet right

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.090 
actually have a Benny's helmet right
here<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.240> actually<00:01:54.869> broke<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.740> way<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
here that is actually broke the way that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.580 
here that is actually broke the way that
they<00:01:56.250> kind<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.030> break<00:01:57.299> from<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:57.990> being<00:01:58.170> used

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
they kind of break from just being used

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.190 
they kind of break from just being used
and<00:01:58.860> taken<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.969> off<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.140> see

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and taken on and off and as you can see

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.590 
and taken on and off and as you can see
on<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.649> side<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.100> kind<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.610> made<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.390> lip

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
on this side it kind of made the lip

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.389 
on this side it kind of made the lip
stick<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> little<00:02:04.530> bit<00:02:04.710> more<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.040> one

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
stick out a little bit more on that one

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.150 
stick out a little bit more on that one
side<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.570> kind<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.840> got<00:02:07.160> pushed

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
side because this kind of got pushed

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400 
side because this kind of got pushed
back<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:09.030> then<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.450> finally<00:02:09.690> broke<00:02:10.200> right

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
back and then it finally broke right

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.500 
back and then it finally broke right
there<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.860> middle<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:12.120> think<00:02:12.330> that's

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
there in the middle and I think that's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.730 
there in the middle and I think that's
more<00:02:12.780> typical<00:02:12.959> or<00:02:13.410> they

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
more typical or they

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.700 
more typical or they
this<00:02:13.920> break<00:02:14.220> completely<00:02:14.760> off<00:02:15.410> from<00:02:16.410> what<00:02:16.590> I've

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
this break completely off from what I've

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.500 
this break completely off from what I've
heard<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:17.160> actually<00:02:17.370> didn't<00:02:17.880> ever<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.330> any

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
heard I actually didn't ever have any

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.470 
heard I actually didn't ever have any
old<00:02:18.660> vintage<00:02:19.250> sets<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.820> I've<00:02:21.090> heard<00:02:21.300> they

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
old vintage sets but I've heard they

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.050 
old vintage sets but I've heard they
just<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.890> know<00:02:22.950> typically<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.670> helmet

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
just you know typically that helmet

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.930 
just you know typically that helmet
strap<00:02:24.360> would<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.750> snap<00:02:24.960> completely<00:02:25.590> off<00:02:25.940> but

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
strap would just snap completely off but

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.550 
strap would just snap completely off but
that's<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.450> little<00:02:27.660> comparison<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.380> some

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
that's just a little comparison of some

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.860 
that's just a little comparison of some
of<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.830> different<00:02:29.730> details<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.360> them<00:02:30.480> kind<00:02:30.810> of

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
of the different details of them kind of

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.110 
of the different details of them kind of
looking<00:02:31.080> at<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.260> back<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.430> see<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.820> blue

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
looking at the back you do see the blue

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.230 
looking at the back you do see the blue
is<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.660> little<00:02:33.990> darker<00:02:34.770> blue<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.000> new

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
is this a little darker blue on the new

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.930 
is this a little darker blue on the new
Binney<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.470> helmets<00:02:37.910> obviously<00:02:38.910> a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
Binney and the helmets obviously a

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.400 
Binney and the helmets obviously a
little<00:02:39.270> thicker<00:02:39.540> too<00:02:39.900> than<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> other

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
little thicker too than the other

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.480 
little thicker too than the other
helmets<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.760> vintage<00:02:42.210> ones<00:02:42.450> come<00:02:42.690> with

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
helmets that the vintage ones come with

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.370 
helmets that the vintage ones come with
it<00:02:44.490> does<00:02:44.700> have<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.090> dimple<00:02:45.540> on<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.780> side<00:02:46.020> just

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
it does have the dimple on the side just

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.550 
it does have the dimple on the side just
like<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.770> other<00:02:46.890> vintage<00:02:47.640> Benny's<00:02:51.560> but

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
like the other vintage Benny's but

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.530 
like the other vintage Benny's but
little<00:02:53.220> darker<00:02:53.610> blue<00:02:54.170> but<00:02:55.170> overall<00:02:55.590> now<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
little darker blue but overall now the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.240 
little darker blue but overall now the
new<00:02:57.540> Benny<00:02:57.780> does<00:02:58.050> have<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> double-sided<00:02:58.830> face

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
new Benny does have a double-sided face

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.220 
new Benny does have a double-sided face
so<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.300> does<00:03:00.540> kind<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.900> go<00:03:01.260> along<00:03:01.350> more<00:03:01.770> with

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
so it does kind of go along more with

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.650 
so it does kind of go along more with
the<00:03:04.230> vintage<00:03:04.650> look<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.120> could<00:03:06.360> kind<00:03:06.600> of

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
the vintage look so you could kind of

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.060 
the vintage look so you could kind of
turn<00:03:06.840> around<00:03:06.870> have<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.440> haven't<00:03:07.680> felt<00:03:08.010> like

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
turn around have it haven't felt like

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.480 
turn around have it haven't felt like
the<00:03:08.340> vintage<00:03:08.550> look<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.950> but<00:03:10.950> overall<00:03:11.220> I'm

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
the vintage look to but overall I'm

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.400
