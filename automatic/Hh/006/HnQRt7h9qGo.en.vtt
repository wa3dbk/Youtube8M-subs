early<00:03:57.519> 20s<00:03:57.849> early<00:03:58.980> 20s<00:04:01.829> and<00:04:02.829> in<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.099> eye

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
early 20s early 20s and in the eye

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.380 
early 20s early 20s and in the eye
condition<00:04:03.610> went<00:04:03.730> away<00:04:03.790> which<00:04:04.000> was<00:04:04.090> exciting

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
condition went away which was exciting

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.030 
condition went away which was exciting
and<00:04:04.720> then<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:05.200> bump<00:04:05.470> formed<00:04:05.860> on<00:04:06.010> my<00:04:06.159> foot<00:04:06.390> and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
and then a bump formed on my foot and

and then a bump formed on my foot and
also<00:04:09.040> with<00:04:09.400> ptosis<00:04:09.879> in<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.120> title<00:04:10.420> you<00:04:10.569> don't

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
also with ptosis in the title you don't

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.380 
also with ptosis in the title you don't
sing<00:04:12.040> my<00:04:12.160> songs<00:04:12.370> for<00:04:12.609> me<00:04:12.700> doing<00:04:13.000> my<00:04:13.209> whole

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
sing my songs for me doing my whole

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:23.280 
sing my songs for me doing my whole
story

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.900 

I<00:04:23.320> have<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:23.800> farm<00:04:24.100> and<00:04:24.340> I<00:04:24.460> didn't<00:04:24.820> really

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
I have this farm and I didn't really

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.280 
I have this farm and I didn't really
tell<00:04:25.120> anyone<00:04:25.480> and<00:04:25.660> then<00:04:25.810> when<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.020> finally

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
tell anyone and then when I finally

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.260 
tell anyone and then when I finally
started<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.250> tell<00:04:27.490> people<00:04:27.700> we<00:04:27.940> went<00:04:28.030> on<00:04:28.150> the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
started to tell people we went on the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.390 
started to tell people we went on the
internet<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.750> it's<00:04:29.050> called<00:04:29.260> XO<00:04:29.680> ptosis

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
internet and it's called XO ptosis

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.140 
internet and it's called XO ptosis
so<00:04:30.970> it's<00:04:31.120> ptosis<00:04:31.510> by<00:04:31.750> up<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.110> foot<00:04:32.350> basically

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
so it's ptosis by up the foot basically

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.000 
so it's ptosis by up the foot basically
so<00:04:34.150> I'm<00:04:34.960> not<00:04:35.110> really<00:04:35.290> concerned<00:04:35.680> though<00:04:35.890> it

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
so I'm not really concerned though it

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.620 
so I'm not really concerned though it
let<00:04:36.220> someone<00:04:36.400> examine<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.270> other<00:04:37.450> night

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
let someone examine it the other night

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.900 
let someone examine it the other night
she<00:04:37.870> told<00:04:38.800> me<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.280> then<00:04:39.520> I<00:04:39.610> thought<00:04:39.820> I<00:04:39.880> don't

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
she told me and then I thought I don't

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.550 
she told me and then I thought I don't
have<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.360> worry<00:04:40.510> about<00:04:40.570> it<00:04:40.930> not<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.320> go<00:04:41.410> to<00:04:41.470> the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
have to worry about it not to go to the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.840 
have to worry about it not to go to the
doctor<00:04:41.830> but<00:04:41.950> then<00:04:42.130> actually<00:04:42.280> was<00:04:42.580> like<00:04:42.700> yeah<00:04:42.820> I
