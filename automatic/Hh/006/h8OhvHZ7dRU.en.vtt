00:00:00.927 --> 00:00:02.973
 An interesting question from my viewer. 

00:00:02.973 --> 00:00:05.915
 How much is a medical certificate valid for a driving license? 

00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:08.795
 A month, half a year, maybe a year? 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.061
 Or maybe 5 years, maybe 10? 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.679
 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki, I am a doctor of transport medicine from Wroclaw. 

00:00:16.404 --> 00:00:19.250
 And I will start traditionally from the query of my viewer. 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.458
 "Hello, I will be able to register for a driving license in two months, I would like to do medical examinations, 

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:28.794
 I just do not know if they will be valid for 2 months. 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.222
 When I will submit papers on the profile of the driver's candidate. 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.138
 And what is the period of validity of this decision? 

00:00:35.776 --> 00:00:40.955
 If I do such tests a month or two earlier, will not they send me back to repeat them? 

00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:44.476
 Thank you in advance for your answer.". 

00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:48.219
 Answering this question. 

00:00:48.746 --> 00:00:55.316
 Neither in the Act on Drivers of Vehicles, or in some other legal acts of a lower order, or my industry regulations 

00:00:55.316 --> 00:01:03.293
 Minister of Health, I have not found anywhere a certain maximum period in which you must make this medical statement 

00:01:03.293 --> 00:01:14.300
 deliver to the communication department, at the moment in order to create a PPK, i.e. a profile of a candidate for a driver. 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.044
 So, in theory, if you do research today, then how do you take this medical certificate for three years 

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:27.233
 or for 5, they should take it. 

00:01:27.673 --> 00:01:28.710
 I speak theoretically. 

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:32.450
 But how does it look in practice in the communication departments? 

00:01:33.997 --> 00:01:36.893
 Honestly, I do not know too much, 

00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:47.040
 The practical problem that I came across in my medical practice is, of course, simply 

00:01:47.382 --> 00:01:50.930
 Templates of judgments change from time to time. 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.580
 So the legal basis of the decision has changed, there are two commas, two letters, on the ruling 

00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:08.360
 and this slight change of just a few sentences on the medical certificate may cause them to be challenged by the office 

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:17.057
 and sending it back to the doctor's patch, especially how it was exposed as there was a long period of time 

00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:22.570
 and the clerk saw that the ground had changed. 

00:02:23.527 --> 00:02:28.100
 As in life, unfortunately, a doctor is absent at any given moment. 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.720
 And it happened to me to study again in the framework of such, let's call it patches, especially during the holiday season, 

00:02:34.724 --> 00:02:38.840
 Sometimes it happened that the doctor moved out, he died, there the devil knows what is happening to him. 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.860
 And the student suddenly, means not yet a student, just wanting to form a profile for a driver 

00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:52.340
 like a cat with a bladder, and looks for a doctor to get him examined again. 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:02.010
 Also, I do not advise you to be over-zealous here, but as part of how to say it - common sense 

00:03:02.012 --> 00:03:07.888
 wisdom - just do the research at least 3 months before the start of this course, so that you can have it 

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:09.226
 eats fresh. 

00:03:09.226 --> 00:03:17.020
 Of course, how do you do it there 3 months and 1 week before, should not it be a little earlier? 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.220
 more important. 

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:26.980
 However, if the official cancels your decision, then just ask him for a legal basis and ask him best 

00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:27.820
 in writing. 

00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:35.860
 As you have in writing, you have a basis again, you can appeal against this decision. 

00:03:37.364 --> 00:03:46.170
 At the same time, something can appear in legal acts at any time, which I can not have a clue about, even if you know such a legal act, 

00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:54.720
 which, however, indicates the maximum period of the medical certificate to the driving license course, to develop the profile of the candidate 

00:03:55.792 --> 00:04:00.970
 for the driver, just write it in the comments below for this video. 

00:04:01.787 --> 00:04:08.580
 I say, I am not an omnibus, but according to my knowledge there is no such time limit, although I say - there are various other 

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:10.260
 restrictions. 

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:16.340
 I am also finishing this, said Darek Kraśnicki from Wrocław, a specialist in transport medicine. 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.480
 However, if this video you like, give me like, give me a thumb. 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.440
 How did you solve any problem, share it on your social network, facebook, our-class, 

00:04:27.107 --> 00:04:33.380
 if you know the html code, you have access to your website - paste this video onto your website. 

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:39.627
 But traditionally, the most discussions are, of course, on my channel, on my website 

00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:41.490
 www.Badania-Na-Prawo-Jazdy-Wroclaw.com 

00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:46.770
 and there, of course, step in after subscribing to my YouTube channel DoctorMedicinePracy. 

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:53.336
 The subscription links are here somewhere to my right, and to your left. 

00:04:53.336 --> 00:04:56.310
 There is a link somewhere at the top, there is a link somewhere at the bottom. 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.250
 Also Dariusz Kraśnicki once again said. 

00:04:58.974 --> 00:05:01.380
 And see you in my next video.
