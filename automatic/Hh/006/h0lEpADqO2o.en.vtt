00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
over and over as you've got to create a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.380 
over and over as you've got to create a
quarterback<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.280> you've<00:01:05.729> got<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> take<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> bad

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
quarterback and you've got to take a bad

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.640 
quarterback and you've got to take a bad
play<00:01:06.600> make<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> good<00:01:07.110> one<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
play make it a good one because the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.800 
play make it a good one because the
things<00:01:07.830> are<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> break<00:01:08.250> down<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.700> us

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
things are going to break down for us

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.109 
things are going to break down for us
that's<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> way<00:01:10.260> football<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.549> it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
that's just the way football is so it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.399 
that's just the way football is so it
makes<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.420> even<00:01:12.570> more<00:01:12.689> interesting<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.380> guess

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
makes it even more interesting I guess

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.289 
makes it even more interesting I guess
you'd<00:01:13.740> say<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.280> he<00:01:14.340> throws<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.580> nice<00:01:14.820> ball<00:01:15.060> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you'd say but he throws a nice ball and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.830 
you'd say but he throws a nice ball and
guys<00:01:15.420> would<00:01:15.600> haven't<00:01:15.869> caught<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> ball<00:01:16.400> so

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
guys would haven't caught the ball so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.330 
guys would haven't caught the ball so
you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.200> exciting<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.100> also

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you know it's exciting to see I also

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.890 
you know it's exciting to see I also
thought<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.090> Jeremy<00:01:21.420> Langford<00:01:21.600> had<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
thought you know Jeremy Langford had a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.170 
thought you know Jeremy Langford had a
good<00:01:22.049> scrimmage<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.950> thought<00:01:23.189> delton

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
good scrimmage and I thought delton

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.630 
good scrimmage and I thought delton
Williams<00:01:24.450> did<00:01:24.780> some<00:01:24.900> good<00:01:25.020> things<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.409> well<00:01:25.640> so

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
Williams did some good things as well so

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.179 
Williams did some good things as well so

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
those guys played the ball down the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.590 
those guys played the ball down the
field<00:01:41.220> lipid<00:01:41.549> comes<00:01:41.729> up<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> big<00:01:42.060> catch<00:01:42.420> i

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
field lipid comes up with a big catch i

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.850 
field lipid comes up with a big catch i
think<00:01:42.630> i'm<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.110> sure<00:01:43.290> who<00:01:43.409> caught<00:01:43.619> all<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
think i'm not sure who caught all the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.590 
think i'm not sure who caught all the
ball<00:01:44.040> somewhat<00:01:44.399> more<00:01:44.520> downfield<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
ball somewhat more downfield but I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.389 
ball somewhat more downfield but I
thought<00:01:46.110> especially<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> second<00:01:47.369> half

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
thought especially in the second half

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.370 
thought especially in the second half
once<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:47.909> started<00:01:48.149> clicking<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.750> bit<00:01:48.899> we

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
once we started clicking a little bit we

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.569 
once we started clicking a little bit we
made<00:01:49.560> place<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:50.250> great<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.520> see

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
made place and that was great to see

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.580 
made place and that was great to see
based<00:01:51.450> upon<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> outcome<00:01:51.840> today<00:01:52.259> does<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
based upon the outcome today does it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.780 
based upon the outcome today does it
make<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> little<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.040> more<00:01:53.189> difficult<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.670> make

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
make a little bit more difficult to make

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.100 
make a little bit more difficult to make
a<00:01:53.820> decision<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.810> final

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
a decision what you do in this final

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.719 
a decision what you do in this final
week<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.320> camp<00:01:55.590> well<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.280> think<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.520> have<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
week of camp well I think we have to

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.429 
week of camp well I think we have to
keep<00:01:56.850> competing<00:01:57.509> there's<00:01:57.810> still<00:01:58.020> positions

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
keep competing there's still positions

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.740 
keep competing there's still positions
that<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:59.610> are<00:01:59.729> up<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.000> grabs<00:02:00.210> whether

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that that are up for grabs whether

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.289 
that that are up for grabs whether
you're<00:02:00.899> number<00:02:01.140> two<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.530> defense<00:02:02.000> or<00:02:03.000> number

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
