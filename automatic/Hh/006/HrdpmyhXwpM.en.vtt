craft<00:00:24.480> with<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.840> didn't<00:00:25.140> do<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> crafting

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
craft with it I didn't do the crafting

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.929 
craft with it I didn't do the crafting
recipes<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.220> these<00:00:26.340> because<00:00:26.640> they<00:00:26.789> are<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
recipes for these because they are the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.150 
recipes for these because they are the
exact<00:00:27.330> same<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.349> would<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.769> any<00:00:29.039> other

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
exact same as you would with any other

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.429 
exact same as you would with any other
things<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.179> find<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.570> or<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.960> smelt<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.349> and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
things you find the or you smelt it and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.049 
things you find the or you smelt it and
then<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.679> make<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.969> were

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
then you make this just like if you were

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.510 
then you make this just like if you were
making<00:00:33.300> an<00:00:33.390> iron<00:00:33.690> set<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.290> or<00:00:35.160> anything<00:00:35.489> like

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
making an iron set or or anything like

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.490 
making an iron set or or anything like
that<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.000> then<00:00:36.300> there's<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> ambrosia<00:00:37.140> bread

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that and then there's the ambrosia bread

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.260 
that and then there's the ambrosia bread
I<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.980> not<00:00:38.160> looked<00:00:38.309> much<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.059> does

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
I have not looked much of what that does

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.299 
I have not looked much of what that does
but<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.050> assuming<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.680> very<00:00:40.890> good<00:00:40.980> bread

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
but I'm assuming it is very good bread

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.639 
but I'm assuming it is very good bread
because<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:41.790> golden<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.500> have

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
because it's golden so then you have

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.250 
because it's golden so then you have
your<00:00:43.680> celestial<00:00:44.579> bronze<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.270> which<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
your celestial bronze or which is the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
your celestial bronze or which is the
same<00:00:46.469> set<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> armor<00:00:47.370> set<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.670> tools<00:00:47.850> crafted

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
same set of armor set of tools crafted

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.389 
same set of armor set of tools crafted
the<00:00:48.450> same<00:00:48.629> way<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.870> smelt<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the same way you smelt it just like you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.850

test<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.560> pickaxes<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.100> they<00:03:58.280> all<00:03:58.400> mine<00:03:58.610> the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
test the pickaxes and they all mine the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.630 
test the pickaxes and they all mine the
same<00:03:59.060> they<00:04:00.020> can<00:04:00.200> bronze<00:04:00.890> can<00:04:01.100> be<00:04:01.220> mined<00:04:01.550> with

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.690 
quick little glitch but the mod i did
not<00:05:26.870> realize<00:05:27.080> before<00:05:27.410> is<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:28.010> armor<00:05:28.430> looks

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
not realize before is the armor looks

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.610 
not realize before is the armor looks
the<00:05:28.910> same<00:05:29.120> whether<00:05:29.450> you<00:05:29.660> have<00:05:29.870> bronze<00:05:30.260> or

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
the same whether you have bronze or

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.680 
the same whether you have bronze or
whether<00:05:31.130> you<00:05:31.280> have<00:05:31.460> Imperial<00:05:31.760> golden<00:05:32.390> is<00:05:32.480> the

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
whether you have Imperial golden is the

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.960 
whether you have Imperial golden is the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
exact same on the outside so that's a

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.220 
exact same on the outside so that's a
small<00:05:35.210> little<00:05:35.330> problem<00:05:35.690> that<00:05:35.870> needs<00:05:36.050> to<00:05:36.169> get
