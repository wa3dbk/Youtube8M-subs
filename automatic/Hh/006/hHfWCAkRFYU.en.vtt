00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.240
 this Tuesday 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.500
 the mission that it's a way for m 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.710
 to go on the field for several days 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.710
 with customers and design flows to the bikini 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.760
 two seconds compose are facing at the same time 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.820
 as the miles go by 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.660
 improvements 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.770
 you have to work 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.900
 the starting point of Gaddafi on Thursday 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.350
 Bernard is doing that for that 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.570
 in fact we wanted a landslide from Thursday night really 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.140
 representative of the user 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 even that can push a little bit the bike no 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.120
 in its entrenchments 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.530
 since % 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.130
 I think it is 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.400
 the region was magical in a landscape of unevenness 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.400
 it's just since different mtb 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.770
 oh yes it's done 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.869
 christophe khider 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.009
 I could not easy it's the lot to apply for the equivalent of one year 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.069
 of data 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.160
 and then we have it in the mountains that means people who go 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.360
 discover on a primary btp sometimes too if he is ready but loaths 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.949
 u system and with a level of quality 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.429
 it's really left the tramelot 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.439
 improve reading 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.099
 the interest of these peace missions is special because it is no longer 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.769
 left 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.119
 a complete range of products corresponds to our way 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:41.689
 sometimes I'm happy class was stronger the blue jersey either at 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.379
 ranking 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.379
 may be able to do it 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.860
 he trusts 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.469
 as to its annual accounts 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.029
 but how many are some of the technical parts 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:03:00.179
 for his feat of really 100% but why so it's true that the 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.249
 his problem it will come out necessarily it is clear that we manage 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.579
 the advantage of having one of our points of disagreement is really this for all 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.289
 the world this law institutes a bear is trustfully acceptable a job in 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.119
 which one can test wolf valley things like that it can be 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.879
 as beneficial to me for the development team for a 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.680
 for as much feedback information things like that this 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.969
 that seems advanced in both directions so had to come from the client for 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.969
 be able to try the delicate defended bikes to unlock them 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.209
 I think this track and by deduction of two goals ruins 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:50.259
 he was already well in abnormal conditions of use 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.799
 and there we have to go further they come by the user 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.389
 the face to face port 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.479
 to confront their products 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.379
 to everyone who wanted to use 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.199
 it was later that I was recruited for 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.229
 through to the public such for some 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.479
 scc basically testers 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.619
 the profile had nothing to chance 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.039
 the bike 6 points 3 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.549
 so we'll say the little sports stadium 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:20.570
 in fact 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.180
 so we got a year 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.180
 oxfam Clement dubecq a cane I imagine have received 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.229
 who actually proposed to register were participating mission text 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.539
 poor traded 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.370
 m since yesterday since march 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.550
 in big progress 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.750
 indeed the removal of these dozens of weapons feels like really 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.840
 much better tastes 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.570
 seventy high level at the end of two general twins that finishes 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.539
 stride all products over 6000 votes 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:47.900
 I see him 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.029
 - almost all day 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:51.889
 on the soccer field 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.889
 she is quite rewarding with victims 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.800
 the idea is to continue 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.589
 a part that setting up 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.589
 outside pursue the ps for a long enough time 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.039
 a to allow them to this place when doing it at the highest since the 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.169
 January 19th in haiti franck 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.469
 developed within the couple 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:14.719
 which allows customers 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:18.150
 regularly a little bit like us a logbook 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.849
 we will fill the order daily 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.669
 bike out the master by comment and we actually can follow 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:25.110
 for the 8th edition
