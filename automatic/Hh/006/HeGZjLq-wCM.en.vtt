of<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.190> road<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.610> think<00:02:53.090> Jonathan<00:02:53.330> first<00:02:53.750> had<00:02:54.020> a

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
of the road I think Jonathan first had a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.290 
of the road I think Jonathan first had a
good<00:02:54.230> quick<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.650> little<00:02:55.010> bit<00:02:55.250> different<00:02:55.670> coming

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
good quick a little bit different coming

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.800 
good quick a little bit different coming
running<00:02:56.960> in<00:02:57.170> swinging<00:02:57.590> yeah<00:02:57.980> sure<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.310> think

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
running in swinging yeah sure I think

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.090 
running in swinging yeah sure I think
blows<00:02:59.810> up<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.170> waited<00:03:00.590> there<00:03:00.770> was<00:03:00.920> always

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
blows up the waited there was always

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.770 
blows up the waited there was always
odds<00:03:01.490> on<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.790> there<00:03:02.150> was<00:03:02.300> going<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.480> be<00:03:02.540> one

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
odds on that there was going to be one

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.040 
odds on that there was going to be one
each<00:03:02.960> course<00:03:03.860> having<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.340> break<00:03:04.580> of<00:03:05.570> course<00:03:05.870> but

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
each course having a break of course but

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.550 
each course having a break of course but
it<00:03:06.140> doesn't<00:03:06.410> sound<00:03:06.770> like

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.620
