00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
with the 60 second reps it'll be 30

15 seconds hard 15 seconds easy and

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.749 
15 seconds hard 15 seconds easy and
again<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:56.049> easy<00:01:56.289> part<00:01:56.649> is<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:56.979> walk<00:01:57.310> or<00:01:57.520> job

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
again that easy part is a walk or job

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.910 
again that easy part is a walk or job
that'll<00:01:58.390> only<00:01:58.719> be<00:01:58.840> two<00:01:59.079> minutes<00:01:59.259> in<00:01:59.530> total

which<00:02:00.280> then<00:02:00.490> takes<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:00.939> total<00:02:01.149> time<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:01.689> the

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
which then takes the total time of the

which then takes the total time of the
monarch<00:02:02.200> partly<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.950> 20<00:02:03.340> minutes<00:02:03.670> now<00:02:04.570> it

monarch partly to 20 minutes now it

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.050 
monarch partly to 20 minutes now it
sounds<00:02:05.110> easy<00:02:05.289> starting<00:02:06.159> off<00:02:06.250> at<00:02:06.399> 90<00:02:06.700> second

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
sounds easy starting off at 90 second

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.550 
sounds easy starting off at 90 second
efforts<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.479> then<00:02:07.570> finishing<00:02:07.960> off<00:02:08.050> in<00:02:08.200> 15

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
efforts and then finishing off in 15

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.100 
efforts and then finishing off in 15
second<00:02:08.950> efforts<00:02:09.220> but<00:02:09.729> trust<00:02:10.090> me<00:02:10.209> as<00:02:10.479> the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
second efforts but trust me as the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.350 
second efforts but trust me as the
repetition<00:02:11.290> gets<00:02:11.920> shorter<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:13.000> does<00:02:13.209> the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
repetition gets shorter so does the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.479 
repetition gets shorter so does the
recovery<00:02:13.900> you'll<00:02:14.739> find<00:02:15.069> when<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.250> first

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
recovery you'll find when you first

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.190 
recovery you'll find when you first
start<00:02:15.760> doing<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.120> session<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.630> after<00:02:16.900> 8<00:02:17.050> or

start doing the session that after 8 or
9<00:02:17.349> minutes<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:18.040> will<00:02:18.130> actually<00:02:18.550> be<00:02:18.640> very

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
9 minutes you will actually be very

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.809 
9 minutes you will actually be very
tired<00:02:19.209> but<00:02:20.019> as<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.260> become<00:02:20.440> stronger<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.430> as

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
tired but as you become stronger and as

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.280 
tired but as you become stronger and as
you<00:02:21.970> start<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.300> get<00:02:22.420> more<00:02:22.660> training<00:02:22.959> done

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
you start to get more training done

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.620 
you start to get more training done
you'll<00:02:23.920> find<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.340> you'll<00:02:24.489> get<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.670> 13<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.420> 14

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
you'll find that you'll get to 13 and 14

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.530 
you'll find that you'll get to 13 and 14
minutes<00:02:26.140> before<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.650> start<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.040> get<00:02:27.160> tired

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
minutes before you start to get tired

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.690 
minutes before you start to get tired
make<00:02:28.540> sure<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.349> keep<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.830> repetitions<00:02:30.489> as

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
make sure you keep the repetitions as

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.220 
make sure you keep the repetitions as
even<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.660> possible

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
even as possible

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.800 
even as possible
the<00:02:33.190> recoveries<00:02:33.910> will<00:02:34.090> take<00:02:34.299> care<00:02:34.569> of<00:02:34.630> itself

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the recoveries will take care of itself

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.500 
the recoveries will take care of itself
as<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.650> start<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.130> get<00:02:36.250> stronger<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.269> said

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
as you start to get stronger and I said

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.509 
as you start to get stronger and I said
more<00:02:37.780> training<00:02:38.230> done<00:02:38.440> you'll<00:02:38.950> find<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
more training done you'll find that the

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.660 
more training done you'll find that the
recoveries<00:02:40.090> won't<00:02:40.660> be<00:02:40.840> as<00:02:40.959> tough<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:42.340> reason

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
recoveries won't be as tough the reason

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.069 
recoveries won't be as tough the reason
why<00:02:42.760> you're<00:02:42.970> struggling<00:02:43.239> with<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.599> recovery

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
why you're struggling with the recovery

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.839 
why you're struggling with the recovery
is<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.470> are<00:02:44.590> not<00:02:44.769> advanced<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.459> your<00:02:45.579> training

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
is you are not advanced in your training

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.539 
is you are not advanced in your training
yet<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.329> they<00:02:46.690> will<00:02:46.840> come<00:02:47.019> with<00:02:47.200> time<00:02:47.549> enjoy

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
yet and they will come with time enjoy

yet and they will come with time enjoy
it<00:02:48.730> it's<00:02:48.910> one<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.239> my<00:02:49.360> favorite<00:02:49.810> sessions<00:02:50.019> and

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
it it's one of my favorite sessions and

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.990 
it it's one of my favorite sessions and
you<00:02:50.739> can<00:02:50.890> do<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.160> session<00:02:51.400> anywhere<00:02:51.880> it

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
you can do that session anywhere it

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.910 
you can do that session anywhere it
doesn't<00:02:52.239> have<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.630> be<00:02:52.780> done<00:02:52.989> on<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.260> measured

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
doesn't have to be done on a measured

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.370 
doesn't have to be done on a measured
surface<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.910> can<00:02:55.060> actually<00:02:55.480> do<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.750> out<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.350> a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
surface you can actually do it out on a

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.349 
surface you can actually do it out on a
straight<00:02:56.709> stretch<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.069> road<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.670> use<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.180> as<00:02:58.329> a

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
straight stretch of road and use it as a

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.120 
straight stretch of road and use it as a
measuring<00:02:58.870> tool<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.140> see<00:02:59.319> how<00:02:59.350> far<00:02:59.799> you<00:03:00.010> can

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
measuring tool to see how far you can

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.160 
measuring tool to see how far you can
get<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.430> 20<00:03:00.760> minutes<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.569> next<00:03:01.720> time<00:03:01.989> you

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
get in 20 minutes and the next time you

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.380 
get in 20 minutes and the next time you
go<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.350> do<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.680> see<00:03:03.220> how<00:03:03.400> much<00:03:03.579> further<00:03:04.000> your
