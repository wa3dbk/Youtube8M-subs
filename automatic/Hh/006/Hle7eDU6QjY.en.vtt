what<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.890> does<00:01:14.130> guess<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:15.240> makes<00:01:15.479> them

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
what this does guess it makes them

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.200 
what this does guess it makes them
harder<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.229> kill<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.250> potentially<00:01:18.090> if

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
harder to kill so when potentially if

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.670 
harder to kill so when potentially if
they're<00:01:18.330> harder<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.630> kill<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.320> don't<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
they're harder to kill you don't have to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.520 
they're harder to kill you don't have to
have<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:19.920> crosshair<00:01:20.430> or<00:01:21.000> your<00:01:21.290> red<00:01:22.290> dot

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
have your crosshair or your red dot

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.960 
have your crosshair or your red dot
whatever<00:01:22.740> you're<00:01:23.040> using<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.490> gun<00:01:23.759> on

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
whatever you're using on your gun on

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.940 
whatever you're using on your gun on
them<00:01:24.390> longer<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.229> improving<00:01:25.799> your

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
them longer so this is improving your

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.819 
them longer so this is improving your
aim<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.970> long<00:01:27.150> run<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.650> that

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
aim in the long run so we got that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.039 
aim in the long run so we got that
covered<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:30.299> team<00:01:30.450> options<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.990> want

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
covered and your team options you want

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.370 
covered and your team options you want
to<00:01:31.170> make<00:01:31.290> sure<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.710> radar<00:01:32.040> always<00:01:32.369> fun<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.420> yes

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
to make sure the radar always fun is yes

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.319 
to make sure the radar always fun is yes
because<00:01:34.979> once<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> radar<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.150> you

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
because once you have the radar on you

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.819

generally know where everybody on the

spawn points particularly not for team
deathmatch<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.810> gives<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
deathmatch but it just gives you a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.929 
deathmatch but it just gives you a
little<00:01:43.320> bit<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.619> where<00:01:44.159> someone<00:01:44.520> could<00:01:44.640> spawn

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
little bit of where someone could spawn

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.120 
little bit of where someone could spawn
and<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.600> keep<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:46.320> kill<00:01:46.740> streak<00:01:46.979> going

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and you can keep your kill streak going

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.969 
and you can keep your kill streak going
on<00:01:47.340> or<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.840> becoming<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.899> boss<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.380> improve

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
once you're in the game guys you need to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.550 
once you're in the game guys you need to
determine<00:02:15.599> whether<00:02:15.840> you're<00:02:16.230> going<00:02:16.349> to<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.530> a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
determine whether you're going to be a

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.390 
determine whether you're going to be a
sub<00:02:16.890> or<00:02:17.250> an<00:02:17.400> AR<00:02:17.640> ah<00:02:17.879> right<00:02:18.810> now<00:02:18.989> I'm<00:02:19.260> an<00:02:19.500> AR<00:02:19.769> so

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
sub or an AR ah right now I'm an AR so

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.619 
sub or an AR ah right now I'm an AR so
I'm<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:20.849> have<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> lower<00:02:21.330> sensitivity

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
I'm going to have a lower sensitivity

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.420 
I'm going to have a lower sensitivity
that's<00:02:22.170> what<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.379> would<00:02:22.500> be<00:02:22.590> teaching<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.040> next

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
that's what I would be teaching you next

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.160 
that's what I would be teaching you next
is<00:02:23.519> you<00:02:24.209> need<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.390> find<00:02:24.780> what<00:02:24.989> your

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
is you need to find what your

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.080 
is you need to find what your
sensitivity<00:02:25.769> is<00:02:25.830> going<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> be<00:02:26.129> generally

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
sensitivity is going to be generally

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.699 
sensitivity is going to be generally
people<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.659> use<00:02:27.780> ARS<00:02:28.230> have<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.409> lower

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
people that use ARS have a lower

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.949 
people that use ARS have a lower
sensitivity<00:02:29.040> I'll<00:02:29.819> run<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.269> for<00:02:30.569> that's

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
sensitivity I'll run it for that's

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.080 
sensitivity I'll run it for that's
pretty<00:02:31.319> low<00:02:31.590> but<00:02:32.099> for<00:02:32.670> an<00:02:32.730> assault<00:02:32.970> rifle

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
pretty low but for an assault rifle

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.059 
pretty low but for an assault rifle
that's<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.629> good<00:02:33.810> sensitivity<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.830> need<00:02:34.980> to

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
that's a good sensitivity you need to

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.199 
that's a good sensitivity you need to
make<00:02:35.250> sure<00:02:35.280> you're<00:02:35.610> going<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.819> landing

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
make sure you're going to be landing

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.210 
make sure you're going to be landing
your<00:02:36.480> shots<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:37.230> when<00:02:37.680> you're<00:02:37.799> playing<00:02:38.040> the

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
because the air is one of the most

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.289 
because the air is one of the most
important<00:02:43.920> roles<00:02:44.310> when<00:02:44.730> you're<00:02:44.849> playing<00:02:45.090> and

have a good AR you're not going to be

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
able to get map control that's what

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.729 
able to get map control that's what
you're<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:50.970> r<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.930> what<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.680> does

you're a r is for and what this does

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.349 
you're a r is for and what this does
with<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.459> double<00:02:53.760> health<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.150> double

with the double health and double
regeneration<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.200> makes<00:02:55.650> them<00:02:55.739> harder<00:02:56.040> to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
regeneration and makes them harder to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.979 
regeneration and makes them harder to
kill<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.609> generally<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.480> have<00:02:57.629> to<00:02:57.780> have<00:02:57.900> your

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
kill and generally you have to have your

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.020 
kill and generally you have to have your
crosshair<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.440> them<00:02:58.680> like<00:02:58.769> i<00:02:58.920> said<00:02:59.129> before<00:02:59.250> you

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
crosshair on them like i said before you

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.490 
crosshair on them like i said before you
have<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.239> have<00:03:00.329> on<00:03:00.420> longer<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.079> it's<00:03:01.319> just

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
have to have on longer and it's just

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.440 
have to have on longer and it's just
harder<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.769> kill<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.129> people<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.640> if<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.299> have

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
harder to kill the people so if you have

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.440 
harder to kill the people so if you have
a<00:03:03.480> higher<00:03:03.720> aim<00:03:03.989> for<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.799> better<00:03:05.160> aim<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.730> you

a higher aim for a better aim and you

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.449 
a higher aim for a better aim and you
have<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.629> higher<00:03:06.810> sensitivity<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:08.280> can

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
have a higher sensitivity you can

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.160 
have a higher sensitivity you can
generally<00:03:08.760> kill<00:03:09.090> people<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:09.870> can<00:03:10.019> turn

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
generally kill people and you can turn

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.199 
generally kill people and you can turn
on<00:03:10.230> them<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> lot<00:03:10.709> better<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.849> don't<00:03:12.030> miss

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
on them a lot better and you don't miss

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.380

little bit why you have a higher
