00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the ball out of the air that's not the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.120 
the ball out of the air that's not the
purpose<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.350> drill<00:02:28.470> though<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:28.950> if<00:02:29.010> you

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
purpose of the drill though so if you

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.650 
purpose of the drill though so if you
like<00:02:29.310> throw<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.880> completely<00:02:30.300> miss<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
like throw it and completely miss the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.020 
like throw it and completely miss the
ball<00:02:30.810> don't<00:02:31.500> think<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.280> failed<00:02:32.760> at<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030

ball don't think that you failed at the
drill<00:02:33.270> because<00:02:33.630> it's<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:34.170> not<00:02:34.709> important

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
drill because it's really not important

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.860 
drill because it's really not important
for<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.670> drill<00:02:35.880> its<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.180> get<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.480> idea<00:02:36.780> of

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
for the drill its to get the idea of

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.290 
for the drill its to get the idea of
throwing<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.680> up<00:02:37.770> throwing<00:02:38.610> at<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.970> ball<00:02:39.120> to
