00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello everyone today it's dylan 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.950
 of mycar diner team 36 so I'm going 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.440
 make a new video so this time 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.450
 so on my detector so previously 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.639
 I showed you my mc2 rest 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.870
 so today this with the detectors 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.359
 rob thomson 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.910
 so as you can see and at 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.430
 their height so you can see it's 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.949
 in a bag 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.300
 so she is well protected from 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.570
 detectors are well protected to 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.660
 inside so there is foam 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 to protect them on the top so 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.270
 to not damage the phases of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.480
 detectors as you can the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.399
 see a small place with a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.590
 kind of moss also here that is 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.329
 really protects well so in the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.129
 pouch there are four more detectors 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.410
 a central so yellow green detector 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.609
 blue red 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.289
 I do not know if you see well on the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.739
 video but that's because he does not know the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.610
 worse 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.080
 So I show you a detector 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.210
 so a small pile 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.770
 no you can see it 23 watts 12 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:24.180
 volts after that cd then the special 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:28.310
 thus detecting no solid defects 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.799
 really solid so early 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.670
 excuse me you have people so some 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.610
 seals 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.229
 as if it falls in the water or if it 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.650
 take the water but I remove them because 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.759
 that on my rock mode so you have to bah I 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.620
 will you moon and I can do you 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.480
 listen to his sense 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:52.900
 the lesson I'll see they have 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.310
 really a volume of powerful so by 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.990
 against the detectors I forgot to 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.110
 specify you can not adjust the 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.870
 volume except with this little cap it's 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:08.080
 how do you say you put it in the 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:10.899
 little hole here and that removes the sound 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.020
 does not remove the sound but it puts me a 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:18.880
 a little lower which is also good when 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.800
 you have the power to light so 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.670
 then the central so you can 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.320
 tone the volume and this little 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.180
 middle button it's to turn it on 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:35.110
 let's turn it on so that's it 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.530
 to say that she is turned on so when 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.290
 we go to turn on your detector 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.060
 you see that lights up blue it wants 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.100
 to say that he turned on 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.160
 no because I'm proud with the same 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.510
 color 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.830
 so that the detectors are 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.560
 really sensitive to wheels is 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:03:01.420
 really very well frankly I 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.630
 am not disappointed for the world so in the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.020
 description I wish we went 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.910
 compared to the detectors I was able 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.480
 really I tell you again rsa in the 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.700
 description 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.530
 bah right now I have presented my 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.989
 anton detector that alert w remember 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.400
 not from the icc and subscribe then from 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.400
 share go alone
