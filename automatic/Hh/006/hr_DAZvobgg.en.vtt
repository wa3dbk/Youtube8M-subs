00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
bleeding because when you don't cover it

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.970 
bleeding because when you don't cover it
it<00:04:47.140> does<00:04:47.380> still<00:04:47.710> turn<00:04:48.010> white<00:04:49.500> nope<00:04:50.530> picked<00:04:50.860> up

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
it does still turn white nope picked up

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:59.770 
it does still turn white nope picked up
the<00:04:51.130> heck<00:04:51.280> see

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.459 

yes

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:07.929 

so<00:05:04.189> has<00:05:04.429> that<00:05:04.669> soft<00:05:05.089> look<00:05:05.509> I<00:05:06.279> can<00:05:07.279> definitely

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:07.939 
so has that soft look I can definitely

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:12.070 
so has that soft look I can definitely
feel<00:05:08.330> this<00:05:08.659> sand<00:05:09.969> texture<00:05:10.969> as<00:05:11.239> I'm<00:05:11.809> brushing

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
feel this sand texture as I'm brushing

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.690 
feel this sand texture as I'm brushing
it

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.770 

but

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
but

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.200 
but
definitely<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.890> hexie<00:05:22.250> did<00:05:22.460> not<00:05:22.610> lose<00:05:22.820> any<00:05:23.000> of

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
definitely the hexie did not lose any of

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.510 
definitely the hexie did not lose any of
its<00:05:23.390> color<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:24.140> tinsel<00:05:24.590> did<00:05:24.770> not<00:05:24.920> lose<00:05:25.130> any<00:05:25.310> of

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
its color the tinsel did not lose any of

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.990 
its color the tinsel did not lose any of
its<00:05:25.790> color<00:05:26.350> and<00:05:27.370> it<00:05:28.370> doesn't<00:05:28.790> look<00:05:28.970> like

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
its color and it doesn't look like

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.670 
its color and it doesn't look like
anything<00:05:30.100> blood

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
anything blood

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.420 
anything blood
nothing<00:05:33.680> is<00:05:33.830> shrinking<00:05:35.530> it<00:05:36.530> still<00:05:36.860> has<00:05:37.100> the

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
nothing is shrinking it still has the

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:46.470 
nothing is shrinking it still has the
shimmery<00:05:37.880> shine<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.690> it<00:05:42.940> so<00:05:43.940> there's<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:45.290> I

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
shimmery shine to it so there's that I

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.820 
shimmery shine to it so there's that I
hope<00:05:47.480> that<00:05:47.690> helps<00:05:48.520> okay<00:05:50.230> I'm<00:05:51.230> gonna<00:05:51.410> say<00:05:51.650> about

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
hope that helps okay I'm gonna say about

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.550 
hope that helps okay I'm gonna say about
putting<00:05:52.250> in<00:05:52.400> another<00:05:52.970> coat<00:05:53.690> on<00:05:53.720> just<00:05:54.200> to<00:05:54.350> see

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
putting in another coat on just to see

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:03.470 
putting in another coat on just to see
if<00:05:54.680> it<00:05:54.830> makes<00:05:54.980> it<00:05:55.190> darker

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.690 

oh<00:06:03.600> my<00:06:04.290> goodness<00:06:04.650> gracious<00:06:04.800> these<00:06:05.250> skeeters

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
oh my goodness gracious these skeeters

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:13.760 
oh my goodness gracious these skeeters
up<00:06:05.910> there's<00:06:06.150> another<00:06:06.420> hexagon

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.760 

and<00:06:14.770> that's<00:06:14.920> two<00:06:15.220> hexagons<00:06:15.880> with<00:06:16.270> you<00:06:16.590> and<00:06:17.590> you

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
and that's two hexagons with you and you

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.710 
and that's two hexagons with you and you
can<00:06:17.950> definitely<00:06:18.130> see<00:06:18.550> that<00:06:19.030> when<00:06:19.330> you<00:06:19.450> do<00:06:19.600> the

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
can definitely see that when you do the

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.530 
can definitely see that when you do the
second<00:06:20.050> code<00:06:20.230> it<00:06:20.380> does<00:06:20.530> get<00:06:20.740> darker<00:06:21.330> just<00:06:22.330> like

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
second code it does get darker just like

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.310 
second code it does get darker just like
any<00:06:22.690> other<00:06:22.980> glitter<00:06:23.980> polish<00:06:24.900> it<00:06:25.900> normally

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
any other glitter polish it normally

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.080 
any other glitter polish it normally
takes<00:06:26.590> about<00:06:26.770> two<00:06:27.130> coats<00:06:27.430> to<00:06:27.670> get<00:06:27.790> it

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
takes about two coats to get it

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.480 
takes about two coats to get it
Oh<00:06:29.040> smack<00:06:30.040> that<00:06:30.250> one<00:06:30.750> so<00:06:31.750> yeah<00:06:31.950> the<00:06:32.950> hexagons

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
Oh smack that one so yeah the hexagons

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.910 
Oh smack that one so yeah the hexagons
still<00:06:33.760> have<00:06:33.940> a<00:06:33.970> holographic<00:06:34.600> as<00:06:35.320> you<00:06:35.500> can<00:06:35.680> see

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
still have a holographic as you can see

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.520 
still have a holographic as you can see
on<00:06:36.040> that<00:06:36.220> guy<00:06:36.400> right<00:06:36.610> there<00:06:37.140> so<00:06:38.140> they<00:06:38.260> didn't

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
on that guy right there so they didn't

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.100 
on that guy right there so they didn't
lose<00:06:38.740> anything<00:06:39.160> and<00:06:39.850> the<00:06:40.120> tinsel<00:06:40.420> still<00:06:40.900> has<00:06:41.080> a

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
lose anything and the tinsel still has a

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:47.400 
lose anything and the tinsel still has a
holographic<00:06:41.890> as<00:06:42.250> you<00:06:42.460> can<00:06:42.640> see<00:06:46.020> you<00:06:47.020> can<00:06:47.200> see

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
holographic as you can see you can see

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.090 
holographic as you can see you can see
the<00:06:47.560> play<00:06:47.770> of<00:06:47.920> colors<00:06:48.340> so<00:06:49.710> yeah

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
the play of colors so yeah

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.910 
the play of colors so yeah
nothing<00:06:51.700> bleh<00:06:51.910> and<00:06:52.710> everything<00:06:53.710> looks

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
nothing bleh and everything looks

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.330 
nothing bleh and everything looks
beautiful<00:06:54.460> I<00:06:55.110> hope<00:06:56.110> that<00:06:56.290> helps<00:06:56.590> you<00:06:56.650> let<00:06:57.250> me

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
beautiful I hope that helps you let me

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.030 
beautiful I hope that helps you let me
