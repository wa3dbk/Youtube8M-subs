00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
hey guys I wanted to show you guys the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.350 
hey guys I wanted to show you guys the
rapid<00:00:08.360> growth<00:00:08.570> of<00:00:08.600> the<00:00:09.080> Moringa<00:00:09.500> oleifera

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
rapid growth of the Moringa oleifera

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.629 
rapid growth of the Moringa oleifera
these<00:00:11.360> seedlings<00:00:11.720> here<00:00:12.320> that<00:00:13.010> stand<00:00:13.430> now

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
these seedlings here that stand now

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.680 
these seedlings here that stand now
about<00:00:14.030> six<00:00:14.540> inches<00:00:14.840> tall<00:00:15.139> are<00:00:15.950> only<00:00:16.690> literally

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
about six inches tall are only literally

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.040 
about six inches tall are only literally
about<00:00:17.990> five<00:00:18.320> or<00:00:19.130> four<00:00:19.340> days<00:00:19.580> old<00:00:21.189> so<00:00:23.050> the

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
about five or four days old so the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.370 
about five or four days old so the
growth<00:00:24.260> on<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:24.980> Moringa<00:00:25.519> oleifera<00:00:25.670> is

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
growth on the Moringa oleifera is

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.829 
growth on the Moringa oleifera is
incredible<00:00:27.380> especially<00:00:28.220> if<00:00:29.089> you're<00:00:29.300> in<00:00:29.570> a

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
incredible especially if you're in a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.450 
incredible especially if you're in a
warm<00:00:30.230> temperature<00:00:30.560> area<00:00:32.770> between<00:00:33.770> I<00:00:34.250> say

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
warm temperature area between I say

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.740 
warm temperature area between I say
starting<00:00:34.940> off<00:00:35.090> at<00:00:35.300> 80<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:36.130> 95<00:00:37.130> degrees<00:00:37.750> they

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
starting off at 80 to 95 degrees they

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.959 
starting off at 80 to 95 degrees they
can<00:00:38.899> withstand<00:00:39.050> 100<00:00:39.950> degrees<00:00:40.280> but<00:00:40.640> as<00:00:40.789> I<00:00:40.910> said

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
can withstand 100 degrees but as I said

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.810 
can withstand 100 degrees but as I said
they<00:00:41.420> need<00:00:41.450> a<00:00:41.690> lot<00:00:42.110> of<00:00:42.260> water<00:00:42.500> especially<00:00:43.250> if

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
they need a lot of water especially if

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.630 
they need a lot of water especially if
they're<00:00:44.000> not<00:00:44.180> an<00:00:44.449> older<00:00:45.020> mature<00:00:45.680> tree

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
they're not an older mature tree

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.959 
they're not an older mature tree
Maranda<00:00:47.570> thrive<00:00:48.020> off<00:00:48.350> of<00:00:48.379> water<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:49.550> think

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
Maranda thrive off of water and I think

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.549 
Maranda thrive off of water and I think
that's<00:00:50.149> one<00:00:50.359> of<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.570> misunderstandings<00:00:51.440> that

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
that's one of the misunderstandings that

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.779 
that's one of the misunderstandings that
there<00:00:51.859> that<00:00:52.100> is<00:00:52.250> out<00:00:52.370> there<00:00:52.399> in<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.699> internet

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
there that is out there in the internet

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.389 
there that is out there in the internet
that<00:00:53.210> their<00:00:53.390> drought<00:00:53.719> tolerant<00:00:54.260> yes<00:00:55.160> they<00:00:55.370> are

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
that their drought tolerant yes they are

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.880 
that their drought tolerant yes they are
drought<00:00:55.850> tolerant<00:00:55.879> if<00:00:56.690> it<00:00:57.109> comes<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.680> that

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
drought tolerant if it comes to that

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.270 
drought tolerant if it comes to that
condition<00:00:59.289> it's<00:01:00.289> like<00:01:00.469> in<00:01:00.590> Africa<00:01:00.859> you<00:01:01.129> can

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
condition it's like in Africa you can

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.279 
condition it's like in Africa you can
find<00:01:01.519> some<00:01:01.789> older<00:01:02.480> trees<00:01:02.780> that<00:01:02.989> I've<00:01:03.109> been

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
find some older trees that I've been

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.140 
find some older trees that I've been
there<00:01:03.530> for<00:01:03.739> years<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:04.160> a<00:01:04.489> lot<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:04.730> other<00:01:04.850> stuff

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
there for years and a lot of other stuff

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.030 
there for years and a lot of other stuff
has<00:01:05.300> died<00:01:05.570> off<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.140> they<00:01:06.260> they're<00:01:06.710> still

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
has died off and they they're still

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.730 
has died off and they they're still
there<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:08.210> Moringa<00:01:08.660> has<00:01:09.050> the<00:01:09.200> ability<00:01:09.680> to

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
there the Moringa has the ability to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.270 
there the Moringa has the ability to
store<00:01:10.280> water<00:01:10.610> within<00:01:11.180> their<00:01:11.509> root<00:01:11.780> trunk<00:01:12.280> so

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
store water within their root trunk so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.460 
store water within their root trunk so
that's<00:01:14.240> what<00:01:14.479> actually<00:01:14.659> makes<00:01:15.049> them<00:01:15.259> drought

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
that's what actually makes them drought

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.039 
that's what actually makes them drought
tolerant<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:17.030> is<00:01:17.210> possible<00:01:17.450> for<00:01:17.960> them

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
tolerant and that is possible for them

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.740 
tolerant and that is possible for them
to<00:01:18.259> actually<00:01:18.409> live<00:01:18.680> out<00:01:18.710> in<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.009> desert<00:01:19.750> but

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
to actually live out in the desert but

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.719 
to actually live out in the desert but
that<00:01:21.049> only<00:01:21.290> happens<00:01:21.619> once<00:01:22.220> they<00:01:22.490> have<00:01:22.640> to

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
that only happens once they have to

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.690 
that only happens once they have to
become<00:01:23.090> mature<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.290> have<00:01:25.009> been<00:01:25.220> around<00:01:25.490> I'd

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
become mature and have been around I'd

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.510 
become mature and have been around I'd
say<00:01:25.970> for<00:01:26.210> at<00:01:26.299> least<00:01:26.360> several<00:01:26.630> years<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:28.369> where

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
say for at least several years to where

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.890 
say for at least several years to where
they<00:01:28.610> become<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.909> lot<00:01:29.119> stronger

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
they become a lot stronger

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.940 
they become a lot stronger
so<00:01:30.710> Miranda's<00:01:31.700> love<00:01:32.060> water<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.320> if<00:01:33.530> you're<00:01:33.710> not

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
so Miranda's love water so if you're not

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.380 
so Miranda's love water so if you're not
watering<00:01:34.159> your<00:01:34.399> meringue<00:01:34.700> go<00:01:34.850> on<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.030> regular

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
watering your meringue go on a regular

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.120 
watering your meringue go on a regular
basis<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.110> then<00:01:36.380> wondering<00:01:36.680> why<00:01:36.799> they're<00:01:36.979> not

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
basis and then wondering why they're not

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.819 
basis and then wondering why they're not
growing<00:01:37.399> that<00:01:38.000> could<00:01:38.180> be<00:01:38.299> one<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.600> major

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
growing that could be one of the major

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.450 
growing that could be one of the major
problems<00:01:40.840> as<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:42.110> say<00:01:42.259> they<00:01:42.439> are<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:42.829> tropical

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
problems as I say they are a tropical

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.300 
problems as I say they are a tropical
tree<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.770> in

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
tree so in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.430 
tree so in
Hawaii<00:01:46.910> and<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.600> lot<00:01:47.750> of<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:47.960> other<00:01:48.080> places

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
Hawaii and a lot of the other places

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.880 
Hawaii and a lot of the other places
Central<00:01:48.950> America<00:01:49.690> which<00:01:50.690> is<00:01:50.720> rain<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.770> know

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
Central America which is rain you know

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.380 
Central America which is rain you know
they<00:01:52.070> have<00:01:52.220> rain<00:01:52.430> all<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.670> time<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.270> it's

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
they have rain all the time and it's

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.800 
they have rain all the time and it's
very<00:01:53.450> moist<00:01:54.050> Marsh<00:01:54.440> of<00:01:54.830> sorry<00:01:55.460> very<00:01:55.910> a<00:01:56.210> lot<00:01:56.780> of

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
very moist Marsh of sorry very a lot of

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.630 
very moist Marsh of sorry very a lot of
moisture<00:01:57.050> in<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.470> air

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
moisture in the air

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.860 
moisture in the air
they<00:01:59.450> thrive<00:02:00.140> very<00:02:00.500> well<00:02:00.710> like<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.190> but

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
they thrive very well like that but

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.860 
they thrive very well like that but
water<00:02:02.870> can<00:02:03.020> be<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.860> Miranda's<00:02:04.400> worst<00:02:04.880> enemy<00:02:05.510> if

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
water can be a Miranda's worst enemy if

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.340 
water can be a Miranda's worst enemy if
you<00:02:06.350> do<00:02:06.740> not<00:02:06.980> have<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.490> well-drained<00:02:08.060> soil<00:02:08.450> so

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
you do not have a well-drained soil so

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.440 
you do not have a well-drained soil so
you<00:02:09.830> can<00:02:10.010> water<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.550> heck<00:02:10.729> out<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:10.910> Moringa

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
you can water the heck out of Moringa

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.430 
you can water the heck out of Moringa
alone<00:02:11.960> as<00:02:12.260> long<00:02:12.320> as<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.250> soil<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:14.690> has<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:15.140> good

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
alone as long as the soil it has a good

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.820 
alone as long as the soil it has a good
drainage<00:02:16.210> so<00:02:17.210> if<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.630> if<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.350> put<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.560> lot<00:02:18.710> of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
drainage so if you if you put a lot of

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.080 
drainage so if you if you put a lot of
water<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.160> moranga<00:02:19.430> tree<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.910> have

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
water on the moranga tree and you have

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.930 
water on the moranga tree and you have
play<00:02:20.600> heavy<00:02:21.260> soil<00:02:21.590> where<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.640> waters

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
play heavy soil where it's the waters

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.770 
play heavy soil where it's the waters
just<00:02:23.060> gonna<00:02:23.270> sit<00:02:23.510> there

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
just gonna sit there

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.140 
just gonna sit there
now<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.560> Marengo<00:02:25.160> do<00:02:25.370> they<00:02:25.640> do<00:02:25.700> not<00:02:25.910> like<00:02:26.120> that

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
now the Marengo do they do not like that

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.480 
now the Marengo do they do not like that
and<00:02:26.570> they<00:02:26.720> can<00:02:27.080> suffer<00:02:27.500> from<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:27.980> root<00:02:28.190> rot

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
and they can suffer from the root rot

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.050 
and they can suffer from the root rot
very<00:02:29.120> quickly<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.370> think<00:02:31.700> that's<00:02:31.880> one<00:02:32.030> of

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
very quickly so I think that's one of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.790 
very quickly so I think that's one of
the<00:02:32.210> misunderstandings<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:33.140> -<00:02:33.500> don't<00:02:33.680> need

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
the misunderstandings that - don't need

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.680 
the misunderstandings that - don't need
a<00:02:33.860> lot<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.070> water<00:02:34.310> false<00:02:34.820> they<00:02:35.150> need<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> lot<00:02:35.600> of

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
a lot of water false they need a lot of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.770 
a lot of water false they need a lot of
water<00:02:35.900> if<00:02:36.710> they<00:02:37.700> have<00:02:38.300> well-drained<00:02:39.080> soil<00:02:40.780> so

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
water if they have well-drained soil so

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.720 
water if they have well-drained soil so
