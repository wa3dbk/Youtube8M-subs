the whole is also pretty sharp on the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.020 
the whole is also pretty sharp on the

road so while it's generally crew Z and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.240 
road so while it's generally crew Z and
comfortable<00:03:25.600> it'll<00:03:26.170> also<00:03:26.590> tackle<00:03:27.130> some

corners<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.850> no<00:03:28.030> problems<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:34.540> three<00:03:34.900> cars

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
corners and no problems so three cars
