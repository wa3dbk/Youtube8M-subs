00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.470
 male voice toppers if you have a child at home once again emperor in job and home 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.000
 we learned that in denekamp but now the father where are now learning how to swim 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.490
 to be closed, it is questionable whether it will soon be represented again 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.520
 will be with news and apply to major water tournaments 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.640
 available means that fewer training hours are involved in the 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.829
 development of of young swimmers 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.359
 And no that is partly underground Twente has a standards and hourly reputation 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.089
 really completely forgotten and that goes on and on 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.350
 yes that is now in danger 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.110
 yes and it is not only competitive swimming and swimming 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.610
 of course much more than 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.810
 only the events within the club are also just a special sport activity 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.070
 celso ortiz five recreational swimming pool exactly it updates with diploma swimming 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.680
 school swimming which of course is slowly disappearing from which more and more disappears in the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 Township 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.120
 because of the cuts 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.340
 but also what many people don't know is that sweden and david beers are the biggest 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.660
 sports activities in the Netherlands 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.089
 what kind of running and cycling and yes 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.590
 Only when swimming you have a little bad luck that may be what is needed 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.740
 not just you and not everyone has a backyard some bugs and what 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.550
 they do 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.920
 and in so doing it was designated by the municipality and as they determine 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.729
 that something will close and you have no alternative to check 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190
 Alkmaar 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.190
 top favorite 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.320
 investing in the neck and very good news and that is not only good for the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.990
 elderly people swimming laps 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.940
 for the out of the length of his club but that is certainly not for me 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.700
 also unimportant for the 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
 small legs and children 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.960
 yes and green thereof 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.260
 important is that she and 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.070
 enough 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.070
 facilities 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.640
 last year opened last summer participated in the olympic games in 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.410
 London 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.560
 I managed to get a nice eleventh place 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.009
 he pays for the hour and it all started in twente at the dinkel 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.179
 a questionable but pay attention to a national topper actually 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.289
 all that summer work has its rivers start at the club that starts with and yes 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.919
 here to redeem land if you wanted to continue because then everyone goes 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.409
 actually yes towards the dinkel 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.409
 a questionable level good trainer daems a good structure 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.420
 to bring you to a regional or even a national top 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.019
 but if you continue to support sport, then you have the mole to Lent 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.829
 and the most important fixed times that is not in twente is a 50 meter indoor pool 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.510
 the associations inside and said they are very all sorts of animals and people 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.089
 are committed to alternatives 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.659
 I think of going into conversation with professional parties outlined KNZB 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.889
 architectural firm zoom 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.429
 concept pools he who are ultimately much more durable than anything 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:52.939
 is all there now 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.349
 those who have been using it for two and a half years for an alternative 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:00.589
 also beneficial for the municipality 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:04.129
 she presented and the municipality just doesn't want to hear it this time 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.639
 cuts needed but yes in this case, however, guessing is cheaper of course 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.030
 also 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.139
 she lives because in the coming years that will save a lot of money on a new job 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.049
 in addition, moving yes x 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.619
 very important 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:26.619
 beh for small children but also for other people and for everyone 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:31.269
 because it also ensures that you stay healthier and you are sick and therefore 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.409
 origin 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.139
 that's a whole this morning the group that has been on the shirt for two and a half years 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.049
 this plan 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.889
 and I 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.399
 I think they just have no other choice that it really goes now 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.239
 Listen to the people who actually stop after that 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.219
 process drawn up 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:49.499
 in the town hall by people who 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:53.239
 have or do not know about funds and do not bovag out and have them 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.599
 purely looking at budgets they are going to look this off 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.419
 and then we are going to put his buddy out more en masse to the 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.139
 user sector of the experts 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.159
 and that is the mistake they make time and time again and they still have the chance to 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.579
 not to make that mistake, but then they must listen to the people who 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.299
 for two and a half years 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.849
 have very good plan lie my advice are make ambitious decision 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.529
 because this is also a possibility for region to no 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.809
 to distinguish and the tree 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:24.870
 yes to 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.980
 I am thinking of heading around in a number of places and that could potentially be at risk 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.330
 look into 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.099
 it is now back after twelve minutes then you avoid a labor camp 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.449
 to put up a nice 50-meter track 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.939
 you will win a lot of talent here regularly 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:44.309
 or the citizen does not make the city after the city do 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:49.059
 and if you mention the talents that optimally use that also in the region like you 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:51.430
 twente the fireworks disaster for the excellent 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.889
 the five municipalities that would amount to a visit 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.590
 talents here in the region 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.559
 give a chance but also the people who do well 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:01.559
 bring it here to give a new chance to train and study 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.430
 the knvb wants to make talent in europe 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.930
 the musicians you get the chance only once 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.969
 so if you do it then do it well and have a 50 meter pool 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:12.879
 if you were five because you had been 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.199
 only picked up mill end in 2007 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.709
 and here also set up the oxygen tent
