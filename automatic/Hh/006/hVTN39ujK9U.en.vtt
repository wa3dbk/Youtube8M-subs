 preparation last year 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.540
 of fire that experienced is also not the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.800

 say it looks very nice 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.340

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.040

 contact and explain to those people 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.750

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.030
 to talk to us about something else 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.009

 a matter of course that people are on 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.270
 all this evening 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.310
 come and also give money, we think 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.049
 normal but then of course it is not 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.820
 special about this is that it is already 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.380
 these people come with a purpose 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.549
 being cozy is important but a lot 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.330
 more important than the end of the 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.380
 evening 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.909

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.890
 have the support 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.840

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.759

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.259

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:03.270

 [Music] 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:51.729
 [Music] 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.450
 as a new feyenoord player 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.910
 The Feyenoord say that it goes 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.970

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.770
 people at the table to relationships of 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.600
 sponsoring feyenoord 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.370
 what do they want to discuss with you 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.870
 everything about football 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.370
 of course, but also find ready time 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.640
 I of course don't just lie there 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.240
 but oh well late but also to the person this 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.240
 sounds deeper into 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.850
 [Music] 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.209
 most shit know everything in particular 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.640
 by the older players dirk kuyt and 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.690
 giovanni who know that am us 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.280
 just an example 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.950
 you are for the whole lot of boys and 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.459
 Girls in Netherlands for six years 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.500
 up to 20 years and you can do that for yourself 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.090
 but you can continue sharing and me 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.980
 think we have to assume that parts 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.950
 people who are closest to us 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.420

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.930

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.850
