00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:07.349 
three we looked at it and we've
developed<00:02:04.749> a<00:02:05.170> season<00:02:05.709> three<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.179> where<00:02:07.179> we're

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
developed a season three and where we're

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.910 
developed a season three and where we're
staying<00:02:07.539> season<00:02:07.929> three<00:02:08.200> would<00:02:08.320> actually<00:02:08.770> be

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
staying season three would actually be

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.300 
staying season three would actually be
shorter<00:02:09.310> this<00:02:09.430> season<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.940> season<00:02:10.690> two

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
shorter this season to season two

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.010 
shorter this season to season two
longest<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.440> entire<00:02:13.440> trilogy<00:02:14.599> we<00:02:15.599> decided

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
longest of the entire trilogy we decided

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.729 
longest of the entire trilogy we decided
that<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.380> season<00:02:17.010> three<00:02:17.540> would<00:02:18.540> not<00:02:19.380> be<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
that a season three would not be the

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.140 
that a season three would not be the
best<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.430> season<00:02:20.940> two<00:02:21.060> will<00:02:21.270> definitely<00:02:21.780> ended

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
best so season two will definitely ended

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.430
