00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.980
 well good evening everyone hlm virus and that's it 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.219
 it's been a while since I did not post a video that day 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.599
 exactly and to go away there are several reasons to why for 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.579
 which I have not been able to video recently 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.080
 the first is for that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.960
 what you see there 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.160
 the new beast that will be used as a computer bad year is a pc that we have 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.390
 ridden with hold public places skier it takes basically it 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.539
 gave me back used parts and for what I have not changed is the case 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.040
 practices and alam and the hard drive 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.850
 and percent 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.130
 Well here I wanted to introduce you a little bit this new 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.450
 configuration for 100 euros by lower prices it's not really a 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.480
 group setup and die it's a self-respecting thing that helps 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.540
 better rotate battlefield bad company 2 now i must have 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.110
 increased rachidi increased to about 10 meters per second over hours on 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.120
 battlefield so that's not trivial at the level of 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.420
 recordings hits it's all simple 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.120
 I wanted you to present a little bit here 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.260
 my new pc 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.280
 I must also know that I have sinned 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 buddies recently curled yesterday and at the man and adrien who came to 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.030
 me too 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.259
 so I was not too much in front of my pc yet 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.680
 x which actually explains what do you do I did not offer you any videos 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.609
 regularly 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.299
 that's when we go short a little bit that I prepared the lighting all 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.320
 ages not like not shaking too much when john 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.530
 because I speak so first of all why am I hooked up the german 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.100
 there is 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.400
 % a new cooler single color masters that allows you to cool the 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.870
 what breaks my lawsuit 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.290
 worry the city is here m 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.619
 so graffiti as you know allows us to do the same for everything 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.620
 the world 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.710
 lelay game 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.190
 reda makes it possible to display in the graphic part of a computer in what 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.400
 which is based on a very great price 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.950
 there are ram strips here g skill both there what you see 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.420
 there is he feeding head he explains unfortunately the fact 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.830
 than 400 watts but for those who support for now my config ext 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.259
 I have not met 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.260
 for the processor in mind 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.210
 the us professor 3 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.590
 in terms of basic cadenced cross giguère that but I see that 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.069
 the cases of abuse of giguère I will overclocked 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.279
 eliott to hold it was no problem 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.499
 the same level of cooling there stop traveling and decided to 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.159
 stability it works nickel 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.949
 the hard drive you see there 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.359
 it's the same I'm not going to change just to mater and fall from the tower installed this 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.939
 which also explains the fact that I did not offer you videos 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.819
 after the player is here dvd but% 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.189
 very very important 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.949
 and here and the box for those who try peres and it's a naze guard 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.149
 2 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.199
 just tap that to type in the card on a year 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.219
 on google and you'll find it a schematic as you are all 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.589
 Aïssa discovered sealed boxes the biggest markets 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.419
 and by the way a pretty interesting system of water that is for 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.339
 them that actually allows to mount the hard drives and the elite the cd drives 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:55.199
 device all that esa lokeren system was well fucked geoffroy 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.109
 surround the quercy and in fact it allows me to fix 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.889
 the components quite efficient way I do not know if I'll see that reflected with 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.889
 the sub-prefecture 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.699
 the Malouine 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.749
 so a new config a mom before I was on the street so before I was 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:13.989
 at 50 between 50 and 60 frames per second on bbc2 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.379
 now it takes time between 60 and 70 who really is not there 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.689
 negligible it is a big improvement 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.849
 this is after others what could I talk about I can 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.819
 maybe because you turn your mouth what's called a cooler in 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.559
 made of a radiator mix 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.169
 and knowing that the racket is not necessarily something that 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:31.850
 surprises 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.359
 a radiator can be 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.309
 in e to cool 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:39.539
 so here they have not turned off a fan in Montreal 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:42.579
 for example the own words 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.010
 percent and what can I say that other side I just wanted to 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.359
 present that 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.009
 and then for me I will tell you a little bit of doubt that I'm going 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:52.479
 continue to do for videos 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:53.399
 in the hair 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.399
 besides a little the beast less we will move away 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.839
 So here is that the target the case a rider 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.180
 good then the sequel in the videos I had to do episode 5 for bbc 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.359
 for the draws 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.039
 % were dinosaurs on vehicles for those who do not know it 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.149
 not do it by itself seriously 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.119
 in the same line as saying someone else 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.159
 no but listen I wish you all a very good evening and 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:19.739
 I hope you will be there anymore I know we had asked to do 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.600
 in the description I would put the jam to lie I will put all the 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:24.669
 pieces all that 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.150
 and pity please after this video still ask what more 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.309
 is my config at dior this question a 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:33.419
 thousand times I think a thousand times 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.289
 in short on behalf of the libournais kebab I wish you a very good evening and 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.800
 I tell you next time for a new video on 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.999
 full of different games and specially dated the son of baye 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.699
 Yes 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.699
 Why 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:01.299
 in this hen
