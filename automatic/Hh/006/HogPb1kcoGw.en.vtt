inches<00:02:29.250> by<00:02:29.820> 25<00:02:30.810> inches<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.680> little<00:02:32.160> bit<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.370> a

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
inches by 25 inches so a little bit of a

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.040 
inches by 25 inches so a little bit of a
strange<00:02:32.700> size<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.180> could<00:02:33.300> easily<00:02:33.450> scale<00:02:33.930> it

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
strange size you could easily scale it

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.390 
strange size you could easily scale it
down<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.440> actually<00:02:36.560> actually<00:02:37.560> baseline<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400

down I actually actually baseline on the
back<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.760> piece<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:38.970> recycled<00:02:39.600> foam<00:02:40.020> board

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670
