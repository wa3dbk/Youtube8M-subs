00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.230
 [Music] 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.270
 hi I'm a little bit that says I'm 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:18.870
 here to introduce you something I did this 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:22.170
 mobile is my mobile an android device 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.570
 and I'm not here to tell you about the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.630
 devices is for something that maybe 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.870
 many people do not know and that is quite 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.430
 well as you can see there is a drawing 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.810
 of a peak does not look very good because 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.630
 I'm talking to the camera but it's a 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.320
 application called mini wilder 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.510
 that's what I'm telling you for sure because 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.450
 tested many applications of minecraft 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.490
 for android the most similar to 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.980
 minecraft of truth but the most similar 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.630
 with enough difference 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.309
 so I wanted to make a video 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.260
 talking about it for those who do not 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.489
 know enrique station 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.809
 wilder min wilber I will put the expressions 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.900
 names and some link of the page 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.450
 official litigation is oy although all 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.030
 It looks very nice and I tell you it's a 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.700
 one euro payment application 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.950
 more or less although I think that at the beginning 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.820
 the application was free 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.470
 it's free is made of payment 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.470
 the facts under the promotion 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.480
 good but if we care to pay a euro 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.790
 for this wonder, I already tell you 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.050
 you see thousands does not look very good but it's that 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.580
 I have no other way to record than with my 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.110
 camera i'm trying to record in hd 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.500
 click on new world and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.060
 the house that I had made 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.010
 if it is not a thing of the other world but it is 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.229
 the most similar to normal minecraft like 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.800
 I'm saying it's just the most similar 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.780
 to the normal minecraft you see here you can go 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.720
 walking here you have access to 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.950
 objects more quickly here you have the 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.530
 Inventory 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.229
 even here we are going to limit explaining 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.320
 in an object by holding down the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.269
 you eliminate creating once but you put 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.590
 principal 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.260
 this is the latest version of boulder 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.910
 Well, the postmen we arrived at 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.010
 check 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.340
 wait, I missed the torch 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.340
 torches 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.349
 the torches the trunks and the mass of 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.840
 kraft eo and the lean publicity are what 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.020
 only I've been able to verify and how 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.569
 you see here I have a peak if I have the 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.849
 stone things 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.920
 the enemies are a bit unique not 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.380
 was talking friends out there be not 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.490
 I still have not been able to check it 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.450
 in the portions 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.610
 [Music] 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.110
 I'm going to kill him it's the first time he killed 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.290
 to an animal I think the first time 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.290
 I saw it 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.280
 you are enemies 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.080
 is that you are going to flip if the 6 people 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.440
 what they expect is a kind of version of 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.420
 khyber in mini wilder 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.420
 I was in love with controls 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.469
 It is high Lousy no green 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.469
 rabbit 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.520
 if it jumps in there and I think several of those 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.800
 floating dead 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.530
 Well, as you can see, it's pretty 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.870
 interesting of the game 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.330
 and what was around here is a world that 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.380
 nothing else you hit the application today 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.950
 I decide one euro includes bachelor 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.110
 is that in the end our fuck we do not 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.680
 20 euros separated by original manga as 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.940
 a damn euro for having a minecraft 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.120
 then something of the has nothing to do 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.790
 but 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.310
 very similar on your android is pretty 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.920
 fun sincerely but you can 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.490
 think here you see me here you know the 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.170
 normal wallets 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.600
 and nothing is an application to increase 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.920
 the mind has said without returning and of 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.920
 our garland of these 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.180
 well we have done a this one still this way 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.070
 that I'm going to use right now for the 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.080
 wood that says 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.950
 I could finish the video here but I was 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.950
 where to make a mini 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.430
 or a rabbit mir dies 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.039
 just with him right after here 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.370
 but no 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.630
 but good 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.630
 he has died for something 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.540
 it gives me to do nothing the only 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.150
 food that he found for that in 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.890
 carrots you depend just like you see 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.630
 and from what I've seen it will not be crap 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.480
 of food 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.040
 and it is not also I think that recently 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.730
 they were making a community of the world 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.730
 in Spanish 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.200
 like the question so he's very handsome 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.270
 it does not look very good on the camera like 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.270
 I said but the young 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.900
 and well before finishing this video I'm going to 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.270
 and tell the last thing the other 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.300
 the setting where the same as the Mexican 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.190
 more you can configure all this everything 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.120
 what you want for better performance in 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:38.000
 your mobile see how is a memo the 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.280
 sound the car exalted that he only had 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.020
 activated because I grew with a certainty a 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.370
 blog with high highs 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.650
 photographically in alpha channels at 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.270
 button but quite serve it because 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.680
 handle it is a bit complicated 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:55.250
 casey the short distance and then it's 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.500
 the multiplayer because if you have multiple 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.140
 [Music] 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.860
 titles but do not know right now how 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.440
 I'm studying a server 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.539
 I believe that 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.310
 and then with the wifi 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:15.349
 with the wifi already scanning that if someone 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.349
 have a server I think he knew 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.790
 [Music] 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.390
 if we hope we help them in boulder 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.360
 board 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:31.349
 but that is here and already just 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.960
 why not all man and do not believe 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:36.659
 do you believe you need to see me there death or 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.719
 Internet connection because I'm from 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:43.750

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:48.690
