00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.980
 hi to all and tsb today we get 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.020
 found for a brand new safe glitch 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.180
 I was online then what will 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.620
 do but have already bought this garage 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.390
 so I'm going to show you now 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.010
 on the screen so it will take 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.480
 this garage must be laughing 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.789
 lice de griche is a garage for two 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.490
 places kicker he listens to 27000 I 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.019
 believe well of memory so when 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.960
 will have to do is also have inventor 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.329
 not necessarily then so you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.259
 go into the turn so a 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.659
 Once inside the garage 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.940
 actually made it obligatory margin 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.860
 unfortunately only on ps3 so actually 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.840
 will need to plug your cable in for 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.790
 change the case and then 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.050
 you will go back to 2nd thorn o and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.310
 when your character started to 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.220
 sit down you're going to unplug the cable 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.330
 and here it's going to make you a little a little 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.310
 screen like what the controller and i telly 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.980
 plugged in and there you will see that your 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.800
 character will fall into the void 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.570
 so then you go away so 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.830
 the start screen and there you will see 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.220
 that you are going to be right in the middle of 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.570
 the map 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.920
 so what will have to be done is 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.780
 find a passerby in the street who has 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.730
 want to fight and so in fact soon 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.890
 that he will put you a right so or 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.020
 two in fact you're going out a 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.130
 phone call the mechanic is there when 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.689
 the mechanic will answer 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.850
 so you'll see that the god mode 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.520
 must be activated you will be 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.499
 completely invincible nothing do you 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.990
 will kill so slip really epic 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:20.399
 100% invincible and imagine that you 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.719
 do this guide when in a session 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.520
 there are players nobody will be able 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.689
 kill you I know that sometimes it's 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.799
 annoying you can not happily 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.499
 because everyone wants you 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.960
 kill lovemaking with this glitch it's over 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.340

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.179
 we can make carnage with you 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.130
 can do as soon as he is as soon as he is 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.990
 well here is not to abuse too much of this glitch 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.249
 but in any case to really start 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.770
 enjoy it before they are patched 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:45.060
 here I am I hope that this little game you 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.649
 will have pleased if that's the case as 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.509

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.370
