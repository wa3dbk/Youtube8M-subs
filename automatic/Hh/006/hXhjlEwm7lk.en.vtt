them I mean to ask you but it's like who
what<00:04:52.699> are<00:04:52.759> the<00:04:52.820> key<00:04:52.910> which<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:53.120> like<00:04:53.300> in<00:04:53.449> there

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
what are the key which is like in there

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.140 
what are the key which is like in there
so<00:04:53.660> they<00:04:53.780> can<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.930> similar<00:04:54.139> to<00:04:54.699> the<00:04:55.699> dance<00:04:55.910> craze

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
so they can a similar to the dance craze

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.260 
so they can a similar to the dance craze

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
an EMP drops an EMP on the map for a

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.430 
an EMP drops an EMP on the map for a
last<00:05:13.550> like<00:05:13.729> one<00:05:14.030> or<00:05:14.150> two<00:05:14.180> seconds<00:05:14.780> totally

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
last like one or two seconds totally

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
disables all the enemies suits so they

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.520 
disables all the enemies suits so they
can't<00:05:17.120> use<00:05:17.180> our<00:05:17.449> remote<00:05:17.750> our<00:05:17.960> stealth<00:05:18.289> and

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
can't use our remote our stealth and

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.020 
can't use our remote our stealth and
basically<00:05:19.099> this<00:05:19.250> means<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:19.580> can<00:05:19.610> pretty<00:05:19.940> much

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
basically this means you can pretty much

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.490 
basically this means you can pretty much
insta<00:05:20.510> kill<00:05:20.660> any<00:05:20.900> when<00:05:21.050> you<00:05:21.139> look<00:05:21.349> out<00:05:21.470> for

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
insta kill any when you look out for

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.820 
insta kill any when you look out for
about<00:05:21.830> two<00:05:22.039> seconds<00:05:22.460> and<00:05:23.500> which<00:05:24.500> is<00:05:24.650> really

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
about two seconds and which is really

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.200 
about two seconds and which is really
awesome<00:05:24.919> and<00:05:25.250> then<00:05:25.430> you<00:05:25.520> get<00:05:25.639> your<00:05:25.669> maximum

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
awesome and then you get your maximum

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.029 
awesome and then you get your maximum
nanosuit<00:05:26.660> which<00:05:26.810> overcharges<00:05:27.530> your<00:05:27.680> suit<00:05:27.919> at

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
nanosuit which overcharges your suit at

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
10 kills for about 15 seconds where

10 kills for about 15 seconds where
you're<00:05:30.470> pretty<00:05:30.710> much<00:05:30.740> invincible<00:05:31.250> for<00:05:31.699> 10

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
you're pretty much invincible for 10

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.270 
you're pretty much invincible for 10

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
the maps you can't customize your

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.770 
the maps you can't customize your
killstreaks<00:05:43.699> which<00:05:43.940> is<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.389> best<00:05:44.570> way<00:05:44.750> I

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
killstreaks which is the best way I

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.600 
killstreaks which is the best way I
think<00:05:44.930> I<00:05:45.440> think<00:05:45.590> it's<00:05:45.710> pretty<00:05:45.860> good<00:05:46.039> to<00:05:46.370> have

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
think I think it's pretty good to have

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.760 
think I think it's pretty good to have
pretty<00:05:47.330> well<00:05:47.389> designed<00:05:47.840> killstreaks<00:05:48.320> fair

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
pretty well designed killstreaks fair

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.680 
pretty well designed killstreaks fair

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
competitive play that happens a lot by

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.050 
competitive play that happens a lot by
the<00:06:51.110> end<00:06:51.319> of<00:06:51.379> crisis<00:06:51.800> to<00:06:51.949> a<00:06:52.189> low<00:06:52.520> service<00:06:52.729> band

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
the end of crisis to a low service band

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.719 
the end of crisis to a low service band
a<00:06:53.180> lot<00:06:53.270> of<00:06:53.419> stuff<00:06:53.659> and<00:06:54.289> which<00:06:55.280> isn't<00:06:55.520> the<00:06:55.580> best

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
a lot of stuff and which isn't the best

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.909 
a lot of stuff and which isn't the best
way<00:06:55.819> to<00:06:55.939> go<00:06:56.090> I<00:06:56.120> like<00:06:56.360> a<00:06:56.780> variation<00:06:57.439> and<00:06:57.560> my

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
way to go I like a variation and my

00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.860 
way to go I like a variation and my
competitive<00:06:58.490> matches<00:06:58.699> everyone<00:06:59.599> used<00:06:59.780> in

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
competitive matches everyone used in

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.089 
competitive matches everyone used in
sort<00:07:00.050> of<00:07:00.110> different<00:07:00.259> weapons<00:07:00.740> different

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:01.099 
sort of different weapons different

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:02.619 
sort of different weapons different
loadouts<00:07:01.430> playing<00:07:01.789> different<00:07:01.939> styles<00:07:02.449> I

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:02.629 
loadouts playing different styles I

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:04.029 
loadouts playing different styles I
think<00:07:03.050> that's<00:07:03.169> the<00:07:03.259> best<00:07:03.379> way<00:07:03.560> to<00:07:03.620> go<00:07:03.800> and<00:07:03.979> I

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 
think that's the best way to go and I

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.290 
think that's the best way to go and I
think<00:07:04.219> the<00:07:04.310> competitive<00:07:04.759> seniors<00:07:05.060> can<00:07:05.150> be<00:07:05.240> a

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
think the competitive seniors can be a

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.330 
think the competitive seniors can be a
real<00:07:05.479> challenge<00:07:05.509> with<00:07:06.379> these<00:07:06.560> random<00:07:07.039> alien

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
real challenge with these random alien

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.219 
real challenge with these random alien
weapon<00:07:07.669> spawns<00:07:07.879> and<00:07:08.240> you<00:07:08.960> can<00:07:09.110> actually

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:09.229 
weapon spawns and you can actually

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.740 
weapon spawns and you can actually
customize<00:07:09.590> weapons<00:07:10.340> well<00:07:10.550> your<00:07:10.699> end<00:07:10.879> game<00:07:11.150> so

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750 
customize weapons well your end game so

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.029 
customize weapons well your end game so
you<00:07:11.840> can<00:07:12.080> switch<00:07:12.349> up<00:07:12.530> your<00:07:12.560> place<00:07:12.860> they'll
